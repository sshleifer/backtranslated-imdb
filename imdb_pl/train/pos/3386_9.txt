Is this the future that awaits us? A crowded, merciless wilderness with hellish, unwanted existence? This film is reminiscent of a problem that still bothers us, doubly, since the film was released in 1973. Let's hope the world will not end up like that ... <br /> <br /> Soylent Green is a wild movie that I really enjoyed. He had nice characters, a semi-apocalyptic scenery, a fascinating and thought-provoking plot and the most terrible macho of a man: Charleton Heston. Richard Fleischer gave the film a very unpleasant, dirty look. You are almost choked by the stench of the city and its dirty inhabitants. <br /> <br /> The heroes are great. Charleton Heston, who became one of my favorite actors, IS Thorn. The man created this role of a bad but nice tough guy. I can definitely wear Thorn shoes. He sees that something is wrong, but everyone around him or does not listen (more like they pay to not listen) or they want him to die. Edward G. Robinson (in his last film R.I.P.) plays sympathetic old Sol, who has enough of this nasty place. Everyone else is great, especially Leigh Taylor-Young as Shirl, a piece of "furniture" that comes from the apartment in which he lives. <br /> <br /> The special effects are fantastic, even in 1973. The Soylent Green factory, futuristic apartments, and especially the "scoops" (bulldozers that get rid of people) were excellent. The dirty air outside looks nasty and very nasty. Empty city streets full of wicked and disgusting people are very disturbing. <br /> <br /> The last remark is the ending that even now shocked me. This is macabre, but if you think about it, it's a pretty good idea. <br /> <br /> The Bottom Line: <br /> <br /> A great science fiction movie from the '70s that makes you think and leave you feel very uncomfortable.
