I learned about the film "Holes", hearing from people that it is not typical Disney that both children and adults got into the story. People, let me tell you that I was not disappointed. "Holes" is based on the novel by Louis Sakhar and follows the adventure of Stanley Yelnats, a boy who is sent to a strange juvenile desert camp. He makes friends with a boy named Zero and together they embark on an adventure that changes their lives. It was a very interesting, unique, different and funny story. I did not know what to expect when I watched it. It was interesting to see how history merges like pieces of a puzzle. The boys who played juvenile offenders were very funny, and Jon Voight was just as funny as Sir Sir. Now that I've seen the movie, I have to read the book. Most recommended!
