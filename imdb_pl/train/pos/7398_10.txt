Xizao is a rare small movie. It is simple and undemanding, and at the same time so satisfying in terms of emotions and joy. The story is simple and the subject of old and new clashes is greatly introduced in the first scenes. This theme is the essence of the film, but it would be flat, if not for the great characters and actors playing them. <br /> <br /> The aging patriarch, master Liu, is a relic of Chinese days before the expansion. He runs a bathhouse in the old quarter. Each scene set in a bathhouse is for us a source of jealousy, stressed, unhappy people. Even hardened cynics can not find any faults in this wonderful environment. <br /> <br /> The mentally handicapped son Liu, Er Ming, is the second truly powerful character in the film, combined with his contemporary brother. The interactions between these three people and the various guests in the bathhouse are incredibly detailed and noticeable, and some of the scenes contain so much emotion that they are almost invisible in the movies. <br /> <br /> Thanks to his regime - a critical message, this film was not only censored, but also had a disproportionately small range. It may be a coincidence, but when the movie of this caliber is practically impossible to find, even on the Internet (!), You can not help suspicious yourself. <br /> <br /> So help free speech and movie world, buy, rent, copy this great movie, and if you happen to own a DVD, if there is even one, then share!
