I saw "An American in Paris" on the first issue when I was still in school and I fell in love with him right away. I returned to see him again the next day and lost count of the number of times I saw him, both in the cinema and on television. He fantastically uses some of the best songs and songs of the greatest popular composer of the 20th century (George Gershwin) and presents the greatest male dancers (Gene Kelly) and female dancers (Leslie Caron) in the history of Hollywood. Supporting cast of Oscar Levant (as bizarre as ever), Georges Guetary (why did not he make more films?) And Nina Foch (brilliant in unpleasant role) are at the top of their form. The closing ballet, superbly choreographed for the title music, excellently uses the sights and sounds of Paris and the images of Impressionists and post-Impressionists. All of Gershwin's songs are beautifully staged, but the most memorable are "It's Very Clear" (Caron and Kelly on the Seine) and "I Got Rhythm" (children from Paris joining Gene Kelly in "Une Chanson Americaine"). If you love Paris, see this movie. If you've never been to Paris in your life, see this. But see it!
