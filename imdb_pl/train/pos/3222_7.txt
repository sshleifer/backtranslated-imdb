The first two sequences of this film create two conflicts: thethematic conflict between the soldier Todd and his suppressed humanity, and the physical conflict between Todd and his bio-engineering substitute. Both sequences are quite thrilling in different ways. <br /> <br /> The folk script breaks down a little, solving the first of these arches in the middle of the movie, which means that the other half is not much more than just a regular action. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the recognition for the creators for creating a piece of genre action with the heart, or even a bit of a soul, and especially Kurt Russell, who sends very little. <br /> <br /> It's not a great movie, but it's worth seeing.
