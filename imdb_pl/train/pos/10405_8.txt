This movie was one of my favorites in my childhood and I have to say that unlike other films I liked at the time, Baghdad Thief kept its quality when I was growing up. It's not just a movie that kids use, but they can also be seen by adults. The only disadvantage is that you can not see past "bad" effects (compared to today's effects), as you could when you were a child. I did not remember anything about these effects, of course about ten years have passed since I saw the movie when I was about eleven. Who then sees the effects? You only look for good stories and entertainment, and that's what the movie provides. In my opinion, this movie is one of the first great adventure movies of the twentieth century. It comes to mind that Indiana Jones's films are quite similar to this movie. There is a comedy, romance and adventure in one that creates a wonderful mix that will capture you from the beginning to the end, and although the movie is old and the music and style of the movies is clearly not modern, it can not be dusty and old. All this is mainly due to great history, good direction and good performances. In this section, Sabu (as Abu) and Conrad Veidt (as Jaffar) stand out, delivering comedic and cooling elements of the film in the majority. Great movie and although "oldie", definitely "goldie". I hope someone has the brain and courage to spend the day on DVD. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
