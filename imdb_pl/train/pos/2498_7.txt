I picked it up in the Danger After Dark set and watched it only because of my interest in the performances of Hyde and Gackt. I was expecting a horror horror movie, which was a great gore-fest and very bad dialogue. This is exactly what it would be if it were created in America. Instead, I was intrigued by the good character development and the way in which Sho (Gackt) develops through the film as a person. The acting skills of both stars were surprisingly good, considering that they are not professional actors, and the director did a great job with all this, setting it in the future without flying cars and holographic billboards. By the way, Taro Yamamoto's performance was very surprising. The only other movie in which I saw him is Battle Royale, where Shogo Kawada plays, and in this film seems to be the exact opposite of Shogo. Toshi is smart, lively and hyper, serving as a kind of comic relief with his antics. Shogo was a great tough guy on the island, who killed without thinking about anything. So watch out for its performance, if you know Battle Royale, you will be very surprised. <br /> <br /> But do not be fooled by the summary in the back of the box, because this is not really a vampire movie. It's just a vampire movie. This character Hyde is a vampire, it's almost a fact of the background with what really happens in the foreground, and you'll like the last scene. It's really a moving picture at some moments, the photography is really well done. It's definitely something to pick up the next time you're in Blockbuster.
