The penultimate collaboration of director Anthony Mann and star James Stewart (except for a few days in which Mann worked on the Night Passage before parting with the star in adverse circumstances), The Far Country contradicts his main view, offering another portrait of a embittered man reluctant to his own redemption, fighting with him at every step. This time he is a cattle breeder whose reaction to work problems - throwing challenges with embarrassing cowboys at the end of the trail - causes his cattle to be confiscated by wayward judge John McIntire from Roy Bean's law and order school. Stealing them and taking them across the Canadian border, he soon becomes reluctant to be dragged into a growing conflict between seekers and a judge who cheats or kills them from his claims ... <br /> <br /> Although it is not a big surprise, which way Stewart turns off at the end, he is a surprisingly heartless criminal on the way, even using his desire to be alone to justify not warning the group of seekers of an approaching avalanche when he has a chance, because this is not his problem. Most of the movie is really just the width of the hair between him and McIntire, something that the judge recognizes instantly, relishing the company of a related spirit, even when he's genially planning to lynch it. In many respects the burghers who have faith in him probably also recognize it - despite their appeal to his dead and buried better nature, there is an unspoken acknowledgment that the only person who can oppose the judge is someone almost as bad as he is. <br /> <br /> As usual in Mann is the unique use of high places in the country, although the final game takes place on flat terrain, and the movie is almost perfectly popped with strong support from Walter Brennan, Harry Morgan and Ruth Roman (though young romantic interest Corinne Calvert tends to be annoying). Unfortunately, the great Canadian Rockies cinematography has few advantages due to the clearly average DVD transfer, with the addition of just a movie trailer.
