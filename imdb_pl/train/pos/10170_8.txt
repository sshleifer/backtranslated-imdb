Unlike the reviews from the second review, this movie was really surprisingly good! I reluctantly went to see this and expected that I would be bored with cliches, obvious jokes and abuse, all of which were promised by the trailer. <br /> <br /> However, after 5 minutes I really laughed acting. The only gag of Over Her Dead Body's "toilet humor" manages to create realistically funny scenarios and, without too much spoiling, some moments with animals are fun. <br /> <br /> The basic ingredients of a good movie are all there; scriptwriter, director and actors, and compared several other recent attempts at romantic comedy, this film is high. <br /> <br /> Sure, you will not learn anything or spiritually, but if you go with an open mind you are certainly having fun!
