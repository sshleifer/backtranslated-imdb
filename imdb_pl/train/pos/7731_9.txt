<br /> <br /> "After dark my sweet" is a strange mix of sensuality and dullness. The film is slow, very slow, but it requires a rhythm to tell a story about murder and passion. Jason Patric has never been so sexy and powerful (the man gives a real performance), and Rachel Ward is very sexy. <br /> <br /> Sexual tension, pshykological heat, steps of the past ... flashback scenes, Patric's bizarre character, everything becomes a sexy secret. I recommend this one reason, it is a more sexy boring movie I have ever seen. Check the scene of creating love, it is especially sexy.
