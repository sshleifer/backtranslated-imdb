I have always considered murder in Mesopotamia one of Poirot's better books because it is very frightening and has an ingenious ending. There is no doubt that the TV adaptation is visually striking, with beautiful photography and a very disturbing musical result. As always, David Suchet is immaculate as Hercule Poirot, the comedy's highlight is the Poirot battle with a mosquito in the middle of the night, and Hugh Fraser is good as a rather naive captain Hastings. The rest of the cast turns into decent performances, but be careful not to overshadow the two tracks, which is a threat to some of Christie's adaptations. Part of the episode was quite scary, a combination of an episode as tragic as Five Little Pigs, an episode that enjoyed me much more than this one. What made her particularly frightening put the music aside as Louise Leidner saw the ghostly face through the window. She was quite faithful about the adaptation, but I would say that there were three things I did not like. The main problem was stimulation, it is rather slow and there are some scenes where little is happening. I did not like the fact that they made Joseph Mercado a killer. In the book, I see him as quite nervous, but the intervention of the idea of ​​making him a murderer and insufficiently developed made him a less attractive character, although I am glad that they did not miss his addiction to drugs. (I also noticed that the writers have overlooked the fact that Mrs. Mercado falls into hysterics in the book when she believes she is another victim of the murderer.) Another thing that was not so impressive was that I felt that it could have been more effective if the adaptation was from Amy Leatheran's point of view, as in the book, Amy seemed less sensitive to adaptation. In general, despite some misunderstandings on behalf of writers, I liked murder in Mesopotamia. 7/10 Bethany Cox.
