The pure genius of Orson Welles makes him one of the greatest films. Welles is involved in a murder plot that can be assumed as a fallen guy to whom he refers with the sarcastic commentary "the great mannequin I am." The plot is so complicated that I still do not know if the victim knew that his life would soon be lost. The scene of the shooting in the carnival hall of mirrors is one of the most amazing in history. This scene is worth the admission price. This is the only time Rita Hayworth ever played a complicated but credible character. Nobody but Welles would have the courage to cut her hair and dye her with blond hair. No one should miss this photo.
