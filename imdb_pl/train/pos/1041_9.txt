Watch On The Rhine began with the art of Lillian Hellman on Broadway, which wrote the movie and saw it on Broadway while the Soviet Union was still connected to Nazi Germany through this infamous non-aggression pact signed in August 1939. the fact that Hellman was only an echo of the communist party line did not change until several months later. Lillian was actually months before her time in this job. <br /> <br /> The art of Watch On The Rhine lasted from April 1941 to February 1942, where 378 appearances and five players came from Broadway to repeat their roles Frank Wilson as a butler, Eric Roberts as the youngest son, Lucile Watson as a family and above all the villain George Coulouris and Paul Lukas. <br /> <br /> Lukas won a hat award in 1943, winning the Oscar, Golden Globe, and New York Film Critics for Best Actor. Probably if there were Tony rewards, he would also win it. Oscar is even more unusual considering who he was dealing with, Humphrey Bogart for Casablanca, Gary Cooper in For Whom The Bell Tolls, Mickey Rooney in The Human Comedy and Walter Pidgeon for Madame Curie. Each of his competitors was a bigger name for the cinema than he. Lukas' nomination is usually what the Academy gives to complete the fields. <br /> <br /> Jack Warner knew that this is why the Christians of Mady did not repeat their part on Broadway, and the role of Lukas' wife was handed over to Bette Davis. Davis took this role not because it was a particularly impressive role for her, but because she believed in this image and simply wanted to be associated with it. This is the same reason why The Man Who Came To Dinner did a much lighter game than this one. <br /> <br /> Davis is the daughter of an American Supreme Court Justice who married a German citizen in Weimar's days. After many years of being vagrants on the European continent, Davis Lukas and their three children are coming to America, which has not yet entered the European war. They are welcomed by Lucile Watson, who is naturally delighted to meet her grandchildren. <br /> <br /> The fly in this ointment are other home guests, a friend of Davis from ancient times Geraldine Fitzgerald and her husband, is also from Europe, a Romanian diplomat and aristocrat George Coulouris. Coulouris is a wastrel and spreader, and he feels the possibility of double inflicting when he suspects the antifascist origin of Lukas. <br /> <br /> His suspicions are quite correct, that's why the family was the tramps they used to be. Lukas fought in Spain on the Republicans side and was injured there. Since then, his health is not the same. His family loyally supports him in every decision he makes. These decisions apply to all other cast members. <br /> <br /> Adding a bit more to the Broadway game, including cute fascist creatures, was Dashiell Hammett, who was a significant different Lillian Hellman. The Coulouris playing cards at the German embassy were the work of Hammett with such repulsive types as Henry Daniell, Kurt Katch, Clyde Fillmore, Erwin Kalser and Rudolph Anders. <br /> <br /> Coulouris is really one of the wicked characters ever to be seen on the screen as the Runmanian account is missing. He was a metaphor for his own country, who enthusiastically embraced the Nazis and then also rejected them, without losing the pace of Stalingrad. <br /> <br /> Lucile Watson was in the best supporting actress in 1943, but lost to Katina Paxinou in For Whom The Bell Tolls. Dashiell Hammett was nominated for the best adaptation scenario, and the film itself was lost to the best image of this other anti-fascist classic, Casablanca. <br /> <br /> Although this element is firmly embedded in these specific times, Watch On The Rhine still contains a harsh anti-fascist message that repeats itself infinitely.
