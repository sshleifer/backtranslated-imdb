I found this episode as one of the funniest ones I've seen in a long time. The creators of the southern park have made the best deception in the Romero movie I've ever seen. They really touched Romero's basic social commentary, which he did with each of his films. I would like to know what was George Romero's opinion about this episode. I'm sure it was purely positive! Keeping your true vision of epic zombies fully intact! Most fakes deal with pure gore, not forcing the viewer to think about how Romero tries to do with his films. I think that if a zombie outbreak happens, we can really worry about our property values ​​before our lives, as shown in this episode!
