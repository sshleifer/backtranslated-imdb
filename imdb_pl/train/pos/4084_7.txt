I suppose it's supposed to be a kind of "Beauty and the Beast" modification or upgrade, but I can not say that I've ever watched a movie that began with a few minutes of graphic sex of horses. Wow. In any case, it looks like a young woman and she ... no? I went to this castle in France, where the woman is supposed to marry the son of the castle owner, who cares for the horses to fall down. It seems there are legends in this area of ​​the beast, which was rather noisy, as you can say, with women, or at least in particular. There are all kinds of references in this regard, but each time a young bride, who soon begins to blush, gets strange little hands, the father of the groom takes her out of her eyes. In any case, the future young lady goes to sleep, while the family is waiting for the cardinal, who will show up at the wedding (probably a member of the family) and dreams of the beast in the forest that has its way with her. The effects of this leave are somewhat desirable, and any attempt to eroticism (not that I know a lot about it) is somewhat ridiculous, especially when some highlighted additions appear more or less as realistically as bed sheets or baseball bats. It has a rather strange and violent, and at the same time twisted ending, with not very good hints or too extensive, but it was something like fit and definitely not what I expected. I do not know, it is difficult to overcome, but it has its moments and is definitely strange. 7 out of 10.
