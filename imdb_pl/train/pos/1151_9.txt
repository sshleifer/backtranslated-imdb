"Soapdish" is one of the best, but least well-remembered comedies of the 90s. The film revolves around various dramas outside the camera that appear behind the scenes of the cheaper opera Daytime Soap Opera. The first of the impressive advantages of the film is the fantastic cast of the list A. "Soapdish" presents some of the greatest actors and actresses from that era. <br /> <br /> The movie is superbly run by Sally Field, as a neurotic actress who is aging Celeste Talbert (he's famously throwing anger when he puts on a costume) that makes him look like "Gloria F * CKING Swanson!"). Her supporting cast sounds like someone from the movies of the 90's! Whoopi Goldberg, Robert Downey Jr., Teri Hatcher, Kevin Kline and Kathy Najimy are raising the level of the movie very much. Goldberg is predictably perfect, while Downey Jr. performances. and Hatchera point to the comedic perfection that they will later achieve. <br /> <br /> When it comes to writing, the movie is unique. The script is really modern, which turns into a wonderfully bizarre several times. There are also several visual gags that are much ahead of their time. In a sense, the movie reminds Mel Brooks at its best and often reminds the reviewer of "High Anxiety" (1977). A large part of the film's humor depends on the fact that it is often virulent, but quite accurate, it presents daytime television and neurotic and pretentious actors. For example, an extroverted casting session with the participation of the exploitative leadership, played by Carrie Fisher, is both fun and honest. <br /> <br /> "Soapdish" is for me one of the best Hollywood comedies produced in the 90s. It's an excellent script, and the cast of class A makes it necessary to see it. It's hard not to love this movie after you laugh for 90 minutes.
