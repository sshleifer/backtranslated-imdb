I watched this movie on Friday, April 7. I did not see the last scene (because I also talked to my sister-in-law). Can someone tell me what happened to her? I watched her husband hear that someone was talking to his wife in the bedroom, and then he opened the door, he's dead. <br /> <br /> What happened to her? Has she killed herself? How could she organize everything like phone calls, meanwhile she is at home when her husband talked to this strange admirer? Everyone can explain it to me. I am so curious !! (in the end I read that she suffered from the personality of Multiply Disorder Personality). <br /> <br /> Earlier.
