Best of the seven Sam Fuller movies I've seen (including Park Row, Run of the Arrow, Verboten !, Shock Corridor, The Naked Kiss, The Big Red One and this movie), Pickup on South Street counts as one of the best movie noirs . He represents Fuller in his most controlled situation. I like it, of course, when it's out of control, but almost everything in the Pickup is perfect. The film is absolutely beautiful. Richard Widmark appears as a pickpocket who steals a microfilm that was supposed to hit communist spies. Jean Peters plays a woman who was carrying a movie for her boyfriend, played by Richard Kiley. Peters is forced to find Widmark and recover him. He finds him through the dove stool played by Thelma Ritter. Widmark and Peters attract each other, which changes Peters' loyalty (and the fact that he learns that he works for communists, cold war matters are really interesting). The love story is made a little fast and not entirely reliable, but it is not so bad that it harms the film (contrary to the previous Fuller movie, Park Row). Richard Widmark is great. It must be one of his best roles, but I'm not so familiar with his career that I can say that for sure. Thelma Ritter gives you the most memorable performance. Her role gives the film unexpected emotional resonance, and her final scene in this film is as moving as any other in the cinema. I will never forget it. 10/10
