Let's face it: the last season (# 8) was one of the worst seasons at every concert I've ever had (mostly, I've never found dry spells that would survive the whole season). But if you evaluate this program in the last season, of course it will be worse. This is a completely unfair assessment - because "This" 70s Show "was a great and fun series about a bygone era and how the people who lived there were not so different from us today. <br /> <br /> It's ok ... ignoring season 8. <br /> <br /> Topher Grace plays Eric Forman, a horny teenager maniac with an eternal love for Donna (Laura Prepon), a feminist from the neighborhood. Playing their friends, Danny Masterson (Hyde), Mila Kunis (Jackie), Wilmer Valderram (Fez), and even Ashton Kutcher (Kelso) give fantastic performances in (almost) every episode. The best of them is probably Fez, a student of foreign exchange, who is as mentally dissolute as possible. What country is it from? Try to figure it out! For another dimension of entertainment, Debra Jo Rupp and Kurtwood Smith are phenomenal as Eric's parents. Rupp, as Kitty, is both powerful and sweet, just like Mrs. Brady meets Marie Barone, while Red Smith exists mainly to scare everyone. Don Stark and Tanya Roberts play very well against each other as Donna's parents, chauvinistic but friendly Bob and air-controlled Midge. Tommy Chong has occasional appearances as Leo, a stoner who acts as a father figure for Hyde. <br /> <br /> In addition to anachronistic errors that appear quite often and lessons that sometimes come to the surface (and in this regrettable ending season) "" 70's "is a great spectacle with an amazing magazine, point direction and pleasant a pulsating atmosphere in each episode. They are all fine.
