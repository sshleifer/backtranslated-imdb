It's a movie that will make you want to see it again. I especially liked how it ended. I have not seen the end, but when the laws have not been blown out the first time, you can suspect that he will come back again. <br /> <br /> The story is addictive and could be more psychological, but I understand the story needed to capture the viewer, and the action was necessary for that. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that Michael Jr. he can be as unmoved as his younger brother and mother, as if blown away. But I can appreciate that playing on the stage could not really pay attention to us because it had a bigger story to tell. <br /> <br /> Some complained about Hank as a gangster. I believe that it is not justified. If his character was more difficult, he would not care if his son pulled the trigger or not. <br /> <br /> Eight stars for this. Although it was released in 2002, I saw it for the first time on DVD yesterday.
