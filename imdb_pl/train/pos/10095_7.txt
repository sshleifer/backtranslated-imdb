My parents took me to this movie when I was nine. I never forgot it. I've never seen anything as beautiful as Elizabeth Taylor before. (She was twenty-two when she did Elephant Walk.) Remember that I'm nine years old, so the feelings are not sexual, I just did not see anything else on the screen. I just wanted to sit at her feet like a puppy and look at her. She began to show her age (she is almost seventy-four years old), but I still believe she is one of the most beautiful and breathtaking women that have ever lived. <br /> <br /> I've seen the movie several times since then it's a juicy melodrama. What saves him is, of course, the beauty of Miss Taylor, the magnificent scenery, the impressive panic of the elephant and the well thought out point about human arrogance in the face of nature. <br /> <br /> In total, well - big hours of watching a movie channel or a rented movie.
