What makes this movie so frightening is the way it portrays Andre and Calvin as (relatively) normal guys. Certainly they are not people who want to become professional filmmakers, because they hang around in front of the camera, forget about scripts, etc. They make video only as a diary to show "survivors" how normal their lives are. Their parents think that guys are shooting a video from their family home. Investigating other children's attacks on their schools, Andre and Calvin learn what not to do, and inform (usually stupidly, "The Old House") about any potential "Andres and Calvins" who can watch this movie, how to make bombs, get a gun and do not get caught before Zero Day (attack day).
