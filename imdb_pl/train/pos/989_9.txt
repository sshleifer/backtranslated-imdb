Both my friend and I thought that this movie was well done. We were expecting a light comedy, but we got a full action movie with comic thrusts. We both thought that this movie may not have worked so well at the box office, because the announcements led us to believe that it is a comedy. I was impressed by supporting actors and of course Dave Morse always performs a great acting job. Most of the cast supporting the veterans who were not the first players and were solid. We both felt that writing and directing were first-rate and we commented on each other about the purchase of this film. If you do not buy, rent it for a good time.
