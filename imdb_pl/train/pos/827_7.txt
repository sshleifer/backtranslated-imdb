Perspective is a good thing. Since the release of "Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace", claims and counterarguments about how episodes II and III will lead to the uprising, they have distracted attention from the "original" Star Wars movies, making them part of a coherent whole instead of segregating older ones and new movies for a separate trilogy. What new films have done allows a fresh look at older films. This new perspective allows us to appreciate what was often considered the weakest of the original trilogy: "Return of the Jedi". ROTJ, often ridiculed for being too "sweet", is in a way as strong as the original and only slightly less impressive than the almost perfect "The Empire Strikes Back". Indeed, the "sweet" ROTJ element, namely Ewoks, remains a weak link in the whole series. Did George Lucas place fur dwarfs in the film solely for merchandising? Only he can answer this question. <br /> <br /> Apart from this charming factor, the movie is a great full circle and evolution of the saga. Following the "The Empire Strikes Back" conclusion, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) follows his friends in the Rebel Alliance on Tatooine, his native planet, to save Han Solo (Harrison Ford), a cosmic pirate who changed the hero of the Rebellion, which was captured by Jabba the Hutt for outstanding debts. <br /> <br /> Skywalker is a changed man since Ben 'Obi Wan' Alec Guinness left Tatooine to fight the empire of evil. His origin, covered in black, discovered by Luke, made him confused and torn. His psychological makeup is not as strong as his appearance would suggest. While he may strive to always help his rebels, he wants another chance to face the evil Darth Vader again, in spite of his uncertainty about whether he will destroy him, or finally turn to the Dark Side and join Vader alongside the Emperor. br /> <br /> The early scenes at Tatooine make an impression, from Jabba's lair, to his floating palace and the "all-powerful Sarlac" - a resin that lives in the sand. Lucas's CGI enhancements in the 1997 movie have worsened Sarlac's overall effect, making him look fake and exaggerated. <br /> <br /> The battle scene on Tatooine is outstanding and is one of the most memorable saga. Luke almost alone, Anihiliates Jabba and his buddies, proving his prowess as a Jedi is now almost complete. <br /> <br /> When Luke returns to the Degobah system to visit sick Yoda again, the viewer is disappointed. Yoda's obvious lack of scruples. Undoubtedly the star of "The Empire Strikes Back", Yoda is almost erased from history, because the progress of Luke's destiny takes place on the screen. <br /> <br /> ROTJ is really Luke's movie, maybe even more than the original one. His journey carries the film when he comes close to confronting Darth Vader and his fate. Other forms of rebels certainly work in its shadow. The romance between Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Solo does not exist, unlike the "Empire." In fact, only Leia's character is developed in ROTJ, Solo's character seems to disappear when aspects of his personality become too well known in the first two films. <br /> <br /> Their roles are condemned to cooperate with the Rebels to destroy the entire new Death Star that is coming to an end. This time, the emperor himself supervises the last stages of construction. The Empire intends to crush the Rebellion once and for all, while the Emperor himself plans to bring the powerful Skywalker to his side to work with Darth Vader. The Emperor is another kind of evil for this film, less cunning than the governor Tarkin (Peter Cushing) from "Star Wars", deeper psychologically dark than anything else. Emperor, superbly played by Ian McDiarmid, is just one of those characters you like to hate. <br /> <br /> All other actors are well rooted in their roles. Hamill surprises when the more wise Luke, making the progress of his character from a grumpy teenager, an impatient student to an enlightened warrior, is one of the few true achievements of the characters in this series. Ford's role is weak, because all his charm and charisma were released in the first two films - he was the TRUE star of the first film. Leia Fisher is more helpful, at least until the end of the movie, in which she learns about things she has never been sure about ... Add to favorites such as Alec Guiness as Kenobi, Yoda and nice Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2D2 and series it is more like a family than a cast. <br /> <br /> Despite the careful battle for the forest with Ewoks and Empire, it ends well and includes a tripartite sequence of battles: on Endor, in space and on Death Star, each with very impressive special effects. Music, as always, is brilliant and perfectly reflects the mood in every case. Like "Blue Danube" it worked perfectly for "2001: A Space Odyssey", the score of John Williams is as much part of the folklore of Star Wars as light sabers and strength. <br /> <br /> Lucas left the ending open to interpretation, which means there could have been more episodes. Actually, science fiction fans have created their own versions of episodes VII, VIII and IX in their heads. ROTJ works when it has a chance, and furry cute animals aside is a good finish of the series. <br /> <br /> When all six episodes can be watched together, this saga can be the best in history. Is this already? The addition of the episode I changed the landscape of the series. Therefore, the "Return of the Jedi" can now be viewed in a different light and receive a completely new recognition almost 20 years after its release.
