Mamet has written a lot about The House of Games; most of them are good. I decided to visit the film again to see how it would last after 17 years and was surprised by how much I enjoyed watching it. The success and durability of the film probably has much in common with the two main components that are always fun on the film; good history and good deception. Mamet manages to bring his characteristic mood and obvious histrionics to the film, while at the same time trying to get us, the audience and the sign. Then he explains the art of konning just to do it again, etc., all the while building the story. "The House of Games", now a freebie on the cable, is worth checking the first timers and a good repetition for Mamet fans. (B +)
