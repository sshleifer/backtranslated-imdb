the most amazing combination of love and psyche of two young people. presented in the most sophisticated way and definitely affecting your heart. a rare combination in which the sequel outperforms the prequel in both story telling and the intensity of emotions. the film confirms your faith in love and separation pain. the joy of watching a loved one is unmatched and everything can be sacrificed. Ethan and Julie have thoughtful, eternal characters with such simplicity that gives the film pure joy and love of watching. The film must see all people who believe in true love. by far the most romantic (at least one of them) movie of all time.
