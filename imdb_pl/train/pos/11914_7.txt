You know, this movie is not so great, but, I mean, come on, it's about angels helping the baseball team. I think that the plot is fun anyway, that kid's dad says he'll take him back if the angels win the pennant (because he knows he does not). all the time (by Angel Christopher Lloyd, RIP) And finally his dad does not take him back and drives the motorcycle straight into the face of the children. it's funny, until Danny Glover accepts him and is not his friend. <br /> <br /> I think the advantage is that the old lady stays alone to die with her stitches and stories. However, the real winner is God. Because later he got a job as a writer for numerous shows of antics. <br /> <br /> As a film for children, he gets 7. As a film about the secrets of the blind, stupid faith and nature of the "god", he gets 10.
