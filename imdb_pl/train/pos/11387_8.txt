An American in Paris is a great musical about an American painter living in Paris with inspiration. He meets a rich woman who admires his paintings on the street and believes that he can make his work even more popular for the public, eg in a museum. Nick Kelly's Golden Globe as artist Jerry Mulligan is perfect for both singing and dancing. He also meets with the main girlfriend Lise Bouvier (Leslie Caron), who is engaged to his best friend. He can not help his feelings for this girl, even after he finds out who she is engaged to. Filled with a nice romance, great song and dance, this is a very good music movie. It can be a bit of a drag with its dance sequence of dreams, ie American in Paris ballet, but it is a good happy ending. He won Oscars for the best artistic director - stage designer, best photos, best costume, best music, music score, best screenplay, script and screenplay and best film, and was nominated for the best director for Vincente Minnelli and the best film edition, he was nominated for BAFTA awards for the best film from any source, also received a Golden Globe for the best film - musical / comedy, as well as nomination for directing for Vincente Millenni (Liza's father). Gene Kelly was number 66 in The 100 Movie Stars, and he was number 15 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, "I Got Rhythm" was number 32 on 100 Years, 100 Songs, the movie was number 9 on 100 Years of Musicals, he was number 39 for 100 years, 100 passions, he was number 68 for 100 Years, 100 Movies, and he was number 58 for 100 Greatest Musicals. Very good!
