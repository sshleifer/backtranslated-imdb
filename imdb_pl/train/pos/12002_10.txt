Despite reading the "introductory comments" from someone who did not like the movie interestingly - (WHY IS THE ONLY NEGATIVE COMMENTARY ARE THE FIRST FIRST IN THE LEAF?) It was very nice to see that practically everyone liked it! Of course, the Church wanted to emphasize certain points and present the prophet Joseph Smith in a positive way - this is the whole idea. In fact, these points were extremely effective. We already know that Joseph Smith was a man ... but despite all the terrifying negative tests stirred up by his opponent, he showed how he was able to do extraordinary, God-given work. I recommend it to everyone!
