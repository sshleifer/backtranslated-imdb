Such a masterpiece as the first of the two Snowy River movies, the sequel to The Man From the Snowy River is all that should be a continuation. Do not tread on the fingers of his predecessor, preferring to leave the legend, which was the first live movie in exceptional immortality. <br /> <br /> The Man From Snowy River II is based on the return of Jim Craig to the country of the Snowy River after a three-year absence. The film subtly tells the story of changes in the nineteenth century, Australian history, legends and horses. The story shows a bit of Hollywood in lighter shades, an aspect that was absolutely absent in the first film, yet unambiguously combined with a clear sense of Australian patriotism. The plot is much more vivid than the first movie and much more impressive, with particular aspects of the previous part of the film, however The Man From Snowy River II has all the essential features of the first film; sensational beauty cinematography, a stunning focus of the Australian country, the second most impressive movie about horses ever made, and the fantastic and deeply moving soundtrack of Bruce Rowland, which is the first in every respect. Geoff Burrowes did a great job in this film and deserves recognition, especially regarding the quality of the Australian film industry. The main cast, from Tom Burlinson to Sigrid Thornton and the well-substituted Brian Dennehy, carries their parts with the same passion and distinction as the first film. When it comes to sequels, The Man From Snowy River II is a masterpiece; deeply moving and inspiring experience once again.
