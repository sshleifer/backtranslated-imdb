I watch it on the Star World network abroad, which is buying the American and Canadian series, which lasts one or two seasons, like The Jane Show. I thought about how many women's comedies show how I really can see with my own eyes, Is Lucy, Bewitched, I Dream Of Jeanie (the one with Barbara Feldman), and then my mind becomes empty, I can not think about others, all women play supporting roles, not leading ones. So for me The Jane Show is in quite good company. One thing I just thought about. I have seen a few things done in Canada and I never remember to be filmed in an ordinary TV series that shows SNOW! Everything takes place at the peak of summer, LOL! I admit that this is a great place to live in a wise summer climate, but you THINK that in the winter they will show a bit of Canada, because it is also part of the lifestyle. I mean, SCTV, Just For Laughs comes to mind as two comedy movies that lasted a long time in Canada and very little or no snow, although they both take lots of pictures in the open air. Digger, but I laugh with Jane and her obviously liberal ways of accusing her neighbor of racism, and I like the bald guy and his madness. office comedy with a female guide. It is by no means the best comedy, but for a guy who says he can see it himself, he says something. If I was with my wife, she could really enjoy her because it's about sex in the office and stuff like that, so it can be a good light comedy for couples to watch. 7 out of 10.
