I will not disclose anything, describing the conspiracy of this film, other than to say that it starts with the return of a young blind woman to Israel, whose closest friend and companion has just committed suicide. It unfolds like a crime story when a blind woman tries to understand why her friend ended her life. In the course of investigating and collecting information, it inevitably leads to a catastrophic conclusion. The film is well prepared, and acting, especially Talia Sharon as Ya'ara, a blind woman, is excellent. The Israeli film has reached the age of majority and is now fully competitive in relation to other foreign films, although few have found a large audience in the USA.
