This film rediscovers the term "Spring Breakumentary". Hans, a fat member of the group, shows his talents like these generations, Chris Farley. Johnny Kansas, "King of the $ 1 bet", shows that he is no longer in Kansas, consistently raising the stakes. Kyle's laughter is really infectious and offers some sweets for ladies (just like Matt). The dwarves, though they have their moments, do not give justice to the Mexican hat dance it deserves. And finally, we have our hero, Ed. It gives hope to all who are wrong, stumble, damned, pale, who are still looking for someone special. And this hope is a small place called Cabo San Lucas. While this blockbuster has overlooked theaters, it is a mandatory rent, because we can all refer to one of these spring versions.
