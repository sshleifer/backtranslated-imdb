And Thief in the Night must be the best of all end-time thrillers. I have no idea what people are complaining about, what people are complaining about when they say that these movies have scare them to receive God. They only needed excuses and blamed the Thief at night. Do not listen! These films not only talk about one of many possibilities of oppression, but they are also pleasant to watch in their simplicity. In fact, they are low-budget and it is a bit obvious, but not so obvious after the first look. I had no idea because I really assumed that many movies like those from the '70s contained low budgets all the time. <br /> <br /> The thief in the night tells the story of young and cynical Patty Myers, who lives for what is coming, until her husband and almost all her friends disappear in the prophetic delight that everyone has warned her about. Initially, the movie is not based on it until it is delighted. What he leads to shows that all around her become Christians and believe in Christ, which usually happens with many people. Everyone around them who they once knew and loved will disappear forever, and the one who stays is the one who blames everyone but himself. No one can blame you because they are always right. <br /> <br /> Like the ones who complain about the movie. These people must be adult adults. I'm thirteen and you do not see me groaning, especially since I was exactly like Patty before I took Christ back to my heart again. For those who have not seen it, if you want a little bit of everything that has been thrown into the Christian movie, instead of stereotypically all others, it's bad movies than you'll enjoy A Thief In The Night. Do not knock before you try it. Something new is always good. Trust your instincts.
