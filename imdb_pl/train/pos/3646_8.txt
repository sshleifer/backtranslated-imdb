"The Rookie" by Walt Disney is based on the story of Jim Morris, former minister of picka, who made one of the most incredible returns in the history of sport, finishing almost a 10-year retirement and making his debut in Major League in 1999 at the age of 35. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a short summary of the childhood of Morris, which included a series of changes of location - his father was a military man. And even when his family settled for good in mad football in Texas, Morris's passion for baseball remained strong. <br /> <br /> Then the childhood segment overtakes the 23-year-old adult Morris (played by Dennis Quaid) who is currently a baseball coach and chemistry teacher at Big Lake High School (in real life it was a high school in Reagan County in Big Lake in Texas). It is mentioned that he tried his career as a baseball player, but it did not work out. <br /> <br /> The Morris team is struggling with problems and lecturing them about giving up their dreams. They turn him over, telling him that he should try the Major League team. Several times, when it comes to them in practice, they express amazement at the speed with which they throw. Morris seems unconvinced, but agrees to enter into a contract with his players, in which, if they win the district, they will try the Major League team. <br /> <br /> Big Lake wins the district and keeps to the end, Morris attends the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. He throws phenomenally 98mph - faster than he threw during his petty league career and exceptional speed even for the Major League pitcher. After another rehearsal with the Morris team, he gets a contract with Devil Rays. <br /> <br /> It leaves him a difficult decision - stay in his comfortable life or once again realize the dreams of the Major League, passing through a small league game involving the earning of small money and spending months away from home. And the decision is even more painful than during his first small league match because he now has a wife and three children. <br /> <br /> Morris signs up with Devil Rays, starts at AA level and quickly approaches AAA level, one level below Major League Baseball. But with the end of the season, the chances of being "called" become smaller. <br /> <br /> I mostly love this movie. There are many great performances and nice characters and it is easy to find a really appealing Morris. In addition, the movie performs well in professional baseball both at the main level and smaller. And above all, it teaches a timeless message of holding on to your dreams, even if they seem distant and almost impossible to achieve. <br /> <br /> Despite this, the film has some drawbacks. Although generally accurate, exaggerates, and even produces a few things. Check out http://espn.go.com/page2/s/closer/020410.html to see some examples. In addition, except for one scene in which he prays with his players, the film completely ignores the Christian faith of Morris. But given the left-wing Disney spirit, this is not surprising. <br /> <br /> Presumably, many exaggerations / fabrications were made to make the story more dramatic. However, a 20-minute documentary about Morris, which is on DVD, contains some information that makes his story more dramatic but is excluded from the movie. <br /> <br /> For example, from birth to the time when his family settled permanently in Texas when he was 12 years old, Morris again located 14 times. His initial minor league career ended after four operations, in which he lost half the muscle in his left shoulder, which made that throwing 98 mph was even more inexplicable. <br /> <br /> To fully appreciate and understand the story of Jim Morris, it is good not only to watch "The Rookie", but also to view a DVD document, check the link to the inaccuracy of the film and probably read the biography of Morris, also entitled "The Rookie ". I have not read the book, but I hope on one of those days. <br /> <br /> But in general, "The Rookie" is a very good representation of a wonderful story and is a powerful testimony to the power of dreams and the triumph of an ordinary man. 8/10
