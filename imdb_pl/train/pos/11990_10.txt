In 1990, the Disney cartoon world was certainly in great shape. Shows like Chip n Dale Rescue Rangers, DuckTales and Gummi Bears were already popular, and now Disney has created another great cartoon and this cartoon has brought the birth of Disney. This cartoon is called TaleSpin. It's about the old character of Jungle Book Baloo Bear, who gets a job in the aviation industry. In the series, he meets the Kit Cloudkicker, the former Air Pirate and the good surfer from the cloud, the business lady Rebecca Cunningham and her overactive daughter Molly. This series is very funny and has lots of great punks that you do not understand as a child, but you understand later in life. This is one cleverly written series and it's great to add it to the DVD collection. Parents, buy it for your children, letting them see all these awful fairy tales of Nickelodeon. If you liked TaleSpin, check out "Darkwing Duck" and "Goof Troop". Spin!
