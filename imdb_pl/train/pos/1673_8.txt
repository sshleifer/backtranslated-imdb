A great trip to Martino is a thrilling and pleasant giallo with beautiful appearances of a good looking cast and mainly two leaders, George Hilton and Anita Strindberg. <br /> <br /> For me, a jigsaw puzzle is so confused and confusing that I just sit back and enjoy, not try to anticipate. Just when everything seems to be solved, again we are dealing with another series of twists and turns, nice twists, we have to say that. <br /> <br /> Sexy with lots of bloody kill this well-filmed movie with London, Athens and Greece coastal locations. The super final set on the Aegean rocks surrounds everything and everyone has a good time.
