This film is definitely a strange love story. Although this movie may not be much to say, Nicole Kidman is wearing the film herself, and the rest of the cast could easily be forgotten, though Ben Chaplin does a pretty good job at Hertfordshire Life with pictures of St Albans and Hemel Hempstead showing the real essence of the area. What begins to look like a regular episode of the popular British television series "Heartbeat", soon turns into a small gangster action movie. In this simple little film nothing really falls into the memory, which ends with quite a decent weekend entertainment. Good to watch, and if you like the hero, John, who is thirty-something years old, you can find something he can identify with in his character.
