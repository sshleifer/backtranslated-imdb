This movie is one of the most provocative movies about Jesus I've ever seen. He does not try to tell the whole story, but only to present the interpretive expression of the last day of Jesus Christ. He is darkly witty, funny and seriously faithful to elements of Jewish tradition and contemporary interpretation of the scriptures. Judas is much more ordinary than other performances, not the dark and evil evil that we sometimes imagine, but a blatantly wrong man, terribly wrong in his zeal. Jesus Chris Saranden is funny and serious, loyal and committed - very human and at the same time divine. The final dialogue is carefully made and serves as a kind of small conversation that two powerful people can do when they have just committed cruelty. I would watch the movie again and recommend it to others.
