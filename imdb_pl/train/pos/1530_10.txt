Old People Show ???? I am 15 years old and I watch the program from the age of 12, I decode it daily on my Sky + Box from Hallmark and BBC 1. I really wish they would not cancel it, they did not even have a goodbye. But what an adventure, all these episodes, I think I saw them all, and it does not occur to me that I did not like or dislike. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the BBC changes between the Murder and Murder She Wrote diagnoses - I have never watched it and did not intend it. Anyway, the heroes in Diagnoses Murder are so profound and the chemistry between the actors is amazing. It was a sad day when they canceled this program ........
