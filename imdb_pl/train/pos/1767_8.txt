Steve Carell made his career by introducing a bit of a strange simple guy, first in "The Daily Show" and then in various supporting roles. At Virgin Carell, he found a clever and fun scenario that makes the most of his strengths. Carell plays Andy Stitzer, a middle-aged man living in a quiet, lonely life. Andy is a bit strange, but in a awkward way. One night, Andy, who first meets with co-workers, accidentally reveals that she is a virgin. His associates David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romany Malco) and Cal (Seth Rogen) initially annoy Andy about his situation. But it is clear that all three have a certain respect for a decent human being, Andy, and they decide to help him by helping him finish his virginity. And so he starts looking for Andy in adulthood. Andy is the quintessence of innocence, and most of the humor comes from his naivety in the situation in which he is in the whole movie. Some of the humor is primitive, but most of them are simply well done. In addition, I discovered that some parts of the movie are really moving, because Andy for the first time in his life develops both romantic relationships and friendships. I am not trying to present this movie as a love story or a drama; is a comedy about places. Still, any good comedy I've ever seen has enough heart to care for heroes. A good comparison would be "The Wedding Crashers" from this summer. Virgin has a similar mood, but maybe he is a bit vulgar in some of his jokes. I especially liked the end of the movie, which I thought was a great way to end the film. Without betraying anything, it reminded me of "Something About Mary." Very light and pleasant; it makes you laugh and smile, which is exactly what you should feel when you finish a comedy. I would highly recommend.
