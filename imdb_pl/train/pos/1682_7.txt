After immersing your fingers at the foot of the giallo pool in the masterful film "The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh "(1971), director Sergio Martino followed the same year, which turned out to be another thrilling thriller" The Case of the Scorpion's "Ogon." Like his earlier effort, this one of the stars of handsome macho George Hilton who The next year will play in the hybrid Martino Satanic / giallo "All the Colors of the Dark." "Scorpion's Tail" is also the actors Luigi Pistilli and Anita Strindberg, who play the unhappy pair (to put it mildly!) In Your Vice Is a Locked Room and only I have a key "(1972). (I love this title!) I suppose that Edwige Fenech was busy this month, in which they did it! Besides, this movie boasts the stylish direction that Martino fans expect, as well as the tortuous This time, the story concerns an insurance researcher (Hilton) and a journalist (Strindberg, here looking like a prettier one, smarter sister Farrah Fawcett), who are caught up in a series of macabre murders after a plane crash and drop by a million dollars by a beautiful widow. I really thought I could find the picture halfway, but I was wrong. Although the plot makes sense in this giallo, I may have to watch the film again to fully appreciate all its subtleties. For me, the most important thing was the fight of Anita's cats and mice with the killer at the end, especially the burglary of the house and the clever struggle on the tiled roof; lots of good actions in this movie! Good people in No Shame should be thanked for one more great looking DVD, with nice subtitles and interesting additions. It turned out to be a great outfit in the constant pursuit of restoring these forgotten Italian jewels from oblivion.
