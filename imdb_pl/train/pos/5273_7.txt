Directed by Ruggero Deodato, a real icon for many horror fans after he directed the momentous and notorious Holocaust Cannibal. But do not expect such publicity in the film reviewed here, because it turns out to be incredibly tamed in the comparison and plays more like Conan inspired by the trip for the young audience. <br /> <br /> This description can immediately discourage the majority of fans of the whole Swan & Sorcery inspired by Conan, but before you turn in this direction, you have to say that this movie is just so much fun! <br /> <br /> In most of the game, he laughs and offers two HUGE and very nice characters in the form of David and Piotr Pawe≈Ç aka. Barbarian brothers who seem to have a ball with their characters. <br /> <br /> The favorite movie by B-Richard Lynch appears as the main villain in this song and it's also great to see the roles of Big George Eastman and Michael Berryman. <br /> <br /> What's more, ladies are delighted to watch and appropriately scantily dressed for the duration of the film (the basic and very desirable component of this genre!) <br /> <br /> What can I say - it's just a really fun and light approach to the genre and I recommend it with all my heart!
