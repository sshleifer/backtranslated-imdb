I just finished browsing the first album in a 4-disc (26 episodes) collection created in conjunction with UCLA Film & Television Archive (S'More Entertainment, Inc.). So far (except the first episode) the image quality is quite good. The DVD box is shown on the cover page here on IMDb. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Peepers" is as charming as when I saw him for the first time (he was 5 at the time), and Wally Cox is really charming in this role. If you're in the mood for a quiet comedy that sneaks into you, unlike hitting you on the head, you'll value this opportunity to experience all the great characters you can remember from childhood. Although some gags are a bit trivial, most of them are brilliant and well made ... and even old-fashioned ones are fun. This is one TV series that fulfills my memories of early childhood.
