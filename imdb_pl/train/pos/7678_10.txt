I just saw Holly along with another film about human trafficking and sexual abuse of children, called the international film festival "Trade in the Sea." I must say that Holly blew Trade out of the water. <br /> <br /> Holly is a powerful and amazing movie on many different levels. It is amazing from a purely artistic and cinematic perspective. Audio mixing, camera angles, control and operation are in place. <br /> <br /> In addition, the way he deals with the topic is tasteful and non-exploitative. It presents the problem of sexual abuse of children in both educational and thorough ways. The filmmakers devoted extraordinary attention to the details, really capturing the nuances of the epidemic of child sexual abuse and trafficking. Too often, when we are dealing with this kind of topic, it is tempting to shock the audience with graphical scenes of rape and violence. Holly is able to achieve all this without falling into a typical Hollywood trend. <br /> <br /> I had the pleasure of seeing Holly at two separate film festivals, once in the US and once in the Netherlands. I can honestly say that I have never seen more disturbed audiences. Listening to the talks after the screening, people ask what they can do to fight the sexual abuse of children. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend everyone, both because of the film value and the subject.
