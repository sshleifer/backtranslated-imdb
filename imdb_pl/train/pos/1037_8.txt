"A bad perpetrator is often a man who left something unsolved, not always what he did." - Cesarz Marek Aurelius <br /> <br /> The DVD release "Watch on the Rhine" could not have come at a better time. He restores us the main play Lillian Hellman, adapted to the screen of Dashiel Hammett (commentary by Hellman Bernard F. Dick confirms its authorship). He presents the subtle performance of Bette Davis, who played a subdued secondary role long after she became the queen of horses in the Warner Bros. party. Equally important, it reminds us that the Second World War had a purpose. <br /> <br /> Sure, you say we needed it. We heard Cary Grant's sermon in "Destination Tokyo" (1943) about Japanese boys and their Bushido knives. We watched jackboots stomping on lively hills in The Sound of Music (1965). In "It Happened Here" (1966) we visited England besieged by Germany. However, to tell you the truth, we still need to spread the news. <br /> <br /> I have an 81-year-old friend who regularly curses Franklin Roosevelt. He thinks that FDR equated the US with foreign fighting, which we did not need, and thus caused the death of his favorite cousin. He encourages him to demonize allied leaders and to banalize the Second World War by Patrick Buchanan. <br /> <br /> A political columnist recently published a thick book, full of detailed research, which claims that Adolf Hitler would not pose any further threat to Poland, Europe or the world if the Third Reich were handed over to the Free City of Danzig in 1939. Buchanan he maintains that if these egoistic Poles would not face the Nazis, engage the unreasonably interfering England and the hauntingly altruistic France, he would have swallowed up the West without war. He believes that without the rigors of Total War, no one in Germany would build gas chambers to provide a definitive solution to the Jewish problem. <br /> <br /> Some commentators on this site believe that "Watch" is falling under the weight of obsolete propaganda. Maybe. However, neither my friend nor Pat Buchanan seems to make sense of the movie: some people hurt and kill to catch the earth, the good and freedom of other people; such people dominated Axis's powers and "enough" did not appear in their dictionary. <br /> <br /> Paul Lukas deserves the Oscar he won. He and Bette Davis put a convincing passion into their images of refugees fighting the oppressors. They give an emotional blow to the intellectual cause for descending from the sideline, for actively facing the executioners and murderers. Bernard Dick notes that Hellman did not care for Lukas as a person because he remained apolitical. Of course, as Hungary, he first saw the bloody "dictatorship of the proletariat" Bely Kun, which replaced the outdated empire, and then overthrew the right-wing tyranny of Admiral Horthy. <br /> <br /> In the wonderful role of an added episode to Hammett's play, Henry Daniell sardonically introduces the class officer who despises the brown shirts he serves. His Phili von Ramme would undoubtedly stand with Field Marshal Rommel in 1944 during the Plot on July 20 against Hitler. However, in April 1940, he craved the Nazi case in a pragmatic way, although he insults Herr Blecher of the "Butcher" and sneers at the Romanian aristocrat Tecka de Brancovis for trying to disseminate information about the leader of the Underground. <br /> <br /> Teck, a pauper and potential cuckold, wants cash and visa to return to Europe, where he could resume the shreds of life that fell apart with the devastating empire of the Great War and the larger global economic crisis. There are no political beliefs, no scruples about trading a freedom fighter for their own tomorrow. A graduate of the Mercury Theater, George Coulouris gives this stale cynicism from the Old World the advantage of a desperate threat. <br /> <br /> Lucille Watson gives the overwhelming vitality of a housewife to a catchy man, an imperious old woman who knows her mind and gets her way - but whoever does not appreciate her children and their achievements outside the home, controls. She and her pale son connected with the office belong to the American version of the privileged von Ramme and de Brancovis. However, this family has seen no ruin and will never be. They are people who make money, who can quietly do evil, just do not oppose it. <br /> <br /> This mother and son can easily make choices that reflect this opposition to National Socialism and Fascism, which is flourishing today in my friend and Buchanan pundit. "Watch on the Rhine" has a well-groomed look. His dialogue reflects his erudite descent on the stage, and does not sound fresh from the streets. However, Hellman and Hammett's film has intestinal strength. Viewers still have to hear and constantly pay attention to the calls for weapons against marshals.
