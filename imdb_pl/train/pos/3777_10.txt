Anyone who does not think that Bogus Journey Bill and Ted is one of the best films of all time requires checking their heads. Somehow, he manages to be both mindless and thoughtless, but at the same time terrifying and clever. One of those rare films that actually improve his predecessor, Bogus Journey can be admired repeatedly. Notable attractions are a duel with death and ending, which is very "emotional". Keanu wants to forget about all the Matrix debris and get on with what he does best, Ted Theodore Logan in Bill and Ted: The Return.
