This is a well-made documentary about the exciting world of Indy Car races. Photography is simply outstanding. The scene was that Mario Andretti rides an old racing roadster down New England, surrounded by old maples, leaves blown aside by the speed of the car, are amazing. The movie loses some of its beauty on a small screen, but if you like to watch cars brought to the limit, you should see this movie.
