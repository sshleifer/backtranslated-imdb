I do not agree with one of the reviewers who compared this film to American International Pictures. Basil Deardon directed a brutally realistic movie with a fair attempt to show the rise of juvenile delinquency in post-war England (but without sentimentality with "Blackboard Jungle"). The photos were perfect because they really captured the horror and isolation of a huge housing estate. The estate looked like an old prison. Stanley Baker was excellent as a hardened detective, assigned to a juvenile unit - "Urgent, urgent - Larceny - five ice lollies" !!!! He states that it is the butt of many jokes. David McCallum showed that he is one of Britain's best young talents in the 1950s. (He had a completely different role in Stanley Baker's "Hell Drivers"). His Johnny creation and the fanatic attitude he inspired was very scary. Ann Heywood was also very good as a cynical Cathie. I would not say there was a romantic thread in it. <br /> <br /> Detective Jack Truman investigates a series of arson attacks by someone marked "Firefly". Just as he finds evidence that can lead to a breakthrough, he is assigned to the Department of Juveniles - he is very disgusted with what he considers to be the wrong work of the police. In the midst of all these cries, he gets his first phone - six-year-old Murphy twins work in local shops on a stick !!! <br /> <br /> Taking twins home, he meets their brother, charismatic Johnny, and their embittered sister Cathie. He begins to appreciate how living in ghostly housing estates can turn young children into criminals. As he becomes more and more involved in family affairs, he realizes that there is a strong connection between fires, Johnny and the terrified Chinese youth who works in the laundry. A local priest (Peter Cushing in an unusual role, far from the horrors of Hammer) explains that when Johnny was younger, he saved some people from the burning building and was hailed as a hero. He wanted to regain his sense of importance and be useful, and felt he could light a fire. The siege of the school was filmed in a very real way, and the viewer felt the fear of the children - the teacher (thinking only about his own safety) escapes and locks them in the room with a frightened shooter !!!! <br /> <br /> I thought it was a really great movie that tried to show some of the social problems Britain experienced after the war. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
