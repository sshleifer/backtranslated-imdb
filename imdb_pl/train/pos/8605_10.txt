Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy play in this "modern" musical that presents MacDonald's comic skills. Surreal 40s musical seems to mock fashion from the 40s, despite being in current fashion. Stunning costumes and sets (yes B & W) add surreal, sleepy quality to the whole movie. A few good songs will make the movie come alive, and the number of "Twinkle in Your Eye" is a total attraction, including a funny number of jitterbugs between MacDonald and Binnie Barnes. Edward Everett Horton, Reginal Owen, Mona Maris, Douglas Dumbrille and Anne Jeffreys are also HUGE. In extended tracks, we'll also see Esther Dale, Almira Sessions, Grace Hayle, Gertrude Hoffman, Rafael Ottiano, Odette Myrtile, Cecil Cunningham and many others. <br /> <br /> Great fun and nice to see the wonderful MacDonald in her jitterbug / vamp procedures. She could do all this.
