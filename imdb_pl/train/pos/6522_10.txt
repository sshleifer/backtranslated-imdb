During the whole event, the Pirates of the Caribbean Trilogy Craze Paramount Pictures really threw the ball in restoring this Anthony Quinn directed by Cecil B. DeMille supervised the film and receiving it on DVD and Blu Ray with all the extras. It is clear to me that Paramount Pictures Execs are blind as bats and do not know that they have a really good pirate movie in their vault about a real pirate who actually lived in New Orleans, Louisiana, which would help the Crescent City known for their combination of pirates . When the Execs in Paramount finally get the program and publish the movie in digital format, I will be a happy camper. Paramount Pictures is up to you if you can get your movie back and bring it back right now!
