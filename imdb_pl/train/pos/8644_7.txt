**** = A masterpiece to be written in books and never forgotten. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 = Classic on time; just have to see <br /> <br /> *** = Solid, valuable, very funny song <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 = Good movie, but there are some uneven elements or noticeable defects <br /> <br /> ** = It may still be considered good in areas, but this work has serious problems or is inhibited by unavoidable elements considered unavoidable (eg species) <br /> <br /> * 1/2 Mostly bought nothing by little valuable moments. <br /> <br /> BOMB = No visible quality <br /> <br /> - Kalifornia = *** <br /> <br /> - Amazing (too strong material of violence, considerable sexuality and language) <br /> <br /> I rented this movie, expecting to celebrate Brad Pitt's face in the summer, but I was surprised and disappointed. This is really more dramatic and very dark ... I remember the intense voice of Duchovny emotionally. <br /> <br /> Pitt plays his most sexiest movie with a surprising talent. Who started out as a hopeless but harmless "white garbage", became an aggressive, disturbing alcoholic with a clumsy mind. During some of the last stages of the film, it was difficult for me to watch it - it was unpredictable and terrifying. This testifies to very good writing and acting. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is full of bizarre, sensational scenes that made me hold my breath no less than once and I do not mean action scenes. I mean dialogue scenes so brilliantly made that I actually winced and gasped at what I saw. It was like watching a rhino and a lion in a cage and watching them bite to their deaths. Again, I'm impressed by the writer; whoever is, did the impossible: mixed oil and water. <br /> <br /> I really liked the performance of Juliette Lewis. It's rare that this talented young actress appears nowadays, when she does, it's such a joy. Some of her moments in this movie led me to tears. I mean that. Emotions that this girl can arouse in your head are amazing, and I clearly remember that several times I was indistinct. <br /> <br /> I can almost feel that I am fooling myself with the high quality of craftsmanship shown by the filmmakers only giving the "CALIFORNIA" rating ***. But the dark feelings that it evokes are too strong and depressing to raise them. I believe everyone should see this movie. I'm really doing it.
