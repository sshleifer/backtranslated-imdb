This movie is an exception to the rule that the sequel is worse than the original. His comedy at its best. This movie is a fast slapstick comedy in which something seems to happen every second. On more than one occasion, the entire audience laughed loudly at the joke. <br /> <br /> It's a great advantage that he saw the first movie, but it is not required. They have the advantage of being a parody of a TV series from the last decades, such as the survivor (expediton: Robinson in Swedish). I do not see it if you do not know Sweden and its language. Otherwise: Have fun! Johan
