Many Americans would say ... What? to my opening commentary. Yes, I know that my comparison is undoubtedly an insult to the fans of Master Akira Kurosawa, but if you analyze this movie, my comment is correct. We have a peasant who goes to the city in search of help against a group of grasshoppers who wants to steal the village's harvest. The big difference is the way history adopts. Our samurai, a team of circus performers, as in the original, is a very complex mixture of personality, but finally what the village needs, HEROES. Watch this amazing movie again (Seven Samurai) and find more movies that stole history and tried to get the same magic effect as Akira Kurosawa's Masterpiece. The tip is The 13th Warrior with Antonio Banderas, Michael Crichton copied the story to write a bestseller, but he did not find the third cat's foot.
