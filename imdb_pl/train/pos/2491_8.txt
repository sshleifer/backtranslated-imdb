Budget constraints, time constraints, scenario shooting, and then cutting, pruning, cutting ... This crew is a group of good, young filmmakers; thought out in this scenario - yes, allegorical - wise in zero effects, when time and knowledge are all you have, relying on actors and friends and kind others for their time, devotion, locations; and getting the first canned function, stuff 1 in 1000. These guys are making movies. Good. Check out their collection of shorts "Heartland Horrors" and see the development. And I can vouch for them, working with them is the coolest thing you'll do in the industry. I am hampered by the sharp, insulting criticism of this film, wondering if any of the reviewers heard even one word of dialogue, wondering about one thought or concept or if all that was desirable in this work is visual blood strokes and cuts to satisfy some thoughtless a view of what horror should mean to the public. Let 'The Empty Acre' bring you yourself. Do not assume that what you expect should be just because it will be introduced to the horror / thriller genre because of its supernatural assumption. It is a drama with a depth that exceeds how far you can drive a blade into someone with respect for a message that does not attack the visual center of your brain, but rather draws from an empathic imagination to experience the suffering of the mind and the spirit of others. mark ridgway, Curtis, "The Empty Acre"
