Personally, I think that this film can not be separated from its political / historical foundations, as is the case with many (American) reviewers. This is not about growing up on Main Street in the USA. It's about growing up in Yugoslavia while it was torn between East and West. Just as the guys are torn between Esther and everyone else, and Esther is torn between "Tovarish Joe" and the guys. In some situations there is a shame in the case of an audience who never lived under Tito. I feel that the film is underestimated and it is a pity that we lost the director. Such films make freedom more important. This is not just "another film from the Eastern European era" ... it is a sensitive portrait of teenagers walking a thin line that can lead them to true freedom.
