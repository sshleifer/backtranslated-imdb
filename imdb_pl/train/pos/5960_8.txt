It's great to see Jorja Fox in a role where he smiles a lot. I also loved to listen to her singing. A nice change to see her with her CSI / West Wing / ER roles. The film itself was funny, but it seemed that some explanation was omitted in many parts. Some heroes seemed to be unhappy for one minute, and happy next ones and it was up to your imagination to find the cause. Each character was bizarre, and in some cases I could not wait to see what they would do next or hear what they would say next. This film was not full of squeaky, clean people, but rather complicated realistic people who could make mistakes, feel bad about them, and then find a way to fix them.
