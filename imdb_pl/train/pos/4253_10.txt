a really great movie, one of the best I've seen. Touching and simplicity - just like life, sometimes you cry sometimes laugh and it's just beautiful. not too much, just as it is supposed to be. I really liked the idea of ​​the movie, no one is bad or good, everyone or just people sometimes make mistakes mainly because of public pressure, everyone is trying to stay strong and some are more successful than others, and the most important thing is that you do not have reasons to get angry - you can do it, but eventually anger goes away and then you have to let love come back, although it's hard, true happiness lies. <br /> <br /> Great actors and cast, the movie really gives you a sense of movie. <br /> <br /> nice to be nice. <br /> <br /> I recommend seeing it, especially if you like to watch the lives of Italians ....
