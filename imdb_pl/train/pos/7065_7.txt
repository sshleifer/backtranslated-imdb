A lovely movie about three living sisters from Switzerland (often seen running in fitted outfits) who want to regain their parents (it seems that mom still carries a torch for dad) - so they sail to New York to stop dad from marrying a blond goldsmith who calls "valuable". Daddy has not seen his daughters in ten years (strange) does not seem to mind and he thinks he's great, and meanwhile Precious seems to lead a life mainly led by her overbearing mother (Alice Brady), a woman who just wants to make sure so that her daughter would marry a rich man. The sisters come up with an idea to push the Precious Path of the drunken Hungarian Count, deceiving two women digging gold to consider him one of the richest men in Europe. But the case of the wrong identity makes girls think that the count is handsome Ray Milland who agrees with this scheme because he is in love with Nurse Kay. <br /> <br /> This movie is pleasant, light. . Barbara Read as Kay looks cute and pretty, Ray Milland looks so young and handsome here (though unfortunately not much is possible), Alice Brady is quite good as an intriguing mother - but this is Deanna Durbin, real charming and sweet like a button the youngest sister of Penny, who almost steals the show. With absolutely beautiful vocals, she sings a few songs throughout the movie, although I would prefer them to see them even more in this movie. The story in this movie is a bit stupid, but still, I think the movie is fun and funny.
