I went to see him twice in this movie, my friend went to see him at a publishing party, and he told me it was so great that I was expecting a lot about the movie, I could not enjoy it because I did not watch it in a non-surgical position . For the second time I knew what to expect and I liked it more than the first time. For the second time I felt in the mood for the party. I loved music that is just great. <br /> <br /> If Tom Bartender improves his director's talent, he will be the director everyone will talk about. If you can release this movie as your first, you must be talented. <br /> <br /> Acting is performed by several great Belgian stars (Dirk roofthooft) and several new talents, such as Titus De Voogdt. <br /> <br />
