Warning: contains a spoiler. Corny conspiracy, and in many cases terrible acting. Fontaine is great, but some others, especially Richard Ney, Ivy's husband, are extremely wooden. Ney is lying in bed, dying because of arsenic poisoning, with every hair in place. However, the film is so juicy and full of tension. More faithful to the book than most movies of those times. Throwing Joan Fontaine into poison (and an adulteress who was then equally shocking - I'm not kidding, children) was a master stroke. She is just her ordinary self, Joan Fontainey. As the murderers had, dies, falling "legs across the floor into the empty space."
