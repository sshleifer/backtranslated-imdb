Some posters seem less than grunted because it is neither Mark Twain nor Rodgers and Hart, but clearly does not pretend to be. You'll be looking for a big fan of Rodgers and Hart for me for a long time, but Burke and Van Heusen were not exactly chopped liver, and besides, they knew Der Bingle and found great songs - But beautiful, Moonlight Becomes You, It's Always You, The Day After Forever, etc. - to adapt to his very personal style and here he came up with another great - and unjustly neglected - ballades, Once And For Always, and some optimistic entries in the letters If Stub Your Toe On The Moon and Busy Doing Nothing. The weak thread should not be taken seriously - why Merlin is not heavy when, in most, if not all, versions, he is Arthur's friend / mentor - so if you start to think aloud about why Sir Lancelot, who was sold to historians as an epitome chivalry and metamorphosis of straightforwardness in the school bully of a tyrant who you will not enjoy having what is essentially a funny movie. In total, he does what he's going to do, have fun, so good luck.
