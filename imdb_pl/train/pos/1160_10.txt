That's funny. It's not Arthur Miller or T.S. Elliot, but it's fun. Kline and Fields are great. (Her poem "God, you are so unbearable" when he climbs in his window - great! Kline runs into the door after she met Teri Hatcher - also great!) Robert Downey Jr. he learns who she really is ... the soap opera is rotating, if everyone is one! <br /> <br /> The late stage in the Chinese dining room took place with my children and me on the floor - this scene is worth the rental price. <br /> <br /> It does not solve any problems in the world or show the crafty daytime TV (I hope). Just a lot of fun.
