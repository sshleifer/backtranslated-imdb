I just want to say that I'm glad someone finally poured beans on this movie. Bravo "The Spaz", Bravo! This film is a ridiculous farce for making movies. Especially for a student film! I just want to admit Spazz for devoting an absurd amount of time to finding such a rare picture, and then FIND IT! Most people I know do not have such time, especially since so few will finish reading. Kudos to you! In any case, the film follows a thin plot that is at least incredible and simply stupid. I understand the idea of ​​creating a satire of Charlie's Angels, but why hire such horrible actresses! In addition, what kind of director himself acted, wrote, produced and also edited the picture! Choose one job and put all your love into it! It's such a shame because I heard that he made a good movie about a deadly toothbrush. Again, thanks to Spazz for withdrawing the curtain of this film, people like you are a rare find.
