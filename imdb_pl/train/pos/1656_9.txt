"Thieves and liars" give us a very naturalistic picture of the level of corruption that affects many Puerto Ricans and forcing them to take difficult, if not impossible, choices about their lives and their loved ones. The cast is excellent, considering that some are unprofessional actors; an excellent choice that increases the level of reality in the movie. Photography drives history without interference, as with this type of film. The script reflects the specific features and attitudes of "Boricuas" in a very deep way. Sometimes it seems that you are watching a documentary! Watching this movie, you feel as if you secretly entered the real Puerto Rican society and stood invisibly watching it implode. I love it!
