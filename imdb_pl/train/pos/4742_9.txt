This movie contains more actions before the opening credits than in all Hollywood movies of this type. This movie is produced by Tsui Hark and the stars of Jet Li. The band has brought you many worthy cinema productions in Hong Kong, including the Once Upon A Time in China series. The action was fast and furious thanks to incredible wire work. I only saw the wires in two shots. In addition to the action, the story itself was strong and not only served as a filler. To find other action movies that can compete with this movie, you must look for a Hong Kong movie theater. They are really worth checking and they usually never fail.
