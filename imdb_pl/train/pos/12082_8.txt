After watching the film, based only on the reviewers' ratings, I was most pleasantly surprised. Although clearly low budget, he bears signs of clever ingenuity. For example, when Julia wakes up in a strange house and looks out the window, I thought her sense of isolation would be enhanced by an outer shot focused on her face and then receding, covering the house and its isolated place. And here it is! the next scene was exactly the last shot of the house standing alone on the cliff above the water's edge. There are other examples of how a clever director can raise his film to the level of a very pleasant thriller. Experienced viewers will certainly notice them, but they should be sure that they will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> When it comes to performances, George Macready is his usual frightening self, barely maintaining his temper, suggesting at the same time the ability of unpolluted violence. Nina Foch was surprisingly good as a not-so-wise working girl who does not intend to give up without a fight. But Dame May Witty, oh, she even doubted her own eyes and believed that she could run away with her bad plans. <br /> <br /> It's a real raw diamond and you can not miss it.
