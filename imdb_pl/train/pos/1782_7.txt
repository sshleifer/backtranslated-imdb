I watched the movie three times. Last time I kept skipping tangled scenes to find a solution for the plot. Perhaps the story has no logical connection. Or maybe these rough spots are on the story, because Ann's evocation of distant events is rather flawed. <br /> <br /> Take the young Ann Grant (Claire Danes). Here is a young woman who attended an unnamed college with descendants of a rich family. She had to have help to afford this very expensive education, but she never seems to have any family ties. There seems to be no relatives to turn to when the consequences of one of her disastrous decisions come into force. <br /> <br /> Ann shares an evening of passion with his great love Harris Arden (Patrick Wilson). Then, when Harris comforts Lila after the tragic death of Brother Buddha, Ann suddenly finds him repulsive and is disgusted with her own behavior. I had to miss something here. Ann's behavior seems completely inexplicable. Ann leaves the relationship with Harris and finally marries one of the best men at Lili's wedding. Despite Harris's rejection of Ann, he still has deep feelings for him on his deathbed. <br /> <br /> His behavior clearly showed that Harris was deeply enchanted by Ann and would be happy to marry her. Scene showing their accidental meeting after the wedding Lili showed that Harris still had deep feelings for Ann. <br /> <br /> The movie showed the pattern of romantic relationships Ann. She always dropped with her men and rejected them. This pattern was with Harris and two husbands. Lila, on the other hand, married a man she did not love, and stayed with her husband until he died. Perhaps Lila was able to build a relationship because she did not want to let her marriage fail. <br /> <br /> Then came the too-comfortable presence of Lili Ross next to Ann's bed. Apparently Nurse Ann was able to extract enough information from Ann's last few lucid moments to identify and contact Lila. None of these messages appeared in the film. <br /> <br /> I was wondering about the house where Ann lived in the last days. How could she afford to buy such a home thanks to a modest income from the singing career? Ann always seemed a step ahead of the financial disaster, raising two daughters. <br /> <br /> On a different level, I really liked the film settings and music. The seaside residence was simply extremely painful. Claire Danes was great as young Ann Grant. She is really a talented singer. I prefer her natural brunette to the appearance of blondes in additions to the film. If only these unbearable CGI skylights would go away, I could pick up this video in the entire voting!
