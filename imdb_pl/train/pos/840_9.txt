I was not sure what to expect from this movie. I love watching Brosnan in every movie, he's always good, but it was different. It is a mess and plays very well. In fact, he reminded me a few times in uni :) So, there is not much violence, there is not much action, but dialogue breaks, acting is great and very refreshing, and it's quite fun too :) I do not think you will leave cinema "Wow! I was amazed "but you will leave smiling, enjoying a good movie. I can not ask for more. <br /> <br /> Oh, and if you're lucky, some moron will break the spool of commercials and turn away, inverted (reverse sound)) advertising !! Excellent. Nothing like watching Jacek Daniels' advertisement, in which the drink comes back to the glass bottle with a rough commentary "Twin Peaks" :)
