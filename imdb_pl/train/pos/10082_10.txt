The film is really moving, unique and uplifting. History is universal because it is a struggle between good, evil and the world between. THE MOST IMPORTANT is that his rating is wrong, misleading and traumatized. Blockbuster rated it as if it was a film with an X rating. The truth is that it is closer to G than PG and should be seen by children who can read clear and simple subtitles.
