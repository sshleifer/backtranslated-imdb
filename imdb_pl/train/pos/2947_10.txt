If you have not seen it, you do not know what is missing. The first time you will suffer, lying on the floor, throwing you out of laughter so much, and probably also wet yourself. <br /> <br /> IT'S SO HAPPY. So far, there has not been a single comedy show that I would see that it is peaking and even approaching. So many classic inserts, stories and segways ... <br /> <br /> Drunk uncle on the grill, Gi Joe, Mr. T, goony goo goo, ice man, you will say something to everyone who saw this performance and I bet, that dollars for donuts will not be able to hold their faces and will burst out laughing or recite the rest of the dialogue from the act. <br /> <br /> Pure classic !! It's a pity you can not do it on DVD ... <br /> <br /> Rating 10+ out of 10
