This program is amazing! I've been a fan since its release and it just makes me watch ... I saw here some horrible things I did not want, BUT, it really shows how addiction affects everyone involved, not just an addict. You can see different types of addictions, from drugs and alcohol, to addicted to shopping or addicted to eating disorders. And indeed, it's really sad to see some of the familiar faces that have also passed. We've seen some great musicians, a NBA player, and even young people who really need help. And because they started showing a few more, it was amazing too. Now you can see how long they last after they are broadcast. If you have not checked it yet, do it. It's on A & E and it's amazing! New eps are Sunday evenings at 22:00 EST, if I remember correctly ... so set TiVo!
