After reading the book, I came across this Wal-Mart DVD for $ 3 and I thought, I'm sure what the hell ... I have a DVD and I watched it last night. When I started watching, I checked the working time and it was about 90 minutes. I thought: OK, it's nice ... It seemed to run quite slowly, knowing the story and its quantity. When I got to the actual killings, I had the impression "how much time was it?" Checked. "One minute ?! What the hell ?! "I felt incredibly cheated, thinking that the movie had only passed a third of the story. <br /> <br /> But then I was happy to see that the DVD scene selection menu contained part 1 and part 2. He still had an hour and a half! Then I sat very happily and enjoyed the second half of the movie, even more than the first one. <br /> <br /> I admit that I have not seen the original 1967 film (despite my deepest desire), but I have read the novel and felt that it is a pretty descending movie, a two-part TV miniseries. I think that Perry's cast was completely wrong and a few small inconsistencies jumped on me, but it was still very well done. The first half stretches a bit, while the other half is much more gripping. I think they should make a more proportional movie, how Capote did his book: 1/3 before the murders, 1/3 after and 1/3 after the arrest of the killers. Instead, the movie makes it 1/2 more before the murders, 1/4 after and 1/4 after the killers are arrested. Again, this makes the other half more exciting, but less convincing when we drag the first half and further ... <br /> <br /> Now I look back and I realize that I just did the same thing wrong things go on and on, so I'll shut the hell up. Go watch a movie and come up with your own goddamn mind! <br /> <br /> Nick Houston
