One of my favorite movies that I saw in Seattle. Tom Hulce was amazing, without words he could convey his feelings / thoughts. Actually, I sent Mike Ferrell money for donations to help distribute the film. This is good. The system says I need more lines, but I do not want to give out the story. I was in the Seattle auditorium with Hulce and the director, the writer I think, and Mike Ferrell. They talked for about an hour later. Not a dry eye at home. Why Hollywood is still stupid I do not know. (I actually know it's our fault, look what we're watching) Well, you get what you pay for guys. Get it and see someone special. It's a gem.
