I never knew who Robert Wuhl was before. But after seeing this, I realized who a funny person is. This special HBO film shows that it teaches American students the history of New York Film University, and the man was simply phenomenal. He had fun with almost every key historical event that took place not only in the United States, but in other parts of the world. This document / comedy was a great satire that asked me if what I accept as an infallible true story is really real. <br /> <br /> I liked how Mr. Wuhl managed to combine useful information with great comedy and he learned a lot more exciting. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in history and willingly questions his beliefs.
