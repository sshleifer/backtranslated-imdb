Cracking good yarn with all the actors giving great value. Michael Curtiz at its best. Lots of nice twists and probably the best Philo Vance series. William Powell looks wonderfully relaxed and preferably in his debater. Precursor of the Thin Man series. I recommend it to everyone. Did you come up with all this?
