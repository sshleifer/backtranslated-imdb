A film / documentary about various people in Austria on the hottest weekend of the year. It keeps track of what they do, and maybe more, what they do not do. The pace is very calm ...... so you have to relax ....... breathe ... exhale before you see it ...... <br /> <br /> First you think .... but nothing is happening and you are a little angry at it .. And this is a problem because its mood of the movie and really cool social realistic photos that are nice in this movie ...... ... many people will say, that is disgusting ...... but it is not so bad ... I think it is more used for marketing ... and there are really funny moments ... 60 old woman smashed ..... I guarantee her the most unsexual striptease in movie history ...... his movie is real ... I think it's a word ...... right in the face ... .... and that makes it a bit scary . there is no computer manipulation ..... her real life ... and as we all know, movies can win with reality when it comes to doing diseases ... .... so it is much worse in the real world .... ... <br /> <br /> If you survive a movie, you can start looking at your neighbors and think ... maybe they are like people on the film ... I bet there are a lot of them ...... sick. .. crazy people living with a nice facade ........ after watching the movie I feel that he is more interested in looking at my neighbors ........ <br /> <br /> But maybe you should not watch this movie on your first date .........
