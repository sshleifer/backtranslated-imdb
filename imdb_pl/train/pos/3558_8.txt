Together with the South Pacific, Men and Dolls are for adults - - they are sassy, ​​sexy and full of men who are women and men who are strung. <br /> <br /> There is energy and a drive that makes it stand out from the package - the power of Jean Simmond's performance and the charm of the young Brando and the already masterful Sinatra add to the overall character and appearance of the song. <br /> <br /> Wins guys and dolls as it is shameless, what is it: MGM musical. <br /> <br /> It is still good to look and listen also with great melodies and dance numbers - it will remain one of the classics of the cinema of the XX century and will be watched with pleasure for many years. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it.
