This movie was last week and although at this time of the day (about 18) the quality of movies is almost never good (at least here on Mexican television), I could not turn the TV off. The story of Madelene Moore really touches you. At first, he does not turn out to be a very nice character, but seeing the whole movie, you just want him to succeed. This movie really leaves you thinking. And I think it's mainly thanks to the great game Brooke Johnson. I've never heard about it before or consciously seen it in another movie, but it was a great great game. Compliments for Brooke. I hope to see her soon in another film.
