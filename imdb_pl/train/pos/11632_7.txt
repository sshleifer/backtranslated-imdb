Greetings from the dark again. What a relief ... a thriller that is really exciting! The new IT girl Rachel McAdams ("Wedding Brigands" and "Notepad") dominates the screen in this nice, classic suspense thriller by the well-known horror director Wes Craven (movies "Scream" and "Nightmare from Wiązów Street"). Craven even has an episode as one of the passengers on the plane. <br /> <br /> What makes this work work is the realism of the first 15-20 minutes when we see that McAdams works with 4 or 5 people in a person or by phone. It is natural. When he meets Cillian Murphy (Scarecrow in "Batman Begins") in what seems to be accidental, the movie really escapes. Watching two yuppie flirts, while the audience knows that something is wrong, is captivating filming! The sequence of boarding the plane is hypnotizing, and the 30-minute decks on board are terribly claustrophobic. Craven keeps us in line with the commitment of others and if someone comes to help her. <br /> <br /> As with many thrillers, the only suspension occurs during the culmination when the lamb changes into a superhero. An interesting plot device leads us to believe that little Rachel has the necessary loss of frustration to see it, but we can not help it. The most outdated scenes include annoyed hotel guests, annoying airline passengers, Cillian and FX injuries in a hotel. The strength of the film is the development of characters and psychological games between the leaders. Unfortunately, the brilliant screen veteran, Brian Cox, is under-utilized, but overall it is an extraordinary thriller with suspense that is worth seeing except for the final.
