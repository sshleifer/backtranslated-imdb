Pierce Brosnan, the newest but not James Bond, is a killer. He is very good at what he does, but he gets old and tired. Greg Kinnair is really good as a simple and narrow businessman. Now, when history opens, the film shows these two people in their separate lives. One night they drink drinks at the bar and start talking. Suddenly, it turns out that these two people meet during a series of events. The story is great, the acting is at the highest level and humor is funny. I never thought that Pierce Brosnan would be so funny, but it really is and I must say that this movie is a must.
