It's only been a week since I saw my first John Tracks movie (Female Trouble), and I was not sure what to expect for the second time. <br /> <br /> While the previous movie was outrageously exaggerated, Pecker is actually a funny movie that satires critics of art in New York on T. Anyone who can not imagine what these "experts" consider so appealing in modern art, you will be glad to see these pretentious snobs of a boy so full of himself over Pecker who has just found a broken camera and starts shooting at his friends and neighbors. <br /> <br /> Edward Furlong (Pet Sematary II, Terminator 2: Judgment Day) was surprisingly good as Pecker. There was not a lot of meat in any of the roles in this movie, but it really shines. <br /> <br /> Christina Ricci (Prozac Nation) enters with another great performance as Pecker's girlfriend. In fact, it was the flagship year for Ricci (Buffalo '66, Opposite of Sex and Pecker. <br /> <br /> Lili Taylor, who had the only good role in The Haunting, was also a significant part of the movie and really made it it's nice. <br /> <br /> There are many funny scenes, but I must say that the best thing was when the crown collects screaming "We want a bush!" "We want a bush!" "I want a bush!" I thought it was a convention Republican until I saw the police distracting the dancer. <br /> <br /> I will have to look for more Waters work, especially Hairspray, now it's in the news.
