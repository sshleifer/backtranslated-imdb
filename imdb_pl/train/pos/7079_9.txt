I really liked it - I'm a big fan of movies that mix with your mind and leave you with a lot of questions and ideas for discussion, and that was a great example. But Terry Gilliam is always good at it (almost always, let's forget about Jabberwocky and The Brothers Grimm, right?). <br /> <br /> I especially liked the way he dealt with the theme of time travel and avoiding paradoxes - the way past and future events intertwine and complement each other. <br /> <br /> It was also very well done aesthetically - the art direction was really great and I would like to see it on the big screen. The future scenes had similar resemblances to Brazil in many ways, and even the current scenes were often very visually appealing. <br /> <br /> But perhaps the most striking thing was that it contained two actors I normally do not like, Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt, and they both delivered incredible performances here. Pitt, especially - I've seen one or two films before, which made me realize that it can actually work (as opposed to what I originally thought), but it really surpassed them. At one point, I asked my friends, "Is this really Brad Pitt?" This is probably the most memorable performance in his career (though he may not say too much).
