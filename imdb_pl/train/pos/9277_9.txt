"Cinema is dead, let the cinema live!" Said Peter Greenaway, one of the most innovative and productive contemporary directors at last year's Romanian film festival Anonimul, which reached the third edition and takes place in the Danube delta. This year, the director's award went to Jafar Panahi's Offside. I must see this evening in Bucharest on the retrospective of the festival. The cinema is dead but still very vivid. Panahi's film tells in a convincing way what Iranian society looks like. Digitally filmed "Offside" is a story inspired by a real-life event that took place in the daughter of Panahi: trouble and risk occurred when you decided to take part in a football match. It is forbidden in Iran, which we are informed about. Panahi manages to accomplish it with a few resources, but probably with a lot of work, intelligence and the humor of cultural patterns in a society that puts women at a clear level. The absurdity of rights becomes comical. The film has a happy ending because the Iran team is going to the World Championships. I appreciated the concept and idea of ​​this film the most. I would be very interested in watching other Panahi films that were also banned in Iran. I think that he can be considered the director of activists.
