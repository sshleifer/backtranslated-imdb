I went to The Straight Story expecting a sad / happy drama with nice direction and good acting. These moms. What I did not expect was an allegory of attempts at human existence. Leave it to Lynch to take a simple story of a 300-kilometer journey by mower and change it into a microcosm for human condition. <br /> <br /> If you have not noticed, look again, paying attention to the ages Alvin encounters, the area through which he travels, the reactions that people give him, the types of discussions he leads (one of the first concerns pregnancy and children, one of the last is outside the cemetery). The last path that goes down is particularly haunting in this context because it narrows and its fear and nervousness grow. The last mechanical failure can be seen as the death and miraculous rebirth of its engine associated with the afterlife, in which it achieves the desired union. <br /> <br /> I hope that some people who have marked this, a slow, melancholy melodrama, devotes time to more holistic attention.
