A bizarre horror full of famous faces, but stolen by Cristina Raines (later the television "Flamingo Road") as a nice but slightly unstable model with a rubbery smile, which is to pay for suicide attempts, guarding the gates to hell! Scenes with Raines modeling are very well captured, atmospheric music is perfect, Deborah Raffin is cute as Cristina's friend, but when Raines moves to the terrifying brownstone Brooklyn Heights (inhabited by a blind priest on the top floor), things really start to boil. The neighbors, including the fantastically wicked Burgess Meredith and the perverse couple Sylvia Miles and Beverly D'Angelo, are a diabolical party, and Eli Wallach is enjoying herself as a cunning police detective. The film is almost pollinated by "Baby Rosemary" and "Exorcist" - but what a combination! The Sentinel, based on the bestseller by Jeffrey Konvitz, is fun and ghastly, full of shakes raised by director Michael Winner, who is slowly coming to an end. *** 1/2 from ****
