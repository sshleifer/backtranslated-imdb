This is not a good movie, but I still like it. The Clovis cat is gold in the jar, as well as the premise of the cats themselves - inherently opposed to the bad lunatics. I think there is more in this movie than people realize that it is very difficult, but this harshness can sometimes be good. It has frail lines, a sudden ending and a comedy element passed by inept policemen. <br /> <br /> Did anyone think that the incestuous element is a bit worrying? Ultimately, this film is accidentally and accidentally painful, which is quite effective, I compare it to Psycho - the relationship between mother and son, change heroes. I think that this suddenness also works, it is not a movie that you want to extend, it works only if it is short. <br /> <br /> I'm still not sure whether the director lacked depth or these things with the goal, we know that Stephen King has the abilities, but I have not even read his books, I only saw some of his films. <br /> <br /> In any case, I liked it. If you like spicy movies with 80's overtones, just watch them. but do not expect too much. It's really that bad.
