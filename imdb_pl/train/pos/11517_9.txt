If you like Cleese and all the then British humor "Pythonesque", this little gem is absolutely funny. <br /> <br /> Arthur Lowe is a real treat! <br /> <br /> I saw it with my friends on TV when she first came out and her classic quotes became a part of our jokes for 30 years and will last forever! I have it on tape and it is constantly appreciated. <br /> <br /> Maybe some reviewers take it too seriously. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that it is now available only in the USA (NTSC of course), and not in the UK, where it should be an essential part of the history of British humor !!
