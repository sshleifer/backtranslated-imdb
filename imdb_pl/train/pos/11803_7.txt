"Sasquatch Hunters" was not really as bad as I thought. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERY ** <br /> <br /> Journey to the Forest, Ranger Park Charles Landon, (Kevin O'Connor) Roger Gordon, (Matt Latimore) Brian Stratton (David Zelina) Spencer Combs, (Rick Holland) and his sister Janet, (Stacey Branscombe) escorts Dr. Helen Gilbert, (Amy Shelton-White) her boss Dr. Ethan Edwards, (Gary Sturm) and assistant Louise Keaton, (Juliana Dever) to find a place for some renowned bones found in the area. When they make a camp, the band discovers a huge burial place and more weird bones cluttering the area. When group members begin to disappear, they begin to wander through the forest to a safe place. Sasquatch was found to be behind the killings, and the team teamed together to survive. <br /> <br /> Good news: it was not as bad as I thought it would be. The film really begins to pick up a pair near the middle of the road when the creature attacks. This is a masterful series of scenes, because the whole group is subjected to attacks by the creature, and the tension throughout the game is extremely high. The wooded area is most thoroughly milked during these parts, increasing tension and wondering when a single person wandering in the forest gets his advantage. The film also spreads quite freely, effectively using growls and roars off the screen. They really add a lot to make this part so frightening as other times when you hear a growling cry. It's quite effective and works well. It's nice that the later part of the movie is gaining momentum because it comes out pretty well with high action. Especially one scene I feel must point to a special scene during the first viewing. When a man runs through the forest from creation, he sees the expedition that is looking for him. Raising her hands to shout for help, in the second moment, when she announced her presence, he was attacked out of nowhere and killed fairly quickly. It surprised me and I jumped at first glance. <br /> <br /> The Bad News: There were only a few things you can complain about and one is a simple complaint. The creation here is mostly finished by the terrible CGI, which made it completely ridiculous and destroys any credibility it could have. The horror air conjured up by the opening of the film is almost fired into the window when the creature appears on the screen. It's so distracting that it's a shame that a little more work has not been put into it. I have complained about it and it is something that really should be eliminated, because it does not look so realistically and is quite false. Another big one is killing off the screen here. Very often in the film someone grabbed and then jerked, and then found a bloodied body. It is quite troublesome when the killings later look nice and juicy. Otherwise, I do not have a big problem with it, because everything else, which is usually criticized on this subject, did not bother me, but it is called for other people besides. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: I liked it, but it is still not the best Sasquatch film ever. This should not be taken seriously, and if you look at it this way, it's really nice. Fans of these movies should look at these movies, and those who like Sci-Fi Creature Features can also find some cool things here. <br /> <br /> Rated R: graphic language, violence and several graphic inks
