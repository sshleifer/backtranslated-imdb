Most of the people who follow Audrey Tautou's films do not seem to understand that Amelie was a character - that's not the real personality of Audrey Tautou, that's why every movie he takes part in will not be Amelie part 2, part 3 etc. <br /> <br /> Now that I said it, I also picked up the movie just because Audrey was in it. Yes, it's true, there is a big gap after the first scene, which is not seen at all for 45 minutes, but I did not even miss her because I had a great time with other characters. The guy who's lying about everything is too funny, the guy who justifies people who run out of his cafe and skip the bill, find coupons and ones that balance the loss, or actually ... it can take some time to get into all these characters, but this is one of the best movies I've seen in a while. <br /> <br /> The character Audrey Tautou, Irene, is not an exaggerated sweet girl like Amelie. In fact, like Irene, her rudeness to the vagrant with a request for change at the beginning surprised me. In this film, Irene is a girl with good intentions, but during her (very horrible) day her temper becomes more and more acid and pessimistic. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie great? have all these really interesting stories and stories ... very fun to watch, great landscapes and shots, very colorful and never too slow, and all characters can actually work. The best part of the movie is about 20 minutes, which remains ... this is when all the threads start to combine, and the ride really gains momentum and everything connects with each other and makes sense, and the whole butterfly affects the flowers. I swear it was the best 20 minutes of the movie that I've seen for a long time, and the ending ... It made me think, "Damn, I really found the movie." The end of this movie is at the highest level. Whoever wrote the script for this is a genius, because not only are there all other threads of the story, but somehow they make them all connected (and in a reasonable way, as in this case), but also that each character people felt and live, not just an old person used as a ball to build this whole butterfly effect ... very impressive. <br /> <br /> I strongly suggest this movie because it is a great movie to watch at any time, in any mood, with any company or alone.
