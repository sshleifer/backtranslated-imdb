Stargate is the best performance in history. All actors are absolutely perfect for these roles. I love the connection between characters. If you have not seen this program, I highly recommend it. Although this program is compared to Star Trek most of the time, it really can not be because it is completely different. I am a fan of treking stars, but I definitely rate this program far above each of the stars. Unfortunately, I live in New Zealand and we do not get Stargate on our TV, so if I want to see it, I have to buy a DVD, and season 10 is not yet available, so I can not see it for a long time depressing). This program, however, is very good and should be seen, but it must be remembered that it is very addictive. So in the summer I Love Stargate (and Amanda Tapping).
