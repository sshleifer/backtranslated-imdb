I think Charlotte Gainsbourg is one of the best performers in the world. I can not understand why some people say it is not. Boring....??? Maybe whoever said it was boring is boring. She is a great actress and the film was perfect. He has many great ideas and very good performers. The direction was great. I imagine myself in a French environment with all the sophistication and perfumes, flowers, churches, problems, etc. When she goes to the sister's store she is simply amazing. Everything is great. We have a very good actress, wonderful, for a long time. Alain Chabat and Bernadette Lafont are perfect. I like it more than in the next movie LA SCIENCE DES RÃŠVES. And Eric Lartigau did a very good job. <br /> <br /> Ana
