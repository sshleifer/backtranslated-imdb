I was completely absorbed in this movie from the first to the last minute. It is well made, with many interesting and original camera angles and techniques used. The plot surrounds a deaf woman who is chosen by friends and colleagues. She employs an assistant at work, and her true intention is to find love. He is ex-con and uses it to take revenge on those who have hurt her. In return, he must help him with a robbery that requires him to read his lips. The film moves into a dark film noir, with a few really great scenes and an even better finale. The real beauty of this movie results from the way the director uses the disability of the main character. The use of sound keeps the voltage steady, and dramatic shifts from silence to noise keep pumping blood, that's for sure. Put in a little black comedy and the subtext of erotic sexual repression that you got into a great movie. It's a movie that Hollywood really wants to do, but it just can not.
