This movie has shaken! Eddie is one of the funniest comics I've ever seen. Not only does he have a class, but he also makes the funniest history and culture observations I have ever seen. Eddie is the most original and the most intelligent comic I've seen in a VERY long time. Tell everyone else to leave the stage and let them rule!
