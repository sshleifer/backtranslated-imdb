In addition to great direction, production, acting and predictable drama, there is an important message in the script: <br /> <br /> "Listening leads all the way" To the voice blossomed, listen. voice, listen. To come to yourself, listen to me. To discover the needs of any situation or others, listen. It seems that the screenwriters convey the "mystery of life". Listening leads to the awareness of one's Self. It raises other senses, especially eyesight and widens the horizon. One can also discover one soul. The art of this film "Jak jest w niebie" magnificently showed the development of life, not only its joy and sadness, but ultimately the hope of life. All this is due to the first instruction leading to the choir; <br /> <br /> "Listen, it leads"
