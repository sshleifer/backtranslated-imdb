After watching "Break a Leg" in Vancouver at a publishing party, I thought it was a very nice movie. <br /> <br /> I had some simple belly laughter, and some of the episodes (especially Eric Roberts) were screaming. I did not hear the word about the current release date, although I heard it was close. <br /> <br /> The story is simple, but it is primarily a tool for the character and the situation. The script is fluent and hassle-free, the story unfolds effortlessly, and the acting is comfortable but fresh. This film won at least one prize from EVERY of the film festivals in which he was, or about 10-15 years. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend "Break my leg".
