I rented Zero Day from a local video store last week. I have never heard about the film and I had reservations about this movie. After watching the box, I knew that the film is an indie movie and therefore the quality will be less than in the mainstream film. <br /> <br /> I can say that after watching Zero Day, I immediately started from the beginning. The film was clearly in line with the basic outline of what happened at Columbine High School in April 1999. But it struck me how credible the two leading actors were. For the first time watching this movie, I was not entirely sure if what I was watching was the real tape left by the Columbine riflemen. Deep down, I knew that what I was watching could not be real, but at the same time acting was so convincing that you had to shake your head. <br /> <br /> Is the video disturbing? Absolutely! Are you going to see things that will make you undermine the value of the movie? Probably. I think what most people find disturbing is that they will have feelings for the two main heroes, Calvin and Andre (played by Cal Robertson and Andre Keuck). Why is it problematic for some people? Calvin and Andre are planning a massacre in high school. I know about myself, I felt a huge sadness for Andre and Calvin. I had empathy for them because their life had become so terrifying. They fell so deep through the cracks that they began a journey down the road that could be stopped if only the people around them would pay attention to their situation. <br /> <br /> Zero Day is a phenomenal movie. It gives you a close and personal look at the events that most of us will see in the news. It leaves you thinking about life. And that leaves you in trouble as people have come to this point. A week after watching this movie I still think about it. <br /> <br /> Those of you who have not seen Zero Day should remember the following: The film is independent and there is no budget or film being filmed on cameras. The material in the film is disturbing. This is not the mainstream of Hollywood and there is no happy ending. <br /> <br /> But if you can put it all aside, Zero Day is a movie that will stick to you and maybe it will only help you open your eyes.
