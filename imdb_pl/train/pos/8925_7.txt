This movie has almost a generational meaning for some of us born in the early post-war years in this movie (and especially if you were born in 1946-1953 and loved to spend Saturday afternoons in your cinema), you almost certainly saw it. And the memory that it probably stayed with you. It's a style of a short and incredibly exciting moment in our adolescence days. <br /> <br /> She had a modern stage design from the space age for the audience of her time. The set was any city with a supermarket and cinema that would be packed on display at midnight on Friday. He has hot rods and rebellious youth, but in "why can not he afford to play" and not on the agitated, histrionic rebel - without a cause. All characters were recognizable to us - teenagers, parents, an old man, doctor, nurse, mechanic, boy, puppy, even cops - were nice to us. We could refer to them all. <br /> <br /> He had an extremely terrifying monster. His first victim hears the groans "hurt ..... it hurts" and we were convinced and terrified. The threat is constantly growing throughout history. There are intense periods of tension, colorful effects, fantastic lead in McQueen and moments of humor, both intentional and not. It even had an almost exaggerated sad part to make us feel more sensitive to crying. <br /> <br /> I saw it in the summer, about 9 years old, double-charged "I Married A Monster From Space" and was so excited about the experience of this special dual function that I came back a few more times before leaving it. Everyone I knew saw it. I loved everyone I knew.
