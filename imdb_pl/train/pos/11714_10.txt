Then you have to see this movie to understand reality. After reading the book, Ms. Duke is now an advocate of people affected by bipolar disorder; previously labeled as manic depression. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that today people still criticize others with emotional problems or those who seek psychiatric help. Regressive and discriminatory thinking still exists, and this is unfortunate. <br /> <br /> In this video, viewers see the pain and suffering that Mrs. Duke experienced, especially as a child. Many of us remember her from the teenage "Patty Duke Show". At the age of 15 she was known in America. <br /> <br /> You will learn about its use by Ross (good game Howard Hesseman). When she grew up in the 1950s, the stigma was in full force. We see, however, how it develops in its career, but the disease is getting worse. He goes through attacks of substance abuse and promiscuity; even marries someone who divorces next week; and has several conflicts and tantrums with children and an older mother. All of these problems occurred before she received adequate therapy and medication. <br /> <br /> A recent study published by NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) showed that most adults in the US do not recognize most of the classic symptoms of bipolar disorder. It was also published that every fifth respondent in the survey believed that people can CONTROL their disease without medication if they want. (Bp. Magazine, Winter 2006) If you watch this movie, you will get to know the true story of a talented woman who will not be able to "pull herself up" and "recover" until she is educated about her disorder and receives proper treatment. Thank you, Mrs. Duke, for being an attorney against ignorance and prejudice.
