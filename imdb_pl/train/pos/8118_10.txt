First, I saw him in 1975 on some German TV channel and immediately turned around, then saw the movie about 12 times in cinemas and now I have a video tape, which I watch at least once a year - this film is perfect in every respect (direction, acting , cutting, score ...). The scenes are outstanding and very impressive, the idea of ​​a devastating world war beginning in the late thirties seems to be a prophecy for the 1936 film, the dictator "Everytown" is pure Mussolini, and Raymond Massey is simply charming, credible and perfectly devoted as a "hero" The positive tone towards technology and progress is quite refreshing in today's usually pessimistic standards - especially in the finishing scene, which always brings tears or two to my eyes, even after watching the movie so many times. <br /> <br /> This video is good on television, but it was created for a big screen, so if you have the opportunity to see it in a movie theater, please, it's overwhelming.
