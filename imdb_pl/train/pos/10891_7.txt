You can survive the Survival Day. I thought the TV version was slightly modified. I like Ben Aflecka. Game Drew Johnson, an adult without a family, who is willing to pay a stranger. Valcos with James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara as parents and Christina Applegate as Lisa Valco, daughter. Drew is lonely on vacation because he has no family, so he rents a family in suburban Chicago for a quarter of a million dollars. Bill Macy, who I remember best for playing Maud's husband Artur, is recruited to play grandfather Duda. When the whole situation falls, the truth can be painful. The Valcos farm is falling apart from Drew. Rich girl Drew and her parents make a surprising visit. You can not buy what you want! Acting and writing is mediocre, but the first cast pulls him to the last scene.
