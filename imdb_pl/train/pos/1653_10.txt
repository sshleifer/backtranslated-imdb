I agree with everyone who claims that this series was the best of the "spy" genre. My husband and I were relieved when it was broadcast in the USA for the first time and watched every episode. At the time I tried to buy a series (I recorded it all), but WGBH told me it is not available. I even considered writing to Ian Holm to see if he could have a copy! Like others, I bought and read the Deighton series (partly to understand the complex plot). If the original version is ever available on DVD, I'll be among the first in the queue to record a copy. The portrait of Ian Holma showing the sensitive but brave Bernard Samson was amazing. (He is always amazing.)
