Spoiler !!! This movie is based on the What If? Of course, Mr. Destiny will be able to answer this question. The main character goes through a bad day, like many of us, and asks this question. The chaos theory states that a butterfly in China can affect someone here from a chain reaction. The film focuses on one event while playing baseball. This event launches its destiny; Like Ashton in "The Butterfly Effect", with the exception of Mr. Destiny, he's using a comedy about drama. The results create a fresh, slightly original film. If the philosophy is in harmony with the "Butterfly Effect", you will probably like the destiny. I give him 7 out of 10. Amazing because I saw the first half of the movie 3 times and finally watched the ending on TBS.
