Pleasant despite Leslie Howard's performance. Mr. Howard plays Filip as a flat, uninteresting character. One should sympathize with this man; However, I feel the joy of Mildred Bette Davis. Mrs. Davis gives her best performances (she was nominated for an Oscar). Thanks to her performance, she revives this boring movie. ** Remember not to miss when Mildred tells Filip what he thinks about him.
