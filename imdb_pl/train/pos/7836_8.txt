Canto 1: How Kriemhild mourned Siegfried and how King Attila played through his ambassador Rüdiger von Bechlarna: Kriemhild (Margarete Schön) insists on getting the head of the killer of her beloved husband, Hagen Tronje (Hans Adalbert Schlettow), but her brother, King Gunther (Theodor Loos ), rejects her request. When the king of Attila from the Huns curses Kriemhild through his ambassador Rüdiger von Bechlar, the oath makes him a promise on behalf of the king that no man will ever offend her. Hagen Tronje hides the treasure of the Nibelungs at the bottom of the lake. <br /> <br /> Canto 2: How Kriemhild will come out of her homeland and how she was received by King Attila: Kriemhild brings the land Siegfried died from, and travels to the court of the Huns, where he is greeted by Attila himself, who promises her also defend oath. <br /> <br /> Canto 3: As King Attila besieged Rome and as he called his brothers Kriemhild: When Kriemhild rescues the boy, Attila returns to his kingdom and asks Kriemhild what she would most like her to like. He asks him to invite his brothers to come to his kingdom. <br /> <br /> Canto 4: How Kriemhild accepts the brothers: Kriemhild insists on the head of Hagen Tronje, but her brothers remain loyal to their friend and again do not accept her request. <br /> <br /> Canto 5: How the Huns celebrated the summer solstice with the Nibelunges: Kriemhild asks Attila to kill Hagen Tronje, but he refuses, because according to the laws of the desert, the guest is considered a saint. Kriemhild offers gold to Humom at the head of Hagen Tronje. There is a fight, and Hagen Tronje kills son Attila. <br /> <br /> Kanto 6: Suffering from the Nibelungs: The Huns lose the battle with the Nibelunges, but keep them in siege at Attila's castle. Kriemhild promises to save their lives on condition that he delivers Hagen Tronje, but her brother Gunther says that the German people are loyal to their friends. <br /> <br /> Canto 7: The Nibelungen's End: After Rüdiger von Bechlar's death, Giselher and Gernot, Hagen Tronje and Guhther are finally caught. Kriemhild kills Hagen Tronje, ending his revenge with destroying the Nibelunges. <br /> <br /> The ending of Siegfried's poetic saga through "Kriemhild's Revenge" was also told in seven dramatic cantosas. The character of the first part is a wonderful story about fantasy, adventure, romance and betrayal; the second part is a dramatic story of hatred, revenge and loyalty. A solid screenplay with great development of the characters, excellent casts and amazing direction of Fritz Lang gave another epos. Margarete Schön impresses with a completely different woman, obsessed and unbending in her desire for revenge. The costumes that Kriemhild carries are also impressive, and her acting is based on her face and appearance. I was a little disappointed with Attila's reaction after the death of his only son, because I found it too passive. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Os Nibelungos?
