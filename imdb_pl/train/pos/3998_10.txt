After some time, I missed this movie and discovered it only last week thanks to the recommendation of a friend. I can honestly say that I do not remember the next intimate drama movie that does so many things so well. The magazine is sharp, realistic, refined and even restrained. Cinematography and editing are discreet, but inspired, allowing the dominance of a visual story through great close-ups and framing of images, capturing loneliness and alienation in the most memorable way. Acting is also great, and all characters are painfully real and sensitive to the most attractive ways a film can offer. They reveal their deepest weaknesses through unprotected, severe vulnerability. A real triumph for Roger Michell and Hanif Kureishi and the rest of the team. Must see for serious film lovers.
