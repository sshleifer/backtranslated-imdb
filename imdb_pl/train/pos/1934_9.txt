I saw The Big Bad Swim at the Temecula film festival in 2006 and I was completely surprised how much I was drawn into it. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on the lives of a group of people taking an adult swimming class for a variety of reasons. In itself a humorous idea, the class serves as a catalyst for major changes in students' lives. <br /> <br /> What surprised me in the movie is how real it was. Rare characters in the team songs are treated so well. I liked the scenes in the classroom immensely, and the drama that took place outside was very moving. Nothing seemed out of place or out of character, and ultimately left a very strong feeling, like going to school or a summer camp - where you find quick friends, create strong ties and discover about yourself, but you have to go too fast. <br /> <br /> My only complaint was that Paula's character had a very strong and unusual introduction, which made you want to know a little more about her than it turned out. I suppose you will not meet everyone in the class, but ... <br /> <br /> Besides, I think that the film is very well rounded and quite pleasant. See if you have the opportunity.
