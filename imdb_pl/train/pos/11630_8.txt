Red Eye is a good little thriller to watch on a Saturday night. Intense acting, great villain and unexpected action. <br /> <br /> Some people may not want to watch this movie because it's about a very short 85 minutes, and 88% of the movie is on the plane and just talking. Do not worry, they deal very well with intelligent and witty dialogue. <br /> <br /> Film PG-13 seems to be the new justification for director Wes Craven. But it's certainly enough to put as much violence in the thriller as possible. <br /> <br /> The cast is the strongest side of this movie. This film needed good actors to provide dialogue and emotions. If they did not have these actors, the movie would be lost and boring. We had Rachel McAdams from Mean Girls and Wedding Crashers. Cillian Murphy from Batman Begins and 28 days later. The complement of this cast is Brian Cox from X-men 2. <br /> <br /> The pace in this movie was great. When your thinking is boring, they strike you in the eye. Fortunately, this is not a long movie and you do not feel like it. Much better than in the second flight plan. <br /> <br /> Here are my comments to the flight plan: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408790/usercomments-578 <br /> <br /> I recommend. Not too long and not too dirty. <br /> <br /> 8/10
