Another comment about this movie made it sound bad. Given that the spoken photos were so new - I think the script and acting were good. Davis was so young and fresh. She did not find her own style that we expected. Still, it's great to see her that way - still learning about the craft. <br /> <br /> So many stereotypes come from this movie and it seems that this movie has wiped off some tracks for the next 70 years. My voice is to see and remember how young this movie was. Keep an open mind and maybe you are shocked at how distracted the characters in this picture, because it is 1934 and how we perceive the early part of the last century as tense. by other negative and one-attention comments.
