If you're such a big fan of the author as I am of Jim Thompson, it can be quite suspicious when their work gets transformed into a movie. This is not the case for the publication of AFTER DARK MY SWEET by Scott Foley. A tense, sexually charged classic noir who follows him and gives justice to the original text. Jason Patrick and Rachel Ward give the best possible results of their careers. And always phenomenal Bruce Dern could even embrace him the same. Like Thompson's book, this film creates a dark and surreal world in which passion overcomes logic and the double cross is never far away. Must be seen for all fans of the great noir movie. **** !!!
