I really liked The Night Listener. This is one of the best summer films. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams gives one of his best performances. In fact, the entire cast was very good. Everything played only the right notes for heroes - not too much and not too little. Sandra Oh adds a wonderful comical touch. Toni Collette is great as a mother and never goes out. Everyone is very credible. <br /> <br /> This is a short movie that lasts less than an hour and a half. I noticed that the general version of the release is nine minutes shorter than the Sundance version. I wonder if some of the more disturbing images have been cut from the movie. <br /> <br /> The director told the story and did it in a simple way, which is a refreshing change from many directors who seem to think the task is to impress the audience, not tell a story and tell it well. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by previews and ads. This is not a Hitchcock thriller. See The Night Listener because you want to see a good story told well. If you're expecting Hitchcock, you'll be disappointed. <br /> <br /> The only complaint about the film was the ending. The director could have left a little more imagination to the audience, but this is a minor problem.
