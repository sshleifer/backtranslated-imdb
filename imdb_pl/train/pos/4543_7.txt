Well, no, I'm telling a lie, in fact it's not the best movie of all time, but it's a really nice movie that no one I know has seen. <br /> <br /> It's a movie of a police buddy with Jay Leno and Pat Morita (Mr. Miyagi) with some fluffy history about the prototype of a missing car engine or something, but it does not matter. the reason this movie is fun is the interaction between the two leaders who initially dislike each other and distrust each other, but become friends in a shocking fate. The whole difference in culture is quite good, because it's great to watch, it's totally funny, but in a cheesy and pleasant way. The soundtrack is fun, once again in a cheesy way from the 80s, it fits the movie, I try to find one of the songs for ages, but because I'm working on the memory of what I think a few words could not be found. <br /> <br /> Another thing that this movie has is the most fantastic to pay for each movie, but I will not give it back, oh no! In conclusion, I take this film for over 48 hours, most of Eddie Murphys's production, including a Beverly Hills policeman, and regardless of what buddy Jackie Chan or Martin Lawrence have in their name. If you're looking for a buddy movie with a buddy and you're fed up with a "plain white policeman who meets a wizarding black policeman," do it. Perhaps you will be pleasantly surprised, because it changes the whole formula upside down with "a simple Japanese policeman who meets a street white policeman". <br /> <br /> I give it 7. honestly, I like it more. I would rather watch it than many things that I would give 8. But I guess I know deeply that it's some kind of madness that makes me like this movie.
