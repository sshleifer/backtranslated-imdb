I have not seen this movie for about 5 years, but it still haunts me. <br /> <br /> When asked about my favorite movies, I always think that I always mention them. There are certain films (works of art such as this movie, "Dark City" and "Breaking the Waves") that seem to touch a place in you, a place so protected and hidden, yet so sensitive that they make an impression all their lives on the viewer, in contrast to a life-changing event, such as the ending of a serious relationship or the death of a friend ... This movie "shocked me" when I saw it for the first time. I was left with an emotional hangover that lasted several days.
