Stunning high quality movie. <br /> <br /> Apparently based on real events, which, as said, have a clear ring of truth on the subject, this film is very emotional and deeply moving. <br /> <br /> Battered and neglected child often becomes maladjusted in adulthood, as one of life's failures, whether as a gangster, addict or social load. <br /> <br /> Antwone Fisher as a young adult in a jacket, worried. He is on the verge of being a loser. Psychiatrist therapy advises him and it is this relationship that occupies a central place in art. <br /> <br /> Flashback and therapy reveal the source and remedy for Antwone's anxiety. <br /> <br /> Excellent performances of the entire cast. This story is in fact a family tragedy with emotional and physical torments. All actors give blood-filled performances with conviction and realism. <br /> <br /> One of the messages from the movie is the importance of raising children decently. <br /> <br /> A real Antwone deserves success. To endure evil as a child, but to rise above it, shows a wonderful character. <br /> <br /> And for all those who survived such torment, but survived and succeed: you are all winners. 10 out of 10.
