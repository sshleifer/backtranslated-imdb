A magical journey invented by Alexander Korda and Michael Powell. These two titans from the British cinema have mixed wonderful ingredients to create a masterpiece of the film! Some of the most thrilling early Technicolor, SUBLIME and shimmering music by Miklos Rozsa together with youthful enthusiasm of Sabu, the theatrical and sinister whims of Conrad Veidt and the exquisite beauty and voice of June Dupreza as a princess work wonderfully. Miles Malleson, who plays Father Dupreza, Sultan Basra, also wrote an excellent script that is great enough. DO NOT MISS THIS ONE! Since the publication of the above comments I have recently received a DVD and I can honestly say that I have never seen it correctly until I see this DVD version. Brightness and resolution are so precise, and the colors are so vivid that I was stunned. The amazing classic can be watched again and never fails and delights the viewer. Again, A MUST SEE!
