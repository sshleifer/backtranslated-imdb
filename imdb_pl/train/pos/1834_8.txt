This is a very touching film. I do not care what people say about this film, it's a very good movie. Amitabha Bachchan's performances made the dying father great because he wants to teach his son how to deal with life if something happens to him, and Akshay Kumer was great as the spoiled Aditya Thakura. The supporting role of Shefali Shetty, who played the part of Sumitra Thakur, was great. Priyanka Chopra was good at her small role in the film. Ragpal Yadav as a dead servant and Boman Irani as a spectacular father-in-law have a very good connection, and the comedy scene was hilarious. The direction is very good.
