The old vaudeville band Willy Clark (Walter Matthau) and Al Lewis (George Burns) were among the best known, but they broke with hatred. Over 20 years later, they agree to a meeting in a special TV show ... but find out they still hate each other. Willy's sister / agent (Richard Benjamin) tries to force them to work together. <br /> <br /> A big hit in his time and he won George Burns Oscar for the best supporting actor. I liked it. It was written by Neil Simon, so its non-stop one-liners. Some of them were fun, but the jokes about old Willy and Al were not. I also never liked Matthau. I never thought he was a good actor and something in him simply rubbed me in the wrong way. Also his character here is so pathetic that you will bore him quickly. It was all fun. Burns is just great, throwing off some liners with ease, and even Matthau fits him well. Their verbal battles are the best sequences in the movie. Benjamin is also very good as Willy's nephew, trying to force them to cooperate. For me, it's worth seeing only Burns. This jump began his career on a large scale and two years later he had an OTHER hit with "Oh God". That's good. Just good - not great. Matthau's character really makes it difficult. I give him 7.
