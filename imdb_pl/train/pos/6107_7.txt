After watching the movies ... I thought: "Why the hell was this movie so successful in the Korean box office?". Even if the film had a clever / unusual script, the acting was not very good, and the characters were not very interesting. For the Korean film ... I liked the battle scenes. If you want to watch the movie without thinking, this is the movie for you. But I must admit ... the movie was a bit childish ... 6/10
