One of the best films by John Ford "The Informer" does not contain any wonderful scenery of the American West. Instead, the intense drama of Ford was known for playing the no less difficult terrain of the British actor Victor McLaglen. The former player who once competed against Joe Louis in the ring wins the Oscar-winning character of the disgraced IRA soldier Gypo Nolan on the worst night of his life. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple: in 1922, Dublin, a hungry and humiliated man who was expelled from the IRA for being unable to kill an informant in cold blood, becomes an informer himself. For 20 pounds, he betrays a friend "Tansom" and for the rest of the night he drinks and distributes his blood money in rapidly changing spasms of guilt, denial, self-pity and a desperate desire to escape the consequences of his actions. <br /> <br /> This extraordinary complexity of seemingly simple character Gypo is the most impressive achievement of the film. In most films, the heavy Gypo type would be thrown as heavy, he would have at most two or three lines and he would get rid of quickly, so the hero and the villain could prove themselves. In "The Informer" Gypo is both a hero and a villain, while the game is played out in his internal confusion, each fragment is clearly divided with the audience. <br /> <br /> Since Liam O'Flaherty's novel was previously filmed in 1929, RKO gave Ford a very modest budget. The director and his co-workers, especially the operator Joseph H. August, used it to their advantage, creating a claustrophobic masterpiece about a man fighting himself. In addition to Oscar "The Informer" McLaglen also won John Ford, as well as victories in the Best Screenplay and Best Score category.
