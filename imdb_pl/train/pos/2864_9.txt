It was a joke around Bonanza about how fatal it was for any woman to get involved in any Cartwright case. After all, Ben Cartwright was three times a widower with his son at each marriage. And every woman who tied up with Adam, Hossem and Little Joe would end up dying because we could not get rid of the widower's formula and the three sons who started this classic television western. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, if Bonanza were made today, writers would have revolving figures of women who came and went out of Cartwrights. People have relationships, some go well, others not so good, it's just life. And we are less demanding than our heroes, so if a relationship with one of them goes south, we do not have to kill the characters to keep the survivor intact. But if Bonanza was made today. <br /> <br /> But we still expected a lot from our western heroes and Bonanza, although it took some time to keep up and the change in watch time with NBC certainly helped, the secret of Bonanza's success was the noble Patriarch Ben Cartwright and his unbreakable sons . Ben Cartwright was the perfect Tato TV in every genre you want to name. He spent all his life in hard construction work, which the enormous Ponderosa had spilled on three children. The children differed in personality, but all converged into a pinch. <br /> <br /> Cartwrights have become and continue to be an American institution. I suppose more people cared for this family than the Kennedys. This is evidenced by the popularity of Bonanza in syndication. <br /> <br /> Pernell Roberts as the oldest son Adam was discharged from the series. Rumor has it that he did not care about Cartwright's noble characters who bordered on holiness. Perhaps if it was done now, he would like it better in the way I describe it. <br /> <br /> This was just the beginning for Michael Landon, how many people are included in three hit television programs. Landon also has Highway to Heaven and Little House On the Prarie, where he had creative control. Little Joe was the youngest, the hottest but the most romantic of Cartwrights. <br /> <br /> When Roberts left. the show continued with two younger sons, but when the great Dan Blocker left, the heart flew out of Bonanza. Other characters were added up to this time, David Canary, Tim Matheson and Ben Cartwright adopting the young Mitch Vogel. But a big, loyal, but a bit fat Hoss was undoubtedly the most pleasant of Cartwrights. His sudden fall after surgery left too big a hole in this family. <br /> <br /> So the Cartwrights from Ponderosa went down in history. I have a real taste of how America took Cartwrights to heart when I visited the real city of Virginia. It does not look like you see in Bonanza. But near Lake Tahoe, exactly where you see Ponderosa on the map at the starting points, Cartwright is home, a set kept and open as a tourist attraction. Like 21 Baker Street for fans of Sherlock Holmes, the ranch and Cartwrights are real. <br /> <br /> And if they were not real, they should be.
