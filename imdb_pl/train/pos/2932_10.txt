I've seen my participation in comedy and standup movies, but this one is so original, so fresh that it will make you wonder why you've always been in the video store. Murphy has some joking jokes, but it's too funny to include them. If only every movie can be so much fun. you should be called "107 minutes of the most amazing comedy" Murphy is a comical genius in this movie and will make you say "this is the guy who did the dr. Doulittle. " He talks about a man from ice cream, mothers throwing shoes, his aunt with mustache, racism and everything you could think of and those you could not. Please, if you ever see one comedy in your life, that's it, if only all movies can be Delirious.
