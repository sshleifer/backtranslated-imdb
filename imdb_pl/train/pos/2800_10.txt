David Beckham is a British football star and husband of Victoria Beckham ("Posh Spice" from "Spice Girls"). His trademark is a shot that bends across the pitch and goes into the net. Football equivalent of the unbalanced baseball curve. "Bend it like Beckham" means performing this type of spectacular shot. Besides, and the little chapel in the main character's bedroom and the faux-cape at the very end, the film has nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of small football-joke, such as the current one that character's parents give her shirt with the number 9 (property of the great Mia Hamm, for those who know), references to "Posh" n "Becks", tribute video for WUSA one of the characters plays for a disbelieving friend ("They * have * it ??"), lesbian gags, sports gags and so on. <br /> <br /> The story is about a teenage girl in England who loves Beckham and wants to become a football star. He has a real gift, but two seemingly insurmountable obstacles that must be overcome are the lack of a professional league of women in the UK (hence their fascination with our WUSA) and her parents who are Hindu immigrants embedded in a very old-fashioned way that do not allow daughters, among others to practice contact sports. The girl's family is portrayed as a form of ironic fun, but with great liking - think about My Big Fat Greek Wedding. The girl loves them and respects enough to go through sitcom hell to hide from them the growing football star.
