This surprised me, because Adrian Pasdar often disappointed me, but he kept the perfect balance in this performance, avoiding both farce and pathos, while providing humor and real emotions. Always great Julie Waters is great here, and anyone who has not yet recorded her in Educating Rita in 1983 should immediately rent her (a great movie). The rest of the background characters are well-played, many wonderfully eccentric without going out. This one is funny.
