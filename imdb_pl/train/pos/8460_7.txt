Gundam Wing is a great program. I appreciate that I introduced me to Gundam and anime at all. However, after seeing his predecessors, such as Mobile Suit Gundam, Zeta Gundam, and even G Gundam, I think that Wing is Gundam Lite. <br /> <br /> Characters: Gundam sticks to his characters for a long time to get into difficulties and see. This is not happening in the wing. Heero is the best dog at the beginning, and at the end is the best dog. Personality does not change, growth is never achieved. The best character is Zechs, who is a hero for all purposes for most of the series. But suddenly the series betrays him and turns him into a villain for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> Mecha: The wing has great suit designs. Gundams are super cool, and Epyon is my favorite. I am even considering several OZ clothing designs that match some of Zeon's classic suits. But the designs of sweet suits will not save the series from boring characters. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Finally, Wing has cool battle scenes, though full of animation from recycling, but shallow plot and character development. Pleasant, but not moving like the previous Gundam tours.
