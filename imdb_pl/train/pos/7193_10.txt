God! Zorro was the subject of almost as many films as Tarzan and probably had more or less actors in the title role. <br /> <br /> This series is one of my personal favorites and, as mentioned earlier, is one of the 5 best sound series. Oddly, this is one of the productions that appeared in this 1939 shed. * Until this production in 39 Zorro was really well known as a literary and film character. The film opens with a short note about the history of Mexico's struggle for freedom from the rule of the European monarchy, namely Spain. History encourages comparison with the American revolutionary war. <br /> <br /> The story focuses on the mythical Province of San Mendelito and its "Council." Benito Juarez ** deals with their relationship with the gold mine to the new Republic of Mexico. The gold shipments must reach Mexico City. <br /> <br /> Don Francisco Uncle Diego Vega, says he organized a group of patriots to act as a protective force for gold convoys. A raider from the Don del Oro mob, he puts an "insult" on him and challenges Don Francisco to fight with swords, Don Frasncisco passes. <br /> <br /> Suddenly, a masked cloaked cloaked soldier seems to fight with the sword and, after detecting the "Z" trademark in the face of a bad guy, sends him to the underworld. Don Francisco declares his wounded breath Ramon (William Corson) that Zorro is his nephew from Los Angeles. He also tries to talk about the true identity of Don del Oro, but expires before completing the statement. <br /> <br /> There's a big party for Diego at the Hacienda Don Francisco, where Diego is disappointed by Ramon'sister (also a Don Francisco branch) with his shy act. "A FOP !!", he declares. <br /> <br /> Later Diego and Ramon elude to join the volunteer meeting. When they ask: "who will lead us when Don Francisco is dead?", Ramon declares "Zorro, we are a fighting legion of Zorro!" There is a great battle with the Legion, now covered with gray, with masks and cloaks to protect the Golden Train. Then Zorro seems to be trapped in an artificial avalanche intended for a convoy, when, well, you know the end of the first chapter in <br /> <br /> <br /> Wow! It was a lot of writing for one chapter, but like most other series, the first one is longer and has a lot to do to set up the story. Let us just say that there are still 11 good, well-made, action-packed chapters. <br /> <br /> THE LEGION OF FIGHT ZORRO contains all the elements that contributed to the highest action in the cliff. We have an unknown evil leader who ignites problems between different groups. There are many suspects who really is behind the mask of "Don del Oro". We had soldiers, white renegades, hostile Indians and Legions. <br /> <br /> In short, it's safe to say that in this series there is everything you could want, and then a little bit. And, by the way, they wisely choose that the actors have no influence on the Mexican accents. <br /> <br /> When it comes to what's here, what makes ZFL stand out from the others? What makes it different or unique? Well ........ <br /> <br /> First and foremost, it has a much more elaborate and exciting musical score and highlights the drama and action on the screen. The opening theme even appears in the interpretation of the flamenco guitar in Cantina in the first chapter. This is probably the only time when such a highly specialized innovation appears in a serial soundtrack. <br /> <br /> And yet there is one more feature that really puts the Fighting Legion saga in front of everyone else. This means that the film not only has a heroic musical theme, but also sports lyrics, yes, Legionairres sing! We hear them singing in the first chapters and in several chapters! It really works well and adds the feelings we get from watching. <br /> <br /> When the show first appeared on our local television (around 1955), all the gangs immediately recognized Reed Hadley's voice as belonging to "Captain Braddock of RACKET SQUAD, the television series. Mr. Hadley had a very distinctive, deep voice. *** He managed the role very well. His costume, especially the elongated mask, looked very good and probably very functional. <br /> <br /> There is a small slip. A certain minor anachronism occurs when Benito Juarez (Carleton Young) speaks to the Council of San Mendelito, because Juarez was about 18 years old (1824) and although he was probably the largest single figure in Mexican history, he certainly has not yet achieved such significance. His inclusion in history was likely to have earned the release of JUAREZ Warner Brothers in the year in which Paul Muni starred in the title role. <br /> <br /> It's not only my choice as the top 5 sound series, but also my favorite Zorro movie. <br /> <br /> * We are reminded of a great collection of the best air movies this year, what with GONE WITH THE WIND, MR. SITHER GO TO WASHINGTON, CITADEL, JUAREZ, THE KZZER OZ, MOYS AND MEN, ONE MILION BC , ZENOBIA, WE WANT OUR MUMA, all included in production this year. <br /> <br /> ** Once again, Juarez did not reach any national significance until around 1850, about 25 years later. Also in this story political divisions are called "provinces". In fact, they are called "states." Just as we are called the United States of America, so also south of the border they call their Repubhlic United States of Mexico. <br /> <br /> *** Reed Hadley was visible on some very "A" photos in which his richly toned voice is used with good results. Watch and listen to his narrative in THE HOUSE ON 92. STREET (1945) and GUADALCANAL DIARY (1945).
