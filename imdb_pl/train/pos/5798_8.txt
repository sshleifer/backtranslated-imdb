I saw it for the first time when they showed it during Easter 1993/4 and then they did not think about it too much, I bought it on DVD last summer, when I started to enter Michael Jackson (I liked his music before) and I liked it a lot more senior. It's a good movie, but it will not be the classic movie like "The Sound of Music," "West Side Story," "The Wizard of Oz," etc. Michael Jackson as an actor was good, as were other cast members. There were disturbing scenes, such as Katie's little girl, which was hit by gangster Frankie Lideo, played by Joe Pesci. The scene that scared me when I was younger is when Michael turns into a robot. My favorite song in the movie was Smooth Criminal. I think he was better than Thriller.
