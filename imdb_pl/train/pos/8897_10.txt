Me and my sister rented this movie because we were in the mood for something kitschy and not requiring watching. However, the movie has significantly exceeded my very low expectations. <br /> <br /> It's much more than just presenting the age. She has very real portraits of heroes, and most of the actors perform amazing work. Different stories are baked together with real movie footage from times that give it a unique character. Watching it, I really felt that I cared about what happened to the characters. <br /> <br /> I would also like to convey countless praises of Julia Stiles in her role of Katie, she was great in that way, he stood out! <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to everyone ..
