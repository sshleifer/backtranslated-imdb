Welcome to Collinwood there are many things, but this is not one of the following: <br /> <br /> George Clooney star vehicle Unfunny Un-Original <br /> <br /> And yes, I know the basis of the film is another movie. But when it comes to Hollywood, it can be compared to their most authentic products in this decade - and it's true for me. <br /> <br /> The movie is from the beginning to the end, absolute gas. Here's why. <br /> <br /> There is no bad performance in the film. Funny parts are funny. The frightening parts are sharp. The script includes, not a boring moment of dialogue. The photos are fresh and so beautiful. And it does not fit the Hollywood norm (you'll see what I mean when you see a movie) <br /> <br /> When I was a kid, I remember seeing movie commercials. This film went under radar, not earning much money at the box office, and is not even an iconic classic. The reason why Transformers 2 is seen by average viewers as acceptable is that they are used to watching Transformers 2. If the film is as original and funny as it was pumped out as often as many millions of pieces ** cinema experience would be about much fresher place - <br /> <br /> When "they" say they do not make them like they used to be, "they" did not see Welcome to Collinwood. <br /> <br /> Fun, a mini-masterpiece of a caper comedy that does not compromise. One of my favourite.
