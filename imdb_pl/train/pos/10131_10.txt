In the first episode of Friends, which was aired on September 22, 1994, "The One Where Monica Gets A Roommate," there is a song in which Rachel sits under the window, and Rachel is sitting in the window: you have to hold "... does anyone know the song an artist or song title? It seems to be a great song .... I would like to get a copy of it. Thank you for your help. I am looking for an album / cd, on which it is included, so I can buy it. <br /> <br /> I have shows that are available to buy and I'm happy about this show over and over again. It seemed credible ... thanks to the hours of entertainment you've been providing over the years.
