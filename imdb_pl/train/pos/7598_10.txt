"Lost", "24", "Carnivale", "Desperate Housewifes" ... the list goes on. These and other high-quality shows prove that we are in the midst of a golden age in the history of television. "Lost" is pure genius. Incredible deposits of personal and psychologically profitable stories, highlighted by sublime photos (amazing to use this word, describing a TV program), deadly result, great performances and editing. Anyone who is not addicted to it lacks one of the most important creative expressions on television. It may have problems watching only one episode a week, but the DVD format is really an amazing way to watch it. I hope that they will keep pace with it (as I am sure).
