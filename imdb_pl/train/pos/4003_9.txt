A woman left alone after the death of her husband attracts a friend and a handy son. In a slightly twisted story, a woman begins to sleep with a handy man, trying to revive. Twisted part? The handy man is also the exclusive interest of his daughter. <br /> <br /> As if it was not strange enough, my mother manages to fall on this man, and when her daughter finds out, she blames not only her dysfunctional relationship, but also her pathetic life on her poor mother. <br /> <br /> Although you can think wrong about this woman, the truth is that the film manages to present it in a positive light. Beautifully played by Anne Reid, the character has a dimension and presents great emotions. <br /> <br /> A really genius performance and a nice movie. <br /> <br /> 8/10
