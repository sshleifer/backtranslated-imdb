In addition to the great METROPOLIS movie, it is the oldest clean science-fiction movie. Although sometimes the video is a little informative, and the acting can be a bit broad, it's a great movie for two reasons. First of all, it is extremely original in terms of both style and content. Even in the 21st century, there are no films about which I think they are similar. Secondly, in those days special effects were absolutely unbelievable - using matte pictures, models and huge casts to create amazing scenes of both the post-apocalyptic world and the vast city of tomorrow. Of course, you can sit down and knock on the movie because, according to today's standards, the effects are just that. But you must appreciate that it was a state of the art when the film appeared in 1936 and had to really amaze viewers. In many respects, the sets look very similar to the "modern cities" presented at the WORLD FAIR in 1939. <br /> <br /> I think the movie is also interesting because it seems to be torn by the question "are people really THAT stupid or are we destined for size? "The end result seems to be a bit of both! What a truth! <br /> <br /> Last note: I've seen it twice on TV and recently on video. All three times better sound and print quality - especially sound. If it's available on DVD, I hope it's much cleaner and will provide optional subtitles. Because the sound on the film was still cutting out, I would really appreciate it!
