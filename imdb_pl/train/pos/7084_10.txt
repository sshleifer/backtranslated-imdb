I can not decide if it's one of my favorite movies. It's a good thriller and it has an emotional core, but I still can not decide. I really liked it. This is the first Terry Gilliam movie that I saw. My first impression? I was involved until the very end and it is not so complicated (be confusing). <br /> <br /> The movie is set in the future. The man James Cole (Bruce Willis) is sent from the future to get some information from the past (specifically in 1996). The virus killed 5 billion people. Is sent from the future to get some information on this topic. The psychiatrist Kathryn Railly is also involved. The story of love is beautifully presented and you can really feel the longing for this love and longing for regular life. Loose ends are connected in a very interesting way towards the end. <br /> <br /> In this movie I liked the fact that, unlike other post-apocalyptic films, the film did not want to give boring social commentary and instead I focused on this one guy and his longing for regular life. "You want to see the ocean, be with it" is a particularly moving line in this film. Chooses focus on the tension and confusion in the person's mind. Therefore, this is not exactly a post-apocalyptic movie, but instead it can be described as a romantic sci-fi film with themes that range from time travel to obscure reality and so on. This makes this film a special movie of the 90s. The complex story flows smoothly without adding too many characters. <br /> <br /> The performances are quite good. Bruce will surprise me here because he did not play an ordinary tough guy, but he gave a good performance to a confused man who is in love. His desperation in some sequences is beautifully presented. I need to check his other films. Wonderful Madeleine Stowe is a real treat. EVER since I saw this movie, I became so obsessed with it. She gave a great performance to a woman who sympathizes with her patient and finally falls in love with him. Brad Pitt is a real surprise because of the character of a crazy man named Jeffrey Goines. His Oscar-nominated spectacle is quite surprising given that there are not many critics who have nice words for him. <br /> <br /> The end is quite cool and this is another reason to watch the movie. Length or complexity is not such a big problem because this movie is moving fast and there are enough incidents to interest people. And every incident in this movie matters and nothing is unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Good thriller 10/10
