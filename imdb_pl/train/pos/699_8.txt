I saw the nightmare of Insomniac, which was not long ago and I must admit that he was really good. If you're a fan of Dominica Monaghana, you'll love it. A movie with a hole takes place in his mind - does it? Acting of all the others is a bit hasty and wobbly, and some scenes can be cut out, but in the end they succeed. The DVD accessories are as great as the movie, if not bigger, for House fans. He has a lot of honest moments from the set, results and a great interview with the director. Anyone who has made an independent film, will happily watch Tess (director), House and everyone else on a very small, personal plan, trying to get out of this little monstrous movie. It was quite nice and I'm happy that I have it in my collection.
