This movie was a really great movie about something that concerns us all. I know that I've come across this many times. Thank God Will Smith jumped on the social issue of text messages while driving. People, do not do this. An hour and forty-five minutes is not enough time for this matter. Personally, I wanted to throw away my mobile phone after the film. I was glad to see other people in the theater who saw the news and dropped off the phones with empty popcorn bags. I decided to turn off all text messages on my phone and I would encourage others to do the same. If you care about your family, let them see this important message about the public service regarding text messages while driving or they could kill seven people. Thank you for showing us the way.
