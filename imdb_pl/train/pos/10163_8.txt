It was a good story ... it had a good pace and all characters were developing well. <br /> <br /> I've watched a lot of movies in the last two weeks and it must have been the best I've seen in two weeks. <br /> <br /> However, Jason Bigg's character was the best. <br /> <br /> Although he was small, he was cleverly made from the very beginning. /> <br /> It may be a romantic comedy, and I do not like the most, but overall writing, directing, making, sound, design in all capacities were really pretty cool. <br /> <br /> This movie has won quite a high position among all the films I have recently seen - and the rest was a big budget or better publicized. <br /> <br /> Good job in writing.
