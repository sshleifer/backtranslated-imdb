All reviewers on this site have to say that this movie is worth seeing. So it was created in 1972. The fashion in the film was exactly the same as in those days. People who have not studied culture for decades would think that this movie is a cheese ball. Compared with the modern series, "Left Behind" (which was created for our time), it looks cheezy. However, the only joyous part of the film is fashion, which was again over 30 years in the past. BUT. The message sent in this video is very powerful and carefully preserved. There is so much to say, but I refuse. (for fear of corruption) So come out and see this movie! If you do not like the message you send, you have problems that need attention!
