Like The Grinch Stole Christmas, I immediately stole my heart and became my favorite movie almost from the first watch. Now eight page views later have the same impact on me as I did the first time I saw it. <br /> <br /> Screenwriters Jeffery Price and Peter S. Seaman with Who Framed Roger Rabbit fame are doing a fantastic job of adapting Grinch's story to the screen. Ron Howard's direction led the story to a full life, and the typical energy performance of Jim Carrey as The Grinch steals the show. <br /> <br /> Some film critics have argued that this is not a true story with the spirit or principles. After reading the original story, I must say that I can not agree. The same film speaks of Christmas and its true meaning as an original story. Indeed, it increases the influence of history, making it more personal, showing us how and why Grinch became who he was. <br /> <br /> * MILD SPOILERS * (They probably will not destroy your movie ... but if you have not seen it yet and you are one of those who want to know the story about NIC until you see it, skip the next two paragraphs. ) <br /> <br /> I think almost everyone can relate to Grinch's horrible experiences at school. I think that everyone, at one time or another, was unpopular at school, who was always elected. I know I was ... and that's why I personally had so much sympathy for The Grinch and what he went through. <br /> <br /> And naive idealism Cindy Lou Who, believing that no one can be angry, was the heart of tearing. When everyone else turned away from Grinch in fear and ignorance, Cindy Lou was determined to become his friend. If only everyone could have such an attitude. <br /> <br /> In fact, I think the only thing that could make a movie a little better would be to further soften humor and adult content. It was quite restrained, but each of this adult humor (as when The Grinch slammed his nose for the first time in the neck of Martha May Whovier) simply does not fit into that story. <br /> <br /> This is good in your way of being a Christmas classic, taking a well-deserved place next to Chuck Jones's book and cartoon as a compulsory visit every Christmas season.
