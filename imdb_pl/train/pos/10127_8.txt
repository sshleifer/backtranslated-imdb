That was the beginning of it all! It's true that it's not friends at its best, but it was the pilot of the series, let's not forget and it's not a bad idea. We present the gang and Central Perk, where our history begins. Even from this first episode, we have a sign of Ross-Rachel's relationship that will come in the next ten years when Ross says, "I want to get married again," and Rachel gets in a wedding dress ... probably not intended as it was then, when the writers went on the Monica-Joey relationship, but now it fits nicely when you look back. Something else ... in this episode Rachel is introduced to Chandler as if they had never met before, but in later episodes the so-called "flashbacks" are denied because they both met three times. Nevertheless, the point is to make it a good start to a great show. This episode may not be the usual Friends we're used to, with the cast still a bit inexperienced, but for the next few episodes we see why the show became what it was! Do not stop watching, the first season is great !!
