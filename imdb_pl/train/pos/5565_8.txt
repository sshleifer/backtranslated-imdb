I'm a C & C fan, going back to their records and I liked the movie, but at some point in the mid-1980s on cable TV in San Jose, California, it was aired with an alternative storyline that destroyed the entire movie. All marijuana references have been replaced by "diamonds". The bag that "Red" drops to Chong, has diamonds in it instead of marijuana, but the conversation still remains the same ("... is worth ~ 3000 USD / pound"). There is also a section in which alien clips on the ship were added, watching C & C and talking to each other about getting diamonds. At the end, instead of "cosmic coke", it's something else. I am not sure who created this version, but it was horrible and obvious that they tried to make it a friendly family / child. It would be better if this network did not emit it at all.
