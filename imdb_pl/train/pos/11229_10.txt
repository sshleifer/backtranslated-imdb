With the number of actors they work on, they have a wide range of casts. A nice CGI spaceship in places, but their green screen needs some work. Anyone who has heard about Adobe After Effects 7 should buy it to make its keying better. <br /> <br /> Stories are well thought out, including lots of trek elements to keep it in the right context. BUT the idea of ​​kissing two guys makes me continue the episode. I am not homophobic, but I can not help that I do not find men kissing entertainment (do not worry about women). In any case ... For a series of fans are good things. With a slight improvement on the green screen, brush mode and some guiding ratings, this series is stunning. In any case, I recommend this series that has ever used TNG and DS9.
