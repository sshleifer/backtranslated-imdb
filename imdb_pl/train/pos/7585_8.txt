It's a strange, cerebral, surreal, esoteric movie. If there is such a thing as an "intellectual horror film" cinema, this movie is just that. I started to be scared and I would like someone else to watch this with me and barely have a story! I will have to see the movie again before I feel that I really understand it. If you're a person who likes "My Dinner With Andre" and Godard's movies, or if you're doing a lot of mind-altering drugs, you'll probably like this movie. Wow.
