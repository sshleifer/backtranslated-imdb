I just watched MURDER IN THE FRIDGES in the newly released Universal Pre-Code set and was amazed at how much I liked the vehicle at the end. Most of the other commentators described this story, the murder mystery in the musical, but I wanted to add some additional comments. Brisson and Carlisle are relatively bland compared to the majority of smaller players, and none of them seems to have the right voice for what they sing (Carlisle is a trained opera singer, Brisson is a bit unsteady on some of his tall and low notes). Great Victor McLaglen and Jack Oakie are doing well, with a great sense of time that keeps the ball moving between the music numbers. Yes, Lucille Ball and Ann Sheridan are Vanity's girls, but let's not forget about the excellent jazz singer Ernestine Anderson in the issue of "Ebony Rhapsody". Gail Patrick makes one of his early performances, sounding a bit like Eve Arden; Patrick became the executive producer of the television series Perry Mason. Then there's Jessie Ralph as a wardrobe lover - you'll see her also with David COPPERFIELDA (as Aunt Peggy) and THE BANK DICK. The music is very good - Brisson introduces the standard "Cocktails for two" in two different scenes; "Sweet Marijuana" with barely clothed pebbles in the background (blood dripping on the white skin of the choir was wonderfully cool); "Ebony Rhapsody" with the Duke Ellington's Orchestra and a bunch of beautiful dancers, both black and white, mixing them. And I believe that this is one of the first early musicals in which there is such a mix - and the costumes leave nothing to the imagination.
