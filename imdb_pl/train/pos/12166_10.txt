A very strange and fascinating movie. It is a very awkward and badly wounded man who tries to manage his life as a fundraiser / door-to-door seller. The director was able to capture a very disturbing tone that has served this story well. Original and disturbing, at the same time finding a lot of humor in the pain accompanying life. In the test center is a sequence that really stands out and makes me laugh out loud, which is not as frequent as I should. One of the most memorable movies that I've seen for a long time. He has not gone away from me and I am waiting for Bronstein's future efforts. Fantastic performances all around. The simple line "I really appreciate it". is now iconic for me.
