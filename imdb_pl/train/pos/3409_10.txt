North Africa in the 1930s. A beautiful woman looking for the meaning of her life and a handsome monk Trappista fleeing the crisis of faith comes to a small Arab town on the edge of the Sahara. They will meet and the passions will be touched, but even the Sand Seer does not know whether they will find happiness or sadness here, in the GARDEN ALLAH. <br /> <br /> The plot is clear, but the movie is still great fun and a beautiful look. Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer are a pair of great screens. It's just wonderful, and Boyer gives the most effective, understated results, allowing his sensitive face to do a lot for him. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast is excellent: Basil Rathbone, sympathetic as the count who loves the desert; Joseph Schildkraut as a friendly, talkative guide (the whole "Arabic" that he and others say in the film is pure gibberish); Lucile Watson as a gentle Mother Superior; Alan Marshal as an honorary young French officer; Tilly Losch as a dangerous dancer; Henry Brandon as a comic porter; John Carradine as the mysterious Sand Diviner; and the wonderful Sir C. Aubrey Smith as a wise old priest. <br /> <br /> The film's heroes recognize Helen Jerome Eddy as a nun; Marcia Mae Jones and Bonita Granville (peeking over the shoulder of the nun) as a girl from the monastery; skinny Nigel De Brulier as a lector of the monastery; and Ferdinand Gottschalk as a hotel receptionist, all unrestricted. <br /> <br /> Colorful movies from the 1930s are rare and beautiful, and this film is no exception - the pictures are as colorful as the desert itself. GARDEN ALLAHA was the first Technicolor movie that was filmed on site. Yuma in Arizona gave the filmmakers all the sand dunes they could desire, but contaminated drinking water and 135-degree heat soon caused the company's rebellion. When everyday haste showed that Boyer's face had burned a bright red tomato, producer David O. Selznick finally gave up. The rest of the movie was shot on the Hollywood sound stage.
