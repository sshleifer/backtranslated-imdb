I gave him 10, because everyone else liked it and it would be ridiculous. The reason I am disturbing you is to add personal observation to Castle's work. <br /> <br /> I saw "Homicidal" and "The Tingler" (version with an ingenious sequence of colors in which everything except blood is in black and white) several times and "The House On Haunted Hill" many times. <br /> <br /> Even I am not old enough to see them when Castle was able to show his showmanship tricks, so I can appreciate them for their merits. And although most pass it as a secondary, schlocky, hammy, etc., I believe that they do him a favor. <br /> <br /> The final sequence of "Homicidal" is ESPECIALLY shocking and works today - and the assumption of "The Tingler" while stupid was very original. <br /> <br /> But "The House On Haunted Hill" was TRIUMPH. Using the house of Frank Lloyd Wright as his outside, great Vincent Price and a solid cast, as well as a good result and production value - when I saw him for the first time at a full late evening screening at the end of the sixties, it caused a reaction from the audience I have not seen earlier and have not seen since then. <br /> <br /> It was something in which the heroine is alone in the basement (if you have not seen the movie, stop reading NOW) and we are waiting to hear the hero on the other side of the wall. <br /> <br /> In the absence of a telegraph for what is coming, the camera slowly moves away, forcing AUDIENCE to shift its gaze to ... I say no more (my spoof statement applies only to THIS film). <br /> <br /> The point is that I think this trick was DELIBERATE - not accidental - and when it happened, THE ENTIRE AUDIENCE WONDERED (including most men!) The audience took care of calming down THEN MINUTES. <br /> <br /> Now THIS is better filming. An extravagant showman he could be, but "House" and the other two films I mentioned were GOOD FILMS. Castle might not have been Hitchcock, but he was not Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> It is easy to concentrate on someone's idiosyncrasies and forget to examine their TALENT. So I hope that this document confirmed it. I look forward to it.
