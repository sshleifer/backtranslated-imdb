Who would have thought that such a little known movie can be so haunted and moving? I am really impressed. It is a pity that more people have not seen it. I loved, as always, the score of Hans Zimmer. And what is the directorial debut of Bernard Rose! I wonder, however, if I should call it a horror film. One can easily argue that it is also fantasy or drama. Well, regardless, I love this interpretative potential. Everything and everyone in Anne's dreams (played by Charlotte Burke) represent the real conflict in her life ... the house itself, the tree, Mark, the lighthouse, etc. It's all the details that make the film so good for repetitive reviews. I hope that I will come across another small movie full of emotions and psychological significance, like this some time.
