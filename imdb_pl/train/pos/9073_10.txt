My wife and I took our 13-year-old son to see this movie and we were delighted with this fun movie. He has an additional appeal to boys and men who remember their childhood, but even women like the movie, especially the chorus of Hallie Kate Eisenberg: "Boys are so weird." It's refreshing to watch a movie that unknowingly shows that boys and girls really differ emotionally and socially. Boys really do such weird things and usually survive to tell a story and scare stupid mothers! The film pleased us so much that my son and 11-year-old friend, me and my daughters, a 23-year-old boy, went to see the movie the next day for boys. For the second time we had even more fun and everyone loved it. It is clean and delightfully preserved by a kindergarten cast reminiscent of the television classic "Freaks and Geeks". We all feel that it will become a sleepy hit, not like "Freaks & Geeks", which did not survive the first season, but sold out its DVD release. See it especially if you have boys, and you'll find that it stimulates conversation about fun and security! Girls will love it because of the possibilities offered by the saying: "Boys are so weird!" Do not miss this ...
