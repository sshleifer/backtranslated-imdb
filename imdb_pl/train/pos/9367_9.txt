This is not often the movie can literally make the whole audience laugh, and five minutes later fill the eyes with tears. Many films try to do it, but few can exert that film's emotional impact. Adam Sandler practically drags you through his hot and often violent explosions, but also makes you laugh when the shadow of his past is not drawn. I'm not going to ruin anything, but there is one scene that should have tearing eyes and twitching. Even the most macho men would have to be heartless bastards not to feel something while watching this movie. Don Cheadle gives another great performance, but he is invented by Sandler. Liv Tyler and Jada Pinkett Smith give solid performances, but nothing in the line of the two main roles. Sandler's humor is still present, which in fact saved the film from depression. There are a few laughs, but do not think that you will stay there long because it becomes serious again without much warning. <br /> <br /> I can go on and talk about how well this film only got about every emotion that the human body contains, but I will shorten it. I feel that you do not have to say anything more. Do yourself a favor and take some time to watch this movie. Even if you have to wait until it comes out on DVD, it's 100% worth the time. A deeply moving film that will surely cause tears in your eyes and a smile on your face ... unless of course ... you are a soul without a heart.
