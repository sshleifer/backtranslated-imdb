According to the G-Men tradition, The House On 92nd Street, The Street With No Name, now the FBI Story is one of those carefully supervised films that showed the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the best possible light. While his 48-year-old director J. Edgar Hoover was alive, he would not be shown in any other light. <br /> <br /> The book of Don Whitehead, on which this film is based, is a simple office story from the foundation in 1907 until approximately the time of The FBI Story. Sometimes it's important to remember that there was the FBI before being led by J. Edgar Hoover. Part of this time is also described in the movie. <br/> <br /> Warner Brothers did not create a documentary to give the FBI the body and blood of fictional character John "Chip" Hardesty. Hardesty, played by James Stewart, is an FBI career that graduated from law school and instead of going into practice, he started working at the office in the early 1920s. <br /> <br /> In real life, the Presidium was led by William J. Private Detection Agency Burns of the Burns. In fact, it was a blatantly political operation, as shown in the film. Burns was at the periphery of Harding's administration scandals. When Hoover was called in 1924. To introduce professional law enforcement techniques and rigorous standards of competence, he did just that. <br /> <br /> Through the Hardesty family, which is Stewart and wife of Vera Miles, we see the history of the FBI. In addition, we see a lot of their personal family history that is completely integrated into the history of the FBI. Stewart and Miles are probably the entire American couple. We follow the FBI in some of the cases in which Stewart is involved, arresting members of the Ku Klux Klan, plot to murder the oil-rich Indians, overthrow the notorious criminals of the 1930s, their involvement in stopping Nazi supporters during World War II and espionage against the communists cold war. <br /> <br /> There is a kind of prologue in which Stewart tells the class at the FBI Academy before going into the history of the office, which intertwines with his own. This is connected with a bomb placed on the airline by a son who bought a lot of life insurance for his mother before the flight. Nick Adams will give you the creeper as the perpetrator, and the story is unfortunately valid. <br /> <br /> Of course, if the history of the FBI were written and produced today, it would reflect something different and not so much American. Even so, the FBI has a story to tell and it is not at all negative. <br /> <br /> The history of the FBI is not one of Jimmy Stewart's best movies, but this is the first movie I've seen with my favorite actor in it, so she has a special liking for me. If the whole FBI was created by Jimmy Stewarts, I would feel better about it. There is also a good performance by Murray Hamilton as his friend and agent who died in a shooting from Baby Face Nelson. <br /> <br /> Vera Miles not only married Stewart, but actually married the FBI as a movie shows. It is dated mainly, but still has a good and interesting story to tell.
