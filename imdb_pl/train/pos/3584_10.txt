My name is Heather and I am the girl that this movie was based on. I want to thank everyone who watched this movie and they liked it. as raw and harsh as some of the things in this movie, it really did not come close to describing how bad things really were. not to mention the impact of everything on my mother and younger sister. Thank you again for the wonderful comments that everyone had, I really appreciate them. <br /> <br /> Hey everyone! <br /> <br /> This is Heather's mom. It's hard to believe that so many years have passed since the creation of this film. It's even harder to believe that people were still watching it a year ago. For each of you who have had the same or similar situation, please know that there are people in cyberspace who understand how you feel. Our thoughts and prayers are with each one of you.
