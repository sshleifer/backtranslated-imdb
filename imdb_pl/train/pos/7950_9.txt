First of all, I loved the music of Bruce Broughton, very lyrical and only this added to the charm of the film. The best aspect of the film was three animals, extremely loudly spoken by Michael J. Fox, Sally Field and the late Don Ameche. While Fox has the funniest lines, Ameche plays a rather deliberate, engaging character (voice of reason), and Field adds a joke to a character who is always seen as an opportunity. People were not so addictive, and sometimes the movie dragged on, but that's my only complaint. This is one beautiful looking movie with beautiful shots from Canada. Although the film itself is quite long, there is never a seriously boring moment, and this is beneficial thanks to the voice work and well-written script. All in all a charming and perhaps an underestimated movie, from 9/10 from me. Bethany Cox.
