Ossessione is in a very bad condition, but is now undergoing a full renovation at the Digital Film Lab in Copenhagen. The material used is the "2nd generation Master" originally from print, which Visconti managed to hide from the fascists. It was scanned in Spirit 4K (as 2K RGB data) and then processed using the DaVinci Revival restoration software. Then the rest is physical work and we do not anticipate completion before early spring. Next year should be available on DVD and, hopefully, released on HD DVD. This film is beautiful and we hope that many generations will enjoy the reconstruction effort.
