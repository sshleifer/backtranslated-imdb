When I reach the "back" of 35, I am more and more shaking my head in the face of sex madness, teenagers who today have an influence on drugs. It was great to remind me that it was just as crazy for me as it is today. This movie drives this point home. If you're a fan of the late 70's, you'll love this movie. From KISS posters to Angel's concert in this movie! <br /> <br /> Watch out for the young Laura Dern. Why did not they have more Runaways songs that I would never know? <br /> <br /> I had a problem with the character of Randy Quaid destroying a 16-year-old girl. During his absence, she and her friends have a party that destroys the guy's house. Cops come in and there is no mention of drinking minors and how these children got into these things. <br /> <br /> Foxes belongs to Over the Edge, Fast Times, Dazed & Confused and Kids as one of the scariest youthful films. <br /> <br /> I say: buy and watch it with your children and talk about all this.
