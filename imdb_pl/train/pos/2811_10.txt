Silverlake Life, a view from this place, is an absolutely stunning movie about AIDS and a homosexual love relationship. Some images are really difficult to make, especially when someone is gay or afraid of AIDS, and probably for any sensitive person who is watching it. It is not easy to make a film about such a terrible disease and its consequences not only one, but two people. This film teaches you how to take care of each other in such difficult times, but it never becomes too morbid, it still shows life anytime, reminding you that beyond theater or peace life goes on, no matter what destiny people can be. The heroes are incredibly endearing while we observe their intimacy in the shots that never go beyond the very strict limits, never revealing anything too private or offensive. Children certainly should not watch this movie, but adults, regardless of whether they are dealing with such situations or not, should do so and will not regret the tears that pour out.
