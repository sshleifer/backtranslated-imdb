The summary of this film explains what to expect. This is a very good thriller. Well shot. It is hard to believe that it was the directorial debut of Bill Paxton, although some of the photos look EXACTLY like a storyboard version. <br /> <br /> Still, there are several shots that really look great and show Paxton's real imagination. <br /> <br /> It's a solid story with a few great twists at the end, a few of them, all credible, all fun, and most importantly, obscured enough to make them real turns of action. <br /> <br /> Children in the film are doing great too. I'm usually afraid of movies with children in the main roles, because they all come down too often, like Nickelodeon rejects, but both of them do well. <br /> <br /> This movie is not bloody. This is not terrible. But it is very, very scary.
