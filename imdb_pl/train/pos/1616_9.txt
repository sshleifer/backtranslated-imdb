Delirious romantic comedy with intertwined threads that blend beautifully with actors who reflect each other with precise comical timing, a feat that is beautiful. When an unbridled fianc√©e Cher asks her to help him make peace with his distant, moody younger brother, no one could dream of the consequences that follow. Opera symbols, confessions of the Catholic Church, bites of love and falling snow ... "Moonstruck" is timeless and smooth. The rhythm of the picture takes about 15 minutes (the early sequence with the grandfather and his dogs in the cemetery is a bit rough, and the next scene with Cosmo and an elderly man at the gate, which seems dull), but the mosaic of the story is interspersed with agile skills, and the wavering tone of the film and the kooky spirit is contagious. *** 1/2 from ****
