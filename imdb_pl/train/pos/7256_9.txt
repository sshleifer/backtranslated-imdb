I saw how a long day dies, when he first appeared in the cinema, I thought that the film gave a good point of view to the soldiers, gave a realistic description of people at war. The plot moves at a nice pace, showing a group of people behind the enemy lines and trying to return to their lines with a hostile prisoner. Characters are well-developed and reliable. <br /> <br /> David Hemmings is a good actor and plays the main role with conviction, like Alan Dobie (as Helmut German) I was surprised that I was not able to find this movie on VHS or DVD and I feel that it has become a forgotten movie that is sad because it's better than many other war movies I've seen.
