A beautiful postcard from New York. What I liked best was the ability to watch it with the whole family, and not to wait for a stupid joke from the toilet. It never was like that. My teenagers liked it too. My son Natasha Henstridge and my daughter Michael Vartan. My wife and I commented that we do not remember when we were able to sit with the children for the last time and EVERYTHING liked something. This movie told a story that seemed comfortable, but not old or done. The ending came with a surprise that we all liked. If you're not just a cynical person and you want to let history unfold, it's for you. As a guy, it takes a long time to get interested in romantic films, and he did it. I recommend and we need more of these movies to watch.
