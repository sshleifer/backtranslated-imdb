I remember seeing this movie shown a few years ago on Lifetime TV and I thought it was an interesting story. A few years later I see it again and fall in love with this film. The story of the film is fascinating in itself. The cast makes it much more attractive. Meryl Streep is definitely at the top of his game in this photo. Nail manners, accent and even the look of Mrs Chamberlain. It shows pain, hurt, surprise and anger that Linda had to endure, so it's hard to remember that it is NOT Linda. In my opinion, this performance Meryl was better than her Oscar-winning phrase in "Sophie's Choice" and he should have won her third Oscar. Neill himself is perfect as Michael Chamberlain, and for some surprising reason he has not been recognized by the Academy at least with the nomination. In total, this film receives only ONE Oscar (Streep for the best actress). However, he received several Australian Oscars and nominations. <br /> <br /> Definitely the best movie: tells a great story to get great performances from the entire cast.
