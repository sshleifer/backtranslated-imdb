I LOVE Doodlebops. My son has been watching them for over a year. Last year we went to the Doodlebops concert as well as yesterday's concert (Connecticut). He loves them. The bubbles do not teach the alphabet or numbers, but who cares? are you serious? TV should not teach children about numbers or the alphabet. parents should. Stop. Doodlebops can actually sing. Deedee has a beautiful voice, and at the concert it can be said that all 3 have nice voices and do NOT sing lips. Imagine that they are dancing, jumping and singing. they have talent, children love them, and even enjoy watching the program. This program is by far the best show for children on TV. And a rock band for children. How is it amazing? Why do people say that Chad (Rooney) is gay? how did you hear that? Whether it is or not, it's amazing! Leave him alone. It's not like he or anyone else promotes homosexuality for our children!
