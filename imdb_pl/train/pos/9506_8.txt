A sober, reflective piece, a small miniature that thrives in a great human picture sequence that goes beyond the mere dramatization of the screen. This quiet tale will delight you - if you do not have too many problems with different Spanish accents, from Mexican to Peruvian, and more authentic use of the Iberian Peninsula by Marisa Paredes! Garcíadi has made a perfect adaptation of the novel: even Grand Master García Márquez should be proud of his great work. And hats off to Arturo Ripstein, who skillfully divided his whole effort into a jewel, ruby ​​and so refined, so elegant, so sensitive, so moving ..... <br /> <br /> El Coronel - Fernando Luján - waiting for his retirement, while he still lives in his dilapidated wood living deep in the Colombian jungle (but filmed elsewhere, NOT in Colombia) with his fighting dick and wife (in that order?). And that's all. <br /> <br /> But, oh, so much more ... This movie is a rhapsody. <br /> <br /> I have to see this poetic little piece again as soon as possible. Worth 8 points out of 10, which is very high in my scale. <br /> <br /> This is not a light commercial Hollywood game.
