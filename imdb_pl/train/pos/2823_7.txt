MGM was not sure how to sell Garbo when she came to Hollywood for the first time. Mayer believed her very much, and her appearance in "Torrent" justified it. She did not speak a word of English, so she had to have a hard time working, and Ricardo Cortez did not make it easy. <br /> <br /> The stream of the title is the Juscar River, which winds through a sleepy little village in Spain. Leonora (Greta Garbo) hopes that one day her voice will bring great wealth and happiness to her struggling parents. Leonora and Don Rafael (Ricardo Cortez) are in love, but he is under the protection of his mother and can not persuade her to consent to his marriage. In the meantime, Dona Brull (Martha Mattox) evicted Leonora's parents from their home and sent Leonora to Paris in the hope that they would give her a chance for further vocal career. Leonora sends a message to Rafael, encouraging him to remember his promise and go with her. His mother is enraged and forbids him to go - of course he stuck to her request. <br /> <br /> Years are passing. Leonora has a new identity - she became La Brunna, the Paris Opera's toast. Rafael turned out to be what his mother wanted - he runs to the office and seeks a "safe" young girl, Remedios (Gertrude Olmstead), who is the heiress of the "pig". Mack Swain plays his father. Leonora decides to visit her old house and I agree - why she did not help her leave the house. Her mother still lives in a family home, working as skivvy and taking laundry. Leonora and Rafael meet, but Leonora is full of ridicule. Garbo is so charmingly beautiful, it's hard to believe he could be happy with Remedios. <br /> <br /> The dam bursts and the city floods the city. Leonora's house is on the way of the raging river, but when Rafael tries to save her, she discovers that she is quite safe. Then they light up their romance. The film has a "horizontal" love scene, very similar to that of "Body and the devil". <br /> <br /> Dona Brull spreads rumors about how Leonora really got her wealth, and her mother Leonory believes in her and tells Loren that she should go. Rafael meets Leonora just before the start of the tour in America. He intends to go with her again, but he suspends her again. She spends so much time listening to other people who destroy her reputation - "what she will do for you, but pulls you". The irony is that she has just given him the highest government job if he comes with her. They meet again, many years later - it is as fresh and alive as ever - it looks older than its years, inclined by mediocrity. <br /> <br /> Certainly a good movie with a positive message to imitate your heart. <br /> <br /> Lucien Littlefield does a good job as Cupido, a hairdresser and an old and faithful friend of Leonora. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it.
