Initially GOJOE get used to it a little, but the end result is very satisfying. The story of a murderous samurai who wants to be redeemed by opposing an effeminate but dangerous samurai is worth more than a watch. There are many things at stake here, from physical survival to successful salvation. The film may initially seem somewhat similar to another animated Samurai movie, but soon it enters a more mature / adult territory. <br /> <br /> Not to be missed. GOJOE is one of the better samurai films that will appear in Kurosawa. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 <br /> <br /> (go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review of the movie and reviews of other foreign films)
