"Rich in Love" is a piece of the film that takes the viewer into a bizarre family of Charleston, SC. Very romantic, beautifully made, well written and preserved, "RIL" is washing you like a summer breeze, because her endless meanders breathe life into heroes so that after the movie you will feel like an old family friend. > <br /> A wonderfully made film directed by the director of "Running Miss Daisy", "RIL", is a bit dark "sleeping", which will appeal to a mature audience.
