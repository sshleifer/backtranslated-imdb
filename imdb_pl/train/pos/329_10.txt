Of all versions of Odyssey (or any Greek mythological history in this matter), in my opinion it is the best of them all. Almost in line with the original story - with minor deviations and omissions, eg the lack of Scylla and Charybdis and the fact that Eumae the Swineherd recognizes Odysseus disguised in his hut - realistic acting and authentic scenery and costumes contribute to the fact that it is truly unforgettable a masterpiece, not some Hollywood B-flick with a sword and sandal. Regardless of the fact that the dialogue and subtitles are entirely in Italian, if someone knows the story, he can still create revelations about what's going on and what the actors say (provided you have a good Odyssey on the palm of your hand). At least I did it so much that it inspired me to learn Italian to appreciate the film even more.
