Hot Millions is a great movie in every respect. A funny, unconventional story with the wonderful performances of the four best professionals who have ever worked in the industry. Peter Ustinov is brilliant as always, and Maggie Smith --- definitely one of the greatest actresses of all time --- is a total delight. Karl Malden and Bob Newhart complete the cast and are also excellent. If you want a movie that has an excellent casting, that's it. The way these people work with each other in a natural and trouble-free way, creating lots of laughter and fun moments is impressive. Peter Ustinov was a genius with a great sense of humor and this is one of his most memorable performances. Direction, photography and assembly are also prime, and this is a great time capsule in London in the 1960s. It is definitely on my comprehensive list of favorites.
