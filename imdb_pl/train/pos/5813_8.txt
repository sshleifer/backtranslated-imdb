This movie is great. <br /> <br /> Now I like it when my films are heavy in history and dialogue, but from time to time something like Moonwalker appears and it is possible to see, despite numerous disadvantages. <Br /> <br /> This movie is nothing more than a funny advertisement for Michael Jackson. Starting with a sick video set to "Man in the Mirror", which lists his achievements, as well as fragments of his career, goes through life, and then breaks into a really, very funny segment that works like a funny video for the song "Bad" and "Speed ​​Demon", tracking the adventures of MJ, who runs from maniac fans of time-lapse movement, and finally dancing in a rabbit costume. The detention movement is not as bad as some people think. It is possible. <br /> <br /> Then we see a great video for 'Leave me alone' and straight into the main movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot is ridiculous. Very funny. We see Michael leave the building and then he is shot by thousands of soldiers. Then we found a flashback, showing MJ and three children who came across an underground bed. "Mr. Big" (Joe Pesci) is a wicked villain who has a plan that every child in the world will become addicted to "drugs" (no details) at an early age. MJ and the little girl with whom she is will be caught and then hunted ... yada yada yada. The plot is not really an important part. We get two very cool sequences in which MJ turns into a car, then a robot-spaceship and of course an amazing sequence of "Smooth Criminal". <br /> <br /> It's a movie, but it's fantastic for anyone who likes MJ. He has most of his biggest hits and some cool little bits and some pretty good special effects (especially the Robot / Spaceship sequence). It's worth it, especially if you can pick it up for about a quid on eBay. Thanks to this, children will be silent for a few hours, as well as the majority of 20-year-old children who have been released for the first time.
