After watching the rather spooky World War I spy thriller Madam Lili (1969) with Julie Andrews on television in the afternoon, I suddenly thought I'd seen a much better World War I spy thriller. I only remember that it was produced by Dino De Laurentis. A short IMDB review was enough to find Fraulein the Doctor. When I recognized the title, the memories returned. It is, for its time, quite well-developed history revolving around real events such as the death of Kitchener and German offensives in 1918. She also has a spy woman who is much more reliable than Julie Andrews! As in the case of other reviewers, the first and strongest memories were well-produced battle scenes as well as men and horses in gas masks. If you're interested in war movies, especially WW1, this is a movie worth seeing if you have the opportunity.
