Some of the acting was a bit suspicious. I remember that the asshole of Alexander Walker (critic of Evening Standard, yes, OK, he's dead now) fell into a frenzy about the film saying it was a disgrace depicting NI protesters as murderers. Now, for all NI protesters, this movie was loosely based on Shankill butchers (who were loyalists) and who traveled Belfast in the '70s. Believe me, they were not called butchers for nothing. my main moan about this movie is that it does not show any ray of light or hope, it's all annihilation and darkness, I mean, if the little girl had to die at the end. It may sound trivial, but there may have been a lack of tact that not all Prods & tiags are bad or totally good.
