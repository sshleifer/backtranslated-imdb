Judy Davis tells us why she is one of the most respected and beloved actresses in Australia - her portrait of a lonely, pointless nomad is prime. The teenage Claudia Karvan also gives us an insight into what would make her one of the most popular actors of the country in the coming years, with future roles in THE BIG STEAL, THE HEARTBREAK KID, DATING THE ENEMY, RISK and the acclaimed THE SECRET LIFE USA series. (By the way, Karvan, as a child, was a young girl whose Panda toy was stolen from a chemist's shop in the 1983 drama. A REVIEW OF Tracey Mann.) If these movies appear in your way, make sure you see it !! Rating: 79/100. See also: HOTEL SORRENTO, RADIANCE, VACANT POSSESSION, LANTANA.
