Four words explain why this movie was made - "She got him wrong." The huge commercial success of this vehicle Mae West convinced the label that gay melodramas from the 90s were a real proposition. Here we are rewarded with a fast-moving, well-written romp, which accurately addresses the personalities of its stars. <br /> <br /> Wallace Beery and George Raft are excellent rivals; Jackie Cooper is a bit harder to get, but it's Fay Wray who steals the movie with her underdeveloped lady. With a strong director - as Walsh argues - Wray can suffer a lot of damage, and she is completely credible as the object of both Raft and Beery's feelings. <br /> <br /> A lot of atmosphere, beautifully designed, it's a forgotten movie worth waking up.
