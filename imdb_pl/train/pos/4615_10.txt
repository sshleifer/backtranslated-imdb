I think people rate this amazing movie. People perceive it as a typical horror, which is to scare us and stop us from sleeping. If he tried to do it, it would deserve 1/10, but I watched the movie with a few friends and it turned out that it was very funny and although it was a good movie, it finally has Stephanie beaton. This is the reason why I think it deserves to be 10/10 for pure movie entertainment. <br /> <br /> The general view of this movie is that it has bad acting, a simple script that can produce for 10 years and can not be taken seriously, and people rate it as low. But I see it as a completely funny masterpiece ... which has a fun funny scenario that is even more entertaining for the actors and although it is not very serious, it is very funny.
