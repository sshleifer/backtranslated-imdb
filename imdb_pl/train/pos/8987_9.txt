I recently hired this doctor, remembering that I had heard about it from IMDb.com and was intrigued by the premise. I knew very little about these bands, but I remember hearing "No, if you were the last Junkie on earth" The Dandy Warhols from centuries ago and enjoying it. With that in mind, this is my perspective on the document: <br /> <br /> One of the things that I found unbelievable in this movie is that you do not need to have any knowledge about any of these bands. The director (Ondi Timoner) does not waste time engaging the audience and making them familiar with the people from this film. I quickly fell into the rhythm of both Anton's and Courtney's concerts, as well as their bands, The Brian Jonestown Massacre and The Dandy Warhols. I think it's part of what makes this document so good and what makes Ondi Timoner such a master documentary maker. <br /> <br /> I also loved how the "history" of these bands was told. Most of what you see are teams on the road. Both teams start playing in small clubs and are struggling to find themselves in the recording industry. Throughout the film, each band tries to remain unique and uncontrolled by the norm. However, this is what makes both teams similar, and thus the genius of how two pen groups can go in different directions. <br /> <br /> Basically, I recommend it to EVERYONE who likes a movie at all. You do not need to have a special love for documentaries or any of the bands. Music helps with this, but the music itself is transferred to a love / hate relationship between The Brian Jonestown Massacre and The Dandy Warhols.
