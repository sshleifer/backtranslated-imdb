I just watched 2 Pang brothers' films, The Eye and One take only. When I watched The Eye, I was a little disappointed with the two guys I'd heard good about before. This movie (The Eye) has a really bad script, especially ending (childish, phrase-like and too convergent in my opinion), but it's still good in photography and experimental images. So I decided to see One take only and I was not disappointed again. Still great photography, stunning image, MTV style edition, cool music and this time the story has a lot of indie, logical and beautiful spirit, you will see a few small holes in the story, but it does not cause any problems plot. The only problem with this movie is that I have a bad DVD.
