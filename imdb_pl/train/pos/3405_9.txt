"The Garden of Allah" was one of the first full-length Technicolor 3-band films. To correct the previous poster, the first Technicolor feature (after a five-year Disney exclusivity agreement) was "Becky Sharp" from 1935, which was a costume drama in which the color was flashy. <br /> <br /> The "Allah's Garden" looks like he could have been shot many years later, because the pictures use not only the color, but also the use of shadows. It was amazing for viewers at the time to see the colorful function after watching basically only black and white movies throughout their lives. Unfortunately, the movie can not take pictures. With this in mind, the film is only worth seeing as a visual feast.
