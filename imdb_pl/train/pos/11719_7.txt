Elvira, Mistress of The Dark, is a funny camp horror comedy in which the fourth wall is broken several times, and jokes often remain below the navel. And Cassandra Peterson's breasts become her own. <br /> <br /> Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) is a hostess showing horrors, who finds out she inherited her aunt Morgana. He goes to the small town of Fallwell, which is ruled by the most terrible monster that has ever swept the land. The Elwirs' nasty appearance is of course too big for prunes, but the city's children break out of its different approach to life. And of course there is an even more sinister evil, her uncle Vincent (William Morgan Sheppard), who is after the book spells of Elvira's mothers. You see, Elvira is a real witch, she just does not know it. Yet. <br /> <br /> For what it is, Elvira is quite a funny movie, although the script leaves a lot of room for improvement. Most of the laughter results from the difference between Elvira and people of good morality, but there are also some good visual gags. Everything is fine, but it never becomes something more. All in all good, deliberately camp, comedy. If you like this kind of thing, it means.
