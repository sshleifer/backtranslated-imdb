In fact, I am outraged by the commentary that I read that this movie was "boring" and the beautiful scenery was distorted by black and white material. Founded in 1925 !!!! I think it's absolutely unbelievable for your time! <br /> <br /> The journey through which these people had to go is completely unusual. It took them a week to cross the river. Women carried their children in heavy wooden cradles on their backs climbing on solid rock, sometimes barefoot on snow. I'd like to see that whoever did it now! <br /> <br /> I thought it was a great movie with really amazing photos and an amazing story.
