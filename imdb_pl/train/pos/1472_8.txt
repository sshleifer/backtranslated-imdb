A lot and lots of information to digest, and if you've seen Zizka, you know its tempo. <br /> <br /> Also, if you have not seen most of the films or at least some of the same directors' films mentioned in this document, you will be a little lost. <br /> <br /> And the list of movies is long. The director includes Hitchcock (Psycho, Vertigo, Birds), Lynch (Lost Highway, Mullholland Falls, Wild at Heart, Blue Velvet), Tarkovsky (Stalker, Solaris) and The Conversation (Coppola) <br /> <br /> There are several movies segway, such as Star Wars: Espisode III, Matrix ... but I suspect it's a bait. Of course, Zizek is never boring, but if you do not buy (or do not mind) psychoanalysis, you'll be annoyed endlessly. <br /> <br /> But you should not be like the setting, the clips, the way the movie interweaves with these clips, Zizka points are never boring.
