worth watching, especially with a nice turn of the journalist with honesty, you expect a great fall of the plot, as the Gray Owl is exposed as a scam, but it is not and adds to the generally optimistic and uplifting theme and drama of history and film. <br /> <br /> It must be Brosnan's best performance so far, he convinces us perfectly well, like an English boy playing Indians. The outstanding scene is a return to his? Aunts? where Brosnan and two older actresses create a wonderful scene full of nostalgia and life lost in such a small dialogue, only with facial expressions and good direction. Ideal. <br /> <br /> The story is so little known, and the message is so universal and important that it's a real pity that this movie has not gained much recognition, maybe over time can become a little classic and foundation. I hope. <br /> <br /> Well done Dickie Attenborough and cast.
