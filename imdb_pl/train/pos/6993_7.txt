This is not the best Beli Lagosi movie, but it has a good old approach to the horror of the 40. <br /> <br /> Brides are falling on the altar like flies. I think I'll postpone my wedding until the devil gets caught, but it's a horror movie, so people ignore danger for some reason. In any case, Lagosi is a crazy doctor who needs young woman's blood to keep a healthy and happy aging, sick wife. It always eludes the Keystone cops, hiding bodies in a caravan (who would think about looking for a caravan in a caravan?), And the brides simply become clogged. <br /> <br /> No such movie to be complete without a Lois Lane reporter who wants to catch a criminal herself. Good in solving crimes, bad in keeping mouth closed for all bad times, guess who Lagosi chooses his next victim. I love the piece of "haunted house" in which Lois Lane falls into a thunderstorm as a guest in the sinister residence of Lagosi. Hidden passages, vampire wife, evil dwarf Igor and so on. Good things. <br /> <br /> A fairly well-made stimulation keeps the film moving, and the story is solved in a typical but satisfying way. If you like old horror movies, this one is worth watching.
