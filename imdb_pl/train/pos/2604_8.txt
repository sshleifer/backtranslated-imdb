"Amazing Grace" has a weak feeling because it tells the contemporary story of different lives in a residential building. The spoken language is Hebrew, but drama can take place in any modern city. He observes family values, romantic relationships and features of the age group with equal peace. He does not judge the characters, he simply presents them in a simple way, because they try to work out their individual problems in this modern world. The quality of the game is very good, and the observations made on the heroes are sharp and sharp. I really appreciate this flowing movie.
