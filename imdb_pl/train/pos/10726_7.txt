To my surprise, I liked "Spacecamp" pretty much, I remember seeing him about 13 years ago, and recently I hired him again. I was impressed. Of course, special effects in today's space movies, such as Armageddon and Deep Impact, are much better than in SpaceCamp. However, this film had a history - a very stereotypical story from the eighties, in which one could almost recite another line of dialogue before hearing it. But that's what I liked - they no longer make such films, so it was a refreshing change. It was interesting to see Kelly Preston, Leaf Phoenix and Lea Thomson in early roles, with Tom Skerrit and Kate Capshaw, to add substance to the light and fluffy plot. I absolutely liked the robot named Jinx, he was very nice, but unfortunately he had more emotions than some of the main characters. The film was almost inspiring in its own way and it was worth noting that it was shot at the NASA Spacecamp in Alabama (I think).
