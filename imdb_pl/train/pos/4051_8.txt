Eric Rohmer's "Lady and the Duke". he could use a better translation of the title. Perhaps the "English woman and prince" would be more accurate. Although it is obvious that this film is not for everyone, judging by the comments on this forum, it is worth to watch it, because despite the intricate pattern of history, Mr. Rohmer created a film that could be considered an exhibition of art in the museum. Ultimately, the mixed technology used in the movie works well. <br /> <br /> The strange story of Grace Elliott, a noble lady who was the lover of the King of England and the French Duc d'Orleans, attracts our attention. The place is Paris in the days that followed the French Revolution. The country was in chaos, and power was in the hands of people who did not care about the aristocrats. The pictures show agitators running with the heads of famous people right after their journey to the guillotine. <br /> <br /> The relationship of Grace and the Prince has come to an end, but she remains the true friend of a great man who is in danger, alone, losing his own head. Grace goes through all the horrors around her, unable to escape. He even has an enemy in his own home, in the form of a cook, Pulcherie, who would not hesitate to condemn her in the slightest provocation. <br /> <br /> Watching a movie sometimes gives the viewer the impression that someone is going on a trip through the Louvre, watching the huge canvases that portray this key era of French history. Instead of discovering that the process of digitization is distracting, we have discovered that it improves the film in many ways. <br /> <br /> Lucy Russell, as Grace Elliott, does a great job to introduce this woman who has seen a lot during her life. Her French seems to be perfect because she seems to be fluent in it. As Duc d'Orleans, Jean Claude Dreyfus made a fantastic contribution to the belief that he is a nobleman without any effort. The supporting cast was also great. As a member of the band, Mr. Rohmer has good performances all around. <br /> <br /> For lovers of history, "Pani and Książę" will be an interesting movie to watch thanks to Eric Rohmer's vision.
