Includes * spoilers * - also my quotes may not be accurate. <br /> <br /> Every satire always notes in social and economic commentaries parallel - as true. But for me this movie is much more. I love the symbolism of this guy in a glowing white suit. There is so much confusion and dirt in the world around him, but it will not last. Alec Guiness was the perfect guy to play - his boyish smiles and eternal curiosity are so appropriate: <br /> <br /> "It's a genius - can you tell me the ratio of ink to petrol?" <Br /> <br / > The only moment of failure is that he realizes that his invention did not work - he was almost naked there. However, more than shame is a simple disappointment that "it did not work". He is never really intimidated by people. Remember, <br /> <br /> "But Sidney, we want to stop it too." <br /> <br /> Just moments of hesitation before he sets out to escape again. Does he show any signs of pain that this betrayal must have caused? No. <br /> <br /> Dapne's role is also noteworthy. She is sick and tired of money and power. She thinks that she finally found love outside her father's company. At first, he does not care for Sidney any more than anyone else. But this moment when he falls off the car and comes back to see if she killed him - yet he still thinks only about the beauty of his invention. In the end, she found something that she thinks worth living for. The funny thing is that it's not even an affair. It's a friendship, but of such an ephemeral nature that the title almost does not fit. It's more admiration, maybe even inspiration. <br /> <br /> After discovering that Michael has no real love for her and that her father is completely incompetent to look after her, she gives in to cynicism and tries to seduce Sidney. Fortunately, it turns out that there are really people in this world who live more than power, money and lust. What a refreshment: <br /> <br /> "Thank you, Sidney. If you say "yes", I think I would strangle you. "<br /> <br /> I love the end, when it seems that this whole crazy thing has not come to fruition. But then the cloudy, bizarre rhythm begins and Sidney turns off, his step fits the melody: it does not get discouraged. Where is Daphne? We really do not know - but they were not really in love, and she was not really a scientist. He escaped with help and got a "shot in the arm of hope." (Pollyanna) The context would be nice, but as Billy Joel says, "it's more than I expected ..." <br /> <br />
