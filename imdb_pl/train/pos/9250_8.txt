Clark Gable is playing a crook who comes into the life of a hard-working lady, Jean Harlow. He tries to suck her while she rejects him with her hard attitude. Despite their cynicism and adversity, they fall in love. When Gable accidentally kills a man during a sting, he ends up leaving a loyal Harlow in a women's prison, where he discovers that he is pregnant. Writing Anita Loos and Howard Emmett Rogers is excellent thanks to many well-drawn and surprising characters (including a Jewish socialist prisoner and a prisoner of black women, and her father's preacher played almost no stereotype). Gable and Harlow show their skills as actors, adding to their characters the nuances and quirks that send them beyond the typical roles of Gable and Harlow. The direction is much better than one would expect from Samu Wood. One beautiful shot led Harlow to prison, and then went out into the surprisingly snowy courtyard as the camera followed her. This is one of the best genres of both "criminals in love" and "women's prison", and has one of the best hard dialogues ever written.
