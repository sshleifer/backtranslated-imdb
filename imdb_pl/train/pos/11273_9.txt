A year after losing wonderful Jane Parker (Maureen O'Sullivan) to love Tarzan's rival, hunter Harry Holt (Neil Hamilton) returns to the jungle to win a series of brunettes. Mixing business with pleasure, he also plans to take some ivory from the elephant cemetery, which lies behind the Mutia embankment, the tarzan area of ​​Tarzan. <br /> <br /> Accompanied by slimy, feminine buddy Martin Arlington and a group of unnecessary Carriers, Harry finally reaches the goal (narrowly avoiding death from the hands of wild natives and great apes) only to discover that Jane is still there enchanted with her faint and even worse, that Tarzan refuses to hunters to take any ivory from the cemetery. <br /> <br /> The nasty Arlington decides to solve the matter by attacking and shooting the monkey, then telling Jane and Holt that Tarzan was attacked and eaten by a crocodile. Of course, Tarzan is not dead, only wounded; after he was restored to health by Cheetah (!), he returns to action just in time to save Jane from the tribe of malicious savages eating the lion who attacked Holt's trip. <br /> <br /> Tarzan and his friend, the second film in which Weismuller appeared as a man of several jungles, is often quoted by the fans as the best in the series; although I prefer the original slightly, I definitely understand the popularity of the movie: it is damn sexy and there are great action sequences! Undeniable chemistry between Weismuller and O'Sullivan is fantastic and leads to quite steamy scenes, and since both stars are wearing eensy-stensy throughout the outfit, there are plenty of sweets for both sexes to enjoy (despite the advertised O'Sullivan ) underwater scene naked, actually performed by a double body, the charming girl still shows a lot of skin, even threatening to do "Sharon Stone" at a certain point, when her lumbar flap falls aside!). <br /> <br /> The most exciting moments of the movie are the wonderful underwater fight between Tarzan and the crocodile and the spectacular finale in which Jane is attacked by lions and natives, but is saved by her beau, his monkey buddies and the load of elephants in full mode crushing lions (once again, violence is surprisingly unpleasant, although, as far as I am concerned, there is nothing so shocking as cruel pygmies and their gorilla from the first movie). Cheetah also has a lot of emotions, avoiding rhinoceros, crocodiles and big cats, riding on the back of Tarzan, as he crosses the river and even jumps on the ostrich for a ride. <br /> <br /> Like his predecessor, Tarzan and his colleague suffer a bit from bad effects and unconvincing props, incompetent back projection, a few funny monkey suits, more Indian elephants pretending to be African cousins ​​and poorly hidden swings on a trapeze, but these are not they should spoil you with the joy of this very entertaining movie. If anything, it makes it even more fun! <br /> <br /> 8.5 out of 10, rounded to 9 for IMDb.
