I remember that the Legend of Zu trailer was impressive and being a fan of A Man Called Hero (favorite all the time), Storm Riders, I decided that I had to watch it too. I know that there is a lot to say about Ekin Cheng's acting skills everywhere, but he is my favorite filmmaker in Hong Kong so far (nevertheless better than Nicolas Tse) and is one of the factors that I liked in this film. Undoubtedly, this film is a work of art from the beginning to the end. I even thought that only the actors were real, and everything else was computer generated at the end of the movie. They had to put in a lot of work and deserve it. The plot of the film was a fairy tale between good and evil with a love story thrown in (I think that Ekin Cheng easily draws girls). The story is not very intellectual and deep, but this is not what you expect when watching an action movie. I regretted that there are no more martial arts with fists and fists than battles with magical abilities, but well, it is life and it never goes the way you want. And why did they finally sound like supersonic planes in a battle in the sky? It's too funny. Legend of Zu can not be A Man Called Hero in my eyes, but it flows like a video game and it is not bad at all. If the company decides to publish games in this video, I will not be surprised because it contains all the elements of video games. Good job. Make more of such fantasy movies
