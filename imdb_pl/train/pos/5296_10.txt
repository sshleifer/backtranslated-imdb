Absolutely fun. John Waters' tribute to the people he loves the most (Baltimoreans) is a twisted little ditty with lots of glances and laughter. It's as if you were released in the museum of kitsch! I did not laugh so much in the theater from the Serial Mom. I loved watching old friends from Dreamland, Sharon Nisep and Susan Lowe, back in front of Waters' camera. The cast is simply wonderful (especially Edward Furlong and Martha Plimpton). It uses the best elements of Waters' cruelty (especially the underrated polyester) and many new surprises. I felt sick in a wonderful way. Thanks, John!
