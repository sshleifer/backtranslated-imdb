This is the trio of the stories "Shakti", "Devi" and "Kali" regarding the experimental commune (or something) called the Taylor-Eriksson group, which took people on trips to themselves and the kingdom. I would say that it is unknown and left some damage. Many years later, some of these lesions are still lurking and waiting for the right moment to show up. Shakti tells the story of a woman whose husband died in a mysterious way, in fact he was torn apart, and the suspect was a man who might not have existed. It seems that this woman is able to emit an inner demon, or at least he learns about the sister of a man who died while trying to talk to this woman, pretending to be a reporter. Devi tells the story of a young man who wants to "jump out of his skin". He is a skinhead, a speed maniac and is sent to a psychiatrist who happens to be a former member of this community, which results in a good doctor helping the young man to fulfill his desire. This is probably the best of three segments. Kali tells the story of a healer who is trying to "heal" that woman who was part of this commune and releases some demon who lived in this woman, but one wonders if he did it, or SHE released him because she could not stay in it anymore survive. All three of these stories are quite frightening and full of tension, because you're never sure what to expect, and the premise and settings are so different from those of traditional horrors that add strangeness. It has a somewhat low-budget appearance, but it can also evoke quite a scary atmosphere all over the world. I watched it with open mouths for most of the time, and when real terror (and gore) appeared, it struck quite hard. I find this a very interesting and disturbing movie and I liked it a lot. Nice find, this one, I would give him 8 out of 10.
