Rock n 'roll is a mess and DiG! he demonstrates it masterfully. The director of serious ambitions, and maybe even stupidity, the director can fix seven stormy years of observing two bulky rock groups. With this in mind, the abundance of high-quality materials ensures the film's ability to captivating audiences. If you've ever been interested in any field of the music industry, this movie will undoubtedly be very interesting. music in the film, although it suffers minimally as a result of the required cutting and pasting, is worth the price of the party itself. in the morning after seeing DiG! I went straight to the record store to pick up the album Brian Jonestown Massacre (I was already initiated by the sounds of Dandy Warhols). First of all, thanks to the exploration of rock music, the film is successful at other deep levels. To dig! it is a sincere and sufficiently objective view of the destructive and changeable nature of the creative process and of people who are trying to fight these forces.
