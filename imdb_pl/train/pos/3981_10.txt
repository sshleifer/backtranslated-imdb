This is my fourth short Joe Joe McDoakes, which I have seen and until now the funniest. In this, Joe takes voice lessons from a plate impersonating Charles Boyer and Ronald Colman. When he goes to Warner Bros. Studio (a company dealing with this series, by the way), asks Jacek Carson for tips that become confusing. Then he meets actor George O'Hanlon (who is also McDoakes) who speaks in a more normal voice that is not too far from his late Geroge Jetson and reaches the plan in which he automatically annoys the director. I will stop there and just say how fun I found and I was fascinated by the scenes from movie stars at the end. The last scene was especially hoot, so on this note, go to YouTube if you want to watch how you want to be in Picutres!
