After a long, hard week at the desk, taking all these serious decisions, this movie is a great way to relax. Just like Wells and the original radio program, this film will take you to the land of foreign humor and science fiction. Captain Zippo died under the great supervision of Buick. He was a brave man. The impressions of Jack Nicholson shine through this alien face with dark sunglasses and a leather jacket. And always remember to beware of the "death bud!" Remember the number one rule of this movie - suspend disbelief - sit back and relax - and "Prepare for the death of earth scum!" You must see it for yourself.
