Four stories by Robert Bloch about different people who live in a beautiful old mansion and what happens to them. The first of them is Denholm Elliott as a novelist who sees that the murderer he writes about comes alive. Some terrible moments and a turn at the end were good. The other is obsessed with Peter Cushing with a wax figure reminiscent of his dead wife. The third one has Christopher Lee, who has a child (Chloe Franks) and is afraid of her. All this leads to a rather terrifying ending (although the ending of this story was MUCH worse). The last is a comedy out and out with Jon Petwee and Ingrid Pitt (both chewing the scenery) and a cape that turns people into vampires! There is also a charming story about Christopher Lee playing Dracula. <br /> <br /> This is a good anthology of horror - nothing terrifying, but the first and the end of the third gave me some nice little thrills. The fourth is also really funny, and Pitt is a VERY sexy vampire! Also the house itself looks beautiful ... and very scary. It is well-directed with pleasant atmospheric accents. Very good and unusual movie result. All in all a good horror anthology that is worth exploring. Try to see it on DVD - Lions Gate one looks fantastic with strong colors and great sound.
