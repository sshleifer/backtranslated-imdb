This film is rated as one of my favorite 10 best films. Many people seeing this for the first time and not knowing much about the many topics of the film probably will not understand why I find it so fascinating, so I will try to explain ... <br /> <br /> The film is very rich in historical details and cultural perceptions, and although it has some minor anachronisms, they are completely forgivable. The story is a repetition of the famous duel between Monk Benkei and the young prince Yoshitsune on the Gojo bridge. During the fight according to legend, Yoshitsune is the best for Benkei, and the monk becomes a loyal servant of the prince. This film, however, is a revision of this story and includes war, dark prophecies and political maneuvers. <br /> <br /> One of the main themes of the film is "Mappo", which is a Buddha's prophecy, which after 1000 years of his learning has failed and the world would fall into chaos. He was believed in Heian Japan, after the outburst of Mt Fuji and the civil war between Taira (Heike) and Minamoto (Genji), that the world would fall into anarchy and everything would collapse. It is a time of demons. <br /> <br /> Then you have the way in which the movie solves the question of training the sword Yoshitsune by Tenku (Ravens Goblins) Karuma. Defeated clans often escaped into the mountains and dressed as demons to scare off the locals. It is said that where the ninja clans began historically. The presentation of Yoshitsune in Gojo nicely captures all this. <br /> <br /> Then there is Benkei and various varieties of Buddhism, including many of the esoteric Buddhism of the Shingon sect. They are all presented quite accurately, and to add a bit more, the film manages to convey the power of meditation and Ki energy in a way that makes it an integral part of the story, i.e. Uses magical realism to add an extra dimension to the movie, but does it in this way to make it tactical and dangerous. <br /> <br /> The whole is filled with fascinating curiosities and rings surprisingly faithful during this period. The scenery and costumes are also completely indecipherable and very authentic. The soundtrack is great, very deliberate and ominous. I also thought that the acting performances were surprisingly good. Benkei is a big, dangerous antihero, Shanao (Yoshitsune) is portrayed as a young man testing his limits and getting more and more drunk with his own power, and Tetsukichi, the repellent sword-smith, makes an interesting picture of the "ordinary man" his less than a flattering opinion about the killers who they consider themselves better than themselves. <br /> <br /> As for the story, to see why it's so good, I'm really suggesting you dig up an old book about Japanese history and see how this story transforms the almost carefree story of Robin Hood against Little John into a bloody tale about intrigue, violence and hellish karma.
