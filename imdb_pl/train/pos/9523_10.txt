I loved this movie! I am a real fan of Tom Hanks and I have always been impressed with all his work. From the most dramatic roles, such as Cast Away, The Green Miles, Saving Private Ryan, Forrest Gump, Apollo 13 and Philadelphia. For his amusing roles, such as Own League, Turner and Hooch, Catch Me If You Can, The Lady Killers, Big & Of course Toy Story. But in this movie, Hanks is not the only big actor who lights up the screen. Tyler Hoechlin, the rising star who promises the big stars in Hollywood as Hanks' son, makes for a great performance. He is certainly someone to be careful of throughout his career, I believe he will do wonderful things. Paul Newman as always provides excellent performance on the screen. He is really a legend. We can not forget about people who did not have such big roles in the film, but they still helped him do it. Beautiful and very talented Jennifer Jason Leigh, whose performance at Bastard Out of Carolina and Single White Female I will never forget, brings her a grace on screen as Hanka's wife in the film and does a great job. Liam Aiken is another found treasure in the film. He does a great job with such a small role, and like his roles in Lemony Snickets, Sweet November and I Dreamed Of Africa, he makes a great performance.
