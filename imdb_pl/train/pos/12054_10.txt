I saw the film for the first time here, in Great Britain, in December 1989, when Central TV broadcast it. I still have a videotape, although it has been used up (over the years many friends and family members borrowed it and it was frozen by it!). <br /> <br /> In any case, I remember when I returned home that night, grabbing the Christmas drink, turning off the lights and watching what was advertised as the "Christmas tale of ghosts". Even now I remember some scenes that still send hairs at the end of the neck ... <br /> <br /> I saw some comments to the movie that say it's not it, not this ... I think people are afraid on Friday the 13th and this type, stem and slash rammel, which are funny. It's a "traditional" ghost story; there are no big budgetary activities or special effects ... no curses, no blood, no free sex scenes, no chainsaws or weapons etc ... So how refreshing !!!! This is atmospheric. If you like chilling horrors, well-written, well-preserved and really scary, this movie is for you. I like original horrors; Only last night I saw the original Haunting and this is a great movie. Again, very atmospheric - just like The Woman In Black. The end of the film is different from the book, but it is still very good. I recommend it. Try it out ... you'll like it * if you like traditional ghost stories ... So ... turn off the lights, pick up the fire, shut the door, take a drink ... and enjoy ...:)
