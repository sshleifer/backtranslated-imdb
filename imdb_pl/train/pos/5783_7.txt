I have read the Kerching reviews on IMDb and to be honest, I have not seen any positive reviews so far. Actually, I like Kerching. Kerching talks about a teenage boy named Taj Lewis to earn 1,000,000 pounds on his mother, he establishes a website called rudeboy. The site offers many interesting things, if only Taj and his 2 friends - Danny and Seymour can stop Dad from disclosing. I find this program quite funny and I like watching it. Acting is O.K. but it can definitely be better, the characters are funny, especially Danny Spooner, friend of Taja, his stupidity makes him funny. and Taja's second friend, Seymour. Also Carlton, the owner of the cafe, called "Chill". We never see him, we only hear him. Taja's younger brother, Omar, and his older sister Missy are also funny. And the best friend of Missy, Kareesh. So many times the Taj has almost revealed himself. In addition to the comedy drama in Kerching, such as love life and loss of loved ones, makes this program wonderful.
