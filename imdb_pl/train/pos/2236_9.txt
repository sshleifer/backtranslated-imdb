What I remember most about this movie is the fact that it was suitable for local KTLA TV (chapter 5) during each Christmas season in the middle to the end of the 1970s, mainly due to the fact that the real story took place on Christmas Eve or near her. It has always been a little disconcerting to see the hell through which this girl passes, being a single victim of a plane crash in the Peruvian jungle. The graphic scene of this young girl pulling the leech from the infected leg made a big impression on this young spectator. Not such a festive mood that I was used to at that time. This is definitely not Rankin-Bass production.
