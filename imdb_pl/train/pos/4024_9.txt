I really liked this movie. I'm guessing until the very end what will happen. One of the better movies about the partition I saw. Urmila Matondkar is great too. This is one of the most personal and mundane movies I've seen on the partition. It's a bit less mainstream than Gadar and is really an emotional rollercoaster, where you start with one opinion about what's happening, and go out completely from the other side. This is not a typical Bollywood charge, but rather an art house style movie. The best part of this movie is that it does not focus on the story of another because it did not dehumanize one side of the partition conflict. He does not blame or punish, but he lets you draw his own conclusions about things.
