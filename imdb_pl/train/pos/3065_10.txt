<br /> <br /> I really liked this movie. One of those rare films that Hollywood Really no longer has. William H Macy is simply a great hero with a soul, and Neve Campbell is simply fantastic as a woman who puts her life on the path of redemption. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance, check out this video. He earns praise
