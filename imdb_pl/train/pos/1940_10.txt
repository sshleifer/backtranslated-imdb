I was impressed by this film. Writing was fantastic and the characters were rich and simple. It's very easy to get emotionally attached to them all. The creators of this film really hit the nail on the topic of creating a real life form and pulling the viewer into their world. In addition, the music is great. To perform the score, they used several independent musicians and part of the soundtrack, and also did a fantastic job adding to the film. If you have a chance to catch this movie in a small theater or at a film festival (like me), I highly recommend that you see it. Also, personally, Paget Brewster is beautiful in this movie. That's reason enough to check it out.
