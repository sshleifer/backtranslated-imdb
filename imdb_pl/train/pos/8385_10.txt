This film seems to be badly criticized for some reason. Probably only by mass population. In any case, this is a very interesting movie. The film is an underestimated sci-fi film that actually works because of the interesting story and well-made scenes. <br /> <br /> This movie may not be for everyone. If Sci-Fi fans read it, I really recommend this movie if you like good science fiction. The film has crazy ideas. The setting includes nations fighting GIGANTIC machines in which entire countries invest all their money! The world has been divided into territories. Everyone can challenge every person to the war, or rather a "duel of robots". The fighting method is cleaner than nuclear war, because now everyone has a respiratory mask. For sure the movie that makes you think. Smart, well-written and good effects for a poor budget. <br /> <br /> I usually like movies that have small budgets and actually work.
