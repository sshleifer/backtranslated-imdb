After reading many other reviews of the movie about IMDb, there is a purported consensus among purists that this film is not like the books on which it is based. At this point, I can not comment, never reading any heroes' adventures before. However, I can certainly say that I am struck by the fact that many of these reviewers must have certainly gone through a sense of humor; Let's be honest - this movie is just great! <br /> <br /> OK? .. so I have to admit that the movie apparently is not representative of the characters, but let's put it in a clear perspective. Are the same people who care about the movie, also mourn the fact that the classic Batman series from the 1960s does not remain faithful to the original character of DC comics? Or maybe there is still anxiety in the same people that the Flash Gordon movie version from 1980 was too big a departure from the original series? <br /> <br /> The point is that this movie is incredibly camp, but that's exactly the charm! <br /> <br /> Former Tarzan, Ron Ely plays the title character (and has more than a similarity to Gary Busey to run!) and is backed by a great cast who all want to have a ball with their respective roles. Pay attention to the very short but very welcome look of Michael Berryman's favorite by horror. <br /> <br /> The best scene? Much too much to choose from, but check out the funny face taken by the waiter when Savage and his men make the final faux pas ordering coke, lemonade and milk on a festive occasion! Also a frequently recorded scene at the end of the movie, in which Savage moves his Nemesis Captain Seas using various martial arts disciplines that are marked on the screen! ?? Priceless! <br /> <br /> Simply put, the film is not taken seriously and it is even more fun. Great fun from beginning to end! (and you will sing a song motivated by John Phillip Sousa for many days, guaranteed!)
