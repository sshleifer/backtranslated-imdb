Genre: Dinosaur, animation, New York, time travel, circus? <br /> <br /> Main characters: Rex Tyrannosaurus rex, Elsa pterodactyl, Dweeb Parasarolophus, Ooo Triceratops, boy named Louis, girl called Cecilia and Captain New Eyes. ? Actors: John Goodman (Rex), Yeardley Smith (Cecilia), Martin Short (Stubbs Clown), Felicity Kendal (Elsa), etc.? <br /> <br /> What's happening: Four dinosaurs (see above) are fed a little "cereal grains" and are now cozy, friendly dinosaurs that will be nice for children. They enter New York with big plans? <br /> <br /> Thoughts: This is a cute animated film. Animation of dinosaurs, when they are cozy and friendly, is a bit floppy and not very good, but in this way they look nice. I like dinosaurs when they are cozy and friendly, they are nice, friendly and good. I like (almost) all the appearing characters, especially Elsa and Cecilia, but of course I also like other characters. Overall, I like this movie very much! :-) <br /> <br /> Recommended: people who like good animated films for children, dinosaurs, John Goodman and people who think that circuses are not always what they seem? Enjoy! :-)
