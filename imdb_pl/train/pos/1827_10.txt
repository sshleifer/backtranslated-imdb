All dogs are going to Heaven is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I saw it for the first time when I was 3 years old. Now I am 12 years old and I rented, it makes me think about things and bring back so many memories, these were "days". I love music, I love when Charlie comes to Heaven, I love the song "Let me surprise you". I love Charlie's look and his voice, Bert Reynolds could only play Charlie's voice so wonderful. I love this movie, the first is the best because it is so original and great. It really brings back memories that no one can describe, even me. If only I could go back to those days. I love characters. If the memories come back like this when I'm 12, I imagine how I'll feel when I'm 19, I hope I can see it when I'm older. When I saw it for the first time, I never knew I would really look at it and feel it, I hope it will be available to watch. I am so happy that this movie was made and an amazing idea came to my mind and heart. On a scale of 1-10, I would give it a perfect 10. It's an amazing movie. It is difficult to explain this feeling when I age, and if I have children, I hope that they can experience this feeling.
