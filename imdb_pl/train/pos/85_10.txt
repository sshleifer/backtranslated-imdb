I watch this movie at Birmingham Southern College in 1975, when it was shown in conjunction with the Red Balloon. Both films are similar in their dream quality. Most of the film requires the fish to float in his bowl, while his new owner, a small boy, is at school. The cat enters the room where the fish and its bowl are located, and begins to cautiously persecute its 'prey'. The boy begins his walk home from school, and the viewer wonders if he will arrive in time to save his friend's fish. The fish is moved by the presence of a cat, and finally jumps out of the bowl! The cat quickly approaches the fish, gently raises it with its paws and returns to the bowl. The boy returns happily to his fish, no one smarter. <br /> <br /> The ending is amazing in terms of both irony and technical complexity. It is hard to imagine how the director could have drawn a technical feat in 1959 - it seems to be more of a trick for 2003. <br /> <br /> If you can find him, watch him - you will not be disappointed! And if * you find *, let me know that I can also get a copy!
