The beginning of this movie is a bit clumsy and also confusing, but hold on tight because you are on the ride of your life. The concept is attractive, with interesting devices used to tell the whole story. There are great performances everywhere, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman is the best cast - no wonder. Ethan Hawke also deserves credit for very good results. The direction of Mr. Lumet is unique. The movie is in the 1970s with the respect that the risk is taken while telling this story, but unlike most banal films that populate the landscape today, it is a thriller that is genuinely based on relationships rather than on special effects or product plug-ins. You will be very rewarded for the time invested in this movie.
