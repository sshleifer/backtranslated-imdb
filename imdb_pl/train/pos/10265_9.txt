A unique film about a confused woman (Lindsay Crouse) who engages in sharp battles. Joe Mantegna gives Oscar a caliber performance as the most dangerous of the group. Absolutely charming the first hour, when Mantegna shows Crouse the "ropes" of his games. The story line develops a bit later, but it is still a unique portrait of an innocent man caught in the dark world. It's definitely worth a try.
