Some videos simply should not be processed. It's one of them. In itself, this is not a bad movie. But he fails to capture the taste and horror of the 1963 film of the same title. Liam Neeson was perfect, as always, and most of the cast is held, except for Owen Wilson, who just did not bring the appropriate feeling to Luke's character. But the main disadvantage of this version is that it strayed too far from the story of Shirley Jackson, because it tries to be great and lost some of the thrill of an earlier movie in exchange for a snazzier effect. Again, this is not a bad movie in itself. But you will be much more pleased with the friction of terror in the older version.
