I saw this movie when it was in a limited edition, mainly because of the novelty in the vision of Pierce Brosnan with a mustache, but it turned out that this is one of the funniest movies I've seen all year. It starts almost like a thriller, but gradually it turns into a fun work full of single-line and great comedy between Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear. Also, although I say that this movie is a comedy, we do not forget that it sometimes has a heart and can be very touching when it has to be. When I entered the theater, I did not know what to expect more than a mustache, but what I got was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Leaving the theater I felt very happy about the film and I plan to see it again in a wide edition. I recommend it to anyone who appreciates a good comedy with a well-written script and a large mustache.
