Ah, cliches, cliches, cliches; They are the main part of a wide range of horror films. This one has many. It's still Stephen King, one of the best masters of horror. This movie was really good, just too predictable. And what horror does not have stupid people? This one is filled with delayed victims, practically begging for life. Seminar for animals, which turned out to be a bit scary. The way everything is set up was REALLY awful, but not terrifying. For the most part, the acting was reliable, the uncertainty was not so tense, but the level of entertainment is set at a high level; My eyes were practically stuck to the screen. All fans of Stephen King have to see this movie, but as for everyone else, expect the thriller OKAY.
