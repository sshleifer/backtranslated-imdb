I saw this movie on TV and fascinated by the beauty of Jennifer Mccomb. It was a nice movie and you can watch it for African beauty and of course Mccomba. At the time I was excited about watching this movie and since then I've been trying to VCD this movie, but I can not find it. Huge African lions appear in his film and we will be charmed by the limited size of these animals and their grace. All viewers can watch this movie, especially children will like this movie. But some scenes involving Mccomb are forcing this movie on a native guide. It's a nice holiday movie for everyone.
