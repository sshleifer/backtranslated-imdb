I found this move in a video store, it costs $ 2 to buy. The whole movie stinks really bad! The so-called colonel who would be a hero, if you could trust him, must be eighty years old and barely able to walk. Nevertheless, he manages to shoot the stupidest ninja in the world. Then the story will leave the colonel, which makes sense, considering the old man's inability to do anything that is worth mentioning, now two terrifying-looking guys from the eighties take control of what must have been a story. I got lost hundreds of times, but it did not bother me because the movie is so bad that watching is really fun. Zero budget with actors who do not deserve this name. Go check it out!
