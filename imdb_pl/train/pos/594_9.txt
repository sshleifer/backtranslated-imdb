13 days to Glory tells a traditional story with compassion for the Mexican point of view. The main problem in this movie was that while the cowboy James Arness played the role of Jim Bowie convincingly, the rest of the actors in the cast Brian Keith (Davy Crocket) and Lorne Greene (Sam Houston) were too old. > <br /> Raul Julia played general Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna with the grace and dignity of a professional soldier who won the battle after all. The scene in which he waves his officers for not being able to put up a guard and make it impossible to hear was not understandable for screenwriters. Failure to observe is a serious shortcoming in the army. Santa Anna was angry at his prerogatives. Raul Julia had a great script on the stage. <br /> <br /> Kathleen York was an impressive Susannah Dickinson, a woman who deserves to remember her for her courage. However, Kathleen York could remember that since Dickinsons came from Pennsylvania, it probably did not sound like Southron.
