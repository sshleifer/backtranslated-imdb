It's impossible to hide that Ealing's comedies are good, but for me this movie stands out as one of the best. <br /> <br /> The basic idea behind the film is that a small part of Pimlico in London turns out to be part of Burgundy, not the United Kingdom. Then we follow the fate of the inhabitants in their battle to keep the treasure found after the bomb explosion and prevent the black market traders who will soon realize that the exemption from British law, rationing does not exist. When they become prisoners on their own street, because the government has decided to close the border, we see them fighting against the system. <br /> <br /> They are forced to ration water and food in their positions for what is right. In fact, the situation in which they were before everything began to deteriorate, the moral appears. It's when they lose all the food they think is beaten and they call for surrender, just to let London react to their situation by sending food, a lot of it. Thanks to this, they can continue their fight. <br /> <br /> This hit is the right note, the acting is great, Stanley Holloway, Margaret Rutherford, Hermione Baddeley and Betty Warren stand out. It is well set, it is not too sentimental, and the moral of this story is not forced. Worth watching
