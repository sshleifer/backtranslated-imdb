Of course, the movie, which had a great impact not only on the genre of a buddy, but also on the genre of action. George Lucas must have been a fan of the movie because most of his Star Wars series seems to be a tribute to Gung Din. Characters played by Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks are only the precursors of Han Solo, Luke Skywalker and Chewbacca. Even Gunga Din Sam Jaffe transformed into C-3PO and R2-D2 and liked him or not: Jar Jar Binks. <br /> <br /> Today, this movie is seen as unsupported by the PC, but there is a speech by Eduardo Ciannelli as Guru leader of the Indian opposition to the British paradise, which could be repeated in the feelings of many people. <br /> <br /> For a young boy it was a great movie. Three strong male leads and just a bit of romance. There was a time when young boys thought that kissing a girl in a Saturday movie was just mush. Not like today, when more skin is greeted with pleasure. Too late for the lament of lost innocence. <br /> <br /> I hope this movie will not be forgotten, and several users surfing the channels will stop at TCM and catch a movie with the action, adventure and cast of thousands instead of CGI actors.
