Magicians are a great ride from beginning to end, largely thanks to the magic generated by the stars. Alan Arkin is fantastic in one of his best roles for decades. Like any really great movie, it's a journey in which the theme is redemption and the results of dreaming. I can not believe that this movie is so difficult to find - I would buy it on DVD in the blink of an eye, but I have not found the outlet yet.
