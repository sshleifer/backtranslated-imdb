I never saw him on TV, but I rented a DVD by Netflix, as soon as it was available. I had high expectations and I was not disappointed. It's fun and the animation is perfect. Such a level of quality that I would expect only from feature films, so I'm surprised by some bad comments. Maybe the DVD edition has improved the animation? One of the DVD bonuses is that it was great to see both versions of the remote. I am an adult and I really appreciate that it is for adults. It's not just kids who like cute animated characters. As some say, nowhere is "conceited", but I see where some parents would not want their little children to see it. I am very disappointed that he was dismissed. I would like them to produce more episodes. Or maybe a movie.
