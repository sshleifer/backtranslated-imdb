This film is much better than the version of asylum, mainly world war. Tripods look pretty good, but their walking and death could be better. The action scenes were really cool. Walking ... walking ... walking ... walking !!! oh my God, stop walking or I'm going to kill myself. The thunder scene was my favorite sequence, mainly because the ship rammed several tripods. A good movie that I recommend to people who have read the book. The music is amazing, and the directors' typefaces look pretty good. <br /> <br /> pros. Good soundtrack 99% compared to the book Cool violence. Tripods and manipulation machines are cool, looking at the defects <br /> <br /> some poor, bad looking London
