The events of September 11, 2001 cast a shadow over the Oscars award ceremony with a minute's silence before editing in memoriam, and there was little to sing all the dancing comedic extravagances we would expect from a show of prizes, but it was not bad at all. Entertainment was more or less limited to the LOTR party with Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson, and that's all. The rest of the series was taken by nominated clips and I must admit that it was more enjoyable than the exaggerated numbers of songs and dances we've seen over the years, and Whoopi Goldberg was by no means a bad presenter unlike the very esoteric David Letterman from a few years ago and a minute of silence for victims September 11 was persecuting and dopojna <br /> <br /> Regarding prizes, New Zealand was completely robbed. FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING went home with four small prizes, while A BEAUTIFUL MIND unexpectedly picked up most of the main prizes, except for the best actor who should have been a tough New Zealander, but instead went to a nice American. The only Oscar awards that I accepted, with the exception of the FELLOWSHIP awards, were the awards for the best supporting actress and the best supporting actor, both correct connections.
