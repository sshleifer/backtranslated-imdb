In Arlington Heights, IL we never had a canteen in any of primary schools (1961), so I went cycling from school to dinner and always watched the game. True, I was 11 years old, but I thought it was the best thing! I would draw the hidden pictures on my board and check if my family or friends could find them. I also remember that I won great cars (Pontiac or Oldsmobile) if the competitor got the final hidden picture game. I even had a home version! <br /> <br /> I wonder why this game lasted so short. I liked music and hidden pictures - the only thing I could get was a lemon hidden as part of a bridge over a garden stream. <br /> <br /> Really good memories are associated with camouflage.
