It's the French and the Belgians who do what they do best. It's a bizarre, visually ingenious, exciting and exciting challenge. Director Jaco van Dormael takes us into the world of Georges, a patient with Down syndrome and his striving for a meaningful relationship with someone, just everyone. It does not take place in a condescending manner, but with a great sense of fun and integrity. Georges's corporate guru game, Harry is stunningly supported - going from comedy to tragedy back to comedy with breathtaking ease. <br /> <br /> The Eighth Day sets a similar Hollywood fare like the Oscar-winning Rain Man or Robert Barry Levinson Forrest Gump Zemeckis well and really in the shade. Sometimes it brings to mind Milos Forman's humor "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" with shades of Dennis Potter thrown in for good. <br /> <br /> As a blunt emotionally and desperately lonely yuppie, Harry, Daniel Auteuil turns into another sublime performance. But the brilliant Pascal Duquenne suits this as Georges. It is a film about uniformly strong performances and so many unforgettable songs - a shoe store scene, a car show scene, George's dance to "Jesus He Knows Me" Genesis, a conference scene, a fireworks scene. If you have not seen it, there is only one thing to do. All you have to do is rent or take part in a retro cinema show nearby and see what is missing. Better yet, buy this movie. Ordinary genius .....
