It's really an old, charming movie. The locations are great, and the situation is one of those old Prestess movies. Fi you want to watch a movie that does not require anything other than to sit back and relax, that's it. Acting is good, and I really liked Michael Rispoli. He was also in Rounders. And when you slept. The rest of the cast is fun. That's when two people who are going to get married meet the one they really love on the weekend when they're planning their own wedding. I know ... it sounds weird ... but it is. And that makes watching is fun. It will make your friend hug or leave you, but at least you will know.
