I do not want to wander around the story for a long time - you've seen the trailer and if you do not have it online. I do not recommend him, however - he was poorly made and did not pack any laughter or magic from the film. So those who avoid this movie because of a bad trailer should give it a chance. It's really fun. I was delighted with the ingenuity and originality of this film. The first 40 minutes had me in hysteria - my only problem was that it unnecessarily turned into a bad movie by Austin Powers in the 20th final. However, this is one of the few films in which the ending of the campaign did not make me dislike the rest of the movie (which usually happens). Everyone gives a great performance (especially Joan Cusack) and there are really great moments. Personally, I plan to see him again when he comes out - just to catch all the details I laughed at first watching!
