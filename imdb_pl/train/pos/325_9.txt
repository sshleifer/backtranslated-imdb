It's a great movie - especially compared to the time of the tiring seriousness of today's politically-minded filmmakers. A film that so easily combines sex, relations between the sexes, politics and art is a rarity today. While the turbulent optimism of the sixties can not be recovered, I think we can at least learn lessons from the airy energy and the charm of the film. I do not know what those who call the film "boring" were watching - there are so many things in it that it is never the same movie for more than 15 minutes.
