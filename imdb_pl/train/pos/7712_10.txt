Level One, Horror. <br /> <br /> When I saw this movie for the first time at the age of 10, I knew it would give me nightmares. Did that. Amazingly, as I recall, it was sound as much as the sight of the monster that caused it. <br /> <br /> Second level, psychoanalytic theory. <br /> <br /> Later as an adult, I saw the history of what it was: what if the wild, unrestrained instincts that we all suppress were manifested. <br /> <br /> Level three, pure science fiction. <br /> <br /> The best way to understand the story "What if" comes from the science fiction genre. This is pure science fiction, not "cowboys in space", which today belong to the genre. <br /> <br /> After 43 years, Forbidden Planet remains the largest of all science fiction movies. If you're planning a remake, SKG or Lucas, watch out!
