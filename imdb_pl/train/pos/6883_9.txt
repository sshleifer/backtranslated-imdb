In rare cases, a movie appears that has the power to broaden the mind, warm the heart and touch the soul itself. "LOU" is a movie. I got "LOU" from my wife who received it from a neighbor who is in the film industry. She watched it for the second time with me. We were both charmed. Its as if for the first time again. <br /> <br /> "LOU" is a magic song aimed at sending you back to the moment all your dramas have begun. He does it with constant entertainment. Brest's acting and the director do not allow you to look away from the screen. He creates a character who disarms the bunny, who stutters, stutters innocence, but warmth brings with him such unsatisfied honesty that you forget that you are watching a movie. When epiphany hits a brilliant climax, I saw my wife in tears for the second time. <br /> <br /> As a life coach, I facilitate individual development and transformation, and this film is "must see". Life coaches and anyone looking for their own development and transformation. It's a wonderful, creative masterpiece with the power to change life!
