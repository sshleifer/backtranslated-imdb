Lindy (Meryl Streep) and her husband Michael (Sam Neill) just greeted her daughter Azaria. As Seventh-day Adventists, they live their beliefs every day and soon Azaria devotes herself to God in her church, and the two older boys look at them. Michael has holidays, and the family decides to go to Ayer's Rock, one of the most impressive tourist destinations in Australia. Without being rich, family camps near the place. After a great first day, Linda puts baby Azaria to sleep in one of the tents. Suddenly he hears the crying of Azaria. When Linda runs up to the tent, the dingo dog just shakes his head. The child disappeared and soon, just like dingo. Although the whole camp is looking for a child, it was not found. To sum up, that he is dead and that the dingo has gone away from his beloved child, the chamberlains are fighting to accept God's decision and continue their lives. But, unfortunately, the story becomes sensational in the media and soon the story goes that Lindy murdered the child. Then she is arrested and brought to justice. How could this happen? It's a great show of real events that show how the "mafia rule" is not a figment of imagination. The whole country turns against Chamberlains, partly because they are perceived as strange. Streep gives her the best results ever, as Linda's complex, whose own strong will works on her every step of the way. Similarly, Neill does a wonderful job as uncertain and confused Micha≈Ç. The cast is one of the biggest in history, with performances by people from all over the country who make copies of Linda's case. Costumes, scenery, script, direction and production are at the very end. If you have never seen or heard about this film, make it immediately. It is not far from reality to say that this "Cry" should be seen by all who care about the film and the abused power of the media.
