A wonderfully bizarre movie with enough curves on the pretzels sack. Parker Posey plays Fay Grim as a sexy, vulnerable, loving mother who may or may not be what she seems. This story is very bold, and the dialogue skilfully understated. Traces of humor and intrigue, none of which exceeds the characteristics of Posey so well withdraws. The supporting staff is a star. The downside? This movie requires your full attention, almost until you stop the movie and take notes. Posey has more sex appeal in raising eyebrows than most actresses in the whole body. It's worth your time, even if you do not understand the solution.
