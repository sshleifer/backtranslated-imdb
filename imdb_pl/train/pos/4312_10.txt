If you have not seen this amazing movie about life in the 90s (in L.A.), you missed a special feast. This is one of the most amazing and powerful movies ever made about the lives of Americans in the 90s, and even moves into today's world in which we live. It covers everything from raising a child, prejudice (more than one way), love, adultery, empty nest syndrome, selfishness, etc., and the list goes on. This story develops at the ultimate climax, and when nothing else matters, it always returns to love with friends and family and love of life. It helps us dig deep into ourselves and make us look for what we want from life. It makes us ask questions. Have we done enough for others, do we like it, etc. ??? Sit back and enjoy a wonderfully made and emotional movie that I am sure that others will enjoy throughout their lives. <br /> <br /> Look out for the wonderful performance of Mary McDonnell, Kevin Kline and Danny Glover in this whole movie. These actors are amazing and really show the real glow and meaning of what the message is sent to us all. They are 3 of my favorite actors for a lifetime after watching this movie over 10 years ago. I still like to do it. Also enjoy the great soundtrack and do not forget to count how many times did you see the helicopter and try to find out that it is the symbolism of the film? playing a role in every movie he has ever done. He also does a great job in this movie. For most of you this can be a surprise. Sit back, relax and enjoy a really good film production .....
