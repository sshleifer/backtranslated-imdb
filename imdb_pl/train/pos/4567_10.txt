My left foot is an epic outstanding movie, explaining the life and times of Christy Brown, who had cerebral palsy, serious disability and only had the use of the left foot, but he was defiant, he managed to become an artist and writer against all odds <br /> <br / > I've seen this movie many times and every time I see it, I think it's just as brilliant every time. I wonder how this amazing film did not win an Oscar for the best picture, it is a disagreement given by the academy. Jim Shirdan is one of the greatest directors in the world for me. The screenplay, music and everything else is great in this film. Once the movie is going on, almost everything will feel like a brown household. Ray MacAnally and Brenda Fricker are amazing because parents Cristies and Fiona Shaw are as brilliant as Dr. Eileen Cole, who helps Christy in his fight for rebellion. br /> <br /> The Irish film industry has noticed its name in front of my left foot. My left foot was the beginning of a great period in the Irish film. films as powerful and brilliant as a field, a crying game, in the name of my father and Michael Collins, followed my left foot. These Irish films have been so highly rated around the world and have been nominated for many Oscars and won, a great Period for the Irish film. My left foot is a powerful, outstanding movie. <br /> <br /> Daniel day-lewis plays the crippled Christy Brown so well, and the same goes for Hugh for Conner, who plays young Christy. These two performances are the two best-ever movie performances, especially the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis which I would consider as silent as Antony Hopkins in silent lamb. Daniel day-lewis proved in his career that he is a great actor. <br /> <br /> is a great masterpiece in the film, see!
