This is the first of the Guinea Pig series and is one of the most infamous films from the collection. <br /> <br /> It took me a long time to finally get up and get a copy of this notorious group of movies. I bought a set of boxes for guinea pigs and decided to watch the collection by the release date. So I threw this sucker and sat down. <br /> <br /> From what I read on the internet, and realizing the content involved in this movie, I expected to test my nerves in full force. It did not work. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on a group of men who kidnap a woman and start to torture her with the hope of discovering the human breakthrough and how long a person can tolerate pain. <br /> <br /> Sounds like one sick move? Wrong. The film is not shocking. Perhaps because I became anesthetized over the years, I'm doing it with my obsession with horror, but I think it's safe to say that any true gorehound can sit with it without a problem. a person who does not have a good knowledge of this type of film, most likely will be overwhelmed and outraged by the images he sees on the screen. Although it did not shock me, the movie contains some rather exciting and graphic scenes of violence. Including plucking nails, intestines thrown on an unconscious woman and a needle in the eye. <br /> <br /> In general, I think that most of the gorehounds on this board should just get a copy of this movie for its novelty, but I suggest that every new user of this type of movie comes to this.
