I saw this movie in a London cinema in 1975 and have not seen it ever since. I find it funny. I loved the originality. It's rare for someone to make a movie - and that's sad too. <br /> <br /> I mean, I used to read the book "The Black Hotel" - and as a movie fan I always "picture" books as films. Kinda, "customize" them, you know? But when I read this, I thought it would be a great movie - but of course it would have to be "adapted" - to the point that it would not have much to do with the book. <br /> <br /> But then I thought, well WHY? Of course, you will never be able to watch it on TV on Sunday afternoon, but on condition that it will be screened in the ADULT cinemas who knew what it contains, where is HARM? Shit, my civil liberties have been crushed here. The director SHOULD be able to make a literal film adaptation of "The Black Hotel". <br /> <br /> In an ideal world, adult censorship should NOT EXIST. But unfortunately, although I accept this in SMART adults, such freedom may be harmless, there will always be those who lack rationality to distinguish fantasy from reality and who can be stimulated to commit evil deeds. <br /> <br /> However, it is difficult to see how "La Bete" belongs to this category. <br /> <br /> After appearing in England, the British censor dismissed him from his hand. Despite the relaxation of nudity in 1969, Given the theoretical topic of bestiality in the film, if the censor gave ANY of this, he would look for a new job on Monday. <br /> <br /> BUT ... there was an alternative in those days. The G.L.C. It was a local council with a department that was able to give the film only to London, where viewers were considered to be more "sopisticated" than those who lived in the forests. <br /> <br /> The video was duly submitted and COMPLETED. However, later it turned out that the "management" consisted of only four people - three voted, plus the "chairman". And in the day one of the voters was sick. In this way, the other two voters and the chairman sat down to watch "La Bete". <br /> <br /> One of the voters thought, like me, that the film is funny and will not encourage anyone to commit bad deeds. The second one lacked imagination and simply considered the piece disgusting. And the chairman did not understand it, so he decided to make a mistake on the side of FREEDOM. <br /> <br /> When the missing voters finally saw the movie, they also thought it was disgusting, but it was too late! The film received the "X-London" certificate and was opened to a mixed response. The G.L.C. the table of film censorship was soon dissolved! In this way, "La Bete" opened in London only what is best known as FLUKE! But I'm glad that it was. Great! If you did not see him, do it. This is FANTASY and as such is much less disturbing than most things that you can see in the news these days ...
