Unfortunately for myself - I came across this performance late in my life. I only caught a few episodes (about three) before it was canceled by ABC. I loved the characters and the story - but above all the GREAT actors! I was a fan of Sex and the City, so I saw two characters that I recognized (Bridget Moynahan was and The Character "Todd" was "Smith Jared"), as well as Jay Hernandez (From Carlito's Way: Rise To Power) and Erika Christensen (Swimfan) . I love watching young actors who got their pay, and felt that this program would continue to drive their career. I hope that at least it will be discontinued on DVD, or maybe WB will pick it up for the second season? In the meantime, I watch it on the ABC website from the very beginning.
