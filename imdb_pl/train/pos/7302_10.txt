In this letter, "Halloween" by John Carpenter is approaching the 30th anniversary. Since then, 7 sequels have been born, a remake, a whole mess of imitations and every year around Halloween, when they make these letters, "Top 10 Scariest Movies" are always there. It's amazing for a movie that was made for a budget of about $ 300,000 and contained an almost completely unknown cast of young talent. I could continue and continue, but the most important question is: how is the film today? And all I can say is fantastic! <br /> <br /> Advantages: A simple but scary sequence of opening subtitles that really sets the mood. An unforgettable and creepy result from the director / co-writer John Carpenter and Alan Howarth. Great photos. The starry direction of Carpenter, who maintains a high level of tension, takes great pictures and is careful not to show too much of his villain. Good performances from the then unknown cast. Good sense of humor. Michael Myers is one terrible, bad guy. Many amazing moments that will stay with you. The pace is slow, but stable and never lasts. Unlike most other slasher movies, this is more about uncertainty and terror than blood and a large number of bodies. Cons: Probably not as bad now as it was then. Many of them really stand out. <br /> <br /> Final thoughts: I would like to start this part with the statement that this is not my favorite film from the series. I know this is not a popular opinion, but I really feel that way. Nevertheless, it is a really important film that reaches new generations of cinema lovers. And just because it has been converted into a new generation, it does not mean that it will be forgotten. No way, no, how. <br /> <br /> My rating: 5/5
