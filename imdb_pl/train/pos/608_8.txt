Watching this movie I was a bit skeptical because fantasy movies are not always my cup of tea. Especially romantic fantasy. <br /> <br /> I did not know much that I was on a movie magic ride. Everything in the film, from plot to dialogue and effects, was very close to perfection. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes shines like a star in this movie. From the beginning to the end, you fall in love with this character more and more. <br /> <br /> Michelle Pfeiffer is dangerous as an evil witch who wants to win a star of eternal youth and beauty. <br /> <br /> Robert De Niro is a nice character that gives the audience the greatest comic relief, because the film is gaining momentum towards the culmination. <br /> <br /> In general, it was a movie that surprised and amazed me as a movie fan. If you're looking for a fun and enjoyable movie that will be fun for both kids and adults, Stardust is the best solution.
