I do not know if it contains any spoilers or not, but I do not want to risk being blacklisted until 3462. <br /> <br /> I do not entirely agree with the comments of the viewers that described * Guns, Germs and Steel * as "politically correct" and "neo-Marxist." They could not watch the same series as * I *. <br /> <br /> The * I * series looked at the history of European colonization in the Americas and South Africa without any inaccuracies. I did not see anything in the series that portrayed Europeans as bad people who were lucky, although Europeans were often * lucky - and there is nothing wrong with happiness. Nor did I see the natives depicted as poor little innocent things. If anything, Inka was rather arrogant - as might be expected, every leader would deal with foreigners if his country was not captured in a living memory by any other world power. <br /> <br /> I certainly have not seen anything that could be considered Marxist or neo-Marxist, except for the most incredibly flexible imagination. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, many African nations * have * built-in resistance to malaria and other tropical diseases that Europeans are missing. At a time when they were at the peak of their successes, the Aztec, Maya and Inca civilizations * were * as advanced as others in the world - and as rich; sometimes more. Populations of Native Americans and Khoi-San * have been decimated by smallpox and other diseases introduced by Europeans; just like the European colonists have been decimated by tropical diseases such as malaria. (NOTE: The Khoi-San peoples are completely different from all other sub-Saharan African peoples.) <br /> <br /> So I do not see what some other commentators complain about. The only thing I can complain about is that the series does not tell me anything I did not know before I finished seventh grade. In this movie there is nothing new in historical information. However, it presents some nice dramatic events, such as the conquest of the Incas; production values ​​are very high; and fills in a few holes here and there that were not discussed in Mrs. Gruber's social science lesson from the sixth hour at the gymnasium in Milan. <br /> <br /> If you rent or buy, assuming that you have decent primary and / or secondary education, you will not learn anything new, but you will have a pleasant and fun time to learn what you have already learned (or you should learn) before you go to high school.
