When I bought the Toy Story tape, when it appeared in Video after the premiere in cinemas, I saw the trailer of the one who told the creators of Toy Story. As soon as I saw that I knew it would be a good feature! I was right! Bug's life as Toy Story is a great story, great characters and great animation. My favorite characters are Dim the rhino Beetle, by Brad Garrett and Hemlich Caterpillar, whose voice was taken by the late Pixar Storyman Joe Ranft. My favorite scene is that Slim the chick (David Hyde Pierce) raises Hemlich, trying to distract Bird and Hemlich from "You hoo Mr. And what about a cool tasting worm on a stick, and Slim on a freak! Snap! I just died of laughter on this scene. Being a big fan of insects, I think that A Bug's Life is my favorite Pixar, although I know that many people consider it to be the worst Pixar movie ever! I do not know how you hate the Pixar movie! I think they are pretty good movies! Good job PIXAR!
