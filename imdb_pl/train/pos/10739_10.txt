An amazing document. I've seen it on the original airdate and on the DVD several times over the last few years. I was shocked that he was not even nominated for an Oscar for the best documentary in 2002, in which he was released. No other document is even close. <br /> <br /> Recently he was on TV for the 5th anniversary, but I missed the added segment "where are now" at the end, except that I caught that tons now works the hazmat unit. <br /> <br /> I have seen criticism of documentary films from several people on this list. I do not see how it could be done differently. They had less than six months to collect it and send it up. The DVD contains more materials and background. <br /> <br /> I am also surprised that, according to IMDb.com, my brother did not have any projects in four years. What they were doing?
