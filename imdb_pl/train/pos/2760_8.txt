Everyone we meet influences our thinking, modifies our ways, a little bit of this person fits on us. "Eighth day" takes up this topic (compare "Rainmaker"). In this video, Harry (Daniel Auteuil) an expert in sales psychology meets with Georges (Pascal Duquenne), a child with Down syndrome on the run. The winning performances of both actors give this film its main strength. The opening sequence is perfect when Georges relates his theory about the creation of the world, and in the final scene we discover what God created on the eighth day. There are several moments in history that are very frustrating for Harry. For example, Georges, who is completely uninhibited, requires a pair of expensive shoes and does not have enough money. It's a scene in which you laugh at your tears. I liked the scene where Down Syndrome syndrome escapes by bus and gate to the Paradis theme park during a trip to Galeria Sztuki. The most humorous of all embarrassment is the scene in which Harry and Georges pass the float on the highway and, looking back, Georges gives the driver an unpleasant greeting. But there are also delicate scenes, especially impressive close-ups of hands - hands that feel the sun, wind and rain, hands reaching up, hands reaching and squeezing in love and friendship. This is a real cinema that touches the heart. There are very moving scenes in which Georges proposes to Nathalie, where Georges embraces Harry's head in his arms, where Georges continues to call his beloved mom, where Georges teaches Harry to laugh. beautiful - the very presence of grass (Do you know that she is crying when you cut her down?), trees above your head, birds singing, small insects - all wonderful creatures of nature. Everyone is where you can enjoy, if you just lie (like Harry and Georges) look around and listen ...... A beautiful movie.
