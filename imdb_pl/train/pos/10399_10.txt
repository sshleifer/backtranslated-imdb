It was a favorite of my childhood - I remember seeing him on TV and I loved him every time. Now that I've grown up and have my own child, I wanted to introduce him to this classic movie. We watched it last Friday and liked it. During the fight, Abu with the giant spider, my son's hand sneaked in and grabbed mine - he was really scared. "Will he beat the spider, Poppa?" Look, you'll see. There is no historical frame of reference to speak (eight years old), so Baghdad under Haroun al-Raschid's grandson might well be Ozem under Ozima. <br /> <br /> I think he particularly liked how much heroism and bravado were committed by a thief boy, not by an adult king. In fact, if you slightly deconstruct the narrative of the film, the king is a thief's helper, not a hero - which must be very rewarding for ingenious, adventurous young boys. <br /> <br /> It's definitely a piece from the era - I suspect that before it's eleven or twelve, my son thinks he's "kitschy" or any other word will be used by the next generation. The love story is barely one-dimensional - as a cynical friend commented: "Why does Ahmad love the princess? Because the narrative requires it. " Equally unlikely is Abu's willingness to put himself in danger (many times) for the unconscious, embraced by the love of the overthrown king. But to argue about such things, accepting flying mechanical horses, fifty feet of genes and the Temple of the All-knowing Eye, would be extremely stupid. The satisfaction of the prophecy being fulfilled at the climax of the film is enormous, like the last shot of Abu triumphantly departing on the (stolen) magic carpet, looking for "some fun and adventure!".
