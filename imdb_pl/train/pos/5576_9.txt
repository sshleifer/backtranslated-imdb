This movie is funny! I watched it with my friend and we had to see it again. This movie is not intended for movie viewers who will only watch Oscar nominated films (you know who you are). <br /> "Bita" is a light comedy that made me laugh all the time. He does not take himself too seriously and should be observed with his friends, not with his girlfriend. You will not win any prizes, but you only have to appreciate them. That's right, some jokes are humor in the toilet, but it's not necessarily a bad thing. Sometimes, everyone can use it. Some people have to brighten up and see "Bita" for what it is and not what it is not. <br /> <br /> **** 1/4 of *****
