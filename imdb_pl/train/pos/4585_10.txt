This movie is the best for Jackie. I still do not have enough of watching his best stuntmen. I also like these bad guys in this movie (an old man looks like a Chinese version of John Howard). Unlike Jackie's other works, this movie also has a great storyline and I recommend it to all of Jackie's fans.
