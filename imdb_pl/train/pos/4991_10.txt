It is a pity that this film is so difficult to get in the US. I found it through a rare video distributor and it was definitely worth it. This is without a doubt the best film made in the pre-code era and the best movie from the 1930s. The masterly director Frank Borzage made great films about depression, and thanks to MAN'S CASTLE he created a fairy tale among the hardships of the era. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young and Spencer Tracy have wonderful chemistry to make this movie a wonderful romance. Trina Younga is sweet and hopeful, and Bill Tracy is rough and closed. The dynamics between the character creates one of the most difficult, but finally rewards the relationship on the film. <br /> <br /> MAN'S CASTLE is the softest introductory movie I've ever seen. Borzage uses a hazy and dreamy technique to change the squatting village in which Bill and Trina live in the palace. Difficulties associated with depression are never ignored, in fact they form an integral part of the film. But because Borzage creates a film as a soft fairy tale, the love between the characters makes the situation seem less severe. This makes the film warm and affectionate. <br /> <br /> MAN CASTLE is the crowning of the pre-code era. If only more people could see it.
