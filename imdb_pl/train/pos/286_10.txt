I read a lot of approvals when it was in cinemas and they were all bad ... I think you have to be a certain type of person to enjoy these movies. If you are not a person who liked Walton or Little House ... You do not understand or enjoy these movies ... <br /> <br /> Now about Loves Abiding Joy ... I knew that was the bad start of the movie .... I would like him to show more ending instead of letting you think. This movie has a lot to do with Jeff ... he's 6 years later, so you know that Girls will be interested. <br /> <br /> I want to say that I have liked all 4 films so far. ... I'm not crazy about books ... I can not wait for the next movie. The way Clark's conversations will get you every time. I would love Jan Jones to appear ... maybe a family reunion or something like that.
