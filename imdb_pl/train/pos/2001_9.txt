I was lucky to see "Oliver!" In 1968 on the big screen cinema in Boston, when I was a young teenager. Later, in the summer of 1969, I was pleased to see that the movie still plays in the well-known cinema at Leicester Square in London, after earning an Oscar for the best film of the previous year. <br /> <br /> The success of "Oliver!" both on the stage and on the screen reminded that not all talent begins on Broadway and ends in Hollywood. This legendary story of Charles Dickens, which is part of the literary heritage of all English-speaking people, was superbly transferred to the London stage by Lionel Bart from Great Britain. His charming musical has become a hit in New York and around the world. The film adaptation was made in England in the summer of 1967, and then released in 1968. Music sets and numbers are amazing. The song "Who Will Buy?" Required hundreds of actors, and the British director really deserved his Oscar for putting them together in a unified way. Some of the Canadian and American talents are also part of this great production, but it is mainly a tribute to the excellent craft of British film studios such as Shepperton. Good performance! Other film studios at Elstree, Boreham Wood, Bray, Denham and Ealing also gave the world many movies that can be appreciated over the years.
