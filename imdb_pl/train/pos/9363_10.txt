This movie was amazing, it's the kind of movie you're watching, and instead of looking at other actor's movies, you're looking at other director / writer films. Sandler did a good job, working on a figure outside of his comfort zone, and always good Cheadle did a great job. This movie is great for a mature intelligent audience. Acting was fantastic and can only be surpassed by writing and directing a film. This film focuses on real Americans, the past generation, no stereotypes or racism, only people who have gathered and realized the true meaning of life. This movie is about losing and dealing. Instead of choosing Psychiatry, he defines it, not as someone who heals you magically, but rather through the need to speak with affection to an impartial person whom you can trust, will not judge you, but rather guide you through your thoughts. This movie is amazing!
