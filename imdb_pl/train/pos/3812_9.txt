It's a real eye candy. A world with floating islands and flying ancient cities. Huge monsters, whose preferred method of attack is to cast cathedrals on opponents ... Who can resist? An ancient prophecy, a bunch of would-be heroes and a charming princess in search of your hero ... sounds familiar ...? Yes, we've heard this song before. But you will forget about it, looking at the spectacular scenery. <br /> <br /> This movie is cool to watch when it lasts. But after leaving the cinema, you'll miss some more stories. <br /> <br /> What's behind the 30-year-old wheel? What drove the knight mad? Who built all these great monuments, castles and cities ... and why are they falling apart? And beyond this one group of farmers, where are the people? Really, this picture looks so intriguing, but it is not the Lord of the Rings.
