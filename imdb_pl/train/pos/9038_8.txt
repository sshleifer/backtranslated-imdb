I loved the October sky. I liked music the most. It worked in two ways: in the first hour of the movie, it gives the viewer a time frame. This is done by playing songs from the late fifties. In the second hour the instrumental result is taken over. Music fits perfectly into the mood of the film. <br /> <br /> I not only enjoyed the music, but also enjoyed the cast. Jake Gyllenhaal as Homer Hickam was a particularly surprising for me. He gave a first-class performance, as did Chris Owen (Quentin) and Chris Cooper (John Hickam). <br /> <br /> I saw this movie about escaping from life, which has already been prepared for you twice and I enjoyed myself every time.
