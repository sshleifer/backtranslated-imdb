Your average psychotic variety of the garden variety (deliciously tasted with the awkward joy of Stephen Sachs) rejects various weak, young "adults" (to use the term very loosely) at Dayton Hall University, which is closed due to demolition. Equipped with frightening acting throughout the cast (Daphne Zuniga is doing his disgraceful and inauspicious film debut here as Debbie, bimbo, who has his head crushed by a car!), Strong corpse by 10, fine make-up f / x Matthew Mungle, some bloody murders ( hitting a baseball bat, strangling chicken wire, your standard drill through the head, something of a macabre thing), unexpected surprise with the end of the surprise, which was later copied in Intruder, Christopher's terrifying result ("Hellraiser") Young, a light bit of disinterested nakedness women and the endearingly incompetent direction of Jeffrey Obrow and Steve Carpenter (who also blessed us with "The Power" and "The Kindred"), this terribly terrible monstrosity of slice-and-snippets. Sizes are just as pleasant, and at the same time cheerful and gloomy.
