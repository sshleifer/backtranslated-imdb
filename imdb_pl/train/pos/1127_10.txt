I only saw IPHIGENIA once, almost 30 years ago, but it has haunted me since. <br /> <br /> One sequence is particularly important and could have been invented by a great director like undoubtedly Michael Cacoyanis. <br /> <br /> Context: the weight of history and the powerful army and fleet rest on the shoulders of King Agamemnon. The act of sacrilege made the seas more difficult, threatening his great expedition to Troy. He is told that he must sacrifice his daughter Apollo Iphigenia to get the wind for the sails of Thousand Ships. Initially, he objects, but he comes and cheats on his wife Clytemenstra to bring her daughter to the Greek camp to marry the greatest of all warriors, Achilles. <br /> <br /> Klitajmestra and Iphigenia arrive, learn about the sacrifice and the rage of the gods for protection and revenge. Meanwhile, proud Achilles discovers that his name has been used in this deceitful, dishonorable way. He climbs up the hill to tell Iphigenia that he will protect her. <br /> <br /> Shot: the camera circles two young people without looking directly at each other. They mourn their fate and the weakness of people who deceive their loved ones and the lust for war. Suddenly, they stare at each other and for a moment we feel both their power and beauty, and without expression - with the exception of the camera - the irony that at other times, elsewhere, perhaps they would love and be married. It is a sharp and sad epiphany, which lasts only for a moment. <br /> <br /> In what direction! What camera! What a story!
