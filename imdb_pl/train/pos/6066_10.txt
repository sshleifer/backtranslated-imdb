When I saw this movie for the first time, it was a long time ago on VHS-Video. I liked the movie because it was fun and exciting. A few years ago I saw another movie, entitled: * Amazing Andy Colby's adventure * This movie uses fragments * Wizards of the Lost Kingdom *. They called this film "KOR conquest". I started looking for "KOR" -Movie many years, because I wanted to see the whole movie, not only the parts that were used in * Andy Colby * -Movie. No store had borrowed Kor-Movie and no store knew this movie. I watched my old VHS tapes for years, which I had at home, and what a miracle ... I had this film for many years back at home, but the movie had a different title because it has 3 or 4 titles in Germany. So I was happy that I found this tape at home and this time I had more time to re-watch * KOR the Conqueror. Music is great during the movie in the hole, but the best part of filming in combination with music is the moment when KOR goes drunk by the green forest. The music in the background had some magic. I like Bo Svenson, and also the boy who played Simona in the movie. Both of them did their job very well. Manfred Kraatz, Germany, October 26, 2004. Thanks to everyone for reading my comment.
