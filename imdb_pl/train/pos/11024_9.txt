This movie is just great. It's funny from beginning to end, you'll always be on the edge of your place in the whole movie. In my opinion, this film is very underestimated by critics. <br /> <br /> Sly fits perfectly with the role of the well-trained mountain rescue guy Gabe Walker. With him, Michael Rooker looks great as Hal Tucker. And then, John Lithgow, one of the best performances I've seen as a villain. <br /> <br /> And the fact that 75% of the movie takes place upstairs with a whole lot of bad people doing a lot of action! <br /> <br /> A brilliant movie!
