More TV movies should be like this one. I saw it in the year 93 when he was the first on TV. Helen Hunt and Steven Weber were wonderful, giving very rough and realistic performances. Weber was particularly good, performing in an extremely frightening and understated performance as a molesting child / assassin. This movie really increased my respect for Hunt as an actress. The director also directed "Hoosiers", which was somehow formal and exciting. But the direction in both these works has the same raw, simple realism that is so appealing. If you like unpredictable and overflowing TV movies, see if you can. The story of Hunt and Fahey's affair is also attractive, without diminishing the main story.
