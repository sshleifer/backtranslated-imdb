Movie trailers can show off-the-mainstream violence or sexuality scenes, but these scenes are only rare fragments selected to attract audiences. They are, of course, showing the main message of the movie: <br /> <br /> People who are constantly kicked in the head in their work and life, using the power they can have elsewhere to notoriously oppress others. And at the end of the oppression chain, mainly women. <br /> <br /> The film showing it as brutally as Hundstage is certainly difficult, but the necessity to survive such a life is even more difficult. <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie is similar to Short Cuts, but it's made up of documentary episodes where people like your neighbor are playing in the way they are. Without glare and disturbing, without hope. His documentary style makes the film even more disturbing because you realize that such people are there and there are many of them, although our society is focused on a nice external appearance. Somewhere, the porn industry has to run its business, somewhere there must be unreported domestic violence, somewhere the hopes must break down. I certainly know such people. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a movie without any funny scenes (some people may think that a disabled woman repeats ten best supermarkets is funny, but it's really happening) and without any melodramatic, go watch this movie. However, it will lose when you focus on the subtitles I'm afraid of, because the subtitles can not transfer accents.
