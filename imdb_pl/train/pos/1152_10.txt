The scene in which Sally Field and Whoopi Goldberg are going to the mall to revive Sally's fading ghosts is enough to enjoy this movie, but wait! There's more! It is a tacky good broadcast of day television, movie stars on the way down (and above) and the horrors of love. Robert Downey Jr. shows the lighter side of his genius, and Cathy Moriarty is great. Dialogue is witty, and physical humor performed with extraordinary skill. It's a movie that will appeal to those who really like the art of acting, directing and writing.
