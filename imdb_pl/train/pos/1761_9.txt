Only once in a while we get a R rated comedy that attracts the time and attention of everyone. This is an even rarer case when critics like it. I just got back from The 40 Year-Old Virgin and I can honestly say that it was one of the biggest laughs in my life. I went to show 10:35 and every government was full. Not only that, everyone was laughing all the time with their ass. It's two hours without a break. I dare to see this movie and not laugh. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple. The man is forty years old and is a virgin. However, with this simple, five-second joke, we get a deep, complex story that is not only one of the funniest witnesses, but has real lessons behind it. Steve Carell stars as Andy Stitzer, The 40 Year-Old Virgin. We know Steve Carell, as, in my opinion, one of the best thieves of the scene of all time. Steve Carell, stealing the amusing scenes of Bruce the Almighty, and especially Anchorman, has come a long way, as he finally, with pride, gets his moment to shine as a star. Nobody will forget his name when they witness this comically entertaining, entertaining, funny comedy. <br /> <br /> The beauty of the film is not 100% silly. The genius writing of Judd Apatow and Steve Carell really has a purpose and it is not just one hellish story to tell. Behind the primitiveness and the vulgar non-stop movie, you can learn an important lesson. Although the film is not presented in the best possible way, the movie gives us more than just a pleasant time. His greedy attitude will make you laugh all the time, and at the same time we see real life struggles of people like Andy and his colleagues. The end could not be better. It not only provides what we promise, but also gives one of the most memorable numbers the comedy has ever seen. It would be ideal if Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson appeared in some way, but you can not win all of them, now you can. <br /> <br /> Finally, I think that, as Roger Ebert put it, Catherine Keener gives you an inexplicable, excellent performance as Trish, the only woman for whom Andy has her heart. Not only is he laughing, but he is also crazy to see how much he feeds this story. She has been cast perfectly in this role, and she and Carell have a great, not to say, fun chemistry on the screen. <br /> <br /> Canadian champions, once again, defies Ontario with 14A, while British Columbia, Alberta and Manitoba slapped 40-year-old Virginia 18A. The same thing happened with the Four Brothers, in my opinion, the second best film of the year, and I can honestly say that I love Ontario because of it more and more. To all of you teens who are out there in the States: Good luck, sneaking! <br /> <br /> In general, Steve Carell gives one of the funniest performances I've ever seen, and almost everyone in the cast splits up into laughter. Everyone will be delighted by the 40-year-old Virgin of this summer and I encourage everyone to see it as soon as possible. This is the best comedy of the year. He defeats The Longest Yard, The Wedding Crashers and of course the last memorable comedy of Apatova and Carella Anchorman. <br /> <br /> This is a comic masterpiece and deserves extraordinary praise from critics who have loved this. Each of my favorite critics was delighted and immediately deserves a place in the IMDb Top 250. Steve Carell is a big star. Watch now one of the brightest of this summer. <br /> <br /> My rating: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Objectively? 9/10 <br /> <br /> Subjectively? 10/10 <br /> <br /> Eliason A.
