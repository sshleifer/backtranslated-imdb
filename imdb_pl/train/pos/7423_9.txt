I recently watched the movie version of 54 from Judy and appreciated the story and the music, but it turned out that the film did not attract my attention. I expected that the remake of '76 would be the same story, except for Barbra's turn. I was pleasantly surprised - it was a much more realistic and modern look at fame, money, love and the price of it all. This version is much more real than the version from '54, with probably better music, better acting, more thrilling plot and, of course, deeper love. I do not understand why the previous movie is on the list of the 100 best American film institutes, while this thrilling remake is not visible on the list of critics.
