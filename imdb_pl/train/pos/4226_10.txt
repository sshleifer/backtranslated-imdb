I have a lot of time for all Columbo movies, but this one was exceptionally well written and the solution was very effective at the end. However, my main memory is the opening of the stage in the middle of the movie, between Columbo and the murderer (sorry if I do not remember all this). This is the most striking Columbo picture I've seen: the view comes from the darkness of the locker in which the victim was murdered, and from the room that is lit by daylight. Columbo sits in a high-backed chair, facing the door (and us), contemplating the sideboard and almost in silhouette thanks to the contrast of light. There's no sound. The camera slowly leaves the room and approaches him. He is deep in meditation, gently breathing his cigar, whirling smoke from a cigar that slowly moves upward as he thinks. Then the dialogue begins. Magnificent.
