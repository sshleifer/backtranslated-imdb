Sure, the plot is not Oldboy. It seems that the only "great" movies these days are surprisingly shocking or high budget / hypnotized in some way. <br /> <br /> Spin Kick is a drama / comedy about a group of people who decide to throw their hearts tae kwon into. Regardless of what you expect from this movie, you will certainly feel moved by the work, pain and expectations that the characters experience. Although sometimes comedy, many moments and characters are beautifully presented: there is an old guardian who treats things too seriously, hooligan turned a good guy who just wants a second chance in life, a gentle deputy team who would die happy if he just won once in life and many other characters with their own problems - but above all their own hopes and dreams. Although the plot and goals of the film are simple, these aspects of the film simply emphasize the development of the characters when they overcome personal and interpersonal fights. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie will make you feel fresh, determined and happy.
