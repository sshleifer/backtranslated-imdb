This episode from the first season slightly approaches the controversy with a whole sex bend angle. I imagine that before this process is over, there would be a significant edition to appease censorship. <br /> <br /> The story itself is original and well written, and the directing is complemented by great acting (Nicholas Lea debuts in X-Files, though not as Agent Krycek, but as a victim called Michael). I particularly liked embedded and finished . <br /> <br /> It's different, but pleasant. Ignore any bad reviews that you can hear. Check it out yourself and then judgment
