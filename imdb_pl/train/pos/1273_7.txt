A simple movie at the beginning, a simple movie at the end. He has such an endless and pretending clich√©, but most television films have it in any way. <br /> <br /> Christopher Reeve is doing well as a former compere. It seems to me that marriage between her and the woman for whom she works is a bit strange, but I believe that in the period in which it is contained, it is credible. <br /> <br /> Now, I've seen the edited version of "tv", even if the movie was made and shown in "tv", I also find it a bit strange. But I feel that if I saw the whole piece, I would give him a more probable assessment. <br /> <br /> J.T. Walsh does a good job, not his best role, but still ... a nice job. <br /> <br /> 7/10
