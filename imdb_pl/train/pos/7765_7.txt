Douglas Sirk directs this thrilling drama about an unhappy wealthy. Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack) and Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) are childhood friends with a different view of life. Kyle is the female son of an oil mogul; Mitch works for Hadley Oil Company. They both fall in love with the same woman, Lucy Moore; but Kyle has the means to take her off her feet and marry her. Sister Marylee (Dorothy Malone) seems to be a city nymphoman and carries a torch for Mitch, who always seems to be the one who cleans Hadley's mess. Ambitious with a grudge; a bit above the top, but the stars make it a movie to watch. I was impressed by Malone. Filling in the cast: Robert Keith, Edward Platt, John Lurch and Robert J. Wilke.
