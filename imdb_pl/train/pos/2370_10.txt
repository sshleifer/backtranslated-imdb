This is a great American film about martial arts. The battle scenes were impressive for the American film from the 90s. Of course, the battle scenes are not as good as in Honk Kong movies, actually only a few American movies have battle scenes that are as good as in Honk Kong movies, even today. When you watch a movie about American martial arts, you expect less impressive battle scenes, but you still have some cool moves that can sometimes be surprisingly good, or at least I expect them from these movies. I was impressed by this film. Some of the fight scenes were really impressive, the acting, directing and plot were good enough, so it's really worth watching a movie if you like American martial arts from the 90's.
