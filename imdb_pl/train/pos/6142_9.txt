A wonderful Disney movie with Angela Lansbury in great shape as a middle-aged bride whose interest turns into witchcraft in World War II England. <br /> <br /> Lansbury was about 51 years old at the time of the film and is perfect for some. She is Jessica Fletcher again, but this time for the sake of children or for the mother of England in times of great danger. <br /> <br /> The film tells the adventures of Miss Price (Lansbury) and David Tomlinson as a professor of spells in trying to get some information about spells. These three little lovers who live with Price to escape the London attacks are simply wonderful in this charming movie for all of us, regardless of age. <br /> <br /> It's a pity that Tessie O'Shea, Roddy McDowall and Sam Jaffe have so little to do in this captivating movie. <br /> <br /> I really thought about Ben Stiller film - "Night at the Museum", at the end of the movie, when the relics come alive to fight the Nazi invasion in a small British seaside town.
