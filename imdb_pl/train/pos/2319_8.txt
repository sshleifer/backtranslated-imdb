<br /> <br /> This is a general story about puberty - think "Wedding Member", "Summer 42", "A Summer Place", even "Little Women" - and there are moments in which Mulligan could skip the soup music, do not use slow motion or play in golden, nice scenery. Otherwise, this is done with a rare emotional perfect jump. Nothing is forced, every line has a feeling, and the pace is just right. Even the casting below the list helps: Bigger movie stars with more recognizable personalities could overwhelm the material. Witherspoon is especially perfect: her line readings are fresh and original, and body language is appropriate for a clumsy 14-year-old on the eve of femininity. Waterston is also fine, even if he has to spend most of his time climbing and getting out of his family truck. <br /> <br /> He senses that the creators of the film were aware of their unpromising commercial prospects - no big stars, no big cars, no special effects - and consciously decided that the best movie, the casino will be cursed. He is intimate and honest, and he sticks to the ribs. If you find yourself in the blink of an eye, you do not have to feel cheated.
