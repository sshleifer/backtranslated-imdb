I saw it on the cable in the early 90's and I loved it. I never saw it again until it appeared on the cable last time. I still think it's a great movie in Vietnam. I'm not sure why there is no higher grade. I found everything about this movie. As a veterinarian (not from Vietnam) I can refer to the situation of both Harris and De Niro. I can only imagine that this film is now more poignant with our situation in Iraq. I would like it to be offered more often on the cable so that people can see it. The human harvest on our soldiers does not remain on the battlefield. He was brought home for the rest of his life. And this movie is one of many that make this house very difficult. An excellent movie.
