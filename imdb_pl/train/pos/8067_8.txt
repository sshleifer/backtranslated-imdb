Today, if someone names Victor McLaglen, the answer will probably be "Who?" And maybe "why?" Believe it or not, Victor McLaglen won an Oscar for the best actor in this film, a poor, desperate man who wants to sell his best friend for "Career" in the United States. It's an interesting movie that shows how low even the wealthiest shnooki go only for a few bucks. The film takes place in a British dominated by Ireland, and while all other characters are fighting directly or indirectly for Ireland's political independence, they are afraid only of Mr. McLaglen, who receives money and gets drunk. In the film, one wonders whether political activism is worth all the trouble, because while the activist is trying to say something, many others not only do not care, they do not even know what's going on in this confusion. The morale of this movie is: watch out for a friend, he can sell you for a penny.
