Over the ten years that have passed since Wildside's release, nothing has really come close to its quality in local production. This includes two series of pleasant but overbearing Podbrzyce, which revived the events in the recent criminal history of both Sydney and Melbourne. The Miniseries Blue Murder (in which Tony Martin also appeared, but as someone on the other side of the law) can be an exception. <br /> <br /> Wildside is currently being repeated late at night at ABC. Not watching the show for a long time, I'm still impressed by his uncompromising storylines and very human characters. The cast is excellent: Tony Martin as a detective haunted by the disappearance of his son, Rachael Blake (who later came in fact with Martin) as a social worker struggling with alcoholism and Alex Dimitriades as a young policeman whose gamble is a gamble. Equally good roles are supported by Aaron Pederson, Jessica Napier, Mary Coustas (yes, Effie alone) and young Abbie Cornish. <br /> <br /> ABC inexplicably released only the first few episodes on DVD years ago. The logic of this type of marketing is beyond me, but I'm guessing that it may have something to do with license misunderstandings with the original producers. <br /> <br /> A great series that has aged very well. We hope that the DVD ABC department will work together. <br /> <br /> (According to the moderator on the ABC bulletin board, in December 2009, there will be some further DVD release)
