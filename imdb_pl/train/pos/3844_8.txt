When you read the summary of this film, you may think that it is something weird, and in some ways, for the main character of this movie, Gerard Reve (Jeroen Krabbé) is haunted by visions and hallucinations. The visions that Gerard sees are (more or less) subtle tips on what will happen to him when the story continues, and the viewers can have a great time trying to understand the symbolism used in the film. Despite the use of symbolism and a few hints to end the film, the film maintains a very high level of emotions and is not bored for a minute. This is mainly due to the great performances of Jeroen Krabbé and Renée Soutendijk (Christine) and the great direction of Paul Verhoeven. His style of directing is clearly visible and looking from different points of view can be said that "De Vierde Man" is a typical Verhoeven movie. Not only does this seem typical of people familiar with his American films because of the nudity and brutal graphic scenes, but it will also seem typical of people familiar with his Dutch films because of the same things and his talent for telling great stories. When people watch American films Verhoevensa, short-sighted people can say that there is no talent for telling a good story and focusing only on blood and sex. Some people think so, while I think that he is a very talented director who tries to convey a deeper message in every film. Although this is not a good movie, Hollow Man (his latest American movie) is an example that Verhoeven can do more than science fiction splash movies, and maybe companies should trust him more and offer him more different videos to direct. He needs it. Just watch his Dutch films. Not only do they show that they need a certain amount of freedom, but they also show that he has an extraordinary talent. "De Vierde Man" brought him closer to Hollywood and is certainly one of his best. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
