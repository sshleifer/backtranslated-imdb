I'm not entirely sure if the term "serious comedy" refers to this movie, I'm not even sure if it can be used. In recent years, the movies have been filled with comedy films that are too stupid to even smile. That's why I was considering films that do not meet these requirements as "serious comedies". <br /> <br /> Does the 40-year-old Virgin fit this guild? It's up to you, but in my opinion it's a very funny movie. You laugh a lot and also provide social commentary thanks to really great characters and situations. <br /> <br /> I am pretty, there is over 40-year-old virgin, and even people who do not exactly match these specifications can feel identified by one of the characters in the movie, especially men. <br /> <br /> History, as the title says, concerns Andy, a shy, quiet guy who collects figures, watches the Survivor with his eight-neighbor neighbors and whose favorite band is Asia. <br /> <br /> Kal is Andy's co-worker at SmartTech. He believes Andy is a psychopath until Andy's secret is revealed. Kal is clearly a sexual pervert, but he still seems to get what he wants in the opposite genre. <br /> <br /> David is a passionate guy who is still in love with his ex-girlfriend who escaped with another guy. And Jay, a man in a relationship that seems to be influenced by his constant cheating and getting caught red handed. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure that most of the young people between the ages of 13 and 21 have already watched the movie, but there really is no age limit to be able to enjoy it. So if you have not seen it and you are laughing a bit, with social commentary, then go to the video store and take a break from these deep and depressing independent films. <br /> <br /> This also includes DVD bonuses that you really see from top to bottom.
