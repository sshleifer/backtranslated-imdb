BABY FACE is one of the better "forgotten" movies before the code. It was shown yesterday evening after the version of WATERLOO BRIDGE from 1931 in the TURNER CLASSIC NETWORK network, so I could watch the movie like now, with four plus minutes of restoration. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck lives in East St. Louis (where she could meet the drunken parents of Myra - Mae Clarke - at WATERLOO BRIDGE). Her father is Robert Barrett. She lived with him since her mother's death and (in a restored dialog box) she's been tormenting her since she turned 14. Now she is a resident waitress and part-time fucking in her speech, and her closest friend is Chico (Theresa Harris), an African American who still torments Barrett. This is one of the two advantages of Stanwyck's personality, who is still opposed to his father in the Harris case, threatening to leave if Harris is released (and because it's dirty workers like Nat Pendleton who like to see Stanwyck, Barrett needs to use them the taste of the basket he serves, Barrett must obey him). <br /> <br /> The only guy who comes to speech regularly, Stanwyck likes, is the shoemaker and intellectual Adolf Cragg (Alphonse Ethier), who sees great potential in the impetuous girl, if he just leaves his abandoned home. He also emphasizes the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzche and the idea of ​​the will to power. More on this topic later. <br /> <br /> After he knocks the local political bigwig (Arthur Hohl) and has an argument with Barrett, there is still an explosion that kills Barrett and lets Stanwycek leave his hometown. She and Harris go to New York, they manage to get a free freight wagon, sleeping with a brake (James Murray). They reach New York and after a walk they see the Gotham Trust Company (founded in 1873), A friendly guard tells her where the office is located. <br /> <br /> We slowly observe how Stanwyck enters the corporate ladder to the top, similar (but more disgusting) than Robert Morse dared to HOW TO SUCCESS BUSINESS WITHOUT REALLY TRYING. But Morse was a man in a company dominated by men. Stanwyck knows that her sexual charm is her weapon. He goes through John Wayne, Douglas Dumbrille (part of the movie that I always thought was the most shocking - interestingly - when I watched it), Douglas Wood, Henry Kolker and finally George Brent. Each ends for her, and either is pushed aside when it is no longer usable or destroyed by her. Brent, the new bank president who founded his grandfather, eventually married her - and the film crisis happens when the bank's economic situation is shaken (especially after Brent buys a fortune in jewels and gives her valuable bonds). Brent is accused. Will it keep him? <br /> <br /> SPOILER PODEJŚCIE: <br /> <br /> The only thing that is not allowed in these films is that the then theatrical and moral conventions still dictated the endings. The original tip made Stanwyck board a ship for Europe, leaving Brent for his fate, but realizing he could not do this to him, he would come home and find out that he had shot himself. He ends up with him to the hospital. Now, before the found footage was found, the film ended in that they apparently gave up the money for the bank to save him and retreat back to East St. Louis, to live happily if the poor. <br /> <br /> Neither of them are good endings. Stanwyck should continue his destructive course, with Brent the last of her victims. But even without Breen's office the screenwriters (one was Darryl Zanuck, by the way) thought it necessary to find her a moral center. She does not have - at least she is not there for the powerful men (whom she hates). I do not think that the audience with depression would tolerate such conclusions. <br /> <br /> There are other problems, due to the changing styles of public opinion and changes in society. It was the world of men in the corporate world in 1933, so Stanwyck has his job for her. Wood (when he is dismissed because of indiscretion) admits that he did not want her to work. <br /> <br /> But in 2006, Stanwyck would find a woman anywhere. In the film there appear unpleasant, kitschy remarks (of course some based on jealousy) against Stanwyck from other secretaries and employees at its rapid growth. In 2006, she often confronted women superiors, and she quickly cuts them off her legs. Of course, if he finds one or two lesbians, he can try this path, but he is questionable. And it seems he never meets any homosexuals. They have gay men in business who do not care about her legs or breasts. <br /> <br /> Then there's her mentor, Mr. Cragg. Cragg is being reworked in the "bowdlerized" version to attempt to force her to look for a moral center. In fact, he pushes Nieztsche, but the way the Nazis pushed Nieztsche (in a broader sense) - find the way to power and push it. While Nieztsche sometimes did stress, it was not his theory. Otherwise, nobody would read him today at university courses. Cragg is obviously self-taught, but only half-educated. In short, if someone who thoroughly studied Nieztsche, came face to face with Craggy, he would make him look like a half-educated fool. And this is mentor Stanwyck! A good movie, and worth 10 a day ... but seriously defective.
