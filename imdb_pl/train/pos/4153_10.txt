it was a fantastic episode. I saw a video of him on YouTube and promised that if he ever showed up on television, I would stick to the set to watch. I watched him along with my friend who is just gay, and we both cried at the end. it was a really well written, heartfelt episode of forbidden love between two cops, which I thought was really (in the words of Coop) "Lucky." episodes such as this make Cold Case one of the most captivating and loved works of television magic on CBS. I am looking forward to the next episodes and the replay of "Forever Blue" because I will always watch it.
