The fighting actor finds the best way to break into Hollywood to start knocking out the competition. But what makes Break and Leg a real jewel is a sardonic look at the existence of a fighting (and not so) LA actor. He brings us into this world without effort and irony. It also has a polished look and a very fluent direction under the guidance of Monika Mitchell. Break a Leg is one of those rare independent films that do not reduce the value of production at any level. The letter is strained, dialogue in the first place. Cassini is an actor, and the role really shows his talents. The culminating scene between him and Rene Garcia is a classic classic that can be one of the funniest Hollywood scenes of all time. I saw it at an advanced show, and everyone in the audience laughed in an uncontrollable way and raved about it later.
