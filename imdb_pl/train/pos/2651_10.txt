That's right. The movie is better than the book. Do not get me wrong, I love the book. But the film is much better. This film has Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall at its best. (I have not seen Scatman Crothers and of course Danny Lloyd in anything else.) Some of the ideas used in this movie are better than those used in the book. But I've already talked about those in my mini series commentary. But I missed a few. The film is shot in a better place than in the mini series. REDRUM scenes are more frightening than in the book. So if you're looking for a great movie, get Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. But count on nightmares for three weeks
