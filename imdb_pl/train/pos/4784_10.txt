It's nice to see a movie with real people with honest feelings. Sissy Spacek is as convincing as the simple but nice daughter of Robert Farnsworth, <br /> <br />, who in the end, in his last role, can show what a great actor he was. It's hard to believe it's David Lynch's movie. It is slow, even, sweet and moving. One of the best unless you like car chases, sex scenes and violence.
