Midnight Cowboy is not for everyone. It is raw, painful and realistic, but very funny. The main actors, Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman, who will become Oscar winners, deliver incredible performances. Voight as Texas Hustler, Joe Buck, who migrates from a small town in Texas to New York to become a hustler. He does not apologize for the chosen profession, but it is not so easy. Women from New York, such as the rich lady played by George Johnson and Cass, played by Oscar-nominated Sylvia Miles, differ from the women of Texas. Unfortunately, Buck is trying to escape his past life in Texas. He was brought up by his grandmother, Sally Buck, played by the wonderful actress Ruth White, who died of cancer in 1969. Locations in New York are great, as are the relationships between Fatso played by the heroes of Hoffman and Buck and evolve into a man of friendship with men. Men are fighting for life in New York, not playing according to the rules of how to get a real job. With the development of the film, Buck's past comes to light and is persecuting, but it is not clear. The movie is not intended for children, but compared to today's movies and TV shows, the Midnight Cowboy may be more familiar. I can not forget about young Brenda Vaccaro and an event that can not be forgotten. It's also a tear squeezer from the movie, so throw your tissues out.
