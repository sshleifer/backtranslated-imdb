Based on a true story, this series is a gem of its kind. A slave who becomes a queen, winning the heart of the most powerful man in the village. <br /> <br /> In the city of diamond mining in Tijuco, Brazil, the commissar of diamonds - appointed by the King of Portugal - is the ultimate authority. Growing up in the relative security of her home, young and beautiful Xica da Silva discovers that her world is in danger when she decides to sell her to a brothel in the city, refusing to recognize that the black slave girl may be his daughter. In a desperate attempt to save himself, Xic steals diamonds collected by the diamond commander for the king, intending to use them to escape. The Royal Army arrives to collect the diamonds the very next day, and when the prey is lost, the diamond trader is led out in chains, his family is expropriated and thrown out into the street with only clothes on his back. Martin, son of the diamond commander, swears vengeance. Xica and other slaves, however, are auctioned, and Xica goes to the sergeant's house, the older man, who bought her only to satisfy his lust. However, a new commando with diamonds, elegant and ruthless Joao Fernandes, comes to the city of Tijuco. Immediately struck by the beauty of Xiki, he manipulates the major sergeant to sell it to him. And this is how a love story begins, full of dangers, intrigues and passions, between a deliberate nobleman and an insidious slave who one day becomes a queen. <br /> <br /> The series is full of rich details of the era of belief, superstitions, politics, fashion etc. etc. It really manages to attract your attention to every minute. Sometimes funny with sarcastic and dark humor, full of tension and unexpected twists and turns. "Xica da Silva" is definitely a must. I would like to be able to buy the whole series on DVD.
