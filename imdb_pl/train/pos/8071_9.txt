This film is about Irish rebellion in the 1920s, and more specifically the life of one man after informing his friend about his generosity on his head and the consequences that follow. Watching the movie, I felt that you can take the screenplay and, after a few small updates, do it again, and this, unfortunately, would still suit modern events. But the remake would not be so good. The wonderful performance of Victor McLaglen (for which he deserved an Oscar) and a great band that includes the majority, if not all actors from brogues in Hollywood at the time, most of them are recognizable actors who at the time were or only begin. A very good movie that is worth watching. Highly recommended.
