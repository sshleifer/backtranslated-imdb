This cartoon was strange, but the story had a bit more depth and emotion than other animated films. We have a girl in a camp with a low self-esteem and almost no other friends, except brother and sister who are just as unhappy as her. He reaches the highest point, and when the opportunity arises, he literally has a pact with a devil-like demon. I believe that this film is very faithful to life and when things can not be worse, the girl sees what she has done, feels remorse, then changes, and then helps the dark, mystical being to know the human quality of love. Gemini also improve, helping small bears, and then they also have a sense of self-worth. A very positive message for children, although some elements of the film were weird, it was and still is a nice movie. Stephen Bishop's music (Tootsie songs) made the film even better
