I could not stop commenting after reading the very short commentary "Not bad." This movie is much better than just bad. Acting is stellar, even from children in the cast who do not play sweet or anything else, but behave like my son's friends. The film is clever and expects the audience to be as well. The fictional lines with double flashing are ingenious and contribute to the story, not a filler of time. I watched this movie with my children and then watched it again a few days later. If you have children and you are sick to death of movies that inspire a diabetic coma with their syrupy sweetness, check out "Holes". My 6-year-old liked it the same as my 11-year-old, and my husband and I liked it the same as the two of us. How many movies can you say?
