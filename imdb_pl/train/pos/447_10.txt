This is one of the best films. It's one of my favorites. A movie with good acting. The story is very sensitive and touching. Good camera work too. <br /> <br /> The names of actresses and actors are not at the top of the American Star list. However, they give the same or better results than the top of the list. <br /> <br /> It's such a pleasure to watch a movie about true love, romance, friendship, not hating watching someone have to dig their way to save the world. <br /> <br /> If you do not like this movie, you have no heart or feelings. Then watch the sports movie. There is no killing or horror here. To see a film. It must. TH
