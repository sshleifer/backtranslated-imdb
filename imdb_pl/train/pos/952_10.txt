So for a TV movie, it's only 7.6 on this site? Bah! Humbug! Without a doubt, this classic Dickens story from 1984 is the best in history. And yes, Hound saw the version from 1951, which was also good, but not quite good. The lack of color is probably the biggest disadvantage of this version, although the acting was great. <br /> <br /> George C. Scott is just as amazing as Ebenezer Scrooge. We all know the story of this scant businessman, who is haunted by the ghost of his dead partner, and then by the three other ghosts of the evening. Scott is as rough as Scrooge. Too rough in fact for some critics who say they can not project the newly discovered joy that wakes up on Christmas when the spirits teach him a valuable lesson. But hey, this is George C. Scott. He will never go dancing down the street in a fit of joy. He has too much dignity, and his Scrooge designs his emotions in a realistic way. <br /> <br /> Supporting performances are uniformly perfect, as are costumes, music and decorations. Nineteenth-century London comes alive in the visionary style of Clive Donner. The film even borders on horror in several scenes involving ghosts. However, an important story about morality shines in every cage. <br /> <br /> Often you will not find this version on TV, and this is a disappointment. The "A Christmas Carol" version from 1984 should be an indispensable element of the celebration of every household. When the scenery comes out of the basement, this movie should be in the DVD player at least once in the season. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The Hound.
