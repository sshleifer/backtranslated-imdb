in the West there should be a subspecies named "Robert Mitchum Western". The brilliant, idiosyncratic, usually underrated westerns of Mitchum bring his film personality to etch some dark sketches of the characters and bring the elegiac fatigue in the world, more familiar from the films of Sam Peckinpy. "A man with weapons" is one of his best. Directed by Richard Wilson, the protégé of Orson Welles, it is a harsh, monochromatic beauty, full of chilling silhouettes and terrifying outbursts of savage violence, while Mitchum tames the city terrorized by a monopoly with a private army. Mitchum's regression from a tireless stranger to a mad killer, with lots of dark emotions between them, is a miracle of expressive, physical play.
