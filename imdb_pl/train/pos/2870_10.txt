This movie is wonderful. It always will always be like this. I mean what's better than a maid in love. Walt really did it here. And music! Sleep is a wish that makes your heart beautiful! What else can you say besides great! I can not wait for the special edition to come out, it will be so amazing! I can not wait to hear all the deleted songs! This movie is so beautiful and intelligent! This is lovely. And what about cute mice! I know I keep repeating the same things over and over again, but hey, it's a great movie! Woods was great in this beautiful beautiful BEAUTIFUL cinema
