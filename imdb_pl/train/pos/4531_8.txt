It's a cleaver with love over the centuries. The film consists of Keaton looking for feminine love in the Stone Age, in ancient Rome and the present (1920). In all three cases he is an ordinary ugly Buster and he fights with Wallace Beery for his love. Of the three periods, I think I liked Roman the most, although I admit that it could also be the tastiest one. Actually, I liked the lion scene, which was obviously the guy in the costume, as well as the strange chariot race in the snow - but the most I liked was watching all the amazing acrobatics of Keaton. However, all three periods were good, old-fashioned fun, and the movie, although not the best, is still a unique and enjoyable movie. Check it out!
