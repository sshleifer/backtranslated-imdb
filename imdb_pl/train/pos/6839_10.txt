In what must be one of the most blood-curdling movies, a transvestite murders people in New York, and the answer to everything may not be what people suspect. You can see how Brian DePalma influences Hitchcock for the camera and other things. Michael Caine plays the most provocative character, while Angie Dickinson is just a bored rich woman with a bad hairstyle. Keith Gordon (who later appeared in "Christine") is probably the most interesting character in the film. But you can not really understand this movie without seeing it. And after seeing this you can never know who you can trust. Nancy Allen and Dennis Franz also performed.
