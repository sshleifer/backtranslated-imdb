Nora is a lonely mother of two children who still wants to live a young artist in the 70s, just like her friends, a group of writers, singers and actors. The philosophy of "free love" does not leave the system? and Nora did not count on falling in love, especially with the junkie. Hazlehurst won her first of two AFI Awards in four years for an amazing portrait of Nora, who makes sure her children do the right thing, but at the same time falls in love with Javo (Friels). Garner? Who would later turn into films like LOVE AND OTHER CATASTROPHS and SIGNIFICANT PLANET? is well-manned as the premature daughter of Nora, and Caton (perhaps in readiness to be the host of the HOT PROPERTY program in 2000 ???) appears as a bearded painter. Cameron's early effort is a winner; he went to the award-winning MY BROTHER JACK miniseries among his later projects. But this is the stunning delivery of Hazlehurst, which animates intelligent, script-seeking, based on the award-winning novel Helen Garner.
