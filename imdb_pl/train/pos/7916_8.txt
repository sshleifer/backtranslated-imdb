Well ... Roeg touched some nerves, right? He was a genius when he cataloged his conventions of various characters into psychosis for several decades, but as soon as he has bad taste to suggest that redemption (or even good advice) can be found in the old bad Catholic church, an alternative film crowd, more than you, becomes exceptionally malicious. What is worse, the character of Theresa Russell - in the face of experiences that nothing in her openly rationalist views is explanatory, is reluctantly forced to deal with these experiences on a different spiritual level. You know, the realm of ignoramuses and superstitions, something that the home cinema is supposed to be above. Oh, this horror ... So she states that her marriage - the idea that it may be an exceptionally important commitment - is confirmed by what seems uncomfortable as divine intervention. People who consider this idea prima facie may ask themselves why they instinctively jump into the attack mode when they are called to take seriously the idea of ​​the spiritual dimension of their lives. But they probably will not. Sure, this movie has some problems, especially the shimmering ham of Waia Shire, a knotty nun, a 1950s outfit and everything. And the dialogue between Marie Davenport and the young priest in their last scene comes straight from the Spellbound School of Glib Interpretations (though Hitchcock's film escaped similar accusations because of the source of wisdom about pristine lay references as a Freudian psychoanalyst). Unfortunately, it seems that Nicolas Roeg has struggled with a critical scandal, and even asked a question about the possible answers of this film.
