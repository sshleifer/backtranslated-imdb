What a class in the British cinema! Just in time. A side comedy to run! <br /> <br /> Anyone who wants to experience a bit of freedom from their badly spent youth, this road movie will be proof of the ticket. <br /> <br /> This is a mix of "Withnail and me" and "easy rider". The film works at a solid pace and does not allow you to swim away too long ... Sometimes there are moments of reflection, but I think that they are well justified and add to the characters that show the actors. I was a little worried about the character of Phil Daniels at the beginning, but luckily I won over half of what was one of the funniest scenes in the whole movie! Generally, I felt laughing at the movie, most likely annoying some people around me. Well. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it exactly. It will be a cult British comedy. Worth a visit.
