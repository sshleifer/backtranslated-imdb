The question is, can an entertainment movie really be considered a "bad" movie? My husband and I chose this in a video shop for 99 cents just because of the title and the fact that the words "Vestron Pictures" were in the box (Vestron was highly rated as a quality mark from the very beginning) acquired legendary films " Suburbia "and" Class of 1984 "). We did not expect the film to be as full of prizes as this one. Your basic story is as follows: Grange, this goombaesque bandit from the planet Earth, robs the "shore of the Moon" and is sentenced to a penal colony on a distant planet (I can not remember even the name of the planet) to extract bauxite and other minerals. The "Governor" of the said colony and the owner of the mine use the prisoners for work. Walker, the bounty hunter (most likely one of three on the entire planet) reminds prisoners that there is no escape, because there is only one shuttle from the entire planet and they will deal with it. Then there's a nameless "colonel", a retired bounty hunter who suffers from a haunted nightmare. Much of the film focuses on "futuristic" car chases (dunebuggies with plywood struck sideways) with lots of explosions. The planet itself looks suspiciously like Hemet, CA or one of the other dusty outposts of the Inland Empire. But what makes the movie really shine is a surprisingly amazing soundtrack with several punk bands from Los Angeles in the mid-1980s. I seriously doubt if this soundtrack has ever been pressed to vinyl, but it's definitely worth buying a movie just for the soundtrack. I do not even remember band names (which are mentioned in the subtitles) other than Exploding White Mice, because it was the only one I heard about before watching this movie, but I'm definitely looking for it. <br /> <br /> Essentially, the movie is definitely not a waste of your time and it will be best to play with 12 packages of beer and some of your closest friends.
