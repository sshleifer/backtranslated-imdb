The Last Hunt is a forgotten Hollywood classic western. The subject of genocide through the slaughter of buffalo is present in other films, but never so brutally. The role of Robert Taylor against the type of buffalo buff and Indian assassin is his best performance. <br /> <br /> In the 1950s your mother rejected you and your friends for a party in Saterday, usually with a western or comedy. But then it was bad and let young people watch psycho-dramas, such as The Searchers and The Last Hunt. Let the children wait a few years before exposing them to films with repressed sexual sadism and intense racial hatred. <br /> <br /> Why did not my mother censor these films? Because they contained "safe" Hollywood stars like Taylor and John Wayne. But the atmospheric scene in The Last Hunt is just as scary as Vincent Price's mutation in The Fly. <br /> <br /> The mythology of the white buffalo, part of the texture of the movie, was later broken by other films including The White Buffalo, starring Charles Bronson as Wild Bill Hickock. Laughter is that Bronson once played in the Indians. <br /> <br /> Currently, a large herd of bison lives in the Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. In winter, hunger compels an excess of animals to leave the park in Montana, where sometimes the Indians of Idaho gather it in Nez Perce under the American treaty that precedes the Lincoln presidency. Linclon signed the act of Congress, which authorized the continental railway and began slaughtering the buffalo.
