The father of pride is a pleasant surprise: he is funny, witty and has a great voice. The performance tells about the Lion family, which acts as an attraction of Siegfried and Roy. In fact, they are all stereotypes, but it makes them so funny. FOTP is not a cartoon for children, but it contains some primitive humor for adults, but in a very gentle way. It is full of pop-culture references and stars, and most of them are very well made. I would say that I will give a show 7 out of 10, because it is fun quite well made, but not very original, I have seen most of these stereotypes many times, even in this particular order!
