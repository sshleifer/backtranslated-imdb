Reese Witherspoon stars in Denmark, a young country girl who falls in love with a new 17-year court, Court, played by Jason London. The court is trying to make Dani realize that the difference in their age would make an unbelievable love relationship. Soon, Dani's nubilee charm begins to win the will of the court. Then he enters the meeting of older sister Dani, played by Emily Warfield, and the beginning of a short-lived problem of love / jealousy. <br /> <br /> Tess Harper and Sam Waterston complete the cast. It's a fresh, free spirit; but a moving drama that touches deeply. I invite you to cry.
