Top-class Columbo from beginning to end. I especially like the interaction between Columbo and the assassin, Ruth Gordon. <br /> <br /> As an avid Columbo fan, I can not remember another one in which he does not set the killer at the end, because he does other episodes. In this, because he tries to determine the correct order of boxes and the "message" left by his nephew, he finally dreams. <br /> <br /> The music in this episode is also very good, as in many others.
