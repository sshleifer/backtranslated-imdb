Life Begins is a great movie before the code, in which there are some of the best epochs. He's in the maternity ward, especially in the women's room that's in trouble. There is an elderly woman in it, a hard, unmarried mother (Glenda Farrell), a frail young woman, an Italian woman and a main character (Loretta Young), who spends 20 years in prison for murder. Her husband (Eric Linden) is in the hospital every second pain to know that everything will be fine. Aline MacMahone plays a nurse who is great at her job. <br /> <br /> This movie is very interesting and entertaining. This is not shocking in any way, but it is interesting to see such a neglected topic on the silver screen. Acting is genius all around. Loretta Young is great here in her prime. Eric Linden appears out of nowhere and can be honest. His innocence reminds Michael J. Fox. Glenda Farrell is great as always, the basis of the pre-codes and for good reason.
