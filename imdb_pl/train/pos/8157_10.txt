Rated R for strong language, content of violence and nudity. Quebec Rating: 13+ Canadian Video Rating: 14A <br /> <br /> Fear Of A Black Hat is one of the funniest, most original comedies I've ever seen. This is basically a gangsta rap version of This Is Spinal movie. Touch. It is a pity that few people have heard about the jewel of the film. If you can find this movie anywhere, do not hesitate to buy it, even if you do not like rap music. There are not many comedy movies that The only thing I can think about now is the movie, Clerks, The World According to Garp, a 40-year-old virgin and chasing Amy. This movie is a funny gangsta rap culture stereotype. The film is about a woman named Nina Blackburn, who makes a documentary about the fictitious rap group NWH (N **** with caps). They are basically a stereotype of a rap group controversial rap songs about killing and being a gangster. Fear Of A Black Hat is an excellent comedy movie and I recommend it, even if you are not a fan of the gangster rap scene. It is a pity that this movie is not in Top 250. <br /> <br /> Time for action: 88min <br /> <br /> 10/10
