This film has a powerful philosophical ending. But this ending only matters when you watch the movie from the beginning. <br /> <br /> The alienation of youth in the late 1960s, from the point of view of a young man and a young woman, is the obvious subject of "Zabriskie Point" "Neither Mark Frechette nor Daria Halprin had too much acting experience, which actually strengthens sending the movie. Untrained actors give a sense of realism because both players seem emotionally detached from the confusion around them. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie based on scenarios. With the exception of the first ten minutes, it is mainly visual, with stunning pictures. Beautiful naturalistic images seem global and perfectly in sync with the emotional distance of Marek and Daria. <br /> <br /> I would replace the theme of the poor music of Pink Floyd with more convincing music from The Doors. Many scenes call for "Riders On The Storm". <br /> <br /> I still like this movie. This is different; is special; it's artistic and resourceful. And the desert badlands are beautiful. <br /> <br /> Over the years, Zabriskie Point seems more and more attractive. It transmits the mood from the late 1960s in America. It is amazingly artistic, in a gypsy way. The last eight minutes of the film are philosophically hypnotizing.
