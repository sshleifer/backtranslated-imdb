This is a perfect contemporary film noir .... "perfect" because it is interesting, from the beginning to the end. There are holes here and stupid parts that make you shake your head in disbelief ... but I have not found anyone who would not be drawn into this story. The film has the right amount of actions, tensions, twists and interesting characters. In addition, it offers several nice colors and photos and a good guitar soundtrack. <br /> <br /> I called this crime film "film noir" because it is rough and all characters are not good. Even the only supposedly good guy played by Nicholas Cage is in trouble, lying and having a quick affair he should not have. He does something at the end, which is not right, but I do not intend to destroy it, saying. But it's enough to say that the rest of the character is so bad that it makes Cage look good! <br /> <br /> Speaking of "bad guys", is anyone doing it better than Dennis Hopper? Little. At least in the category of "insane" is difficult to overcome. Lara Flynn Boyle is happy to watch for many reasons. J.T. Walsh also gives another great supporting performance. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that have never made publicity, but they should have. You will have fun watching it. By the way, try to say the name of the movie three times quickly, without questioning it!
