This is one of Jackie's best films, which is without opera bands Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao has one of the best openings in each action movie, and it continues in this way that Jackie shows some high quality stunts, and the only critical argument is that it's getting a bit slow inside, but it's going crazy over the last 25 minutes in the movie, and the end credits show how crazy fool Jackie Chan is to please us.
