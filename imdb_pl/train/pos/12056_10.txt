While I loved movies from the haunted house, such as Amityville and Poltergeist, the book Susan Hills made for a television adaptation is a huge blow to the Hollywood horror movie. <br /> <br /> With a brilliant cast (many of them play Heartbeat and other TV dramas), great acting and a fantastic setting (which convincingly portrays life in 1920), It has all the right ingredients to get the viewer in a powerful story about ghosts. <br /> <br /> Herbert Wise did not need blood, violence or blood to send chills to the backbone of the audience. Using her own imagination, a Woman in Black is a form of fear and fear, and her presence is never absent after her first appearance. <br /> <br /> The main character Arthur Kidd, a lawyer, learns about his invisible spectrum in his mission to settle. The widow dies, and Arthur spends a few nights in her grim house, where he notices many eccentricities that may haunt him for several days. Some scenes are very disturbing and claustrophobic, especially a closed room that opens up, which turns off the generator and closes Arthur in the dark. The film becomes more shocking, the more you put on Arthurs' shoes, and his efforts to get rid of this spirit. The writer puts a lot of interesting additions in history, an example of which is the reappearance of a tin soldier. We are eager to get to know the meaning of all this. The fact that we never really learn a lot about a widow leaves more imagination and makes it even more disturbing. <br /> <br /> Widow mostly looks scary and threatening. The scene after the generator was shot shivered me, a woman who appears out of nowhere on an isolated swampy area with a howling wind? being on such objects myself, I appreciate how it isolates. And the scene at the inn was probably the most terrible thing I saw, which I do not want to see in a hurry or show to older relatives. I often woke up at night thinking that he was behind me in my dream. <br /> <br /> The Woman In Black is a great TV movie and a lost gem. I agree to some extent that the web noise for this movie is completely overstated and I see why people were disappointed after spending 50 pounds on it, but I think the net has conquered hidden gems because it makes movies like these they are too exposed. I think it is still genius and fantastically played and I consider it to be the greatest story about the ghosts of the last century.
