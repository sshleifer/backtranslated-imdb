"Tintin and me" first of all struck me as a documentary masterpiece. Photography and assembly are truly breathtaking (almost anti-Dogma). <br /> <br /> We follow the life of the Tintin Hergé drawer through an open interview in 1971. The Tintin series has been drawn in the background of the great ideological struggles of the twentieth century. In the midst of these Hergé has his own demons to fight, and most of his drawing activities seem to be an attempt to tame them and escape into the world of perfection. <br /> <br /> Even if there are spectacular pictures of a panorama of drawings from Tintin's albums, as well as some reconstructions and reading fragments from albums, the Hergé story is told in its entirety through interviews and archival materials, and never through reconstructions. <br /> <br /> Hergé survived the stormy life of a real, suffering artist. But the fantastic world that was born out of his imagination will continue to amaze readers.
