I saw this movie with my dad. I had to be quite young, about 15 years old. One afternoon it was in Star Movies. After the first half hour it really accelerated. <br /> <br /> All the actors are great, especially Blades and Lou Diamond. I'm guessing it's a band, they just play together so well. I can watch this movie anytime. I think it's the relative stupidity of the plot and the characters are trying to deal with a very strange result. Jokes are not trivial, but they are subtle and extreme, which makes them so funny. <br /> <br /> The perfect comedy for a lazy afternoon.
