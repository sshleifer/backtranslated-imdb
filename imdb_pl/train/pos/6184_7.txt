Since this is the Black Month of History and I review the achievements of many African Americans in the film in chronological order, I got this film on VHS from the library because Duke Ellington and his orchestra were in it. Their jazz version of "Rhapsody" by Franz Liszt was the climax of this mostly long, murderous mystery-musical comedy. A lot of other numbers that I liked are Kitty Carlisle's "Sweet Marijuana", "Cocktails for Two" by Carl Brisson, as well as his duet with Carlisle on the subject earlier and the duo Gertrude Michael, who is great as a woman you like to hate . Jack Oakie and Victor McLaglen probably take their love / hatred for a long time as a producer and detective, but they grow on you. And Toby Wing is a sexy stupid irritant like Nancy, who is trying to say something to Oakie, but he gets "Not now" from him every time. While many characters have motives to commit murders, I was not surprised to find out who did it. And find out how naked women are here (though of course their breasts are covered with hands or a thin top). It was obviously before the code. It is worth looking for any movie lover interested in such things. P.S. As a longtime resident of Louisiana, I like to pay attention when someone was born here because Carlisle was a native of New Orleans.
