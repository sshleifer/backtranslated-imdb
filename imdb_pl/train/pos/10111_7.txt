The haunted world of Edward D. Wood, Jr. it is not a particularly good document. Aesthetically, it is bland and cheap, people in it play on the tangents, which make it very out of focus and coherent, but it adds to its charm. I say this because it is a documentary about a bizarre image that made strange pictures and was surrounded by other weirdoes, and as such, there really is no other way to document the life and career of the man and his misfit crew. There are some glimpses of insight into both Wood's genius and ineptitude, and the presentation of both features is due to the authenticity of the documentary. In general, it's worth watching for Wood fans and for the cinema in general, but do not expect luster here. Expect a documentary film made after Wood's own heart.
