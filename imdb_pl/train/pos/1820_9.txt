I remember this movie from the times when I was a small child, I loved him then and I still do. I managed to get it on DVD for my 18th birthday and I was too happy because I found it so hard to find it earlier and it was only possible to rent it when I was younger. My favorite character is Charlie, because she learns to be a good dog. The film is full of funny songs and music. The animation is brilliant and the characters' voices are excellent. This movie has always been a tear-squeezer for me, but I think if I did not see the movie when I was little, I would not consider it a genius and fascinating, although I still believe I still like it because I'm really into animated films.
