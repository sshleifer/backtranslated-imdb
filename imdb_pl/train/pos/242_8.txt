I thought this movie was very well made, Heath Leger was very persuasive and his Irish accent was impeccable. Orlando Bloom and Naomi Watts were also really good and credible. How true is what really happened, I have no idea, but it showed why people sometimes become what they do. Perhaps those who have power have always been corrupt and thought it interesting that over 30,000 signed a petition for Ned Kelly NOT to be hanged, so maybe there was more truth in the film than it was in the beginning? In many respects it reminded me of Cold Mountain, which was another good historical film. In conclusion, I highly recommend this film and I am somewhat surprised why the cinemas were not better.
