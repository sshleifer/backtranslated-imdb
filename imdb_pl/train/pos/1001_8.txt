A somewhat funny and dynamic action thriller in which Jamie Foxx is an unfortunate, fast-talking hooligan who was chosen by an overly demanding US treasury agent (David Morse) who will be fired on the streets of New York to find a picky computer hacker thief (Doug Hutchinson) who stole forty-two million dollars from the treasury and left two guards shot dead. <br /> <br /> "Bait" means the second year for Antoine Fuqua ("The Replacement Killers") and he deals quite well with the task, even if it is not his first film. What links both films are action sequences that are great. <br /> <br /> Foxx is pretty good here, although his character is annoying at first, but I started to catch the whole movie for. Hutchinson is wonderful as a brain that can be ruthless like John Malkovich and patient because the late Laurence Olivier was in the Marathon. Morse is fine as an agent who makes up a brilliant plan to get anyone to do it at any price.
