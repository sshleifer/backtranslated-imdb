(Some spoilers) I have not read the novel by James M. Cain ("The Postman Always Rings Twice"), on which this movie was based, so I can not compare this version of the film with this, but I have seen and love the American version from 1946 (also titled "Postman"). <br /> <br /> It is even better that this jewel from Italy, which, as I read, was "crippled" by the editorial office because of too many glaring references to the fascist regime. Well, it does not matter? what has remained is a great piece of cinema, apparently a precursor to the neorealist movement in film production. Can you see why? despite the fact that the strict edition has been underway, a penetrating sense of social and cultural oppression, as well as personal oppression remains difficult over the heroes who, in this context, face many limitations in their lives. <br /> <br /> Think about Gino, a young tramp, not very educated, unemployed and escaping to stow, steal and make up for population, his one pair of shoes is worn out to be practically useless. <br /> <br /> U Giovanny sees the way out, but he should have gone on, because Giovanna is oppressed by her love marriage to an elderly man with some money, work (working in a trattoria for her husband, slavery behind the bar and in the kitchen), and her sex. In the past, she had limited possibilities and decided to marry the owner of the restaurant / gas station (Giuseppe Bregana, played by Juan de Land), knowing that she would not make her happy. He tells Gino that she feels sick every time she touches Bregan. <br /> <br /> Under the pretext of helping Breganie to repair his car and send him to the village to buy the necessary part (which he actually hid), Gino gains the favor of Bregana (promising also to repair the damaged water pump - water symbolizing life or its lack) and stay alone with Giovanna. They immediately start a hot, passionate, and at the same time unstable romance. <br /> <br /> Gino soon feels choked by the relationship and feels the need to move on when Giovanna suggests they get rid of her husband. Not wanting to have anything to do with it, Gino leaves the city for a train ride that he can not afford, another Gypsy man named Spagnolo, a friend from the train, kindly paid for it. For Gino, Spagnolo represents a kind of freedom and become friends (Spagnolo also symbolizes Gino's morality and conscience), traveling and looking for a job at the carnival together. Finally, Gino has permanent employment. To his horror (not yet finished with love for Giovanna), a month passed when Bregana and his wife go to the carnival, and Bregana persuades Gino to go back home to live and work with them, because he is handy to have around him. <br /> <br /> Too weak to resist knowing that this will connect him with Giovanni, Gino agrees and returns to stay with the couple. After a while, she succumbs to Gina's demands to get rid of her husband. After doing the wrong act, Giovanna becomes colder than ever, it seems to have a very small conscience, while feeling guilty and ashamed to eat Gino for hurting a man who has never hurt him. Although he wants to leave her? again he does it briefly, they are now inseparably connected and they have to face the consequences. <br /> <br /> I liked how Spagnolo's character came back to Gino's life to act as a judge of his vices? it was very good and interesting, adding the story to a new dimension. <br /> <br /> While the American version of Lions Turner and John Garfield, 46, gets a bit lost in the marsh of peripheral characters, especially cops and lawyers, Ossessione concentrates well on the psychological effects of crime on the lovers themselves. This gives the ultimate effect of even more power and is a powerful statement reinforcing the helplessness of the society in which heroes must live. <br /> <br /> A small dispute: the amount of time (almost none) that passes before immortal love will be announced by lovers, how quickly they kill their husband (there is no botched first attempt, as in the American version); Very fast relationship Gino with a dancer / whore? they quickly confess their love and she is ready to risk a lot for the man she just met! ?? everything is unrealistic, right? I think that this time frame problem is quite distracting? it made me think I had to miss something somewhere. Otherwise, it's worth spending time on the viewer. The operation and direction were equally good throughout the text. Recommended.
