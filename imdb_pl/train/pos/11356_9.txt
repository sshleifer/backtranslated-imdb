It's an excellent movie. It's about a lot of things: hunting a serial killer, the bureaucracy of Soviet Russia, the drive of one man and the relationship between this man (the main detective) and his superior. <br /> <br /> The thing I care about is the relationship between Durokov (Rea) and Fetisov (Sutherland) (please forgive the wrong spelling!). For some reason, its aim is to make their evolution from hostility and transgression into respect, friendship and cooperation. One line of the film sums it up for me: "He would say something witty, but he was overcome by emotions." <br /> <br /> The perfect performance of all actors, even the smallest parts were made with credibility. <br /> <br /> This is not a quick action thriller; in fact, it moves sometimes like a slow drama, but it's worth it. Very satisfying and not exploiting crimes at all. <br /> <br />
