I'm kidding. <br /> <br /> Looking for greener pastures in the form of hustling in New York, Jon Voight is a young optimist Cowboy (almost like Las Gump) Joe Buck from Texas. Big Apple carelessly swallows him and his ambitions in full, and soon Joe is the target of both the cold of New Yorkers and opponents of his street thugs. Given his pure heart, he takes pity on one of those thugs, Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman), and later introduces himself to him in his wreck of a flat, and they both literally fight for survival. <br /> <br /> During the northern comedy is called drama, in my opinion it is best to describe it as a tragic comedy or comedy tragedy. It is above all a beautiful film that is stylish in capturing the contemporary hippy atmosphere of the late 1960s with the must-see-minded Warhol movie and the combination of it with the ultra-urban New York. In the movie Cowboy Joe Buck somewhere in the middle, emphasizing his position outside the place. We feel that he is struggling to fit in, but also to get enough money to feed Ratso Rizzo. <br /> <br /> Midnight Cowboy brought tears to my eyes because it is also rich in content and designs a lot of heart. I imagine that this movie had to inspire both Forest Gump and his hero with a pure heart, and to some extent Crocodile Dundee movies, because he deals almost exactly the same kind of humor - the contrast between the country's cowboys and clever cosmopolitans from New York. A very addictive and sensational film that I highly recommend. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
