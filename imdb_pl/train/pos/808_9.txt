I would just like the Jedi Return to be directed by someone else, that is, there are too many scenes evoked, completely unnecessary. Besides, our heroes look like different people: Princess Leia does not fight Solo anymore, Luke looks boring, Darth Vader is not as bad as before, and Yoda just dies. <br /> <br /> But there are many unusual things in this episode I can not hate. <br /> <br /> SOME SPOILERS 1- Jabba the hut 2- Sequence of the Barge Sail attack. 3-Emperor (now he is angry) 4-Speeders are pursuing the forest endor. 5-The Last Battle. 6-Stage seduction of the dark side. 7 - Anakin's return to the good side of strength. 8- And the last ceremony. <br /> <br /> Some of them are so good that they can cause tears in your eyes. If some of the scenes were cut out and another director was hired, it would be just as great as episodes 4 and 5, but it is still extraordinary. 9 out of 10.
