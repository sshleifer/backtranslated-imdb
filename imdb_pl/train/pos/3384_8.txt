My rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> I really like this movie. Compare with today's thoughtless movie (only action and special effect and nothing new about ideas), "Soylent Green" asks for something that is not there today: Think. <br /> <br /> Well, it would not be big to surprise the day with human food "cookies" that make up the human body. With all that happens on this planet, and seeing how people are so indifferent to everyone, such a future is possible. <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie takes some time, but the idea of ​​the movie is real again. Rich in Paradise, different in hell. Well, today they are lucky to be TV and idiots, like the "Reality Show". <br /> <br /> A TV is a good brain for washing. It is a pity that human intelligence does not develop like technology. Everything ends with writing. <br /> <br /> If you like reality shows, this movie is not for you. If you also believe all politicians. If you do not like asking yourself questions about the future and the future, never look at this video.
