What a great film by Barbara Stanwyck, who by chance I saw that night. "Jeopardy" was fantastic. It was made in 1953 and probably for double bills, but it kept me on the edge of my place. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck plays Helen, who with her husband Doug (Barry Sullivan) and son (Lee Aaker) goes to a remote fishing place in Mexico on vacation. The husband has fallen from the jetty and the only way to save him is if Barbara comes back to the garage for a rope. <br /> <br /> While she runs into a psychotic killer (Ralph Meeker - one of my favorites), and consequently, plays a cat and a mouse because Barbara tries everything she can to make Meeker come back with her to free her husband. <br /> <br /> The film was so tight and such surprises - I did not expect such a great movie. But I suppose I should have realized - is there something Barbara Stanwyck does, and what is not great?
