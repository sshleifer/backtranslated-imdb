People who are having a bad time in this movie are those who do not understand the movie at first. These are people who love movie hits and are against a movie that does not have Leonardo DiCaprio. Wilder Napalm is a sleek little movie that may seem bizarre, maybe even stupid at first, but what's lacking in the story is more than it makes up for in the content. <br /> <br /> One thing, especially in the movie, made a big impression on me using music that plays a big role. These film music students will notice how important music in the film is, both in the life of Vida and Wilder, and in the background. Wilder's motif, Vida's motif and Wallace's motif are audible in the opening sequence, and it's funny how some lyrics play. For example, in a scene where men sing "Duke of Earl," Vida is with Wilder, when men sing something like "She's my girlfriend," and then goes over to Wallace to give him something when men sing lyrical "She will be my girlfriend" cleverly showing the tension between the two brothers. There are many such complexities in the film, and although it may look like a flap on the outside, a true film student will notice how good the movie really is.
