I saw the movie for the first time when I was a freshman in high school, and the movie got stuck in me for years. It is not about the soundtrack, photos, even dialogue and a bit of bad acting, it's about the educational purpose, and the message behind it is the most important thing. It is not a sin to have a child when you are a teenager and you are still in high school, and this is not really bad, but it is a problem. Lots of girls I knew now have children, and they've probably never seen this great movie, and if they did, they clearly did not understand it all. The point is not to risk when you are in a sexual relationship. Every girl can get pregnant the first time. This is not a myth. You do not necessarily lose your dreams, but you must take a back seat in your future because you have a child to think about the first one. <br /> <br /> This movie has a clear message: JUST TELL NO!
