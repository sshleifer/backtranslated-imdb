At a time when musicals were not demonstrations for choreographers, we had great films like this one. <br /> <br /> Being a big fan of both Wodehouse and Fred Astaire, I was delighted that I finally saw the movie. It's not a mix of Wodehouse and Hollywood, but close enough. Some American vaudeville moods, slapstick, and not humorous teasing, clash with Wodehouse's British sense of humor. But in general, the American style of banter makes American characters seem more real than cartoons. <br /> <br /> A few ingenious stagings for dance numbers, including great market places with revolving floors and funhouse mirrors, more than just because of Berkley's busby absence at the top of the dance number. They seem much more realistic if you can imagine that people start singing and dancing so realistically. <br /> <br /> Lack of Ginger Rogers and Eric Blore does not harm the film, instead it allows for a different character dynamics to appear. It is also nice not to have wise cracking, stubborn interest in love. Instead, we have a delicate stubborn interest in love, much more in keeping with the young aristocratic Wodehouses females.
