Gypo Nolan (Victor McLaglen) is as poor as anyone on Earth. Living in Ireland in the 1920s, Gypo and his colleagues, the Irish are part of an underground rebellion against the oppressing British. One rebel, wanted for murder by the English, returns to the city in secret. He thinks he can trust his friend Gypo, but the Â£ 20 prize turns out to be too tempting. Gypo kills his friend and sinks into an abyss of despair and drunkenness. Meanwhile, other Irish rebels are looking for an informer. Immediately, Gypo, with the money burning the hole in his pocket, is their main suspect, but they who are his friends do not want to believe it. The history of The Informer is simple in story but complex in moral and emotional matters. It's easy to be one of John Ford's most exciting films. What Gypo did was bad, but we can certainly understand his motives. We also understand his pathetic character and there is a lot of sympathy for him. The script is also very tight. It is a kind of uncertainty in which we are sure that we know how everything will end, so we have to grit our teeth and with them. Acting is extraordinary. Victor McLaglen, who appeared in many Ford films, probably gave his best performance here (and won an Oscar for this). Any other filmmaker deserves its recognition. In addition to an amazing script and acting, The Informer is one of John Ford's most expressionist films. I love the darker side of Ford. In my mood, as well as in the themes, Informer reminds me of two of my favorite Ford films, The Long Voyage Home (1940) and The Fugitive (1948); in this respect it is somewhat similar to The Grapes of Wrath (1940). 10/10
