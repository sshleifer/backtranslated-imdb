One of my favorite movies. Simply beautiful, full of human emotions, wit, humor, intelligence. History evolves, just like a lesson in life, simply a great movie in many ways. <br /> <br /> The cast is also fantastic ..... a great selection of the best British talents. I loved them all for all the various elements introduced to the film. <br /> <br /> Italy must be one of the most romantic places to create such a story - everything in this film works. <br /> <br /> I love it :)
