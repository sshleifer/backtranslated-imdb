At the risk of being a bit sacrilegious, at first glance I am rather inclined to put it on par with Shaun of the Dead. Now, given that Simon Pegg is an undisputed comedy genius, I realize that this is quite a big claim. And to what extent you agree with this last statement, it can be a good initial indicator of whether "Fido" will appeal to you. <br /> <br /> In a sense, the comedy goes up where "Shaun" ended, except that I returned to the original, stereotypical, small town from the era of vivid times from the 1950s. The zombie wars are over and the zombies themselves are becoming more and more adapted, useful members of the community. What we are announcing at the beginning is largely due to scientific advances made by good people in Zomcom - maybe a nice romantic comedy game? <br /> <br /> The beauty of the film lies in a lifeless image of a respectable neighborhood that preserves basic values, while creating a place for zombies and the special threats they pose. The charm and balance with which he does it are perfect enough. There are motives that can be expected from the more popular kitsch comedy - a veneer of good, pure life, maintaining appearances, suppressed emotions, confused parental values, social decency and the difficult situation of an alienated individual. <br /> <br /> This is a story told with a joyful heart and a wide grace, animated by the versatile and strong cast of the film. This is one of those works where you can really see that everyone involved got a kick out of participation. It's nice to imagine what Billy Connelly looked like ... <br /> <br /> In conclusion, you'll probably appreciate the humor of this movie, unless your father tried to eat you.
