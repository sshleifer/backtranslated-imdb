I must admit that at the beginning I did not expect anything good. I was expecting only a bad movie promoting the image of Gackt and Hyde, but I am happy that I can offer a lot more. <br /> <br /> Yes, acting is not great, but it's not good or all of the cast members are disciplined and bring enough strength to their heroes. The effects are not consistent, but the action scenes are sufficiently satisfying. <br /> <br /> What really draws me is the essence of the story, although it combines fantastic elements, it also shows austere reality. The development of heroes, their doubts and feelings really concerned me and I think that this is the key to this film. It makes you think and communicate anxiety well. <br /> <br /> It meets all expectations for a good drama. I definitely recommend it to everyone.
