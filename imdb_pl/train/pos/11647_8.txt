I can give you four reasons to see this movie: <br /> <br /> 1. Four of the best filmmakers of contemporary Mexican cinema. <br /> <br /> 2. Four good stories related to a large scheme. <br /> <br /> 3. A surprisingly good cast. <br /> <br /> 4. A bitter reflection on the biggest problems in this country (and many others). <br /> <br /> (MOŻLIWE SPOILERY) <br /> <br /> Alejandro Gamboa opens the film with a good story in a comedic mood for authority for ordinary people and still expecting him to be appreciated by his efforts. <br /> <br /> Then Antonio Serrano becomes more dramatic in the second song, heir to the history of Italian neorealism with an anecdote similar to "Peter and the Wolf." <br /> <br /> In the third story, the one that seems more independent of this series, even in context, Carlos Carrera tells the story of a man in the wrong place at the wrong moment. But after the recent lynching in Tlahuac and tradition in this terrible case in the state of Mexico, this story could not have been more updated. <br /> <br /> At the end, Fernando Sariñana returns to the dark humor "the grand finale", in which he compares most of the characters from the previous sequences in one of the better comedies ever filmed. Repeating the central scene from one of his previous films, "Todo el poder", Sariñana gives the last lesson of the subject. By the way, give us a scene that steals a film with Anna Ciochetti doing a short striptease. <br /> <br /> Once the movie ends, you'll get a bittersweet feeling of seeing a good movie (or maybe I liked it) a very painful topic. They say that in Mexico people are laughing at their own shame and that is the best example. This film is testimony to how the Mexicans learned to live in the middle of a criminal state (and perhaps they have accepted it) between two fires: criminals and so-called authorities full of corruption. Even this movie is a godly wish, because almost all good people were victims of crime and did not get it unscathed. If you've had an attack without scratching, you're in luck. Meanwhile, do not lose your opportunity to see this movie, I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> And this beautiful life in Mexico ...
