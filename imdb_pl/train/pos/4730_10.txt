The story of Jet Li, who has to fight his old <br /> <br /> friends. But there is one problem, friends are superfighters. The film is full of blood, super action and the best acrobatics forever. And Lau Ching-Wan is a great co-creator. Of course, the movie has a typical HK-Fun. But I love it! In Germany, the Black Mask is uncut.
