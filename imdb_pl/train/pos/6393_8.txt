This is mandatory for independent film fans, but it also does well with mainstream movies. I think we have the makings for the next Woody Allen or <br /> <br /> Trentin Tarrentino here. <br /> <br /> The budget is painfully low. No special effects and apparently they used ambient lighting (shot in a digital video). And yet this movie grabs you and never lets go. The screenplay is a bit bizarre, but the actors and the director draw it with full realism. He has humor, he has intrigue, he has pathos and everything works together. <br /> <br /> There is no point describing details. If you want to see an independent masterpiece <br /> <br />, a virtual lesson on how to make a low-budget movie that really works, see this one. <br /> <br /> - Oh yes, it's also REALLY entertaining. <br /> <br />
