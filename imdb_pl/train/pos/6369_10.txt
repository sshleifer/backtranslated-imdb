I loved this movie! I am biased because I am a big fan of Disney, but I really enjoyed myself. The action starts at the beginning of the movie and just goes on! It's a bit of a departure for Disney, they do not spend too much time developing characters (my husband pointed to this) and there are no music numbers. It is an action-only adventure. I really enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone who loves Disney, both young and old.
