My name is Domino Harvery. {EDIT * dizzying * CHOP} We - we - my name is Domino Harvey. {CUT, CHOP} My name is Domino Harvey. {EDIT. CUT. Playing} <br /> <br /> I've never seen a director who has so much for his style. You can see that most people underestimate the uncertain, brilliant, dizzying editing technique of Tony Scott. If I had to choose between love and hate, I would say that I love it. Sometimes it was distracting, but the end result was quite good and it is nice to see the director with a creative advantage in his style and some originality (even if he borrows a lot from MTV films). <br /> <br /> This stylistic edge manifests itself when Keira Knightley plays the role of the cocky prize-winner, Domino Harvey, and even her dialogue seems strangely uncertain. Otherwise, the game is poor because I hated her character and I did not feel sorry for her, no matter how much she suffered. We follow Domino through her life when she joins other bounty hunters Mickey Rourke, Rizwan Abbasi and Edgar Ramirez. The team got tangled up in the FBI and suddenly signed a reality show as part of the television production of Christopher Walken (by the way, what does Christopher Walken do in every movie?). I think it's a clever film technique, because now Tony Scott can freely use so many brilliant MTV / Reality Show materials as he likes. At this point, he becomes a pastiche of the MTV culture. <br /> <br /> Therefore, the story is told in an incredibly fast pace, with a lot of brutal language and violence using weapons. There are funny jokes; everything is very modern and surreal at the same time. It's a mess, but it's a pleasant mess. Ultimately, this is defective in many ways (the actors try too hard to make their characters "cool", for example), but it works. I give him a weak 7/10, which may seem generous compared to the general consensus of the filmmakers who rated the film? but I feel that he had some good ideas and he did them well. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
