A beautiful merchant in London is scavenged by the owner of a millionth tea plantation and soon is married and lives with him in his villa in the British Ceylon. Although based on the book by Robert Standish, this initial configuration is very similar to "Rebecca" by Hitchock, with a leading lady Elizabeth Taylor trying with the impressive chief of staff in the residence and (almost immediately) her own husband who is still under the thumb of his deceased, but dominant father. Taylor, at the last minute the substitute for the ill Vivien Leigh, looks creamy smooth in her fashionable wardrobe, and her performance is quite strong; but when Peter Finch's husband starts to drink heavily and barks at her, one might think that her dedication to him is rather masochistic (this feeling also makes it difficult to finish). Still, the film offers a wild popularity for soap lovers: a romantic drama, a bit of travel, interpretative dance, panic on elephants and the outbreak of cholera at the right time! *** with ****
