This film is a great instrumentarium. He follows the rap group, NWH, composed of Ice Cold, Tasty Taste and Tone Def, thanks to their unique path to gangster raps, low and high levels. Through troubles with women, ego, cops and whites, this group gets to the top of the gangster rap world, because this film hits the top of the instruments. I know that everybody's favorite power is This is Spinal Tap, but I think that if in the right mood, this movie is simply better. Laughter never ends, even for someone who is not in rap culture. <br /> <br /> I am a white guy who is not interested in rap, culture or anything else related to it, but I love this movie. Rusty Cundeif, who wrote the script, songs and played in it, showed great potential and it's a pity that I did not see him from Fear of a Black Hat. However, I saw him again than you, and that's because I recommend you Fear of a Black Hat for quick laughter. <br /> <br /> Remember: "Do not shoot at you, you see whites! .... their eyes? No, do not shoot at you, I see whites. "<br /> <br /> FYM and enjoy the movie.
