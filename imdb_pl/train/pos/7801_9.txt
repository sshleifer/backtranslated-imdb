This film fantastically uses cinematography, the depth of the camera catches every character. Denzel Washington and Kevin Kline have made amazing performances, though Washington's accents are dying in some scenes. How is this movie forgotten? can not rent or rent recently, threatening to lose forever. disturbing idea. Attenborough at its best from Ghandi, this song is what it should be in films like these, without worrying about getting the audience to call for freedom in the SOuth African Suite. a book by Donald Woods and a faithful message to express to the world. ta and peace
