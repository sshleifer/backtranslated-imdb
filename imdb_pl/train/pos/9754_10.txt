This Raggedy Ann and Andy Movie are so cute. We love watching Ann and Andy sing and dance, as well as a camel with wrinkled knees. This movie made Camel of Wrinkled Knees so popular, singing his song "I'm nobodies I Love You." If you love Raggedy Ann and Andy watch the movie and you'll see why this movie loves children and adults!
