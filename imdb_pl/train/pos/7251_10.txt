I only saw this movie once 25 years ago and to this day I've always told people that it's probably the best movie I've ever seen. Considering that there was no verbal dialogue and only thinking about dialogue, I found the film fascinating and even held my breath, so as not to emit any sound. I highly recommend this movie, I would like it to be available on DVD.
