Perhaps you do not care about the social commentary or point of view of the creators of the film (I am surprised that the angle "irrelevant" seems to promote Kasdan, when clearly the actions taken in the film promote SOME meanings, the ending was wrong). However, it is absolutely impossible to deny how the story is presented; great symbolism; weft arcs of characters; visualization; dialogue? is an absolute masterpiece. I have watched the film several dozen times and I am still amazed at its perfection. There is no time, action, cut-out or line that has nothing to do with the topic. Realistic human performances by all actors. The scene to the stage is fantastically woven. <br /> <br /> I have a nice level meter. The buzzer never went out during this movie. If you are a thinker (not an ordinary viewer)? this movie provides. Exponentially. Absolutely mesmerizing. (Do you have to agree with this message to appreciate the display? Who cares if it made you warm and vague, or was it interesting?) <br /> <br /> Personally, the movie influenced me? significantly. In my first five. <br /> <br /> Note: the reviewer on the first page clearly speaks about the mistaken perception of African Americans. What he could not recognize was his hand? shake. Do not reach out. A spiritually dead white man, he just saw a man who respects and admires. And he did something about it. The fact that it was black had nothing to do with it, if at all, (the color is just used to draw parallelism and chasm.) It is not a coincidence that the opening sequence moves from black to white. If you see black in this movie as a token? you may want to re-evaluate your anxiety. Maybe you only see black and white, eh. Only thought.
