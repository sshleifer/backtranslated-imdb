The famous conductor decides, after a heart attack, to return to the village where he was born to live peacefully. There he comes in Dutch with a local church choir that will change his life. <br /> <br /> I did not have any expectations when I saw this movie for the first time yesterday; I like watching foreign movies that are not English, and I've seen a few Swedish films in my life, but this one was the best so far. <br /> <br /> Where to start? In my opinion, this movie is a jewel thanks to many things, one of which is great acting. Michael Nyqvist is ideal as a thoughtful, almost shy and dedicated conductor Daniel Daréus. Beautiful Frida Hallgren impresses with her nice smile and subtle acting. All members of the choir are well-developed, interesting characters with their own history. <br /> <br /> This film tells a story, a beautiful story, about music, love, pain, memories, death, about a man who devoted his life to music and tries to create a peaceful existence in the village where he was born, trying to make peace with the past and with the way his life has been so far. Kay Pollack shows us that the Swedes are outstanding filmmakers. Go see Så som and himmelen, it's a movie that makes you think about life and love, and that's somehow comforting.
