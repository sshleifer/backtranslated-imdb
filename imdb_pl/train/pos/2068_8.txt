1958. The sleepy small southern town of Clarksburg. The evil sheriff Roy Childress (almighty Vic Morrow in the top, nasty form) destroys the super hard speeders, forcing these criminals to leave the cliff for premature death on a particularly dangerous stretch of road. Childress meets his match when a cool young hot rod driver Michael McCord (a perfectly smooth and grim portrait of Martin Sheen) appears in a city in his broken car with the intention of avenge the death of his brother (siblings Sheen) Joe Estevez in a short episode). Director Richard T. Heffron, working with the tight and intriguing screenplay of Richard Compton (the same guy who directed the 1970s movie "drive-in", "Welcome Home, Soldier Boys" and "Macon County Line"), tells an engaging story. spontaneous pace, carefully creating a setting from the 1950s and skillfully giving away a lot of tense play of wit and will between Childress and McCord. The uniform cast helps a lot: Sheen exudes the bold, rebellious atmosphere of James Deanesque at the helm, Morrow draws the most from his fleshy part of the evil guy, and also excellent performances supporting Michelle Phillips as a waitress for sweet dinner Maggie, Stuart Margolin as popular deputy Nick Nolte as a nice station employee gasoline Buzz Stafford, Gary Morgan as an engaging young man Buzz, Lyle, Janit Baldwin as Sassy's sassy local tart, Britt Leach as a skimpy taxi driver Johnny and Frederic Downs as a strict referee JA Prostitute. The climactic confrontation between Childress and McCord is a real, pulsing, thrilling doozy. Terry K. Meade's sharp cinematography, well-drawn characters (for example Childress who was obsessed with ruining speeders after his wife and child died in a fatal accident and escape), groovy, syncopated score of Luchi De Jesus and beautiful mountain scenery further improves the overall sound quality of this great TV winner.
