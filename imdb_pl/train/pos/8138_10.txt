CB4 was awful, but he could give Cundieff a better idea. More than Spinal Tap, the movie is clever from the beginning. Surprising everyone who saw it in the mid-nineties. Performances are played for laughs, but not so much that they are cartoon characters, more like Marx brothers. These guys are real and a bit different. They react to situations like each of us. Well, we can not get angry when our performance hats are late for a performance, or they pull out their weapons and beat the record label's contractor, but you get a picture. N (n *** as) W (z) H (hats) takes seriously enough to draw you in and then you're addicted. Hire or get it at all costs, even if you're not interested in rap music, it will still leave you alive. Comparing it to CB4, it's like comparing Star Wars George Lucas with Gil Gerard Buck Rogers' I think you see my point
