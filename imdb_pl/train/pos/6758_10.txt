Where the Sidewalk Ends (1950) <br /> <br /> Where it ends, another begins <br /> <br /> This is a prototype movie noir, and as such is quite pristine, both in style and content view. The photography and night settings are primary (the author of the photograph, Joseph LaShelle, allows drama to emerge on the stage), and close-ups on pure expressionism. I can watch this kind of film only for visualization, even when the actors are fighting and the plot stinks. <br /> <br /> But acting is in the first place, and the plot contains what I consider to be the core of most noir movies, an alienated male leader (representing many men returning home after the changed US after the war and feeling lost) . In fact, Dana Andrews is not only convincing as a restless, lonely detective, but also has a small but important counterpart in the film, the first (first) husband of the main woman, decorated with ex-GI falling for hard times and alcohol. The fact that one man kills the other may have monumental significance, in general - an ordinary guy struggling with his internal problems to success, while a soldier with a medallion falls into an accidental death with a silver plate in his head. The woman goes from one to the other - we assume that they are getting married and have children, as previously suggested in the film. Even if it pushes this interpretation after the fact, we still see the path of one man with some psychological baggage going through the crisis to the highest kind of moral order - turning into a small crime just at this point he really succeeded. <br /> <br /> This movie belongs to Andrews. He plays a much more restrained and moving type than Kirk Douglas plays in a similar role in William Wyler's Detective story a year later, and Andrews is certainly less theatrical. You can easily see both videos side by side to compare textbooks and contrast sessions. The fact that Andrews as detective Dixon fights all this morally, and Douglas as detective McLeod, does not explain why one man gets his girlfriend and the other does not. Gene Tierney pulls out an unusually sympathetic, awe-inspiring and ultimately conventional and "pretty" type of woman - not just the desired carton, but someone Dixon wants to marry. <br /> <br /> The crime story is really secondary to the main drama, but it's effective enough in its game with types and clich√©s. Bit bits are delightful, small details (such as a portable dice table) are nice touches, distant from character actors and the glamor of Casablanca gambling. But the great film Curtiz is iconic even in detail - does not try to be subtle, real and penetrating, but instead is vast, unforgettable and inspiring. They come to the opposite ends of the war and represent opposite opportunities for their leading people. Bogart begins his active service, Dixon, and the man Dixon killed is already behind him. Through, thoroughly, but not washed away. <br /> <br /> It's no coincidence that many, perhaps most, movie noirs have what can be called "happy" endings. The man overcomes his opponents and transforms his inner self, and the film-maker, then and now, understands how beautiful he must feel.
