Believe it or not, but after 12 minutes this movie (for 1912) is a full-length movie. Very, very few films were longer then, but this is NOT what distinguishes this strange movie from the rest! No, that's different, all the actors (except one frog) are mistakes ... yes, mistakes! This simple little home comedy could look very similar to the production of Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy or Max Linder, but instead the Russian production uses errors (or, I think, models that looked like worms). Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy have not been discovered yet and I suppose Linder was busy, so maybe that's why they used bugs! Using stop-motion, the worms moved, danced and fought incredibly well - and much more realistically than King Kong 21 years later! <br /> <br /> The film begins when Mr. Beetle sneaks about having fun. He goes to a lewd club while his wife is probably waiting at home. But, unfortunately, for Mr. Beetle, he is caught on the camera by a local cinema lover. Besides, he does not know that, but Mrs. Beetle also runs an artistic painter from grasshoppers. Of course, there is a lot more in this home comedy, but the plot is eternal and very fun for both adults and children. <br /> <br /> Strange, but also very amazing and awesome.
