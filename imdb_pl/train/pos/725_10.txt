The fascist Mrs. Miss Togar (Mary Woronov, who is lensed by the expert photographer Dean Cundy, as if she was ten feet tall) is about to change her high square. Complications that challenge this goal in the delightful rock'n'rolir Riff Randell (PJ Soles, which illuminates the screen - she also has a hot bod), which is an obsessive fan of the punk band THE RAMONES. Pal Kate Rambeau (Dey Young, whose large glasses in the frame and the role of the nerdy can not hide his stunning beauty) joins forces with Riff to put an end to the alleged crisis of killing rock'n'roll for good, which is a desirable Togar mission. Vincent Van Patten has a funny role as Tom Roberts, he was successful in everything, but he was abandoned. Kate is crazy about Tom ... if only he could get his head out of the sand and see her. Clint Howard steals the film almost (honestly, who can steal this movie from Soles?) As Eaglebauer, the "supplier" who can get almost anything. His office is in the boy's toilet! Paul Bartel is also hilarious as a music teacher who becomes Riff's ally when he enjoys the RAMONES concert. <br /> <br /> A harsh high school that opposes all normal norms. It's like someone just said, "Let's party for an hour and a half." The film really is anarchy ... chaos devoid of plot with love that loves RAMONY with all my heart (even if they are terrible actors, they have the opportunity to win a new audience with this film). <br /> <br /> the end very sums up the movie as a whole. Riff and her classmates take over high school and one big party begins. Honestly, I did not want the party to end! Not in any way conventional, this movie would just lose the craze. This movie, combined with a great rock soundtrack containing the best songs of THE RAMONES, allows the viewer to accept time in life, when the war did not dominate the headlines, and people just had a good time. It must have been days.
