"The Man In The Moon" is a pretty good movie. Sometimes it is very touching and very well done in every respect. I would not say that the movie was terribly original, but what are these days? <br /> <br /> All cast members did a great job in their roles. I really enjoyed seeing Reese Witherspoon at such a young age and doing a pretty good job. Jason London does a great job. And the only person I met was Sam Waterston, who did a fantastic job with his role. I really liked Sam (Matthew Trant). Sometimes he seemed to be a father you are afraid of, but in the end you really like his character. The rest of the cast was also very good. <br /> <br /> If you want to raise films about growing up and dealing with what life throws you, you should watch this movie. I suggest reading the storyline and if it sounds like something that interests you, go for it. In any case, I hope you enjoy the movie, thanks for reading, <br /> <br /> -Chris
