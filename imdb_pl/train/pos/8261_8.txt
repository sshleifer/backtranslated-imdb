The sentimental and naive, but undeniably affecting, emotional request of a man for help, in this case embodied as German and French miners forced to close after the Great War thanks to the new border, which led to disappointment on the German side, how the French are the bosses. But when the fire begins on the French side, the universal decency of the Germans leads to help, security and even friendship. It was an appeal that would have been deaf in a decade, because a man on his own side Pabsta would break this piece and transform the Great War into a prelude. But it is obvious to me that Pabst really believes or at least wants to hope for this fundamental humanism, because this movie emanates with optimism, while his more flippant, cynical adaptation of the Three-Come Opera did not have the bite needed for work. . His sincere faith is also the fact that the heroes are not simple spokespersons for positions, but real people, with real families in which we also live at home. These are ordinary people from the working class who simply believe in the value of care and treatment of their fellow man, and on this day of individualistic opportunism I will make a slight thinning in my conspiracy to get a positive message that represents a point of view that I think we can all aspire to. <br /> <br /> (Note: apparently the ending is cut out on most of the prints, where the French are rebuilding the mining gate, closing people again.) This is a brutal turn of events and maybe made the movie a better movie, but I would regret it that they glue positive vibrations of the last sequence, so in short, I'm glad that it was cut off.) {Degree: 8/10 (B) / # 7 (out of 11) from 1931}
