When he was first aired in 1984, my wife and I recorded it on our first VHS recorder. I still have this aging tape that I try to watch every year. It was the year in which my first child was born, and watching Christmas Carols in this incarnation brings back to the fond memories of happy times - which many hours were spent with this film playing in the background. In the end, I broke down this year and ordered a DVD, which prompted me to take a moment to write this short reaction to the film. The story of Charles Dickens has been captured here in an extraordinary way. George C. Scott is absolutely amazing and completely credible as Scrooge. The supporting cast is equally spectacular. In my opinion, it is flawless production. Small details add a lot of joy. The game of "similarities" nephew and wife Scrooge play with their party guests. (From now on, I recreated it with my English high school students as a short rest from class work!) Honestly, I can come up with several ways to have fun during the holidays, which I enjoy more than the CBS originally sponsored by IBM. (Incidentally, it's cool to see an old tape with original IBM ads ... that show how many computers have evolved over the course of 21 years. Amazing how they've changed!) Conclusion: Christmas Carol is a timeless story, interpretation is a timeless classic. Enjoy ... and God bless us, everyone!
