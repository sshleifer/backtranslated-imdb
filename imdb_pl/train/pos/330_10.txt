I'm Italian, and when I saw this movie again, I was amazed by its beauty: for the first time I was 10 years old and I liked it, but today I can appreciate it with the adults' mind and feelings. Now I understand that it was a masterpiece of the special season of Italian cinema (Pasolini, etc.), which has already passed. <br /> <br /> Hollywood epic movies are good ... for fun. Perhaps this "Odyssey" did not have an English version, because it is not funny enough ... unsuitable for popcorn and coke plants. Suitable for Homerian pathos and existentialist reflections. <br /> <br /> In Italy, a very good DVD version has been recently released: INTEGRAL, with excellent colors. You can find it in some shared files, but it is only Italian and without subtitles. It is a pity: the dialogues and voices of this film are extraordinary.
