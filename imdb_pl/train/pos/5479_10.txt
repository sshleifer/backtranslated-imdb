<br /> <br /> Arriving in a wagon in New York, a clever young woman from BABY FACE starts methodically paving the way to the top floors of power in a big bank. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck is fascinating as an amoral heroine of this influential pre-modal drama. Without a bit of decency or regret, he cools the manipulation of the removal or destruction of people who are unlucky enough to find their way. A great actress, Stanwyck has a full chance to show her talents here. <br /> <br /> George Brent appears quite late in this story, it is a welcome addition, as the only man who can handle Stanwyck; his sophisticated playing style is a nice counterpoint to her icy behavior. Douglas Dumbrille, Donald Cook and Henry Kolker present the successes of her unfortunate victims. <br /> <br /> John Wayne appears for a few seconds as an unsuccessful competitor to Stanwyck's feelings. That would be the only time these two performers came together on the screen. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers should recognize Nat Pendleton as a client, and Charles Sellon and Edward Van Sloan as bank directors - everyone without obligation. > <br /> Music heard on the soundtrack throughout the film, perfectly interpreting the story, is "Baby Face" (1926) by Benny Davis and Harry Aksta and St. Louis Blues' (1914) W.C. Handy. <br /> <br /> BABY FACE is a perfect example of rudeness before the code. In his candid and not very meticulous approach to sex, this type of film, which implementation of the Code of Production in 1934 was to be eliminated.
