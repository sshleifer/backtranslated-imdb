This show is crazy funny! the jokes are original, God, and I love Eric and Kelso! Yes, I know what they say, after the eighth season, it's not funny anymore, because Eric and Kelso are no longer on the show, and Randy is a real fool. Randy is, compared to Eric and Kelso. <br /> <br /> you can not take the funniest characters and change them with a guy "I'm a nice guy" (Randy). it's not his fault anyway, but the writers are trying to make the eighth season fun, it's still, not as much as in previous seasons, but it's fine. circle, Red is a real kind of dad's abusing mentality :), and the kitten is always half-dry. Hyde is always trying to be cool, he also has his moments. the least favorite characters are Jackie and Donna. they're cool, but not without Kelso and Eric. <br /> <br /> a great performance. Stupid!
