I rarely sit in front of the TV to watch a specific program. It's even rarer when I finally like the program, but Last of the Blonde Bombshells was one of the best movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> A remarkable cast, led by Dame Judi Dench and Ian Holm and an excellent, witty and poignant script that makes it a truly rewarding experience. I can not really express how well I thought, so I will not try, I will only say, if you have the opportunity, PLEASE SEE YOU !!!! I just hope that he will come out on the video.
