I saw it 25 years ago at PBS. Watching was very difficult. Yes true. To watch this small family fight in the winter, it was heart-rending. There is no time for courtship: fate threw us together and put our arms on the grinder and made it work. It was based on the actual diary of a woman who I read many years later. She told her diary that her parents had died when she was little, and all their troubles and sisters had to work on the farm to feed themselves. She learned to mow what did not look like a lady. She was afraid that no charming prince would want a woman with tanned, calloused hands, but this husband was so happy that his new wife knew how to mow and she was happy to do so. They were both widowed and worked together to build a new home. It was so sad when the child died. Of course, if they had it today, I'm sure it would be good. It just makes the tragedy very sad. I cried so much. But then they left and successfully pulled out a new calf. Spring is on its way and life goes on. In her diary she had two more boys and they lived.
