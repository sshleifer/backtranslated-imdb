Intruder (L'Intrus) directed by French director Clair Denis is the release of the film. He follows his own spirit in time, space and character. It may be a conspiracy, but I understood that I understood this from the description on the Netflix DVD cover. Honestly, it's probably better to know nothing about the movie before watching it, because then the viewer can put aside all expectations. The film requires the viewer to think, but he also mocks the fact that he will not get a full understanding. <br /> <br /> The human heart is a mystery of the movie. Each picture questions its role, nature and form. The heart is the intruder, the viewer and Louis. Louis Subor plays the character of Louis with the peace and mystery required by this character. Honestly, everyone could play Louis if he had a wandering, willing and comfortable heart. However, Subor is one of the presented here; it becomes a movie, its identity is inextricably linked to it. Many of the film's images remaining in my mind revolve around his expressions, vocal, but mainly physical. <br /> <br /> An intruder is poetic in his ability to capture stillness and full motion, but more fluid than any literature shape he refuses. "Surrealistic" was the term used in the description of this film, but perhaps "quasirealistic" is a more appropriate term. Nothing in the film exists beyond the possibilities of reality; the simple omnipresent result confirms that imagining a combination of heartbeat and low light in music. <br /> <br /> Watch the trailer several times if you are attracted by visual images; see the film to see the consequences of connecting the poem and grasping for freedom.
