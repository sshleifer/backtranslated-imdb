The title of this movie does not make much sense until you see it in action, because it is the sound that a young late man does when he works with his imaginary cart, which he does all day. And he is just one of many strange characters in this surreal and sometimes tragic story of a group of slum dwellers in Japan. <br /> <br /> There are two drunks who trade wives, a man with aspirations or an architect, and his young son, whom he sends, begs for food. He is a wise old man who seems to be a pillar of common sense in everything that happens around him, and there is a businessman with some serious nervous tics who has a wife who treats him (and all others) like dirt. <br /> <br /> There is no specific plot in it, really, it's a collection of stories that drift between themselves, sometimes funny, sometimes tragic. In conclusion, I thought that it works quite well and I have wanted to see it for a long time based on its description. I was not the least disappointed and I definitely recommend it. 9 out of 10.
