More photos of the most popular pinup of all time than a typical biopic, this funny and fabulous movie has the appearance of an epoch with an excellent soundtrack and everything you want in an indie movie. I think the trend would be to portray Bettie Page as some sexual fox, like Jayne Mansfield. But if you really looked carefully at Bettie's poses, she always looked happy. Not "you would like me to take away from me", a haughty look, or "I just do it because my acting career has not left", the look of a porn star. And yes, the ladies involved in this film (three women-producers, screenwriter / director, co-writer and charming Gretchen Mol, who certainly helped me shape this role thanks to their sweet influence) really captured the idea of ​​a sweet, somewhat naïve, southern girl who she was really happy that she took her picture and she hoped that a good good JC would not be too upset with her. <br /> <br /> Gretchen Mol turns out to be a high-level career (she can just have the most perfect breasts in her life), which makes me happy because she has a curse. A few years ago, she made the Vanity Fair cover when nobody really knew who she was by advertising her as the next It-girl. And let's be honest, it was a bit arrogant. I mean, unfortunately, she never reached Gwyneth's status, though not because of her lack of talent. Choosing a few bad movies, when you're a pretty blonde in a whimsical Hollywood, you make me forget that I'm scared. If it does not come back to list A, well, I'll be an uncle of a monkey. <br /> <br /> Intensely private, Bettie has not seen the movie yet. Bettie left the high-level pinup party and fell in love with her old flame, Jesus. Whatever lifts your honey on a boat. You were one wonderful woman. I hope you are happy wherever you are. <br /> <br /> Congratulations, Mary Harron, you've made our cult idol justice.
