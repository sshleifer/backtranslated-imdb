If only ALL the animations were so great. This film is classic because it is strong, it's two simple aspects: history and character. The characters in this movie are beautifully personified. I felt for all the characters, and the human-animal relationship in the film works perfectly. Beautiful animation and three-dimensional computer animation did not work better in any other film. This is a great movie for children and adults who want a classic hero's journey. 8 out of 10.
