I saw this Australian movie about 10 years ago and I never forgot it. The film shows the horrors of war in a way that Hollywood usually shines. The relations between the soldiers of both struggling countries emphasize the differences in culture and the final knowledge that in the end, we all really do not differ within ourselves. If you can find any copy of it - buy or rent it. You will not be disappointed, just surprised.
