The good side of this movie is that it stands alone - you do not need to see the original. Unfortunately, this is also the biggest drawback. It would be nice to include some original characters in the new story and see how their lives have evolved. Sinclair, as in the original, is perfect and provides the best comic moments in movies when trying to cope with inconvenient and embarrassing situations, but the cast is not as strong as in the original movie. Forsyth, congratulations on the courageous attempt to move the character and create the original continuation, but the movie is ultimately flawed and lacks the original warmth
