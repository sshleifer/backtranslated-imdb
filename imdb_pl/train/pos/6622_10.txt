I just went to a movie screening at Expresion en Corto, the short film festival in Guanajuato, Mexico. One of the producers was there and introduced a brief introduction. The film was going on and from the first shot I was amazed: one long shot of futuristic Paris in glorious black and white. <br /> <br /> I should not continue with the details because I think it is a movie worth seeing. A science fiction story can be found on average for many ... it was really good for me. The action is great, the camera can fly everywhere and I mean everywhere. Things that you would not be able to do or see were done beautifully. The performance of the cast is good, in my opinion no one hits the wrong note. <br /> <br /> Now the thing that I think is amazing is animation. 3D graphics look 2D. BW comic book brought to life. The details of the background give a larger texture, as if it were made by hand (I'm sure it was, but when the angles change, you can see the depth). <br /> <br /> The producer at the show spoke about hard work behind the film: 7 years! The director, she said, is brilliant, but maybe he was inexperienced because he only had one short video in his CV. So many people have real faith in them. They set up their own studio from scratch and have faced the challenge they have brought them ever since. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this. I think you will not regret it ... maybe Richard Linklater for the final look of this movie is better than his.
