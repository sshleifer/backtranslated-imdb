I recommend this movie to everyone. Not only for rock fans Luciano Ligabue, but for all movie fans. Because he is honest, moving, funny and real. Because Ligabue is a born storyteller and a lover of the movie, and every frame of his film is created with love and care. Because his characters are loved and they ask for love. Because most of the Italian debuts are bad, and the one made by the outsider is a real joy to watch and listen. Because Stefano Accorsi is wonderful and reminds me of Andrea Pazienza, who, like Freccia, was beautiful and talented and good, and lost her life because of heroin, which Ligabue shows how she is, unfriendly and ugly, not indulging in easy moralisms. Because it is a movie that appeals to our hearts, our ears, our souls. And because I lived the experience of FM radio and that's how it was. Thanks, Luciano!
