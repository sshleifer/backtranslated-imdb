I suppose that JEDI is now chronologically considered the "last" entry in the popular saga and is very good, as are several of them. I liked how directly this sequel took off after THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and appreciated the maturity of Luke Skywalker as a hero (and also Mark Hamill as an actor). After hearing so many negative things about Ewoks, they were not that bad. I liked the exciting chase in the forest and I felt that there were many well-realized emotions in this chapter. Finishing (with some new additions, I think?) It successfully intertwines all 6 chapters into a wonderful fantasy story. I know that many real Star Wars fans hated George Lucas for the changes he introduced in the original films, but being a relative newcomer in these movies quite late in life and not missing what I did not know yet, I think he did these 6 films . perfectly as a whole. Oh, and err - Carrie Fisher looked quite delicious in her skimpy outfit.
