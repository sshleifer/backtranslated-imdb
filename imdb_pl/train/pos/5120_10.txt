Fast and simple, I love this movie. <br /> <br /> As others have mentioned, I'm not from the south, I do not care about country music and I never wore a cowboy hat. (I also never used a car with a dead body in the boot, but I love "Goodfellas".) It's just a great movie. Pictures in a 2.35 aspect ratio and beautifully transferred to a DVD. (VHS was 1.33 full screen). And yes, a robust 5.1 mix for viewing pleasure. What can you say about this film? <br /> <br /> It's just a great story about love / hatred in Texas, with great performances. Travolta is fantastic. Next to "Pulp Fiction" is the best thing he did. She's been in my five for 25 years !! <br /> <br /> Check it out! It's 10 !!!!
