This film documents the circumference of Harlem's ball from the mid-eighties. Much more fun than the Palazzo Volpi, although just as sick, this movie is a real pearl of misery. You can not help but sympathize with characters because of their quirks. The only goal of middle-class intellectuals is to document the phenomena of junk and glitz. Here, the most genius of garbage is very well documented and appropriately charmed. The preferences of the characters for idolatry of everything that is effective inspire even more adoration of the characters themselves from the viewer, creating the effect of the "phenomena phenomenon" that makes this film a work of art.
