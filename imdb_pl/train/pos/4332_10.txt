Paul Reiser did a spectacular job writing this movie. Peter Falk gives a presentation of his life. It is worthy of the Academy Award. It was one of the most moving and fun movies of the year. Reiser's prank is fantastic, and he's as good as he is in his long television series "Crazy about you." Peter Falk did a masterful job as a father, and Peter, who is now 78, also made us laugh and weep. The supporting staff was equal to the task, especially the wonderful great Elizabeth Perkins. This is a must see movie for 2005. We will assume that everyone of all ages and religions will love this film and somehow relate to it in one way or another. We have mothers, fathers and siblings in the film. We all had good and bad times together and we wish that everything would be the same but different.
