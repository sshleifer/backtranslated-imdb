I recently bought a whole series of American Gothic on DVD and fulfilled my memories. I was very grateful that I could see episodes that were never broadcast on TV for the first time. I loved the "Ring of Fire", especially the stories I did not see for the first time. <br /> <br /> Gary Cole is fantastic as "angry, sexy" Lucas Buck. Lucas Black as Caleb is also a great player. I thought that Brenda Bakke as Selena Coombs was also excellent in her performance. In fact, the entire cast was fantastically talented and had great chemistry with each other. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the series has been screwed up by the network (in collusion with a growing group of censors), because it was really designed to watch adults. A mixture of comedies, tragedies, farces, satires, gothic romances and genres of horrors, offered excellent characteristics supported by action at the level of genius. <br /> <br /> I had an incredible desire for the devil once in my life. Long live Gary Cole (sheriff Lucas Buck), the sweetest "fallen angel".
