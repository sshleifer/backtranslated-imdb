I could not agree more with the quote "this is one of the best films ever made". If you think that Vanilla Sky is simply "re-make", you can not be wrong. In this film there is a huge depth: visually, musically and emotionally. <br /> <br /> Visually, because the film is sometimes delicate and delicate (early scenes with Sofia), and sometimes strong and intense (Times Square, scenes after the climax). <br /> <br /> Music and sounds are so perfectly connected to this movie. Without music, the story is only half said. Nancy Wilson created an emotional and at the same time eclectic result for a film that could not be more suitable for such a dreamlike theme (although it was never released, I managed to get the original result for about 60 USD, you can find a copy yourself). Other music choices by Crowe, such as The Beach Boys, Josh Rouse, Spiritualized, Sigur Ros, Monkees, etc etc, are also great for the movie (Crowe has an ear for great music). <br /> <br /> More importantly, the emotional motifs in this film (ie Love, sadness, regret) are very strong and are strengthened ten times thanks to visual and musical experiences, as well as a brilliant dialogue; I admit, the scene of the elevator tears in my eyes again and again. <br /> <br /> However, the best part of this movie (as if it could be better) is that it is so intelligently made that everyone when you see the movie, you catch something new - so watch carefully and be prepared to think! Sure, the topic becomes obvious after the first or second watch, but there is always more to it than history. <br /> <br /> This is definitely the best job of Cameron Crowe, as well as the work of brilliance. Much of my filmmaking and musical inspiration comes exclusively from this work. I have sincerely touched my life because real art has a tendency to act. I am always surprised that there are many people who can not appreciate this film from what it is (I think that understanding art is art itself). <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Vanilla Sky is in his league.
