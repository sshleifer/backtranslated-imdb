I really like this movie, but the fact that you can not understand it, unless you're from the former Yugoslavia. Most of the actors are already dead and they were the best actors in the former Yugoslavia. I appreciate that this movie is now in Divx and I can have it in my collection. Macedonia. Serbia. Montenegro. Bosnia and Herzegovina. Croatia. Slovenia. <br /> <br /> All this was the former Yugoslavia, the crucible of the Balcan nations. This may be a land of dreams, if Slobodan Milosevic, Franjo Tudjman and other nationalists would not poison the mind of the nation with their ill ideas.
