It's just a classic movie in which human voices from animals are really what thoughts are. I do not know if my video copy has a stage, but it never shows how the dogs got off the bottom. It also shows the instinct of animal survival and tracking abilities. Place people in the same position as helicopters. For the first time, the original movie was corrected by the remake, because the reader for the first was removed. Only the use of animals can work in this kind of film, because using people would have to spice up the story, turning it into a murder, proving that in the end the animals are more interesting than people
