This movie caused me to cry at the end! I watch at least 3-4 movies a week. I saw a lot of great movies, more crap. But when the stage ends - katars in its core - came I Cried! And if not - you have serious problems! History is archetypal - nothing new or original. But this is real - because such things really happened and people really exist. Glam is not my music, but I really admire everything that went through in the early 70's ... At one point I directed me towards Velvet Goldmine! Docudramas never works really well. But this movie really urged us to believe it all ... Because they are not trying to make it a path full of great concerts, current musicians who are superheroes, Groupie girls who are stupid and emotionally stupid, do not glorify drugs and alcohol, promote rehabilitation and redemption, which comes even 20 years later ... Once again, a great movie. Since "Leaving Las Vegas" I have never been so moved by the movie.
