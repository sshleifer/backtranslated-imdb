Zane and Beringer will keep you on the edge of your seats. I usually do not go to military / military movies, but it was worth my time. <br /> <br /> It was serious but also fun. Beringer's character was heroic and honest. No matter what, you know she has your back. <br /> <br /> Zane's character has evolved throughout the movie. He was not just a suit, he definitely proved that he could be a hero and deal with weapons. <br /> <br /> It did not take me a long way. It really did not fit in the whole movie, but I'm glad I saw it. <br /> <br /> It's worth checking.
