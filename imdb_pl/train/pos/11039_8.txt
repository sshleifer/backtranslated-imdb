That's what I would call a good horror movie. With occultist / supernatural undertones, this nice low-budget French movie caught my attention from the first scene. This proves that you do not need wild effects or a lot of gore to create an effective horror. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around four inmates in prison, and each of these characters (and their motives) become progressively more interesting because the film builds tension to the finale. We see most of the action with Carrere's eyes, who just entered the prison and must get used to living with these three other prisoners. <br /> <br /> I will not say much because this movie really deserves to be more visible. However, there are a few drawbacks: FX is not very good, but it is used effectively; the plot opens up some secrets; and at the end everything becomes very misleading, but Malefique repurchases before the end. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a very good movie, 8/10
