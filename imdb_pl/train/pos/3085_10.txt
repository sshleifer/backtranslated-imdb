I watched unpublished episodes online and I was so sad that the show would not come back. He had the best cast of mature, talented actors and incredible chemistry. It looked like all actors are personal friends in real life. At the end, the show became engaging, sexy and highly perceptible. Of course, some feature lines are not realistic, so what ... Characters are nice and you will eradicate them. The performance reminded me of a cross between two other favorites: "Sex and the City" and "Felicity". Great recognition for all actors. Note for ABC managers: Nielsen's rating reports do not show real results. The concert audience will mainly record it. I was very disappointed with the main networks that flooded us with reality TV or teen-oriented programs. Why do we have to switch to HBO or FX to get mature, thoughtful and well-functioning material? I can only thank the network for sharing the remaining episodes online. New streaming media will gain more and more popularity among viewers.
