"Birth of the Beatles", an American television film, released in the fall of 1979, It was the best film so far to tell the story of four Liverpool boys who revolutionized the music industry and the world. As the point of view of the former Beatle Pete Best said. The performance of the entire cast is excellent, but most of all the performance of Stephen Mackenna as John Lennon and Rod Culbertson as Paul McCartney. The film was produced by the legend of the Rock and Roll era, Mr. Dick Clark. Who a year earlier in 1978 produced another television film that survived the test of time with the participation of Kurt Rusell in the main role with a different musical legend; "ELVIS". This film was directed by the unknown director, John Carpenter, who directed other successful films such as; "Halloween", "Escape From New York" and "The Thing". The same can be said for the director of "Birth of the Beatles", Mr. Richard Marquand. He then directed other theatrical hits such as "Return of the Jedi Star Wars", "Eye of the Needle" and "Jagged Edge." The only other film that tells the story of the well-known four of them is Back Beat, which premiered in 1994. However, the critics did not care about it or the audience because they did not have a long life in the theater. Birth of the Beatles is a very charming and simple movie that gives the essence of the beginning of the legend and the struggles and difficulties that have gone through, and ends here with the peak of success when they come to New York and appear in the show Ed Sullivan in 1964. I highly recommend this movie.
