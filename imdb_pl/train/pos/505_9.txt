A very good start. I was a little taken aback when I saw the machinery that was not so advanced: it should have been more cruel to match what we saw in the original series. The cast is interesting, although Mrs. Vulkan is a bit too human. She needs a school in Spock, which is after all a model for this breed. It is a pity that they could not choose Jeri Ryan. I like Mrs. Park, a Korean (?) Lady. The doctor has options. I did not solve the other males, except for the black guy. He is very nice. Bakula needs to find his niche - in QL his strong point was his sense of humor and willingness to try anything. It is obviously large and strong enough to heroism. The weights were fine, although I did not like their make-up.
