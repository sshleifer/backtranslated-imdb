WAQT is a perfect example of broth not quite for your soul. The broth, unfortunately, lost its true taste thanks to the excess of dilution and decoration that came into its production. <br /> <br /> What is surprising and disappointing in WAQT is that it comes from a director who stayed away from the usual stereotypes of Hindi cinema in his first venture, but in the second expedition he is in favor of all stereotypical film formulas. While Vipul Shah was convinced to show something as unbelievable as the blind robber in AANKHEN, he simply does not make life in the entire WAQT package, which is based on something as possible as the relationship between father and son. Taken from the Gujarati game by Aavjo Vhala Fari Malishu, WAQT has a meaningful storyline with a social message to support. A mature look at the father-son relationship, father's unconditional love for son and son's responsibility towards his family. Ishwar Chand Sharawat (Amitabh Bachchan), who himself established his entire empire from scratch, leads a rich life with his wife Sumitra (Shefali Shah). Their only son, Aditya (Akshay Kumar), never had to aim for anything, because he got everything that was tailor-made and fed with a spoon in life. Pampering Ishwar broke him even more. <br /> <br /> Aditya dreams about turning into a superstar, but he does nothing to fulfill his dreams. In the meantime, he marries his ladylove Mitali (Priyanka Chopra). Ishwar hopes that marriage will make Aditya a more responsible man, but he is disappointed. Aditya is still on his way to a carefree life. <br /> <br /> The strength limit eventually falls when Ishwar throws Aditya out of his home. A sudden change in the attitude of his affectionate father to him and his now awaiting wife surprises Aditya. There is no alternative but to seek to keep your wife and your unborn child. He begins to turn into an independent man, but the gap between him and his father grows. <br /> <br /> The story is simplified, while the uncomplicated scenario has a very basic approach. You can easily identify and refer to reliable characters of both father and son. If you are not one of these two, at least you could come across people like them in real life. <br /> <br /> Add to this the easy support for director Vipula Shah's script. With such a family affair, any other director would add a ton of melodrama in line with the family law of Bollywood, turning the film into a compulsive tear squeezer. However, Shah excels at dealing with emotions for the better part of the movie. <br /> <br /> A clear example of his unpretentious direction is tangible on stage before the break, in which the father throws his son out of the house in a rather unkind way. The goal of the scene is achieved without erasing the burden of the recipients' brains. The same applies to the scene from the second half, in which now the separated son of the father has a frivolous conversation. This is what distinguishes WAQT from KABHI KUSHI GHUM or EK RISHTAA and in fact puts it at a high level in terms of treatment. <br /> <br /> But after getting all the points of differentiation, you may be wondering where WAQT still fails in? The problem is that while WAQT is different from others in terms of treatment, it is subjected to glitches in the area of ​​packaging. What about the director forcing the song-n-dance every now and then in the first half. There is the song Johar kinda shaadi, the song Chopi kinda Holi, the song of the father disco dandia dandia, the song of dreams and the song of dreams that produces enough yawning in the viewer. Imagine this ... father has just denied his son from home, and his son dreams about a song in the mountains of Morocco with his wife. Not on the spot! For reasons! and the audience outside the seat. <br /> <br /> The film just stretches in the first half, and the actual story only begins in the second half. The director wasted too much WAQT on unnecessary elements. The much-spoken sequence of chasing dogs is not bad, but it is not redemption. However, dance taandav Akshay Kumar is just ridiculous. Imagine that you qualify for star hunting in this movie with this (involuntarily) funny histrionikiem. Add to this the climax of the final of the hunt for the stars, in which the son explodes with emotions. It's archetypal! Also the pattern of editing could be reversed to hide the reason for changing his father in relation to his son. <br /> <br /> Anu Malika's music is good, though unnecessary in the proceedings. Santosha Thundiiayil's camera is competent enough, though not very demanding. Aatish Kapadia invented some good dialogues for dramatic moments. <br/> <br /> Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav perfectly complement the light moments in the film. While Rajpal Yadav went overboard with his comic histrionics in many films, this time he does not understand his character and is completely restrained. His deadly expressions are perfectly complemented by the superior Boman's histrionics. <br /> <br /> Shefali Shah is convincing as a mother. It should not be treated as a vote of no confidence, but it is impeccable both in the game and in "looking" at your character. Priyanka is wonderful and performs her role well. <br /> <br /> Of course, great merits include Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan. Akshay is particularly expressive in the scene in which his loving father deliberately ridicules him to make him aware of his duties. Although Bachchan goes a little bit dramatically in a few scenes, his brilliance hits the whole movie. <br /> <br /> In summary, WAQT is like a soup whose ingredients are both tasty and nutritious, but the final recipe is not so appetizing.
