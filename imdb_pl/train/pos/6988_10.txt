This is one movie that will take some time to get out of your head once you see it. Dialog boxes are close to perfection, which you could expect because it was adapted from the game. Actors simply do their best, the story is simple and attractive. 88 minutes of pure bliss! <br /> <br /> Yvan Attal is completely credible in his role, Sandrine Kiberlain is still a beautiful blonde (but not so stupid) who has as much pleasure in the eyes as the ears, Jean-Paul Rouve provides a perfect approximation of the total jerk ( and he's proud of it being), and Marina Fois is a stupid friend who always makes mistakes when you least expect it. <br /> <br /> Thumbs to Bernard Rapp and colleagues for adapting this excellent game and all the best in future productions! <br /> <br /> I would like there to be more of them in today's production. If you like it, you'll probably like "Un air de famille" and "Cuisine et dependances" too. Both were written and played by a pair of Bacri / Jaoui.
