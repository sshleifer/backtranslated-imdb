This peculiar setting of Wagner's last opera definitely increased on me. When I saw him for the first time, I was a bit irritated by many films with surreal images and I felt that too much was imposed on this story. However, if you manage to reconcile with a fairly large number of "tricks", I think that it turns out that the film manages to capture the very strange, different world atmosphere of the opera and that there are moments that are especially <br /> <br /> Personally I never understood Kundry's role until I saw Edith Clever introduce her. Her performance (Yvonne Minton's synchronized with the mime) is nothing short of brilliant, from the very end to the end, and justifies the hours needed to absorb the film. <br /> <br /> Another reason for Satisfaction in this movie lies in the fact that it gives a spectacular interpretation of Robert Lloyd about the key role of Gurnemanz, which Lloyd performed with great force on opera stages around the world. I had the honor of enjoying him in the role of Gurnemanz several times on the Metropolitan Opera stage, and the juiciness of his voice and warm, the fatherhood of his interpretation of this noble character really had to be preserved, as did his performance in two main character monologues, the Karfreitag scene and the prophecy in Act 1. <br /> <br /> The version I saw was a video tape made for America, so there were subtitles that, unfortunately, can not be removed. This is particularly unfortunate, because the translation used is very inaccurate and enforces an extremely Christian interpretation of the film, which already enforces the opera's interpretation layers. It seemed to me that it was completely contrary to both the UNIKANIEM Christianity of Wagner and his very conscious attempt to "generalize" the Christian elements of the story. (See the footnote at the end of this review.) I think it's almost impossible to watch them when watching a movie with subtitles, and I strongly recommend you if you have the option of enabling subtitles in DVD versions. Do it, and instead, if the opera is unknown to you, read the libretto carefully in advance. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that there are a lot of things in the movie that I do not like and as fast as I saw it, done differently ... but it's been growing in my estimation over the years since I saw it for the first time , and I began to enjoy it again. <br /> <br /> __________________________________________________________________ <br /> <br /> ATTENTION CONTAINING THE SPOILER: A good example is the famous Kundry line: "I saw him ... him ... and laughed". This will be translated in subtitles for reasons that elude me because "I saw the face of the Savior." This is particularly annoying for me, because in the whole libretto Wagner is very consciously and cautiously referring to this invisible figure, WHO DO NOT NEED TO BE BIBLICAL Jesus as "der Heiland", ie in German "Healer" - reference to the wound Amfortas and all wounds and ailments and the need for healing.
