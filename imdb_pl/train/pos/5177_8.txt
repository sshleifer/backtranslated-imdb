I watched it last night, without seeing it for several years. It's a really funny video, with a few faces you did not know. Arkin shines as always. Check it out; you will not be disappointed. Incidentally, it was released on DVD and, unlike its packaging, is widescreen. The transfer is rather weak, but at least the whole movie is visible. ;-)
