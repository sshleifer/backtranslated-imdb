I could not be more impressed; Just eight years ago in 1983. I was going to see a movie about Star Wars in the theater! The best day of my life was about to happen. Until then, my only experience in Star Wars was several Star Wars HBO shows. I did not even see The Empire Strikes Back. <br /> <br /> And boy, this day brought me less critical eyes. Jabba. Big Rebel spaceships. The Emporer. Lightsaber with a green blade !! Wow! From this magical day, I had to watch this film hundreds of times. At this point, I can not even give you an accurate estimate. With these multiple reviews, I noticed, of course, that this movie - REAL Episode III - has its drawbacks. <br /> <br /> Of course, in the context of the movie Star Wars these "defects" are more "quirks". <br /> <br /> Millions had their magical day in 1977 and 1980. In May 1983, I had my own. And this was my Star Wars movie.
