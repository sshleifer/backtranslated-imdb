I had a good time watching this photo and was very surprised by its more erudite features. First of all, the film is undeniably cheap with cardboard sets, limited settings and creative props. The actors play from very poor (two stripteasers), barely professional (Herb Evers as the main man), gothic exaggeration (Leslie Daniels as Kurt's assistant) to first-rate with Virginia Leith in the title role of a headless victim living against her will for the sake of science and the lusty passions of her bride. However, the script is very good and the dialogue is fantastic for a similar movie. The issues abound in what role science and medicine have in our lives and what their boundaries should be. This film is a thinking movie in many ways. However, do not be fooled by his real intentions. This is a dingy story about a man who is obsessed with his skills in medicine, who wants to connect the head of his dead girl with a perfect body, thus creating the perfect woman for the man with the best body and soul. Another very clear aspect of the film is saxophone music, which strongly resonates every time a doctor examines the city in search of female beauties.
