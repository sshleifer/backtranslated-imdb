Seeing both "Fear of a Black Hat" and "This is Spinal Tap", I can honestly say that both films are really similar. In "Fear" there will be many times that you will have hysteria. No wonder why both films have such a huge cult. "Fear" will soon be available on DVD. Rent it if you have to, but the only way to enjoy it is to have it for yourself.
