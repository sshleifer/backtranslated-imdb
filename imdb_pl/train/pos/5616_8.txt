What can you say, really ... "The Tenant" is a top class thriller shot with equal amount of uncertainty and full of paranoia. It's an artfully sketched movie - every detail seems to be made for some reason - although the plot rarely makes sense, and many of them are never addressed in an objective way. That is why Trelkovsky (Pola≈Ñski), a quiet Polish man who got a flat because of the suicide of the previous tenant, stays more and more unstable - to guide us through the world of growing fear and uncertainty. After the warm-up event, the flat, cast by a group of unbearable collaborators, Trelkowski is subjected to ever-greater, seemingly inexplicable control by other residents of the building; the rest of the film chronicles his mental deterioration and gives us an accurate mindfu * k on par with the subsequent efforts of David Lynch. "Tenant", however, is more thoughtful and sinister, filled with unexpected comic relief, great performances and a truly haunting result. It's a movie that's better experienced than described, so come back to it.
