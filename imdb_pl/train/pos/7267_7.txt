Curly Sue is 6 years old, has a lot of hair and life as a tramp. She and her father, Bill (Jim Belushi), try to survive on the streets, being small cheats. In Chicago, Bill decides to jump in front of the car in an expensive garage, while Curly will shout for lawsuits and traction against the intended victim. This is a very exclusive Gray lawyer (Kelly Lynch), who is terrified enough about what she did. Fraudsters earn not only money, but also spend the night in the luxurious Gray apartment. Even then, Gray feels that she owes them, so all three of us stay together. Gray knows only a lucrative law business and nothing about life. Who better to teach her than Bill and Curly, those experienced real life experts? But all good things have to end and there is no life for a legal expert and a few crooks. Whether there is a? It's a sweet and funny movie about the unexpected. Curly is certainly as much fun as Shirley Temple, but of course much sharper. Belushi gives rare, touching performances because his happiness and Lynch are luminous, like a snobbish but delicate lawyer. John Hughes, as a screenwriter and director, again shows us his magical touch, because the script is vivid and unpredictable. Just look how Curly and Bill take Gray for the night without money, and see the humorous results. Do you miss the happy endings, long promised and finally released, with some uncertain times in between? This is your movie to order.
