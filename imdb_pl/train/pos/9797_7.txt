Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman is the newest animated Batman straight to the video / DVD to be released. (Minor Spoilers Ahead) The plot revolves around a new criminal, Batwoman, who appears to be personally involved, for whatever reason, in stopping the serious transport of weapons. <br /> <br /> Although the movie is interesting enough, it's not as good as "Fantasy Mask", "Sub-Zero" or "Return of the Joker". The main reason is that it does not trigger the emotional appeal of other films. At the end of this movie we do not really regret anyone, as in others, especially "Sub-Zero". There is no real tragedy that would make other animated films unique for us. Even Batwoman is not really a "tragic" character (like Mr. Freeze or Phantasm). Not only that, but the alter ego Batwoman seems so incredibly "stiff" and boring, that the viewer does not worry about what happened to her, which caused that she put on the mask or what is happening to her at the end, and that is the main reason we do not get this special emotional appeal. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I found this movie pleasant. He has his moments, for example, when the audience learns who Batwoman really is and seeing the return of an old villain who was last seen in the original "Batman: The Animated Series." The action is also very pleasant at some very uncertain times. <br /> <br /> If the Batwoman background was more interesting, this movie would be better than the "Return of the Joker" in my book, but as it is now, it is in 4th place (out of 4). <br /> <br /> When it comes to animation, it's the same as in the cartoon The New Batman Adventures from the mid to late 90's. The score is not as memorable as the previous 3 animated Batman movies, but it is still good. <br /> <br /> I recommend buying this DVD because it's nice, despite its flaws. But remember, it's not as good as other animated Batman movies. <br /> <br /> 7/10
