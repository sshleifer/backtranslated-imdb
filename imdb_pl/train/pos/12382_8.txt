Here is a decent horror from the mid-1970s about the gate of Hell in New York, which turns out to be old sandstone. It seems that there are many Hell's gates around, but of course this unconscious model decides that it needs some space from its boyfriend / fiancé, so it simply chooses one that is disguised as a nice and inexpensive flat. He meets a few strange neighbors and even takes part in a birthday party for a cat. After meeting the real estate agent because she hears strange noises in the night from above, she learns that she and the old priest are the only tenants. Whoa! So who are all the weirdos? Her boyfriend (slick lawyer, played by Chris Sarandon) begins to spin and discovers that things are not what they look like, not a long shot. It has a few decent, terrifying scenes, and the idea of ​​creaking old people who are its "sometimes" neighbors other than what appears is quite intriguing. A bit decent gore, and even a parade less than normal people at the end makes it a decent watch, and although I've seen it many times on television, obviously the incorrect version of the DVD is much better. Nice little horror, maybe a good addition to "Burnt Offerings". 8 out of 10.
