I really liked it, but I still have nightmares over the hotel manager. The film was well presented, and the choice of actors carries their roles in the realities of writing. Many scenes have captured the imagination and created nails for nails. The progress of the situation was cleverly written, which made me believe that history is only going one way to find a new turn in what I thought was obvious. It is a pity that there must be advertising. I told many friends to watch the next shows, and of course I will be watching again. I enjoyed the scenery of the film and felt that it adds to the plot and intrigue. Husband and wife were eagerly discussing (or should we rather talk about battles?) They were very realistic. The initial situation is common, but the escalation of the presented story is fortunately not. I want to thank everyone who was involved in this great entertainment movie. Thank you! Waiting for more movies --- when? Whidbey
