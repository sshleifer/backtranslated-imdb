I really enjoyed the debut of director Ring, Hideo Nakata. If you've seen Ring before, you'll know the style and idea of ​​the movie. It has a subtle horror that works better than solid (and predictable) stings that attack most of the genre's movies. If you like movies that give you chills, you'll probably like this one. Good, terrifying debut Hideo Nakaty. 8/10
