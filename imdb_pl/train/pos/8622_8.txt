I just can not agree with the above comment - in this movie there are many interesting and really amazing film images, it has an unusual structure and moves towards a terrifying climatic sequence, which is noteworthy due to the effective use of silence. What's more, he explores the strange impulse of suicide in a very honest way, not pulling any blows into what he shows, but not living and over sensationalally moving the subject. he has a documentary, as well as horror and artistic cinema, and deserves a place among the canon of "different" horror movies, such as The Blair Witch Project and the original Ring (both of them are ahead of and anecdotal). It's definitely worth seeing if you're interested in the edges of horror movies.
