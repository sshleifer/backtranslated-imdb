Jane Eyre has always been my favorite novel! When I came across this movie version in the late 90s, I was delighted! This is the best and most complete version of the book on the film! This version is a little too long to sit in one place, but it's worth it. Timothy Dalton is amazing like Rochester. I was glad that they had a normal-looking actress (Zelah Clark) as Jane, not a charming person. I love sets and location. For anyone who is a real fan of Jane Eyre, this is the version to watch !!! For those who are interested, I just found this version on DVD. I watched my copy of VHS almost to breaking, so I was delighted to find it on DVD.
