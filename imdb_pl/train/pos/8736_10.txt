You will enjoy incredibly sophisticated computer animation, and the novelty probably will not stand up during the first, second or third viewing, but you will be attracted by characters that are so simple but intriguing that you can find yourself properly caring about them in an unexpected way, which can but it does not have to make you feel a bit childish because of the medium. <br /> <br /> Disney still maintains the title of "The Biggest Animation in the World", with "Life of the Bug" has become one of their greatest achievements. One of the innovative additions is a great "out-takes" added to the end of the movie. The DVD contains two sets of out-outs, in which, as I said, the VHS cassette has one alternative version for the tape. The DVD also contains the game "Gerry? S Game ", which is a charming little PIXAR movie that was also shown before the movie in cinemas. <br /> <br /> This is by far the best insect film compared to Dreamworks? "Antz", which is quite good, but lacks something in the animation and development of the story and characters. If you look at the voices of the stars of both films, "Antz" is largely popped up with "movie" stars with a few well-known television "stars" where "Bug Life" is quite the opposite, loaded "TV" plays with Kevin Spacey as the only standout exception . But the difference in quality is clear and obvious. <br /> <br /> Dreamworks can not be blamed or surprised, when you go head to head with Disney, you have a job done. This is the kind of movie that almost makes me want to have children to share it with. Do not think for a moment that it's just a movie for children.
