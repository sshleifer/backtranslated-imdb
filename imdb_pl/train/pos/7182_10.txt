I thought that the first episode of the first series was really good. It was really fun and I thought the actors were brilliant. I think it's a crime for anyone who said it was bad because it looked like the right time. I think it's really annoying when people say it was not historically correct, because it's supposed to be Saturday's entertainment, which is not a boring document of history. A great start and I will love what will happen next !! I talked to many people in my school and they love the show! we all think that it is great entertainment and has great stories to do.
