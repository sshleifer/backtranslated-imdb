What surprised me the most was the pure audience he was attracted to. Related films such as Anita and Me have never caused such a big buzz as this movie, though I think probably because of the mention of "Beckham" in the title more than anything else. <br /> <br /> This is a brilliant movie presenting a brilliant message - you can do anything if you are determined enough and focus on what is such a positive message for anyone watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I think it's one of the better Keira Knightley movies and I think she is a brilliant actress and she was great for this role. Parminder Nagra was also brilliant. Unfortunately, I can not say that to Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, because I do not think he's such a good actor, and to be honest, his eyes were a bit scary. <br /> <br /> In total a brilliant movie and a brilliant story
