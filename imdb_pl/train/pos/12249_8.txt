The old-fashioned story of old Jane seems very popular nowadays. I lost the count of the number of versions. Probably the reason is that its "ruts" are our ruts even at this late date. This mini-series of television gives it a mannerist character appropriate to the novel. Stubborn, stubborn Emma is a pretty "modern" girl when you think about it, although the atmosphere of the Jane Austen world may seem a bit artificial to us today. If you have not appeared to EMMA, I will just say that self-sufficient Emma gets her seriousness. It's worth to see how to do it. Acting honors are due to the ladies: Kate, Prunelli, Lucy and Samantha. They could almost have a psychic relationship with old Jane!
