Holes are an amazing movie. I like it very much and it's one of my favorite movies. This is one of the few films produced by Disney, which is not bad. Holes are usually a very nice movie. I would like Disney to do more such photos. Holes are indeed a rare variation of Disney's flickering, which is fun. Do not get it wrong, I do not mean Disney's bad mouth, but most of its stuff is for children and it's OK. Children also deserve their entertainment. But Disney is guilty of trying to appeal to teenagers and they usually fail. But not with holes. It's a kind of movie that anyone, regardless of age, can watch and enjoy, and once they do not think it's trivial. Really, it's a kind of movie that many young caprices can draw from because there are characters in it that they can relate to. <br /> <br /> is not too tacky and does not live a little on the edge. I hope Disney takes more risks and makes more sharp movies.
