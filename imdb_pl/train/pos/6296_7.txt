Parker (Johnathan Schaech) is a novice writer who is still looking for his big break. In the meantime, he works as a telephone adviser in the Manhattan hotline in Manhattan. One day, unfortunately, his apartment building is burning. Parker and his cat are alive, but they are stuck in the tedious task of finding affordable apartments in the Big Apple. Parker comes to the word that you, Samantha (Alison Eastwood), are looking for a roommate, but will only accept a gay man. Because Parker is simple, but the price is right, he decides to pretend to be gay. Samantha likes him from the very beginning and greets him as his new cohabitant. But, poor Parker. Sam is beautiful, intelligent and very desirable. How will he be able to control his true nature? Besides, is not Sam a successful boy-businessman? It's a sweet, nice and humorous movie with two very attractive stars in Eastwood and Schaech. Naturally, the plot is a sequence of scenes "how can I keep this trick", and Sam asks Parker for a shampoo while she takes a shower or begs him to keep her in bed when she receives bad news. In addition, Parker is required to produce his own "fake" gay colleague, Boris, when Sam insists on repairing him with a man he knows. I hope that the gay community will not find it too offensive, because this viewer felt that most of the problems were treated with sensitivity and subtlety. In the case of a small-scale film, the costumes, sets and work with the camera were quite good. Therefore, if you love these funny stories about love, get it soon. You'll like what you see, I know it.
