Tarzan and Jane live happily in the jungle. Some men come to look for ivory and take Jane back to civilization. But Jane loves Tarzan and does not want to leave. One of the men falls in love with Jane and is determined to take her back ... even if it means killing Tarzan. <br /> <br /> It's a rarity - a continuation better than the original. "Tarzan, the Ape Man" from 1932 was good, but he had some terrible special effects and a little dragged. This one has much better effects and is more adult. There is a lot of glaring racism (black man is shot spotty - and nobody cares), but it was 1934. There is also a lot of blood, blood and violence (in the movie from 1934), And the prints make Jane a long underwater bath completely nude! There is also obvious sexual content, and Tarzan and Jane bear almost nothing and (implies) sleep together and have sex - without marriage. It did not bother anyone today, but in 1934 it was quite extreme. <br /> <br /> In addition, the film is well-directed, very fast and full of adventures and emotions. A look at Weissmuller in this skimpy canvas of a lion is certainly a feast for the eyes, and Jane's outfit is also quite revealing. I still think Maureen O'Sullivan is evil as Jane, but Weismuller is perfect as Tarzan. Everyone else is fine. <br /> <br /> This is without a doubt the best Weismuller - O'Hara Tarzan. Worth seeing, but not for children!
