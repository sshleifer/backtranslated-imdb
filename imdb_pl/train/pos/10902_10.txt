I was very moved when I watched the movie. How ionny could keep that hope, and the faith was amazing. so many people care only for what they want and worry about all the things they do not have. and there are such small things as chothes, a new car money. I saw people with tears because of a flaw. this movie restores everything to the basics. Love, hope that the beauty of simple but important things in life causes our everyday problems to be perceived as small and really unimportant. you look at this boy and you realize how long you have been blessed with food, a roof over your head and loved ones around you. You are really blessed. and the saying "stop and smell roses really has a new meaning. I know that Jonny will see this and I would like to thank him very much for sharing such faith, strength and humor with me. Thank you, jonnie, I know that you are rising into the heavens and bringing lots of love and laughter to the heavens.
