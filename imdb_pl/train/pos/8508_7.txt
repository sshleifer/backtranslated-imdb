Richard Dix decided to retire, so Michael Duane took his place, playing the role of Ted Nichols, who meets with the young French Alice Dupres Barkley (Lenore Aubert). This couple knew only for two days and decided to get married by the magistrate (judge) and it was raining when they rode to the judge's house and found out that he was not at home and would not come back until the next day. When the couple is at home, you see someone lift the hood of their car and take the car part from the engine. When you see that this event is happening, you realize that this couple has a big surprise and story to reveal the very mysterious event that surrounds Alice Barkley and that poor Ted Nichols begins with many troubles and without marriage. Good secret, but I missed Richard Dix. Enjoy.
