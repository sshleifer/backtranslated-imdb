"Going Berserk" is actually one of the funniest Candy movies I've ever seen. Sure, it's a bit low budget, but it's a non-stop comedic tour de force. There are many unforgettable quotes. For example, when his future father-in-law asks him how much he earns, Candy says, "Oh, I'm breaking down between thirty and ... eleven thousand dollars a year, sir." Oh, of course, Candy delivery is selling. Just classic things. Eugene Levy also becomes a funny performance as a poor filmmaker. The clip of his terrible low-budget film "Kung Fu U" will make you roll. <br /> <br /> So if you're a fan of Candy and want to rediscover a forgotten gem, I can not recommend this movie.
