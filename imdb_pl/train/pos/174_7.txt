Sunny, a waitress from the canton of D.C., is a little bland, to put it mildly. He drives an old cluster and rents a tiny room from a homosexual pair of men. However, he saves the life of an eminent Arab, taking the ball back, which was intended for an official. It captivates the national press with its charming remarks and sweet look. The presidential assistants, sniffing the opportunity, install it in the department of the US government's protocols. Even then, he sometimes mixes things, but tries hard and learns a lot. He even captures the romantic attention of a state department official. But is there another sinister conspiracy involving an Arab man who wants to take another wife? Blonde? LOL, LOL, LOL. This movie depicts Goldie as pretty as a picture and stupid as a fox, they say. Sunny very, very well, learns in the jungle of the US government. He even has important things to say about integrity and its lack in its protocol setting. Perhaps the Arab community would not be delighted with this job, but for those who like to laugh, rent it today.
