My uninterrupted love for the Italian actress Lucianna Paluzzi, who helped me start my maturing thanks to the performance in the "Thunderball" of 1965, led me to quite unusual places. An example is the British curiosity of 1959 "Carlton-Browne of the F.O." which presents Lucianna in one of her earlier roles. She plays the princess, although the picture is actually a showcase for the talents of Terry-Thomas and Peter Sellers, whose stars certainly grew at that moment. In this charming, often very funny movie, we learn about the island-like Gaillardia country, which until 1916 was a British colony, then widely forgotten. Forty-three years later, however, it becomes the center of global attention and international espionage, when valuable cobalt deposits are discovered there, and Her Majesty sends the inept Carlton-Browne of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to power. Terry-Thomas nicely emphasizes this part, like Sellers in the role of Amphibulos prime minister from a small country. (It was Sellers's second film from 1959 about a small country that suits the world, and the other is "Mouse that roared", of course.) Ian Bannen almost steals the program here, as a kind King Gaillardia, and my girlfriend Lucianna is so attractive, how it can be in its minor role. The film shows a lot in the form of very dry humor, although there are several belly laughter (for example a party at the Gaillardian airport, and especially a major-style parade in May). Granny Sellers' grainy premiere, with its cracked English and seemingly eternal patches of sweat, is another memorable figure in the pantheon of this great actor. Despite the occasional occurrence or two incomprehensible, stiff British giblets, I found this photo, which is a modest entertainment and well presented on this sharp-looking DVD Anchor Bay.
