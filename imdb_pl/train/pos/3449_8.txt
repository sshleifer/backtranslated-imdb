TACHIGUI: AMAZING LIFE OF QUICK GRIFTERS Japanese title: Tachiguishi Retsuden <br /> <br /> Director: Mamoru Oshii Featuring: Toshio Suzuki, Mako Hyodo, Kenji Kawai, Shinji Higuchi, Katsuya Terada Narrated by Koichi Yamader - ------ -------------------------------- <br /> <br /> Returning in 1995, Mamoru Oshii unleashed his dazzling Animated film Ghost In The Shell, which helped consolidate international anime acceptance - and also delved into the general concept of Andy and Larry Wachowski for The Matrix. <br /> <br /> Continuation of the film, Innocence (2004), was the inaugural Japanese animated film that competed for the Palme d'Or at Cannes, and left the heads spinning the same due to their style and innovative effects, as well as its unfathomable storyline. <br /> <br /> Always trendsetter, Oshii presented us with Tachigui: The Amazing Lives Of The Fast-Food Grifters? which has absolutely nothing to do with Ghost In The Shell or Japanese anime in this area. <br /> <br /> Say hello to Oshia's "superlivation" creation: not quite an animation or live action. Instead, the cast has survived somewhere around 30,000 photos that have been digitally processed and reproduced in a deceptively simple cut-out style reminiscent of Balinese puppetry. The movement itself is a stop-motion style that resembles sequences from the experimental Tetsuo Shinyi Tsukamoto: Iron Man (1988). <br /> <br /> "I could not come up with any method other than this one," said Oshii in a recent interview with The Daily Yomiuri. "I realized that this project is not suitable for traditional animation." <br /> <br /> The cast selection is just as enigmatic. Kenji Kawai - who also composed a great soundtrack - appears as a predatory fanatic of a burger, while well-known producer of Studio Ghibli, Toshio Suzuki, spends his time on the screen, murdered in a bizarre way. Others are Katsuya Terada, who played with Oshia on Blood: The Last Vampire and Shinji Higuchi - a special effects specialist who worked on Godzilla's films. <br /> <br /> Koichi Yamadera's narrative sounds like the material of a dry documentary film NHK ?? which contradicts comic tones, as well as the extensive career of Yamadera, expressing stoic anime characters such as Spike Siegel in Cowboy Bebop. <br /> <br /> And the plot itself is a bizarre re-imagination of Japan after the Second World War in the context of various off-shoot fast-food - from soba ramen to gyudon stand-up bars; American dogs in heating trays at grocery stores in McDonald's restaurants with burgers. "Food is the original root of desire," explained Oshii, explaining. <br /> <br /> Thrown into a mix is ​​a new consumer race: fast food champions, people who do not like paying for a tucker and constantly refine their sophisticated scams to get free munchies points. <br /> <br /> Oshii said that his hidden motive was a tribute to the "art" of eating on the streets? something still considered a little taboo in this country, which in a sense explains the use of "tachigui" in the title. <br /> <br /> The director of action movies (Avalon, Stray Dog) in addition to animation, Oshii often blurs the definition between two mediums. The celluloidal result is embedded somewhere in the gray area between the two formats. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the visual experiment here is as joyful as it can be annoying. Just do not ask what it really means; Oshia's films, which are equal to the brain and innovation parts, are often not particularly transparent. Where goes Oshii, thanks to a liberal dose of black humor? here you will find Kentucky Fried Rat, death of hula-hoop, the world's fastest boss of samurai burger ?? and in the very nature of the surrealism of the film. <br /> <br /> He is a man who rejects the influence of filmmakers like Godard and Truffaut, and maybe he owes Andrei Tarkovsky as much as David Lynch. It should not be surprising then that at some point the B-52 bomber performs a flight in a similar to Yoshinoy franchise. The 54-year-old writer-director seemed to consider it natural. "Japan, which I introduced in the film, does not necessarily have to be faithful to reality" - he suggested. <br /> <br /> Of course. -------------- <br /> <br /> Author: Andrez Bergen
