"Panic in the Streets" is a fairly unknown film by Elia Kazan, who was created before his classic masterpieces, such as "A Streetcar Named Desire", "On the Waterfront" and "East of Eden". Kazan had already won the Oscar in 1947, before the film, so he was not completely unknown at the time. Still "Panic in the Streets" is mainly a film that has passed under the radar. <br /> <br /> The great thing about this movie is the Oscar-winning screenplay. It has a very good concept and excellent, tight thrill material with smelling of crime / film elements. The dialogue in this film is also absolutely great and gives the film a sense of reality and credibility. <br /> <br /> The cast is quite unknown (especially when it was released), but still contains Zero Mostel and Jack Palance in one of their first film roles. Especially Palance impresses as a tough gangster boss with a very powerful looking face. <br /> <br /> Despite this, the movie sometimes drags on. The film starts very well, but after the start the film slows down and does not always make the right decisions in terms of pace and point of view of story telling. <br /> <br /> And yet: "Panika w The Streets" remains a perfectly viewable movie, mainly thanks to a solid script and a powerful dialogue that makes the film believable. For fans of the genre of thrillers, this is a great movie to watch. <br /> <br /> 8/10
