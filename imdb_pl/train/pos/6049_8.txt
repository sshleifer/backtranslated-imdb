Freebird is the perfect combination of travel comedy, gang caper, stoner movie and good British movie. <br /> <br /> They are outstanding heroes who distinguish this film from other genre films. The stars Phil Daniels, Gary Stretch and Geoff Bell have great chemistry and make their characters very friendly and realistic. The main story focuses on their journey from London to Wales and the adventures and tricks that take place along the way. This small movie also has a big heart - not only for bike fans, because it relies on the relationship of the characters with each other, including dreams and regrets, such as Fred Stretch's longing for the family he left behind. The pictures are also great - a love letter to the Welsh countryside, as well as capturing the grittness of London's streets and the typical life of pubs in Welsh towns. <br /> <br /> Stylish, great, fantastic soundtrack, nice characters, funny plot - I recommend Freebird in the blink of an eye!
