I saw this movie for the first time 3 years ago and it was introduced by the then Disney director Eisner and the real Jim Morris. <br /> <br /> About a month ago he returned to television and this time I recorded it. Since then I had to watch him at least three times. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful, inspiring, good movie that is intelligently written and credible by everyone interested. It is immune to any sentimental trick in the book, as well as all other stereotypes. <br /> <br /> It's refreshing to see a movie where kids are not jerky and have a lot of behavioral problems, and jockeys are not portrayed as testosterone-driven muscles. <br /> <br /> These are just normal people who have such dreams as you and me <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Hollywood has gone another extreme from what they call "grainy realism", making movies, where everyone curses, and has problems with aggression. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a man who has a dream and is encouraged by friends and family to pursue this dream. The people in Big Lake TX seem so endearing that I want to move there. <br /> <br /> As I said b4, the film does not try to overdo it with sentimentality. Dennis Quaid, as always, never fails. I've watched him since the late 70's, and he's so underestimated. <br /> <br /> But this movie has excellent performances from EVERYONE interested, and kudos for writers. <br /> <br /> The jewel in the film is near the end when Jim is practicing in a dugout before the big game, and his wife is calling to him from the stands. He rushes and reaches out to his family. Looking at the faces of three other pitchers sitting on a dug-out bench is priceless. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a change of pace, choose this movie.
