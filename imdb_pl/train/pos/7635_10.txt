I've seen this movie many times and I have to tell you that I liked it every time. In my opinion, this is the peak movie of Belushi. Belushi and Lovitz are so nice and identifiable with an ordinary person that you can not help but get involved when you start watching. The film has a great cast of stars, some were already large and others have just begun. It's a movie that makes you feel good, and that's the way it is. This film teaches that life is not always so bad. Sometimes it's enough to look at things in a different perspective to fully appreciate what you already have. When you finish watching, you will appreciate what you have much more, and you will also smile. In my opinion, you can not ask for much more from the movie, not to mention that it is a funny movie and you will never lose interest. A very underrated movie here. <br /> <br /> Rating from me: 10 I'm outside !!!
