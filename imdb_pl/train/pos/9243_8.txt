Do not listen to many unpleasant and mocking comments about this movie ... simply, when it comes to ninja movies, my friends are as good as they can! <br /> <br /> Yes, it's stupid, yes, the acting and the script are absolutely horrible, but thanks to the rubber - it's such a damn fun! In fact, as is often the case with B-Movies, the frightening "acting" (which in the case of the discussed movie is really one of the worst I've ever had the pleasure to watch!) And a funny "story" actually serve only to raise the level of pleasure tenfold. <br /> <br /> Of course, the battle scenes are the main attraction in this, although for the most part I am happy that they are very well choreographed, especially the final showdown (during which we are witnessing that the ninja are not supposedly limited by the normal laws of gravity ....) <br /> <br /> Trust me, if you're a fan of ninja movies and you have not seen Sakura Killers yet, then I really miss what I think is one of the real jewels in the crown of the genre.
