Fred MacMurray / Carole Lombard's third film is slightly more serious than Hands Across the Table and The Princess Comes Across. This is another adaptation of Burlesque art, which was supposedly popular at that time. <br /> <br /> The original Burlesque game was played on Broadway in the 1927-1928 season for 372 shows, and the role played by Carole Lombard Barbara Stanwyck comes from Broadway, which brought her to Hollywood. The version with Nancy Carroll in the first days of the talks, and later Betty Grable and Dan Dailey, made another version in When My Baby Smiles At Me. <br /> <br /> In fact, I have a vinyl version of the album, which Al Jolson and Ruby Keeler did for the Lux Radio Theater. It's an interesting job, believe me. <br /> <br /> In any case, MacMurray and Lombard are doing well with the old chestnut, the story is now set in a nightclub where Lombard is a singer, and MacMurray is a jazz trumpeter. Pay attention to the good performance of Dorothy Lamour as a Latin vixen that gets between Fred and Carole. Also Anthony Quinn is one of his earliest films as a wolf in production for Lombard. <br /> <br /> Swing High, Swing Low is really nice today and I would not be surprised if we saw the next version of Burlesque for the 21st century.
