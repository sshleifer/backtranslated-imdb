I have to be honest, I expected failure so bad because it really sounded like they were trying to release the original movie to get money. But this was not the case with this quite funny (sometimes weird) movie. I loved how they told the story of Timon and Pumba, the story of Simba and him having trouble sleeping was fun. Bubble with a jacuzzi, and when Pumba leaves, the bubbles stop. It's all harmless, good for children and some adults. I think this movie will last for some time because it is rather good for the film directly on video and DVD. While the movie seems a bit strange and a bit late at the end, it works. 8 out of 10
