In the past there were countless movies about animals, most of which contain digital animated lips of animals, almost matching the voice, or are ridiculously amateurish. "Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey" is not. <br /> <br /> This movie does not need a baby-friendly addition of moving dog lips or gesticulating cat's limbs. It can make you believe that the animals are really talking to each other and that you can get attached to them emotionally (as it should be all the great films of a boy and his dog). <br /> <br /> Homeward Bound is the embodiment of all friendly animal families for me and boasts beautiful pictures, an inspiring soundtrack (from Bruce Broughton's genius) and an impressive cast ... <br /> <br /> Michael J. Fox ... Szansa <br /> <br /> Sally Field ... Sassy <br /> <br /> Don Ameche ... Shadow <br /> <br /> Frank Welker (Voice of God). .. Miscellaneous <br /> <br /> This is a modernized version of the classic fictional children's play "The Incredible Journey", which was made in a half-documentary Disney movie long time ago in 1963. The sequel (Lost in San Fransisco) is not such a good movie, but it extends the adventure of my favorite friends with furry legs and is a fun urban twist about the great adventure in the open air. Do you want to entertain your children in the witty, nice, heart-warming mini-epics, without the idiotic and often completely funny comedy of modern children's cinema? Parents, buy all three movies for your kids - now! Thank you, Disney, for bringing tears to my eyes every time I watch the classics from the early 90's!
