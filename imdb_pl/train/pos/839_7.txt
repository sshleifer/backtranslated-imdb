Think, Pierce Brosnan, and you think of a polite, elegant, intelligent James Bond. In this movie, Brosnan plays against the type - and has a lot of fun (like the audience). This is a movie about a hired killer who befriends a harassed businessman ... and works! <br /> <br /> This is a funny movie with very good scenes (riveting, sharp Brosnan and a good, compatible "off" - the latest Kinnear has some good lines). My only idea is that Hope Davis, playing for such a tolerant wife ("Can I see your weapon?") Does not appear more often: it could be a great foil for these men. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a matador: playing with the audience while "wants to kill". The ending is amazing because there is a plot (with a positive moral!): It is a crazy, crazy and funny movie that deserves to be a wide audience.
