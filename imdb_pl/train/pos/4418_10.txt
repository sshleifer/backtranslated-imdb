I saw it at the Hawaii Film Festival, where the director and his wife (who produced it) took part in the Q & A. <br /> <br /> It was hard for me to believe that this is a director for the first time and everyone loves Harvey Keitel once again risking and going on to the stage he liked. <br /> <br /> Certainly reminiscent of Kino Paradiso, tells the story of a young director about the turn of the revolution in Cuba. However, do not expect it to be a film about the revolution, that its political position is wonderfully ambiguous. Many references to the obvious love of directors for the story of the film (great "Bicycle Thief") and a few capricious scenes that are not pretentious. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
