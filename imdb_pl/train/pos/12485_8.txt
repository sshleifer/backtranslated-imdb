I just watched this movie and I have to say that I was impressed. It is very scary and has many moments that will make you jump out of the seat! On the way, I had to light a few "emergency" cigarettes to calm my nerves! If I had to criticize, I would say that there may have been too many jumps at all. It reached the point where each new scene reached a climax, and this gradually removed the surprising effect, because in a sense you are new. they were all done so well that they kept the terrifying factor of fear. He had elements of The Shining, The 6th Sense and The Changeling (in particular, the soundtrack reminded me of The Changeling). <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good fear!
