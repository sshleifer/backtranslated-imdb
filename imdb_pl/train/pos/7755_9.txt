"Written on the Wind" is an irresistible, wonderfully perverted movie, because only director Sirk could do it. The film is immersed in a bucket full of Freudian symbols, strange melodramatic and colorful contrasts. The link between financial success and moral decline is the main theme of the film. Sirk seems to suggest that sexual dysfunction is one of the side effects of capitalism. I prefer, however, that the film be the best example of what Sirk could do with kitsch material. The color palette is particularly impressive. Acting in the film is great too. Rock Hudson and Lauren Bacall are terribly effective and give the film an aura of elegance, but the film belongs to Robert Stacek and Dorothy Malone (she deservedly won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress) who manage to keep the film at boiling point. Kudos to the pulsating score of Frank Skinner, ingenious camera Russel Metta (every single shot is a masterpiece in itself) and a production design department. Also, the title track is a beauty. It's an unforgettable movie.
