Generally, I agree with Ebert's opinion. In a sense, I feel that I should not even comment, because it is a movie for the veterinarian and I am not a vet (I was a resister). The disadvantage is that Martha is poorly developed and does not work consistently. My guess is that Stephen Metcalfe is a veterinarian and he spent too little time planning his character.
