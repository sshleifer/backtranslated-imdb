A few years ago, a friend received a movie from Michael Mann "Heat" from one of his friends. After the film was over and we were about to get up, we saw that there was another film right after it, hard on the envelope of the tape, which the owner did not write. However, we were all attached to our places by a clear opening that lacked credit. <br /> <br /> About two hours later I was sitting, wondering: how could I not hear about this masterpiece? . <br /> <br /> This film was Europe. Lars von Trier woke up the movie noir from dead, deconstructed reality with deliberately obvious sets, but it was often haunting resemblance to the post-war German photographs I saw. And then the tricky cuts! <br /> <br /> The story itself is a difficult moral odyssey that does not have a happy ending. A young American pacifist of German descent arrives in post-war Germany, wanting to do something good to pay for the bombs that his countrymen have shed. But above all, it meets with distrust and self-destructive opposition. He is employed in Zentropa, a company dealing in dining and sleeping cars (modeled on Mitropie), owned by one of the Nazi collaborators whitewashing the occupiers. Our hero falls in love with his daughter - who later turns out to be a member of Werewolf, Nazi post-war terrorists. When he no longer understands the world (or only the Europeans), in his anger he drops the railway bridge under the train he has just saved. <br /> <br /> As the last note, for historical correctness: into the real world, Werewolf was nowhere as important as the film suggests, it was mostly the final Nazi propaganda revolution. After the SS unit murdered the Allied Major occupied Aachen, two months before the capitulation, the Nazis announced the creation of entire legions of saboteurs and terrorists who would be ready to fight behind the lines, the Werewolf. But only a few hundred Hitlerjugend√≥w were trained, and although two or three times some were deployed in order to murder suspected communists or foreigners forced laborers in Bavarian villages to squeeze lasting fear on the inhabitants, along with Hitler's death and the end of the war it all fell apart. <br /> <br /> However, Werewolf's propaganda had a profound influence on the occupiers. They were afraid of Werewolf everywhere, they suspected that he was behind every serious accident - but without exception, another cause was found (ignored by some recent pseudo-historians). For example, when the gas main exploded at the police headquarters of bombed Bremen, or when the Soviet military commander died in a motorcycle accident in Berlin. The result was the strongest in the Soviets, who arrested tens of thousands (mostly children!) "Preventively" on the charge of being a werewolf and locked them in prisoner-of-war camps, where many of them were killed.
