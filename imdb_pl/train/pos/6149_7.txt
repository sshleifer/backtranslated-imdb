I just bought a restored version of the movie, which I remember with great liking since childhood and certainly was created for an interesting afternoon. Bedknobs definitely have more sense in their full form, deleted scenes (especially those from McDowall) combine events quite neatly. A little worrying is the way the scenes have been remastered. Apparently the soundtrack for this material was lost or damaged, so some bright spark of Disney decided to dub the scene with a new dialogue. It would be great, except that half of the cast was not around to do it (some for better reasons than others), and the whole thing is rather cheesy. Some of the lip sync are quite weak, and David Tomlinson's voice was named by a guy who sounds quite like David Tomlinson (I think he's a bit German). However, it is good to hear the full versions of all the songs (although "Step in the right Direction" is still absent), and the moments of magic in this movie are still shining. And I challenge you not to giggle when young Paul looks so innocently at Angela Lansbury and coo, "but what does this have to do with my knob?"
