Winchester '73 is a great story and that's what I like. This is not your everyday western - it uses a rifle that passes hands from different characters - as a mechanism for telling stories about these people. Rock Hudson plays the Indian chief, Jimmy Stewart plays a great man with heart and strength, and Shelly Winters plays a gala that has to deal with the realities of her husband and the savage west. It is important to remember these politically correct types - they kill many Indians in this film without remorse. By today's standards, it is still quite violent. But it's a great story and worth seeing. Enjoy!
