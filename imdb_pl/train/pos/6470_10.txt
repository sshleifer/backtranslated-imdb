This is one of the world's best short films "Our Gang". Spanky is the sweetest and the funniest, and the children who get to look after the children are also fun. Tiny Spanky is forced by the gang to watch all her little siblings. Opening them all in strollers, torn by various things hung by a gang of fishing poles, is a beautiful gag. <br /> <br /> Spanky's look in his big toy knife when he asked for care for his older colleagues is priceless, as is his reply - "Hey, where do you get these things - I do not care for any kids!" This tiny dude says "extraordinary" throughout the film, all the beautiful gags and Spanky telling the children "everything about Tarzan" are adding up to make this one of the best "Our Gang" you will ever see.
