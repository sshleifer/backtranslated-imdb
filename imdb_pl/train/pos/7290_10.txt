After a few very good reviews to the SUPERB point, I was very happy with the film. The film was dark, moving, anger, pain, guilt and a very convincing demon. <br /> <br /> At first I expected to see many special effects and like a lover's caress, it dispelled me with subtlety and rightness of it. Brian, I am delighted with your art again, telling the story and concern for special effects. You will come a long way, my friend. I will definitely be the chairman of your fan club. <br /> <br /> Eric Etebari, the best actor, was the number one choice. You made Jr. Lopez looked like a child compared to Kasadyi. :) <br /> <br /> In general, the plot, filming high quality and amazing effects, was fantastic. I just wish it was longer. I am looking forward to The Dreamless with extremely high expectations.
