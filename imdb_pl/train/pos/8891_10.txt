I agree with other comments that there was not a lot of history in the film, but it was not a document! It was supposed to be fun and I think it did a very good job. <br /> <br /> I agree with a black family. The scenes with them seemed out of place. As if this would suddenly appear, but later I got to know the story and the relationship between the families and found it quite good. <br /> <br /> Although it was not a repetition of the 1960s, they brought very large and important breakthroughs to the light of day. I think it is very fun and worth my attention.
