The Road Rovers is a great show about dog superheroes chosen by Master to fight crime worldwide. The show was at least funny. Simple and complex jokes that can appeal to all people of all ages. Running jokes in the entire series that can trigger a drinking game. The action was hypnotizing and cleverly configured. The characters were very original, and each of them had a completely different personality. But what made me have a good time is the depth of the character. Each of them has struggles and emotional difficulties that are never expressed, but suggested in the sub-text. Hopefully one day there will be some way to see Rovers again in action.
