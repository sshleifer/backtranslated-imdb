I thought it was an amazingly clever movie. I was very pleased with it and I could not really "ask for more". Actually, I'm the owner of the movie because I did not return it to someone ... What should I do, but I really want to keep it because of how much I liked it. Also the fact that I do not have too many foreign films and this is the first. Now I personally love Finnish things, so I definitely added how much I liked it. But generally it is worth to watch. However, if you are not completely trying to understand Finnish or read some subtitles, this movie is not for you. <br /> <br /> 9/10 for sure.
