In the book from the Citadel Gene series, Kelly Anchors Aweigh is called a musical bolt. I certainly can not do it better. This is a very important film both in the career of Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra. Kathryn Grayson did not do it too bad either. <br /> <br /> Louis B. Mayer lent Gene Kelly to Columbia, where Harry Cohn had the inspiration for Kelly to develop the choreography of his own numbers and that's why the Girl cover became a classic. So if Mayer did not learn the lesson, producer Joe Pasternak did and allowed Kelly to be artistic. After completing Anchors Aweigh, Fred Astaire finally had a dancing rival to the monarch of cinema dance. <br /> <br /> The main number that everyone talks with Gene Kelly is a dance with Jerry Mouse. Originally, Kelly wanted to do the Mickey Mouse Disney number, but Disney did not lend Mickey anyone. Mickey would have to wait until Who framed Roger Rabbit to make a movie outside. Do not worry, because MGM has its own animated rodent, in the middle the team of Tom and Jerry. <br /> <br /> Kelly has always tried to do something new and different on the screen, like Fred Astaire. Over the next several years, these two people were provided with all artistic control and were praised for their work, even if the films themselves were not enough. It was as if everyone inspired others for greater and better creativity, Kelly for MGM, Astaire for MGM, and any number of other studies. In Anchors Aweigh, Kelly shot Sinatra to dance a little. In fact, Frank Sinatra always acknowledged Gene Kelly for showing him how to do musicals, because he gave credit to both Burt Lancaster and Montgomery Clift for helping him earn an Oscar for Hence to Eternity. <br /> <br /> When Frank Sinatra had half of his contract bought from MGM by RMP, he insisted on a little artistic creativity on his own. He made friends with the band writing songs Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn. In his autobiography Sammy Cahn talks about how Sinatra insisted that they write their songs for this film. Louis B. Mayer gave up and the band wrote some really great ballads for singing. One of my favorite Sinatra numbers comes from Anchors Aweigh, I fall into love easily. Frank sings him accompanying himself on the piano in an empty Hollywood Bowl. This is Sinatra at its best. <br /> <br /> With Jule Styne, and later with Jimmy Van Heusen, Sammy Cahn deserves to be called more lyrics in Frank Sinatra's mouth than any other person. They were friends for life, and Cahn always recognized Sinatra as a breakthrough step in his career. <br /> <br /> In a way, Styne and Cahn said they could write a song using a chromatic scale. They proved it in Anchors Aweigh, when Kathryn Grayson put a soprano in the work on All of a Sudden My Heart Sings. She also made several classic numbers. <br /> <br /> Here, singing is the basis of the plot. The two sailors on leave combine with Kathryn Grayson and her orphaned nephew Dean Stockwell. Trying to fix it with Sinatra, Kelly says he can get an interrogation with Jose Iturbi. They spend a movie trying to achieve it. <br /> <br /> My only disappointment at Anchors Aweigh was that Pamela Britton, who plays the "Brooklyn" waitress, never got a number. She received delightful reviews from the show as Meg Brockie in Brigadoon on Broadway and that's what brought her to Hollywood. I suspect that she had a number that was cut out, and somewhere in MGM's vaults it could still be. <br /> <br /> Anchors Aweigh is a great example of why musicals are simply not created anymore. All this creative talent was contracted with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. If the market value had to be paid for it, the cost could lead to withdrawal from the debt of the third world. <br /> <br /> But the film's results would be extraordinary.
