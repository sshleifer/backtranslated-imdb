Very good, except for the ending, which was a huge disappointment. <br /> <br /> The script was very good, as well as acting. The visualizations were often very grainy, but in a sense they were adding to the film because the snow elements were in good places that helped create a mood in relation to the film. This influence has been ruined by an extremely unbelievable ending. <br /> <br /> I was going to give this movie 8 out of 10, but the end came off 7 points because it seemed to have gone away radically from the first 75 minutes of the movie and it seemed quite forced to make the creators look clever. <br /> <br /> However, this movie was much better than films with much larger budgets and seemed to be filmed like a home movie with additional equipment. Few of the special effects, as it happens, but because of the tension was very good.
