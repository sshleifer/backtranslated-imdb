My observations: post-war mirth. Tom Drake and grandfather from "Meet Me in St. Louis "two years later (the year in which I was born). Donna Reed adorable and pretty. Margaret Hamilton, as always; smaller part than in "The Sorcerer of Oz". Spring Byington is prettier, also with a demanding spry little nose that Hamilton does not have. The tent scene at the end with the ex-boy next door was fun. As a two-year veteran of army tents, he looked quite young and inexperienced when I looked into his eyes. <br /> <br /> I used to work in a department store and it was as elegant as this one. Unfortunately, he disappeared and disappeared into oblivion. We knew each other from these great exhibition windows that were used to lure passers-by to the store to get them to buy all of these great goods. <br /> <br /> 10/10
