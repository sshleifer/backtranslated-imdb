I thought Baseketball was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen! It was witty humor that made me giggle all the time, and the fact that Trey and Matt are so well-known is the film's comedy. <br /> <br /> I just bought Baseketball on DVD and this is just one of those movies where you'll never be tired of watching it. I have a very short focus time and I think that this movie has so many funny pieces that it gives me entertainment. Humorous quotes are unforgettable and can make me laugh for hours if I remember them later. <br /> <br /> In general, I think that Baseketball is a great movie that everyone should see, especially if you're younger because it will make you laugh for a long time. <br /> <br /> P.s Does anyone find it strange that I like them both? hehe
