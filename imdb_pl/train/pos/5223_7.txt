It seems that this movie was not able to satisfy many people. First of all, few people saw it in the first place (I accidentally happened to it), and then, when evaluating opinions and evaluation, those who did not enjoy much of them. <br /> <br /> Well, I did. I usually tolerate Gere for his looks and charm, and although I did not consider him a great actor, I know he can be pretty crazy (I liked his Mr. Jones). But this performance is different. It is not pretty in this and is not charming. His character is completely different from what I have seen so far from him - old, ugly, broken, determined. And Gere, which is to me his best performance so far, draws it beautifully. I think this is a sign of how well an actor is doing his job, if you can not imagine anyone else doing it - consider Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter or Washington for Alonzo on the Training Day. This is how good Gere was here. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast was also fine. It seems to me that I would not fill the Danes in this role, mainly because I think she is too pretty for her. But he's really doing a great job, keeping Gere in top form, which is not a small feat. Strickland easily provides the best supporting act, in a part that requires a significant range from it. I think she is the owner of the key scene with Gere and Danes, and this is quite an achievement. <br /> <br /> So what about the rest of the movie, in addition to excellent acting? This story may not be too surprising, although it has about 8mm aspects, but adding the story of "veterans in the debut" to who has dunnita, and (like Silence of the Lambs) adding a sense of urgency through the attempt to save the girl and impending retirement Gere characters. All this is a background for the development of the two main heroes, because they help each other in achieving new positions in life. That's a lot to do in 100 minutes, but it's well done and we end up taking care of the characters and what's happening to them. <br /> <br /> Direction and photography were right. I could do without modern camera and cut movements, but then I'm an old curmudger and it really was not that bad, in fact I think it helped in the atmosphere of the movie, which you guessed might not be happy in general. <br /> <br /> Worth to see.
