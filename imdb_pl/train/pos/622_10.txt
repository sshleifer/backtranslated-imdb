Although I do not consider myself a great fan of fairytale movies, Star Dust intrigued me when I saw Michelle Pfeiffer in trailers as a villain (especially since I was going to see her as an overbearing Velma Von Tussle in hairspraying). Boy, is she so convincingly evil here as a witch, especially with her ugly make-up at the beginning and the end! Robert De Niro is also great as a pirate captain who is forced to hide in the closet to protect his reputation! Almost all actors like Claire Danes, Rupert Everett, Ricky Gervais, Peter O'Toole and many others have a great time working here. While the Danes and Pfeiffer are classic beauties, there are also the stunning faces of Sienna Miller, Olivia Grant (as a girl Bernard) and Kate Magowan, especially when we meet her for the first time. Novice Charlie Cox is good at leading Tristan and he looked just like his father Dunstan as a young man who I thought he was in the early stages with Magowan (actually Ben Barnes). Many of the comments compared this with the Princess Bride, and although I see some similarities, the main difference was that with PB you always knew that it was just an imaginary story told by an old man to his grandson. Stardust makes you believe most of what you see and hear can happen even with all the hilarity that happens throughout the text. Therefore, I strongly recommended Star Dust.
