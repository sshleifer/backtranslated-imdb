The truly moving story of the recruitment camp in America, where young men are prepared for the Vietnam War. Human research has always appealed to me in war films, because they explain personal, subjective opinions about war, opposing war-action films in which actions and technical data are analyzed in violation of the human factor. <br /> <br /> Film manages to introduce a new rotation of the already ancient theme and distance himself from the usual war movies, especially by focusing on the antihero from the point of view of the traditional standard. The film focuses on the tragic character of Bozz, who wisely avoids being dragged into an inhuman war machine and refuses to give up control over his destiny and fights for something he does not believe spends energy in searching for ways to avoid being sent abroad, both for himself and for his companions and ironically end up finding a legitimate reason for him to finally go to war. Perfect irony. <br /> <br /> Acting is really special, and documentary filming makes you feel like you've moved into a movie. Also, the film will be a source of reflection for those who are delighted with the action in ordinary war films or war game enthusiasts, hopefully they will wake up some of the minds of the generation that happily avoided fear of sketching.
