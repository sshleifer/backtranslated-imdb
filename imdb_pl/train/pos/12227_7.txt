I was looking for it after seeing the fun and language-demanding "Clueless" (1995), perhaps the most-known effort of Alicia Silverstone since the beginning of her film career. "Real crime" has Kevin Dillon, who should help in improving most film projects. In fact, everyone in the cast is doing a good job. The only disappointment, which I think is a film for me, is the awkward "feeling" of some of the scenes, resulting from the need to run a fairly uncompromising, adult subject as part of what begins to sound like an adventure for a student. /> <br /> Alicia Silverstone is pretty good at it. She tolerates the na√Øve enthusiasm and growing anxiety that Mary Giordano has when she maneuvers in the direction of the truth behind the serial murders. I think that its MG characteristics are also there. The conclusion from the story is that it goes into a career in law enforcement. It can be very interesting for the older Silverstone to visit Giordano again during the crisis later in the life of the officer. Just a thought! <br /> <br /> "A real crime" shows the director in a good light. Pat Verducci also has a loan in writing. I do not know any other film work done by PV. I can only wonder what happened after such a promising beginning. <br /> <br /> Like most productions, this one has a largely unknown cast, though Bill Nunn (detective Jerry Guinn) is not like that. Over the past decade, he has been able to provide an impressive number of appearances on the screen. I remember seeing him recently in Carriers (1998), a military TV show. Bill Nunn played "Captain Arends". Fans of the classic American comedy series "Who's the Boss" may also be interested in "Carriers", because the leading player is Judith Light, which many remember with love due to her long commitment to the show. <br /> <br /> A "real crime" could easily work, but it's OK. I think it is a funny story worth seeing.
