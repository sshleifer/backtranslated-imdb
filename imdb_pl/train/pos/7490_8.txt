I have never seen this movie until today. His film was shot on the scenes of Old Dark House and Frankenstein and concerns a small Bavarian village in which supposedly gigantic bats suck the blood of the villagers. <br /> <br /> To be honest, it's a damn good movie that has an atmosphere to lose and a cast that will not go away, Lionel Atwill, Dwight Frye, Faye Wray and Melvin Douglas playing a character named Brettschnieder who interests me because it's it was the maiden name of my great-grandmother. <br /> <br /> This is a carefully modulated movie that has tense and witty liners that slowly build up for a short time, just astray when they realized about their limited time for everything about ten minutes before the end. From this point onwards, it runs straight to the end with a very small amount of fun that preceded it. <br /> <br /> Leonard Maltin and IMDb exchange the duration of 71 minutes and warn against shorter prints. The problem is that IMDb and Maltin can be wrong, and in this case I think they are, because the source I trust more in, says that the full duration is 67 minutes (The Overlook Film Encyclopedia). usually about 60-63 minutes are available, and the amount of missing material is much smaller if it only has 67 minutes. Personally, I think that it will not matter, because it is at most five minutes and I very much doubt whether it will or will break the movie. <br /> <br /> What's the time, if you like creaking old movies, do it, watch this movie, its a great dark and stormy night movie.
