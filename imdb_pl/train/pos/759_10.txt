For many people Beat Street inspired their lifestyle to something creative in hip hop culture. <br /> <br /> Young Lee lives in New York in the '80s, when hip-hop was in the beginning. His crew member "Beat Street" - a b-boy crew. The film follows Lee on his average day, dance, graffiti, etc. <br /> <br /> The director managed to make a film with a story and at the same time present hip hop to the rest of the world. The film has old school functions, such as: Afrika Bambaataa and Soul Sonic Force, Grandmaster Melle Mel & the Furious Five, Rock Steady Crew, New York City Breakers and many others .... <br /> <br /> <br /> Neither Beat Street nor the Beat Street spirit will ever die.
