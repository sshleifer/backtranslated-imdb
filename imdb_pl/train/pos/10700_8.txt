It is undoubtedly a comedy based on national stereotypes. If you go away from pretending that you know whether you care about what communism was and how real are the Russians or the British, if you accept the convention and do not get hurt, you can have fun with the movie. Nicole Kidman is at its best, sexy, moving and fun. Ben Chaplin manages to avoid total shock by Nicole, and the rest of the cast does a good job. The finale is moving, and logic - film logic, of course. It's worth to watch if you accept the rules of the game.
