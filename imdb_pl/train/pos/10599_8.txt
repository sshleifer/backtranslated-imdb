SPOILERS Many different comedy series have at some point experimented with vague independence. In the early episode of the "Family Guy" cartoon, the Griffin family found their home as an independent nation in the United States of America, and history is evolving there. However, in 1949, Ealing Studios produced a great little film according to the same idea. <br /> <br /> After the children's trick, the inhabitants of Pimlico discover a small fortune in the treasure. During the investigation, it becomes clear that the small area is a small installment of the long-lost state of Burgundy. By resigning from London and the rest of the UK, residents of a small street experience the joys and problems associated with being an independent state. <br /> <br /> Based on the time when the rationale was still working, this story is genially told and equally inspiring. The film, starring Stanley Holloway, Betty Warren, Philip Stainton and young Charles Hawtrey, is well stocked with the best actors of his generation. These actors are also well supported by a wonderful little script with several lines of breaking. Feeling exceptionally fresh, despite being over 50 years old, history never seems awkward and always provides entertainment to the public. <br /> <br /> Ealing Studios was one of the best British movie exporters that ever existed. Thanks to films such as "Passport to Pimlico" it is not difficult to understand why. A funny story from the beginning to the end is always fun and always worth seeing.
