First, quick "shut up!" To those who say that this movie stinks. You can not go to any movie waiting for Citizen Kane. It was a really funny movie. Jason Lee is good at everything he does. The only disadvantage of this movie is that I do not think there is enough chemistry between Lee and Julia Stiles. They should have been more concerned with this. Besides, the movie is fun. Selma Blair needs to eat something. She worries me. But she still looks beautiful. So yes, I recommend this movie for a date or light afternoon fun. Go see. <br /> <br /> EVALUATION: ** 1/2 of ****
