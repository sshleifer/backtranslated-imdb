"Welcome to Collingwood" offers some of the most fun dialogues in the last memory. Watching this comedy directed by brothers Anthony and Joe Russo reminded us of another film we saw in the past, but because we missed the initial movies, we had to wait until the end to discover that we remembered 1958 Italian movie "Big Deal on Madonna Street "directed by Mario Monicelli. <br /> <br /> The Russo brothers have created a great cast to present all the characters in the movie. Everything with William H. Macy, Luis Guzman, Sam Rockwell, Patricia Clarkson, the late Michael Jeter, can not be bad. Because it is a team song, all characters have the opportunity to shine. <br /> <br /> The movie introduces us to a group of sloppy, would-be safe crackers from hell. No one could think that these people could do the work they do. Whatever can go wrong, and more, that's what they do. George Clooney makes a small impression as a champion of a safe cracker, which is also seen as counterfeiting of rabbis, but confused with a priest by gang members leaving Cossimo's funeral. <br /> <br /> The best way to enjoy the movie is to sit back and relax, and let all those little crooks on time. Let their funny lines make you laugh, how everyone can see that this gang is doomed from beginning to end!
