Oh, the sixties. There were some interesting movies. I was then a filmmaker. Now I like to rent movies and relax at home, not to go to the theater. I also saw this short movie "The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle". I've been looking for this movie for years. It was really inspiring. Interestingly, I finally managed to collect more information from your site. Thank you ........ I am surprised that this short film was an introduction to the Disney picture. I also did not remember the Disney movie. I did not even remember that it was an opening movie for Disney. I really want them to show it on TV someday. I wonder if Disey has rights to this film? Is it available on DVD? This is a must see for all generations !!!
