I gave this film 10 because it had to be rewarded for its scary elements and actors AND for my god to get involved! The point is, I do not want to tell anyone about acting or history because it will ruin the movie. But I recommend that you immediately go to the nearest store and rent it! (Do not forget popcorn!)
