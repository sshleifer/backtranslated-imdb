Fantastic movie. One excites all five senses. It is not a real historical report and not all information should be treated as factual information. True Hollywood conventions have been used, such as playing the A letter and VERY attractive actors such as "heroes" such as Naomi Watts (Julia Cook - Ned Kelly's lover), Heath Ledger (Ned) and Orlando Bloom (Joe Byrne - right Ned's hand), and unattractive (sorry, Geoffrey Rush), actors are playing drunken and corrupt Victorian police forces. In this way, Ned (Ledger) and Julia Cook (Watts) introduce a very incredible love story to lure all romantics and women are particularly susceptible. Even from the first scene, when Ned saves a fat young man from drowning, and his father calls him "sun" and had "a glint in his eye when he looked at me, with his hand on my shoulder", it is very romantic and convinces viewers are after Ned Kelly's side, weaker. Besides, not all Australians love the weaker?
