I'm still wondering why I watched this movie. I must admit that before I watched this movie, I knew practically nothing about beatles. I did not even know all their names! I only knew that they had a lot of fans, they had a few albums that some say they are the best in history, they fell apart, John married Yoko Ono, and John was murdered. <br /> <br /> VH1 is not even my favorite music station, MTV is. Nevertheless, for some reason I decided to watch it without expecting too much. Interestingly, I loved it! Dialogue was written and very well done on the occasion of a slight mess of accent. This is very important because John and Paul actually talk throughout the movie, even though they are taken outside to explore more possibilities and observe. Jared Harris and Adien Quinn generally give good results. <br /> <br /> The ending was also very clever. I liked how the movie excites you with the SNL performance, and then hits you in the head and makes you realize that it would be better if they just let him go and end it with a good note. My favorite moment is probably touching the roof stage. <br /> <br /> I generally recommend this film to almost everyone. This is a very good way to satisfy your curiosity about what would happen if Paul appeared on the doorstep of John six years after the breakup. This is probably the main reason why I watch this movie, satisfying my curiosity about who the beatles really are and what could have happened to them after the breakup.
