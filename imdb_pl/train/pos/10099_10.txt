Anime that caught me in anime ... <br /> <br /> Set in 2010 (hey, it's not too far anymore!) Earth is now a waste of poisoned gases and pollution. Seeing that crimes happen within 30 seconds, thieves who have the firepower of third world terrorists are so involved and the government of the fictional New Port City creates a Tank Police that deals with this problem - cops with tanks! For madness! <br /> <br /> The "heroes" of this series are: new recruit Leon Ozaki, red-haired Japanese (yes, I know, they never match their clearly Japanese names with Japanese appearance), which has just been incorporated into the tank police and quickly he started working with blond, nice guy with blue eyes Al. Leon is new in using tanks and unfortunately he is destroying his favorite tank of the police chief of Charles Britain (also known as "Brenten"), a big guy who looks like Tom Selleck on steroids and has nice sunglasses, a big revolver and a bad mood. Great Britain did not like it when Leona joined the tank police, and breaking up his special tiger (giant green monster tank) does not make him want it, nor does he like to take away the remains of his giant tank and use it to build a mini tank that he calls Bonaparte, and he soon pushes for her to take care of the children "where the boys are bigger," as he put it. There is also Specs, a bifocal genius, Bible quotation / God fearing the Chaplain, a purple Mohican MO and a pot bowed. A boss who is on the edge thanks to the mayor who always yells at him about the antics of the Tank Police. Seeing how tank cops often destroy half the city, pursuing bad guys and using extreme violence to capture them, people are not very well liked by people. <br /> <br /> "Black characters" is a cyborg called Buaku, which has a mysterious past related to the project known as "Green Peace", his gang and his two sexy cats, cyborg assistants Anna and Uni Puma. In the first installment, the guys are paid for stealing urine samples from a hospital that heals people who have not been infected with clouds of poison gas, and in the second they are employed to steal the image of a naked Buak. This story, however, was not finished in the anime and was completed in the iconic comic book ("Manga"), which is very difficult to find. <br /> <br /> In this black comics venture, all kinds of chaos and chaos are created, explores how far people want their police to go to catch criminals and what happens when the thin border between good and bad people begins to blur. . This is the kind of thing that, if you were to make a movie, go to Quentin Tarantino better. Uneven in places, but still a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> "New Dominion: Tank Police" follows.
