Considering how much these movies are, you have to guess that they had to have fun creating them. The film focuses on a home that strangely accepts everyone who lives there. Residents were: the author Charles Hillyer (Denholm Elliott (with hair!)), Which is haunted by one of his own creations; Philip Grayson (Peter Cushing), who is too close to the wax statue; John Reid (Christopher Lee), whose virtue is the most exquisite fa√ßade; and actor Paul Henderson (Jon Pertwee), on the verge of overly characterizing. <br /> <br /> "The House That Dripped Blood" is really worth seeing (well, it means Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee). In addition to being neat, there may be some subtexts: this may undermine the issue of real horror compared to the assumed horror. As in "The Shining", we can ask if the house / hotel itself has any memories of past events. And if absolutely nothing else, Ingrid Pitt (as Paula's star) is HOT HOT! Around this time, she performed in "Countess Dracula" and "The Vampire Lovers" (also with Peter Cushing). Maybe she - just like Barbara Steele - will remain known only as the queen of screams, but mark my words: SHE IS A HOT QUEEN OF QUEEN! I would like to see Ingrid Pitt and Barbara Steele in cooperation. <br /> <br /> I think the only strange scene (so to speak) is Denholm Elliott in a pink shirt and a fluffy jacket. You read it well. What is the name "Denholm"? Well. Very nice movie.
