Carmen is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's hard to say which performance is the best: Antonio Gades, Cristina Hoyos and Laura del Sol are wonderful. They dance their souls. It is a beautiful story about the unbreakability of life and myth; the myth permeates everyday life. Dance becomes life and all life is danced. Real people and at the same time live their own lives and become someone else, play the role of old lovers. Magic continues.
