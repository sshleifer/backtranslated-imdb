I have to vote for 10 out of 10 in the rare situation in which I see this review, I pity over me, take me to Hollywood and engage in her bizarre / funny world. But it was good in all seriousness. The first episode apparently finds its feet, but it has the bizarre Silverman running all the way. This is not the laughter of a loud comedy, but it's good, there's too much laughter for it, and it would not be right with signals, when you laugh, it's up to the audience to hear the laughter of the inner jester absurd of it all. I can easily see that it is a bizarre Drew Carey show with strange characters and an incredibly strong character in the center. It's worth watching, we're waiting for the next episodes. A VERY good chance for a simple comedy. <br /> <br /> ps, Sarah? Call us ....
