I saw this movie for the first time around 1990 and died completely of laughter. He became a favorite favorite in my group of friends and we quoted him in an instant ("I'm going home in my bag!"). Needless to say, humor still exists, 15 years later. It has become a tradition during Halloween to put many of my new friends on this film (it's good that you can still buy it on Ebay!). I discovered that Halloween sweets taste much better when your tongue is firmly embedded in the cheek ... and this movie is all - pathos, tension, unrequited love, nobility and the list is long. Royal Dano provides an amazing cordial performance as Old Man Wrenchmuller. I remember seeing him in "The 7 Faces of Dr. Lao "as a bad guy who met with a bad end. Here you really feel for the old guy from the very beginning. <br /> <br /> If you're not careful, you'll miss some of the levels of humor in this movie. The creators got very subtle in many respects from unwanted comments, small subtle costumes are excavated in other science-fiction movies, and even a scene taken from the pages of Wile E. Coyote! <br /> <br /> Do not spend a lot of thought processes trying to analyze the movie, people - it's a nice tariff without jerking and should not be offensive to anyone (well, maybe stupid people, but they will not know that they are ridiculed. .). <br /> <br /> - Now if you'll excuse me, I'll go for the bar "Zag-nut" .... <br /> <br /> -Ramsay "RC" Cowlishaw, karaoke DJ / artist
