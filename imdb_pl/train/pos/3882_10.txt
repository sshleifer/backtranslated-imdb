I watched the tape, I immediately rewound it, I looked again and laughed twice. I highly recommend this tape to those who are not hateful but uncomfortable with transvestites. It shows that transvestism is a feature, not the whole of existence. Comedy is not one problem. This man is brilliant. All comics should strive for its level of sincerity, intelligence and talent.
