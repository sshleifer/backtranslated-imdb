This vehicle from dolph lundgren is a fun action movie that will not win any prizes and is not too original, but delivers the goods you would like to see in the movie with the dolphins. our dolph man is a former soldier who is now a teacher in a hard high school in the city center, and when he is taken over by terrorists, his job is to save the day. make sure that the script does not win any Oscars, which is good fun and that it has a fair eplosive action. dolph lundgren gives a good enough performance, but it comes alive more in the action scenes, and the rest of the cast is not the best actors, but it keeps it well. In total, detention is a nice action, but you have seen it a million times.
