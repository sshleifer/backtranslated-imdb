This is my first CG animated movie I've ever seen. Usually, the appearance of other animated films meant that I did not want to watch them. No ice age. I wanted to see it the moment I saw the trailer with Scrat, the funny sabertooth squirrel. <br /> <br /> Ice age was sporadically fun and to watch was a funny movie. The story is basically an animated version of Three Men and a Child, set 20,000 years ago. The graphics were great. Simply beautiful. One thing is to create a convincing aninmation, it's a completely different thing to create visually stunning things and the Ice Age is great to watch with its stylized visuals. Blue Sky Studios is a company that needs attention in the future.
