Poor scripts sometimes? Yes! Cheaper special effects sometimes? Yes! An excellent pleasure of guilt most of the time? Yes! More about Carl Kolchak and Darren McGavin? Yes! I've always liked science fiction as a child, but I found so many things from Dracula / Frankenstein / Mummy / horror, just so much nonsense. Abbott and Costello needed a new look at the classic universal monsters, and Carl Kolchak needed me to get the "dark side" of entertainment. Duke had Rooster Cogburn, Eastwood had Dirty Harry, Garner had Maverick and Rockford, Selleck had Magnum, and Darren McGavin had Carl Kolchak. In combination with all these weak scenarios, tacky special effects, this baroque group of supporting characters and actors, and hospitable stars was Darren McGavin as Carl Kolchak. Despite the danger he had a sharp sense of humor, he was an idealist in pursuing truth and a realist when it comes to accepting compulsory incompetence and possible cover-up by government officials. Additionally, in contrast to 98% of us, Kolczak was willing to push his neck and do what was to be done, even if it meant his fall, the end of his journalistic career or the time of imprisonment. Because of all his faults, including the lack of taste in clothes, Carl Kolchak was a man of grace and wit who rode a beautiful, classic yellow mustang (which was then an old used car) to save the day for humanity. As good as any other fictional character, Carl Kolchak was an everyman hero who was brought to life every week for one season thanks to Darren McGavin. Now that he's gone and his program is on DVD, I hope he will have a great time watching how he was playing again at Kolchak The Night Stalker!
