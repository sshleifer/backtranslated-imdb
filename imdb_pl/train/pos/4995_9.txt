I do not think most of us tend to use the term "must-see" in action movies, but I was impressed by how good the film is and deservedly receive "must-see" from me. <Mando> Mandy played by Shannon Lee (daughter of the dead and wonderful Bruce Lee and sister of the late Brandon Lee) is recruited by Martin, a professional thief who is to help make a diamond jump in a museum for a criminal syndicate and Well rewarded for it. Little is known that another pair of thieves (Lucy and Tommy, a pair of lovebirds) who have been repelled by Mandy and Martin to take part in the transaction, are also planning to steal a diamond. <br /> <br /> Like every pair of thieves, planning a robbery is a thrill. Everything goes wrong because Martin and Mandy are unknowingly behind Lucy and Tommy. <br /> <br /> You will find that thieves support you because they discover that they need each other to survive from the criminal syndicate, who are not satisfied that the diamond is not in his hands. <br /> <br /> Fans of action will not be disappointed, because there is a healthy dose of battles, martial arts and melee sequences. <br /> <br /> What is surprising is not only the action that carries this movie, but romance and laughter (and I do not mean your typical one-line action movies) that przemikajÄ… w. <br /> <br / > It's not easy to eradicate the bad guys, but we see the human side of these thieves and the chemistry they are developing. <br /> <br /> A great movie and one NOT to miss! <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
