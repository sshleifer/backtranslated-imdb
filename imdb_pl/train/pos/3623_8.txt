Disney can just do something here. First, they had "Remember the Titans" with Denzel, a story based on the truth about sport and a small town in Central America. Now with Quaid and The Rookie ... one more sporting story based on truth. <br /> <br /> Both films sometimes move you to tears and make you smile and feel warm after watching them. My wife and I took part in The Rookie and we expected it to be a great movie with a good mood. We were not disappointed when we were asked if we would buy it on DVD when it appears, it was obvious. For sure.
