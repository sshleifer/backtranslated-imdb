I really enjoyed the movie, but I did not realize that Little Richard had so many things in his life. First of all, I did not know about Lucille. There are very few (almost no) mentions about women associated with Little Richard. Even in his life today there is no mention of any involvement of women in a romantic way. I wonder why this part of his life was not mentioned. Overall the movie was great. I also did not like Leon playing the role of Little Richard, he is a good actor, but I feel that some should have been given to another actor. Visually, he did not remind me of Little Richard. I was also completely unaware of the promiscuity that was part of Little Richard. He was introduced to the movie as addicted to sex. Nowadays he will be referred to counseling regarding his sexual addition. He was a voyeur. I do not want to spoil the movie to someone who has not seen the movie, but there were a few things about the movie that I think should not be part of the final cut.
