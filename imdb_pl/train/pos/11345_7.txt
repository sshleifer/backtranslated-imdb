That's why I still have nightmares. <br /> <br /> This horrifying movie (musical) was considered suitable for children in the 70s. <br /> <br /> The boy is going on a magical journey to the island. The mayor of the island, Pufnstuf, supposedly a dragon, looking more like a newt with conjunctivitis for me and a magic flute talking is the goal of the witch (Billie Halliday, who was then considered "okay"). <br /> <br /> The flute is recovered in the "interesting" convention of witches, and the witches have an old gay. The boy dresses in a drag, and then as a "fairy" to retrieve the flute. <br /> <br /> Not suitable for children.
