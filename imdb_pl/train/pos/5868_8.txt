I loved this movie. It's rare to take a look at the Vietnamese post-partum, and this movie - fighting scenes and exciting bombs and shootings - did it. I had no idea it would affect me that way. It's an amazing look at how strangers feel. Honestly, it was hard to watch. We all understand the fight and the kind of drama Apocalypse Now, but it is so different. What happens when they come back and try to live? Can not. It made me realize a large group of people who rattled in America. I can not relate, I can not sleep, I can not have affairs, I can not cope with "normal society." They feel completely different from each other. This is a huge tragedy that is not addressed enough. Yes, we have changed our approach to veterinarians from Vietnam, now we like them, but so what? It seems that it did not matter to them. It's too late? It was a great movie, but I cried a lot. I have no other comments.
