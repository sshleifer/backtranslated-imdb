Hidden Frontiers - something more than fiction fans - is a well-thought-out and organized series that keeps the world of Star Trek alive and growing. From a fun, small fan design to a well-known network series; Hidden Frontiers has something for every star lover. Set in the Late Star Trek: Next Generation / DS9 and Voyager time lines. Hidden Frontier addresses topics and issues raised in other Star Trek series with established stories using well-developed characters, storylines and storylines. Star Trek Hidden Frontier addressed the social context stories that Gene Roddenberry did not show on screen and showed the development of characters in long-term space assignments - real things that happen in the near neighborhood, as well as exciting spatial wars and conflicts -Fi addicts know and love. Done at the "Green Screen" studio; Hidden boundaries bring the cast regular players to the screen and to your hearts. A large cast of actors plays well together and with love gives their time and energy to the project. The innovative use of green screen technology, props, complements and costumes makes Star Trek's Hidden Frontier worlds fun and trustworthy. The Hidden Frontier went where few people walked through the science fiction world and flourished when they got there. Hidden Frontier offers a great bonus for a well thought out website, with interesting discussion forums, access to creative, production and acting employees, and a fun weekly chat. I highly recommend taking the time to load and watch.
