I really liked this adaptation of "Emma". I've seen her many times and I always look forward to seeing her again. Although it only lasts 107 minutes, most of the novels and storylines have been elaborated in a satisfactory manner. All characters are well presented. Most of the dialogues come directly from the novel, without any stupid jokes, like the Thoughtful and Sensitive Emma Thompson. <br /> <br /> As a foreigner, I especially appreciate the excellent diction of the actors. The setting and costumes were beautiful. I find this version quite similar to the 1995 "Pride and Prejudice" miniseries, but then the producer and screenwriter were the same. Kate Beckinsale did a really good job by introducing "Emma," about which Jane Austen said she would create a heroin that no one would want. She is snobbish, but she has enough youth and no experience to be still nice. Mark Strong was also very good at presenting Mr. Knightley, it is not an easy part, I think, although there is no charisma shown by Mr. Darcy Colin Firth in the Duma and prejudice. Even the final scene (harvest), which does not happen in the novel, is the right end, except when it shows that Emma is cold and almost unpleasant in relation to Frank Churchill, while in the novel she was completely reconciled to him, even saying he would enjoy duplicity if he was in his situation. Strange departure from faithfulness, differently shown throughout the film. The costumes are more beautiful and sophisticated for me than in other adaptations of the Jane Austen novel.
