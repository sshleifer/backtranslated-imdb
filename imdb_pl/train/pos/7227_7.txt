Peter O'Toole is a windfall that can be seen in roles in which the lines he talks about are good and give him a chance to fall into a drunken stupor. Charming Susannah York is a good foil for the dramatic presence of O'Toole. <br /> <br /> The film refers to incest - without one clear scene - but it is able to entertain the viewer with its loud commentary. Although it is not a significant film, it will be remembered for its entertainment performances. <br /> <br /> Even York, signing the papers at the end, is a feast to watch, emanating a tragedy in silence. A possible weakness is the relaxed direction of Thompson. But the movie is due to the actors and the script. <br /> <br /> I've seen the movie twice in 20 years - in both cases under the name "Brotherly Love." "Country dance" is quite a farce and unsuitable title of this film, wherever it was released.
