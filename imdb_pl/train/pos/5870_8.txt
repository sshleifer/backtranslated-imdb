JACKNIFE is a great adaptation of Stephen Metcalfe's game "Strange Snow" (screenplay was also written by Metcalfe), in a delicate way directed by David Hugh Jones, who researches too often the forgotten effect of fighting on veterans destroyed permanently by the hideous atrocities of war. Return to this film from 1989. It is particularly moving when we watch soldiers returning from the Iraq war and the strict treatment they receive in our veterans' hospitals. <br /> <br /> Three friends went to Vietnam War together and only two returned alive: the problem is that while both men suffered in battle, one David 'Highschool' Flannigan (Ed Harris) is so seriously damaged by post-traumatic stress disorder that "exists" in a drunken vacuum with his very simple Martha school teacher (Kathy Baker). When David worsens his buddy, Joseph 'Jacknife' Megessey (Robert De Niro) returns to town trying to help his friend. During the events, Jacknife initially offers Martha's help and finally the second date - Martha must be on the ferry - and at this prom drunk David completely disintegrates, destroying the relics at school and scaring townspeople and students. Jacknife makes Dave live in Vietnam for a moment when he lost his buddy and does so in a way that David can start climbing to recover. And for a long time suffering, Martha finds her needs in Jacknife. <br /> <br /> All three actors give amazingly good performances: Ed Harris offers one of his fully realized roles, while De Niro and Baker maintain the high standards set by their careers. More people should help revive this forgotten movie because it is a fragile reminder of the damage our wars bring to people who fight with them and to the families who receive them after the end of the battle. Highly recommended. Grady Harp
