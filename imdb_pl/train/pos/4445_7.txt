This early Sirian melodrama, filmed in black and white, is a smaller film, but shows the talent of the German director in strengthening the line of tired history into something resembling art. Set up in 1910, Barbara Stanwyck is a woman who has sinned by abandoning a small-town husband and her family to a lure on stage in Chicago. She never fulfilled her ambitions and returns to the city, which she left after a zealous letter from her daughter, informing her that she also liked the theater (that is, school production). After returning to his old city, he again meets with pettiness and is dealing with his hostile oldest daughter, a stunned (and boring) husband (Richard Carlson) and a former lover. The story is nothing new, but Sirk is distinguished by creating sensible compositions, each frame being carefully filmed, and Stanwyck as his main lady helps him immensely. It lasts 76 minutes, and it's good, because the material does not really have legs to go on.
