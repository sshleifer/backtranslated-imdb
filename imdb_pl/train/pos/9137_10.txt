It's the only movie I've seen Prince, but it does not matter. And I thought that he was great in singing the boy, if I was wrong. This is probably its best performance. The music is great. That's why he won the Oscar in 1984 for the best music for the movie (or something like that). Now he has an Oscar and Grammy. Although the curse bothers the film (make sure that there are no small children in the room). There is not much to say without disclosing the plot. You should really go out and get this movie, whose collection is not complete, unless you have the movie in it. What else could I say, except to go and get this movie now!
