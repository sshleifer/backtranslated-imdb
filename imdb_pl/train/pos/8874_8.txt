higher learning is a blow to the face for those of us who have been in the wardrobe for too long regardless of ethnicity. this is the topic that most of us would like to ignore, but we can not afford to make a real progressive change in the way it MUST be able to embrace and understand diversity. some criticize this film as hateful or stupid, but the fact is that ignorance reigns in the world, and several of them still help her to dominate our society. everyone involved in this movie did a good deed, showing what steps must be taken not to make movies like higher learning anymore. does it sound like a pipe dream, but we have to start somewhere and it helps.
