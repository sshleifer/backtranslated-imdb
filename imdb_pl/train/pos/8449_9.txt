At the end of the series I became a fan of the series "Homicide: Life on the Street", but soon became a fan. It was a demonstration of police officers, in contrast to any other: visually different in the use of handheld cameras, taking the viewer everywhere, with its multiethnic and mutational cast and their diverse and fascinating personalities, and that it embraced all good and evil Police Department, including corruption and clashes of personalities that grow to the surface. <br /> <br /> Homicide Department: the film, the continuation of the series, is as good as a film made for television. After Lieutenant Giardello (Yaphet Kotto), now a candidate for the mayor of Baltimore, he is shot dead, the cast members are back to help find the killer. In addition, the cast members who left the forces and those who died also have their place in the film. Intensity and fire, which marked the series, return, and the script burns with the same fire that marked the series. All in all a great TV movie. <br /> <br /> Voting: 9
