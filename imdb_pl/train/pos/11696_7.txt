"A Thief in the Night" is a movie that was generally ignored by movie fans due to its low budget (which was obvious) and its subject - the capture of a real Christian church and the fate of those who stayed. Nevertheless, it was a thrilling story that kept the viewer and definitely made him review his relationship with Jesus Christ. He touched everyone - even showing the pastor who preached the Word, but he did not believe it, knowing exactly why he was left behind. This film and its continuation of "Distant Thunder" must see films. Even after the release of the new series "Left Behind", telling the same story with a much higher budget, the impact is still the same - "A Thief in the Night" broke the ground of this genre and will always be remembered.
