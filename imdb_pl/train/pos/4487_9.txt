"Cat's Fraidy", the fourth of these cartoons is good. At least I like it, so I'm surprised it makes different reviews. <br /> <br /> This is a more macabre story than a funny one, though it has its moments of comedy. The atmosphere is dark and terrible. Tension is another strong element. When it comes to humor, it is mainly dark humor. <br /> <br /> In this flash, Tom listens to a terrifying radio program at night and is absolutely terrified because it concerns ghosts, something he believes in. While Tom is afraid of death, Jerry watches everything and can not help laughing all the time. In fact, Jerry quickly finds a way to torture him more and more. With the help of a white shirt and a vacuum cleaner, it creates a large "spirit". <br /> <br /> Tom lives the most terrible experience in his whole life. Although Jerry scares Tom without a good reason, the way the story is created ends with fun. Plus, once again, there is no violence, because it is one of the oldest Tom & Jerry cartoons. However, I'm not kidding that Tomek 9 joke almost pulled into the vacuum cleaner. <br /> <br /> When Tom finally finds out that it was all Jerry's plan and that Jerry made him a fool, Jerry is "caught in a cookie jar" (deserves to be discovered). However, Tom shows incredible patience before the reaction. He glares at Jerry angrily for about a minute. The funny thing is that Jerry invites Tom to laugh with him and it takes about half a minute to realize that Tom is looking at him with a very serious face. Jerry is trying to be funny, but Tom does not laugh. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a different, peculiar and unusual Tom & Jerry experience.
