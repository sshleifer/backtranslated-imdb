The plot does not begin to describe the movie: a man writes a movie, or rather * this * movie. It's completely independent of the point where you think it will be like a black hole. The writer writes something and it happens, or something happens and he writes about it. <br /> <br /> It's very philosophical, like "Waking Life", but more Zen-oriented and, in this case, much better, in my opinion. At some point there are interviews with people on the street, and then you see pictures of people who are filmed, and then you discover that their answers are written in a scenario when someone is still mocking her lines. There is beautiful scenery and optical illusions. <br /> <br /> I hope it will appear on DVD, so I will be able to watch it even more carefully. Seen at Cinequest (film festival in San Jose, CA) on February 25, 2002.
