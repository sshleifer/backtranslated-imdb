I just watched the movie for the second time on TV. It is beautiful, warm, sentimental, very romantic. I rarely saw actors who would be better able to reveal their love and movements with their movements and gestures - Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal, Robert Downey, Jr. and especially Mary Stuart Masterson, they just outdo themselves. Masterson probably has the most difficult role and is simply adorable. <br /> <br /> The film is in the style of both romantic films, such as "While you were sleeping," "When Harry met Sally," "Sleepless in Seattle," and "high-grabbing movies," such as "The Great, return to the future "Peggy Sue got married. I hate to say that because this cast was great and I would never change any of them - but I think it did not work as well as the above-mentioned films, because the cast's cast did not seem as great as Meg Ryan, Tom Hanks, Michael J Fox and Kathleen Turner at the time of making the movie. <br /> <br /> It is not great written - eg. Character lines are not particularly memorable. Nevertheless, it is perfectly made. <br /> <br /> Romantic longings are really tangible, the "feeling" of people in love is perfectly communicated, the timelessness of love and the overwhelming range, the feeling of loss and the desire to regain this relationship are so touchingly delivered. Time and again you will move. Actually, a comparable movie is Made in Heaven - the same romantic longing. <br /> <br /> See it - it's beautiful.
