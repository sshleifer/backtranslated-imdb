I just saw "Valentine" and I have to say that it was the best slass movie I've seen for years. In contrast to the latest trend in horror movies from the 90s, this film is more interested in the fact that it is amazing than in the case of being mocked. For those who hate "Scream", in this film there is not a single reference to the "rules of horror" (although the old rules of cinema are in force here). <br /> <br /> It's the perfect combination of the 80's and 90's horror. You get style, photos and good acting of movies from the 90s and crazy madness of the 80s. I think that the year 2001 will finally give the horror movie fans the type of films they longed for. This is definitely a move in the right direction. <br /> <br /> Denise Richards stands out here as a funny character. You can say that she liked her role and that makes her stand out. I loved her in this movie.
