Often, loud, sometimes sad stories about two working divorced boys - Lemmonie, a neurotic, pure "husband of the house" and Matthau, a sports writer - who decide to live together to reduce expenses often laugh. <br /> <br /> Nicely photographed and directed. The script is very tight - it means that almost every line has more than one page. A particularly entertaining scene includes two British sisters (Evans and Shelley) who seem to be amused by everything everyone says, but when Lemmon throws away his photos of children and, yes, ex-wife, he has girls sobbing with him before Matthau can show up with the promised drinks! <br /> <br /> Very funny.
