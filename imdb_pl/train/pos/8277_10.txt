A haunting piece that an insightful horror fan will fall in gratitude. Keep your Freddys and your Jasons - this movie is in the same company as "The Haunting" (original). Lyrical and truthful, it stays with you for long at night, just like those horrifying performances of the CBS Radio Mystery Theater. Intelligent rent.
