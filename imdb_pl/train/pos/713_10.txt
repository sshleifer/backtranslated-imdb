this movie is amazing. rather. it really does not say much or does a lot, but it's an amazing movie to watch because of how stupid it is. high school takes over the evil ms.togar, which hates one thing that all students love, rock and roll. riff randle will get all the tickets for the Ramones show, and this movie peak with the school takeover ran my riff randle and ramones. this film has everything, a bad script, dubious directing, bad actors (eg clint howard and pj soles), an amazing soundtrack, extreme indifference, these elements and many other elements make it what is classic. > <br /> note - when setting live ramones, notice that the Darby microbes are at the front of the crowd. neat-o.
