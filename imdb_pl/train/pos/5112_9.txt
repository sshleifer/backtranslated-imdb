This movie has everything, action, fight, dancing, riding a bull, music, pretty girls. This film is a real look at Central America. Believe me, I was there in 1980. A lot of money for oil, lots of women and lots of clean tones. It is a pity they are gone. The film is basically just another boy who meets a girl, a boy loses a girl, a boy gets a girlfriend back, but is redeemed by actors and music. There is no movie with better music than this movie, including American Graffiti. It's a movie that I watch over and over again and I never tire it. Every time I watch it, I'm young again and it's time to get out of honky tonking. The only reason I gave him only 9 is that you can not rate the movie zero, I do not feel you should rate one 10.
