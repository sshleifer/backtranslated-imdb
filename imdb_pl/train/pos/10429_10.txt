Usually I'm not a fan of strictly romantic films, but I heard it was good. I was stunned. The most romantic thing I have ever seen in my life. Stunning. Brilliant, sweet, funny and full of heart. Chemistry is impeccable, as is writing and directing. <br /> <br /> Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphy are so natural and sweet together, you really think they're a couple. <br /> <br /> The films catch you right away and do not let go. You can not look away or stop listening. Even small moments will simply melt your heart. <br /> <br /> It jumped into the ranks of one of my favorites. Masterpiece.
