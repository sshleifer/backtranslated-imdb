This movie has a few things that are quite amazing. First of all, it's based on a real story. This in itself is amazing that many tornadoes will hit the same city at night in Nebraska. I wonder if the name of the real city was close to "Blainsworth" (which is the name of the city in the film). There is Ainsworth, Nebraska, but there is also a city that begins with Blains-something. <br /> <br /> This shows the slowest moving tornados in the record where the boys are at home. On the other hand, the scene in which the television is blurred is actually based. Before the Doppler radar and weather radio, we were taught that if you change the TV set to a specific channel (not the cable) and tune the brightness in the right way, you can tell if a tornado is coming. The problem was that by that time you would have been able to hear it. <br /> <br /> Because I know something about midwestern tornadoes, it made me happy with the movie. I like it more than Twister. I mean, give me a break - there's no way you can go through F5 by joining a pipe in a well.
