I watched Pie-lette last night and the word that comes to mind is "original." It is a word that is not often used on television, because they all have a tendency to copy what another network does, and end with seven nights of crime shows, uncomfortable comedies and nonsense of reality. it struck me like a brick was the presence of Jim Dale. Those who do not know the British series "Carry On ..." or those who have not listened to the book about Harry Potter, may not know Dale. I'm not sure if his presence as a narrator adds or distracts. I will have to tune more, but it gives the atmosphere of "Harry Potter". Maybe it's good. <br /> <br /> Lee Pace (Niesławny, Biała Hrabina) has a gift. He never explains where he got it from, but he can bring someone back from the dead for a moment. He works with Chi McBride ("Boston Public", "Roll Bounce") to solve murders using this talent. Everything is fine and fun until it hits childhood love, Anna Friel (Goal! The Dream Begins, Timeline) and things really get complicated. He can not send her away, and he will never touch her. Boy, will it make the relationship difficult. <br /> <br /> I will be tuned to see where this series is going in the expectation that it will still be fun.
