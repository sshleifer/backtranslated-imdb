A great movie of the suspense with amazing, slow camera work, adding drama, makes it a windfall that you can watch and enjoy. Director Brian de Palma makes Hitchcock's super-imitation (many called it "ripoff") with this movie, and the widescreen DVD 2.35: 1 is a must to fully appreciate the camera (and a few scenes with people hiding on each page that she was lost on tapes formatted for television). <br /> <br /> The disadvantage of the film, at least for everyone who has a moral standard, is the general carelessness of all characters, including the policeman played by pre-NYPD Dennis Franz (who has hair here!). <br /> <br /> The opening scene is still shocking with the rather long shower scene of Angie Dickinson, which is quite clear even 25 years after its release. The film has several erotic scenes in which Dickinson (if it really is on close-ups) and Nancy Allen are not ashamed to show their bodies. <br /> <br /> In the first 20 minutes there are not too many dialogues and no bad language until Franz comes in after the murder. The first 36 minutes are thrilling and even if it's obvious who the killer is, it's still very well seen all the time, especially for men staring at naked women.
