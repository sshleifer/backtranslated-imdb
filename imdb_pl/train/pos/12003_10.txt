As a convert to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I try to absorb as much as possible from the history of my new religion. I was invited to the screening of this film with my sons and other young men and women and their families from our district. <br /> <br /> On a beautiful spring evening, we went to Kirtland, Ohio, to the historic village of the church. We had reservations at the Vistor Center to watch this movie. Because watching my film was limited to only a few church documentaries, I was intrigued. The only "full-length" church movies that I saw were "Legacy" and "My Best Two Years", which I thought was very well written and prepared. the missionary interpreter handed over the tissues stating that several people were deeply moved to the point of tears by this film. I thought: "OK ... but you need a lot of time to move me to tears." Imagine my surprise when I found myself sobbing! This is a truly moving and inspiring testament of the Prophet Joseph Smith. <br /> <br /> See this and believe in his powerful message!
