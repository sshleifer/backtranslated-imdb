Greetings from the dark again. 18 directors 18 seemingly unrelated vignettes about love in a city of lights. A very unusual format that requires the adjustment of several segments as a browser. We are so used to character development in a 2-hour movie, it's a bit of disarming to make it happen in the 8-minute segment. <br /> <br /> The idea is based on 18 love stories / relationships in 18 different districts of this wonderful city. Of course, some people do better than others, and some go for comedy while others focus on dramatic emotions. Some well-known directors are involved, including: The Coen Brothers, Wes Craven, Alfonso Cuaron, Alexander Payne, Gus Van Sant and Gurinda Chadha. There are also many well-known faces: Steve Buscemi, Barbet Schroeder, Catalina Sandino Moreno, Ben Gazzar, Gena Rowlands, Gerard Depardieu, Juliette Binoche, Willem Dafoe, Nick Nolte, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Bob Hoskins. <br /> <br /> One of the best segments includes mime, then another mime and nerdiego, and at the same time a happy young son of two mimes. Red cloak, cancer, divorce, sexual fantasy, child death and many other topics also play a key role. Do not miss Alexandra Payne (director of "Sideways") as Oscar Wilde. <br /> <br /> The variety of segments makes it interesting to watch, but as a movie you can not call it great. It is still very possible to watch and a pleasant change of pace for the often watching film.
