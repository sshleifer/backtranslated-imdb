In this beautiful film I enjoyed China's cinematographic leisure in the 1930s. The story is simple. An elderly male performer wants to pass his art to a young man, although he has no live children. The faces of the actors are great. History reveals the dedication and gratitude of children to those who treat them well and their desire for good treatment. The opera in the film reminds me of a FAMILY MY CONCUBE which was more elaborate and complicated. The story here reminds me of the story of Dickens about the times when the children were almost still. The plot is somewhat predictable and a bit too sentimental for me, but it is worth the time to watch the heroism, humanity and history presented.
