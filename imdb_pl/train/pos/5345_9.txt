Yesterday, my Spanish / Catalan wife and I saw this emotional history lesson. Spain is again heading towards a political confrontation. Therefore, this masterpiece should be shown in all Spanish high schools. This is a huge lesson of the hidden crime of fascism. An American pilot who participates in the Spanish Civil War chooses a democratically elected republican government. The criminal role of religion is surprisingly well shown in one of the most imaginative scenes that Uribe ever created. The colors are great. Cruelty of war (could anyone tell me the difference between any war and civil war?) It is used as a scenario of hope when two young children express their feelings and protect each other. Cowards who start abusing power even against innocent children are now active again. Film such as "El viaje de Carol" / "Podróż Carol" tells one of many sad stories from the 20th century. It's a better history lesson than any book could contain. Again a great job from Peninsula Iberica!
