I voted perfectly for how well it played, not for content. It still gives me chills after reading the book and then watching the movie. Two ex-cons travel to their destination to rob the family of money from the safe they learned about while in prison. While driving, the voltage starts to increase because the soundtrack in the film increases the overall expectation. After the killers finish their work on the farm, the next morning the remains of the family are found by a friend of his daughter's church. Bleeding scream, when the scene moves on the phone with a cut cord, really made my blood chill and gave me shivers. The fact that the killers fulfilled their just destiny is a small consolation for this doomed family. Robert Blake was perfect in the role of Perry Smith. The book was superbly written by Truman Capote.
