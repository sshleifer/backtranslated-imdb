I recently caught up with this little gem of a movie on the cable. This surprised me, although I should expect it from the team involved in this film. <br /> <br /> Henry Bromwell directed the film with a sure hand and it shows. Always wondering about the secret life of the killers. You do not have to go too far to realize that they are probably neighbors, social friends and even friends; they are not different from us, at least on the surface. <br /> <br /> In this story, grandpa is a wicked figure who does not hesitate to eliminate anyone at the right price. There is no scruple in teaching the lines to your son and even your grandson! <br /> <br /> Alex is a man living in the hustle and bustle. He knows what he has done in the past and is suddenly aware of the consequences of his actions. He must see someone who will help him find peace with himself. Going to Dr. Parks, trying to find absolution, although he is not there. On the contrary, there is a dramatic turn when Alex finds out who is to kill the next. <br /> <br /> Alex, greatly presented by William H. Macy, impresses us. Not only is he a fantastic actor, but he makes us believe that he is this man. One of the best things in the movie is the late John Ritter. It's as convincing as Dr. Parks, a man who discovers the secret. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland, because grandfather is perfect. He is a natural actor in everything he does. Neve Campbell surprised her with her key role. It shows amazing possibilities and range. Tracey Ullman is Martha, a suffering wife, and she can do little. Barbara Bain is also a grandmother from hell in a rare release. David Dorfman, is delighted with the movie. It displays maturity over the years. <br /> <br />
