I recently came across this movie in TNT five minutes ago during a Florida vacation ... (hey, there must be a time in the hotel, right?) At first I was surprised when I saw Melissa Joan Hart in any length. movie on TNT. I mean, "Drive Me Crazy" is not that old anymore, right? <br /> <br /> But I'm stuck with it and I was completely surprised and entertained. Melissa perfectly fulfills her role as a psychotic Jennifer. Supporting staff (Nick, ex-con boyfriend; Karen, her best friend and her parents controlling life) added enormous credibility. The phrase at the end was a nice closing of this story about a girl who always seemed to be a step ahead of everyone. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance, check it out! <br /> <br />
