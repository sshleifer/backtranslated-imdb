The original with Barbara Stanwyk is saved only by Stanwyk. History and other performances are too disgustingly cute, and the film itself is too old to be enjoyed today. The Bette Midler version is much more interesting. She is Stella Claire, an independent lonely woman who gets pregnant and refuses to help her boyfriend (Stephen Collins) or her friend (John Goodman in an underrated performance). He's raising Jenny's daughter so sweetly played by Trini Alvarado, and then he comes to the conclusion that Jenny's father can do better for her and eventually make a life-changing decision. The film is full of laughter, tears and unforgettable moments mainly between Midler and Alvarado. Marsha Mason works as Jenny's would-be stepmother, who, though rich, turns out to have a very good influence on her. If you like Midler, Goodman or just good movies with lots of excitement, you'll love the STELLA Bette Midler version.
