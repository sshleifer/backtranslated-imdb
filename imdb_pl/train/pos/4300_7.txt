This film could be one of those ordinary "soap bottles" referring to the daily events of half a dozen families whose life is intertwined. discovery of a child thrown under the bushes! What a mix of events! <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the creator of the film goes beyond everyday events and poses questions to consider, although there are no satisfactory answers. He asks: in this chaotic world things just happen, whether it's just happiness, when things are going well or, considering the fatalistic view, whether a person is predestined to be in a certain place at a certain time, and thus to participate in an event and his future takes on a new perspective? Most of us have experienced this amazing experience. <br /> <br /> Is it our super ego that makes us believe that we are so important? As one character says? at one time he sat on the edge of the Grand Canyon and realized how infinitely small he was. <br /> <br /> This is not one of my favorite movies, but a good study of interpersonal relations. Danny Glover has an exceptional nice role.
