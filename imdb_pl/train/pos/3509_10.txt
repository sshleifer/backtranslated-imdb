I saw this movie some time ago and is still at the top of my list of "favorite movies". It's incredibly complex, and what really makes this movie are the detailed pieces (such as the coffee box "Cafe Bustelo", which is again used as a cup for washing her grandchildren's hair) that people can not see because they DO NOT UNDERSTAND THIS FILM IF YOU ARE NOT SPAIN. This is just one of those films that is very culturally specific and special. Please do not hit this video if you do not have previous knowledge about the basis on which it is built. I can see exactly what the screenwriter / director is aiming for and perfectly hit the target! This film deserves better evaluation.
