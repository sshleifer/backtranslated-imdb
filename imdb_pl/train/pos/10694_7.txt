I have a lot of experience with women in Russia, and this movie shows how many of them are unfortunately. They are very cunning, ruthless and greedy, and very unjust. From robot sex, bustle to gifts, lies and betrayal - I've experienced all this in Russia. <br /> <br /> I know what I'm talking about. Here are my qualifications: Here are the photoreportages from my three trips to Russia in search of a bride. It contains thousands of pictures of many hot Russian girls that I met, a black comedy, deceptions in which I was initiated, and the story of my attack and appearance on Russian national television. <br /> <br /> http: //www.happierabroad .com / Photojournals.htm <br /> <br /> This is like Reality TV. You will like it. I spent a lot of time putting it together. So check it out. The Russian woman Nicole Kidman plays is very similar to Julia and Katya in my photojournalism. <br /> <br /> My 3 fiancés who are looking for a trip in Russia are very exciting and will sell, so why not make a movie of my fiancée looking for adventure in Russia? In this movie, however, there is one unpredictable invoice, in this way the guy orders his bride from the catalog and tells her to come to the airport. It does not work like that at all, so I do not understand why the media like to fix it. There is not one Russian website introducing the fiancée who would act this way and I challenge everyone to find such a website. The fact is that you can order CONTACT INFO only with a Russian woman (e-mail address, phone number, etc.) from the website. From there you correspond, then you visit her and if you want to take her to your country, you start the immigration process in your INS office and wait a month later. That's how it works in real life. You can not just order her to come to your airport. Immigration will NEVER let this happen. <br /> <br /> WuMaster <br /> <br /> - I have everything I wanted when going abroad! You too can! http://www.happierabroad.com
