This documentary is about the life of Big and Little Edie Beale, a mother and daughter who, from the mid-1950s to the end of the 1970s, lived alone in her family home in East Hampton, NY. Before the filmmakers find them, the residence breaks down, and the women, 78 and 56, share a miserable room. Elder Edie Beale is the aunt of Jackie Kennedy Onassis, and the younger is her first cousin. Initially, the women were to be displaced from home because of their fatal condition, but Jackie sent them money for repairs so that they could continue to live there. <br /> <br /> Sometimes a movie may seem like exploitation, because no woman seems to be in the best mental health, but sometimes the movie is difficult to tear. "Little" Edie blames her mother for her current condition, and her mother fires that Edie will never be a success that she thought she was. "Little" Edie often seems to have been trapped in the past, focused on the choices she made decades ago, and she loves showing pictures of her youth, where she was apparently a beautiful debutant. Her mother seems more reconciled to her fate to live the rest of her life in terrible conditions. There are clear indications about the wonderful life that once led both women, from pictures depicting a happy family, to a great portrait of older Edie next to her bed. From what we see in the house, most of the rooms in it are empty, the walls break and fall apart, and "Little" Edie leaves the food in the attic, so that the locust can play on it. And of course, many cats are around. <br /> <br /> In this document the document is extremely sad. Although no woman seems particularly depressed with her life, the misery they live in is terrible. It is not particularly clear whether there is even running water at home, and you get the impression that they have been abandoned by the family. <br /> <br /> However, a documentary is a miracle that can be seen and highly recommended.
