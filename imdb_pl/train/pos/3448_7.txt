Document without loss of words ... ever ... <br /> <br /> Suppose that narrative is more than just a trick, let's say it is a commentary on Japanese society. And because this film is as fast as an absurd documentary, as it happens, a constant play of words, as fast as it is going, and so badly translated, as it is - in the current version of the festival screener seen today in Copenhagen Cinematek- - it is still quite pleasant. <br /> <br /> But for a patient and ONLY a truly patient and open one, I am talking to you with fans of Jim Jarmusch with ADD relapses, I believe that this is a movie for you. It's a smart movie if you let him win. <br /> <br /> Pretty beautiful and quite kitschy, and quite Japanese subculture. And quite experimental. Static 2D in the 3D world. All in all, fun for those who want to see a Japanese movie that falsifies the Japanese food culture. Thumbs up if you are in the mood for something completely different.
