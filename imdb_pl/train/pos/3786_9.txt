Ying, a Chinese girl who speaks Czech, invited us to a screening of a Czech film (with English subtitles) in the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies (VES). I saw Samotáři for the first time (Loners, 2000) and it was pretty good. <br /> <br /> As in many other Czech films, the seven main characters seem to have a rather difficult, dirty life; the network indicates that this topic was popular with American films in the early 90's. Their relationships rely on breaking up, merging and recombining. Another typical feature of Czech films is that none of the characters is universally negative, and none of them is permanently positive. You can also see how characters evaluate the features of others depending on the context; it is a very realistic feature of the psychological analysis of the film. <br /> <br /> Ondřej is a talented and married young surgeon who has two daughters. Nevertheless, you find out that he only studied neuroscience to prove how much he loves another woman, Hanka. He is so obsessive that he often disguises himself as a plumber to get to the home of Hanka's parents - a house that repeatedly smokes. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Hanka has very mixed relationships with her parents. He simply decides - by throwing a coin - to break up with Petr, who works in a private radio station. Hanka does not consider her parents' bourgeois life to be a good example, but seems rather ineffective in creating a better environment. But she is a very flexible character when it comes to the type of her boyfriends. <br /> <br /> Hanka seems to have serious plans for some time against Jakub, an innocent drug addict whose memory seems to be crushed by medications. However, friends from his team inform Jakub that he has another girl. Hanka is disappointed and returns to her parents. <br /> <br /> When Hanka and Petr break up, she is organized by Robert, a swat who also works in a travel agency, where his job is to show the life of an ordinary Czech people to Japanese tourists. Robert - who also gives Jacob marijuana - never takes anything seriously and usually sleeps with many different women; in the end his mother dies in a hospital and has her own ways of dealing with depression. <br /> <br /> Vesna (Slavic word "spring") who came to Prague from Macedonia works as a barmaid - and you will not find out if she came to the Czech Republic to see her father or UFO. She seems to be confused, but sometimes helps other heroes in their problems. <br /> <br /> Petr works in a radio station and is the only one who likes his job - a job he ultimately loses. He announces to the public that he broke up with Hanka - so Ondřej learns about the news that makes him very happy. Finally, Ondřej's wife, Lenka, is always ready to forgive and stabilize their marriage - even after Ondřej asks the wizard to get rid of him so that Ondřej can try to catch Hank again. (The magician pays his debt because he is the brother of a serious car accident - Jakub and Hanka bring the victim to the hospital, and Ondřej saves his life.) Lenka also works for the travel agency - as translator - and eventually has to translate some hysterical scenes for about 20 Japanese tourists who shoot their films during Hanka's parents' dinner. <br /> <br /> The seven characters enter into interesting and exciting ways that would be natural if Prague were smaller by four orders of magnitude. Considering the actual size of the Czech capital, it seems unlikely that all these events will take place among seven people, but it is fun.
