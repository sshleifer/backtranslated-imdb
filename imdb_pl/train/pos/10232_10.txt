Seeing most of Ringo Lama's films, I can say that this is his best movie so far and the most amazing. It is an ancient piece from the porcelain era, full of kitsch martial arts, where the location of an underground lair full of traps and dungeons plays such a big role as any of the characters. The action is fantastic, the story is tense and fun, and the scenery is truly unforgettable. Unfortunately, Burning Paradise has not been made available on DVD, and vhs is almost impossible to turn on gloves, even if you're near the second largest Chinese city in North America (like me). If you can find him, do not give him.
