This is the best version (so far) you'll see and the most faithful of Bronte's work. Dalton finds it difficult to imagine how Rochester Jane Eyre proclaimed "not good-looking." But his acting overcomes it, and Zelah Clark, as pretty as she is, is also a complete and credible Jane Eyre. This production is a long watch, but it's worth it. In the scenario there are almost direct quotes from the book, and if you want to have the first real "romance" in the literature, this is the way to see it. I am the owner of every copy of this film and read the original and read it again. Filming may seem a bit outdated, but it will never be like that.
