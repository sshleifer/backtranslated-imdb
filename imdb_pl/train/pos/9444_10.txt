*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Packaged in unforgettable moments (such as the above quote, immortalized by Primus), Deliverance tells the story of four guys who set off into wild forests to sail rafting and escape for a moment with a great cities just to see that their fun soon takes a wrong turn. This is not a Hollywood movie. There are virtually no special effects, the setting is extremely realistic and nothing is covered with sugar or nice. The town boys look like town boys, and even a tough guy, Louis, presented with precision by Burt Reynolds, is clearly at the mercy of the savages on this journey. This is a great example of the "what if" movie. What happens if some friends go on rafting in a forest area with which none of them were familiar and ended up desperately trying to avoid judging and convicting murders that had to commit themselves to save their own lives? > <br /> There is of course a very strong element of the film that deals with social and class structure and the relationship (or lack thereof) between rural and urban population. When four guys arrive in the woods at the beginning of the movie, they clearly do not know how to get in touch with the people who live there, and talk to them as if they were not sure if they would understand or be able to communicate. This block of communication is best remembered on the scene of dueling banjoes, in which they try to refuel the car and the truck and get someone to drive vehicles down the river. While Drew and undoubtedly an inbred and probably underdeveloped boy on the veranda are duels with guitar and banjo (one of the best scenes in the movie), Louis has some difficulties in buying gas, and Bobby comments on genetic deficiencies and how pathetic it all is. When the boy turns away from Drew, who offered to shake his hand after an amazing jam session, Bobby tells him to give the child a few bucks, knowing that none of them is sure how to react. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of thing that we see in the Liberation that establishes the tension to come. This wonderful scene in which there was a lot of fun (including the funniest scene of "dancing in red" until O Brother, Where Art Thou?) It ended, and everyone was uncomfortable not knowing what to do around them. These people are apples and oranges and live according to completely different rules of life. The people whom Louis, Bobby, Drew and Ed met in the hills, grew up separate from modern society and modern laws, and live according to the principles of nature that do not include killing. Four friends, confused by their awkward behavior, set out on the river, hoping to end strangeness and start the adventure. <br /> <br /> (spoilers) When they are separated from each other for a short time, Ed and Bobby bump into the hills over the river, which quickly become unpleasant, uncertainty about the way these people live - as determined by the above stage - it comes into play to create the greatest tension during the stage. I think a good sign of a quality thriller is that the tragic element of the movie, namely assault and real murder, takes very little time on the screen, but remains one of the most memorable parts of the movie. There is no unjustified violence here, all this is obvious and has a surprisingly strong effect. <br /> <br /> The movement is about a violent clash between two very different kinds of people and what can happen when they are unintentionally in a state of war with each other. Traveling the rest of the river after the assault, which takes up most of the movie, delivers incredibly effective tension and keeps you on the edge of your seat, without bombarding you so much that you become numb. It's surprisingly effective when we learn that Ed could well kill the wrong man on the cliff, and the tension in the movie does not go away when the other three members reach the bottom of the river because they give the police a questionable explanation of what's going on there on the river and why the deputy's brother-in-law disappeared. <br /> <br /> This is a very worrying movie that is testimony to its success, because it is obvious that such a movie has a little shake people. Hillbillies is a human (ie more realistic) version of the subhuman red seen in children's, but quite similar movies, such as Gator Bait and Gator Bait 2, none of which could ever be compared to a timeless movie, such as Deliverance. When we follow these four men over their terrible weekend in the woods, the natural element is so real and we get to know men so well and in such a subtle way that we, as people in the audience, are really the fifth member of the team. It is not uncommon for a movie to be in this way.
