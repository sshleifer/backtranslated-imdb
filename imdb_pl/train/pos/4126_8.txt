What a night. Perry Mason then Have Gun, Will Travel, then Gunsmoke (when it was half an hour) and finally at 22:30 came "Sea Hunt" with great opening music and Mike's boat flowing for a new adventure. Wonderful .. Regardless of history, it's the main character (played by Lloyd Bridges), strong, honest, honest. Man and boy. This caused interest in boats that have survived for years. Why do not they show up on the cable or make it available on video, I have no idea .. It's a pity.
