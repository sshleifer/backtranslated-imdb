Yes, Shakespeare would be really proud. Laurence Fishburne was not at its best, but he certainly was not bad. On the other hand, Kenneth Brannagh was brilliant. His intrigues were great, just like playing with the audience. Very nice job. <br /> <br /> There were sometimes too small dramas where you could have expected more. The murder of Cassio, for example, was a bit eclipsed, because it was too far away from each other, causing the viewer to turn his head to capture it all. <br /> <br /> Did I mention Michael Maloney? His madness, Rodentigo's striken was extraordinary; annoying even. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen Othello yet, see this. If you have not read Othello, see this. If you have not heard Othello, see this. On the other hand, do yourself a favor by reading her, seeing that she was acting on stage and heard her singing.
