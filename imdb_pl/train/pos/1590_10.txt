I just started watching the TV series "What I like About You" and I have to say that watching is a real joy. I always like to see that new concerts work well because many shows go out before you really feel them. I watched Amanda Bynes from "All That" who is a really funny girl. The best part of her comedy is that it is so natural and what I mean is something that a person can be the best friend to say I have not practiced. <br /> <br /> I recently started watching the program and I fell in love. I'm just watching from scratch, but I'm waiting for next season. All characters in the series give something from all history. It's nice to see some old face from other programs that I liked to watch in the past, such as Jennie Garth from "90210", Leslie Grossman from "Popular" and Wesley Jonathan from "City Guys". The new character is also very talented, Nick Zano has the charm that makes you love him, even when he's doing something wrong with the holly (Bynes). <br /> <br /> Generally this program has the right ingredients to be successful, I can not wait to see how it grows.
