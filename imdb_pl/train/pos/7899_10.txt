It was an excellent movie. I do not understand why so many people do not like it. There were so many things in it that you can connect with, so many beautiful pictures and so much compassion in things you have not talked about. I was very funny and had a feeling of joyful enthusiasm, just like me when I finish most of Tom Robbins' stories. I have not read this particular Robbin book now, so I do not know how it was, but I can not imagine that this movie could be a very bad interpretation. The film left much to be defined, which is the best part of any novel by Tom Robbins, dreaming about the details. <br /> <br /> To all those who said it was the worst movie in history, I feel sorry for what you have to leave the dark light in your hearts. Far from the worst, this movie was great. Long live the whooping cough.
