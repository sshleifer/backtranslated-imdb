Being half-Portuguese does not make me half-blind (or semi-biased) when discussing Portuguese films. I do not do it often anyway. But this movie was such an adrenaline rush! Yes, it is true - it was the most accurate when it comes to the story that went on - but it did not make any impression of going beyond the typical Portuguese territory: things like using real locations in the middle of the crowded Lisbon movement and recruiting a real crowd face a real crowd from almost 30 years ago. And for God's sake, they did it right! OK, to sum up: very emotional if you survived, but you will notice minor improvements that could have been made, as well as role-playing needs. If you just watch it at random, you're in good historical madness, only in a very recent History and a little more thought-out than usual. Even according to European standards, yes.
