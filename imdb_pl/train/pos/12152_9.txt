I just saw this movie in HBO and it was really good ... a really tragic love story! I really appreciate the fact that the guy in the heart of the story has lost the use of his legs in an accident. It is rare to see a love story involving a physically disabled person. The love that has developed between this figure and the woman who comes into his life nicely presented how I would like to think that love can heal someone's heart. Laura Leighton ... 27 of them, when she made this film ... she was great as a woman so full of life that she can revive this guy's heart. Unfortunately, because his family is rich and he is not there, "problems" develop. <br /> <br /> This month he plays HBO several times.
