I was also very surprised when I saw how few people voted for the movie, and I was just going to write something about it, although my comments are quite similar to those already written. <br /> <br /> I like lots of movie stuff. A great game between Mastroianni and Loren. The way the film is told: Humanity and love are slowly developing between these two outsiders and contrasted with the simultaneous and persistent inhuman march of the fascist radio announcer (who is just a colleague on the part of Mastroianni) and supporters and coming from the show. " For me, this is a very good film about what it means to be a human being. Maybe some of you say that the anti-fascist "message" is too clearly delivered, but for me it has not damaged the film in any way. My voice is 10/10.
