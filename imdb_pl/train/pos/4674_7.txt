What percentage of the films are watched by a man who wonders what happened to their eight to ten dollars? ANSWER: TOO MUCH! This movie is not like that. This is a story about real people who are sometimes a combination of both nice and unlikely. <br /> <br /> Disadvantage: <br /> <br /> Insufficient character development and some plot threads twisted in the wind. <br /> <br /> GÃ³ra: <br /> <br /> forces viewers to think about choices made for good or for bad in their own lives. <br /> <br /> Good game: Scott Cohen, Judd Hirsch, Susan Floyd, Ato Essandoh and Elliot Korte. <br /> <br /> It contains a bit of good humor.
