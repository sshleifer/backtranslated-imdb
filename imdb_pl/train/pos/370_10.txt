I've seen this movie at least fifty times, and after seeing it last week for the first time in a long time I still FULFILL IT. great cast, including Whoopi Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover and Margaret Avery. Akosua Busia deserved an Oscar nomination for the short but powerful portrait of Nettie. <br /> <br /> You will experience all human emotions while watching this movie. I was laughing, I was crying and I was mad. Like most great films, the Academy received many nominations, but it did not win. But this film is undoubtedly one of the best films of all time.
