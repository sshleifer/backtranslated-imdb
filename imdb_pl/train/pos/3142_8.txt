In this really diverse cast, this show hits the FOX. It is a kind of sitcom that grows on you. If you just watch 1 show, you may not like it, but when you watch two or three - you'll start getting addicted. <br /> <br /> This is because some jokes hit and some miss depending on how you view them. As usual today, the topics are very mature. Humor is usually very mature. Often the most fun parts are parts in which mature motifs interfere with the innocent. <br /> <br /> Red (Kurtwood Smith), veteran actor, makes a very good mood at this concert. Debra Jo Rupp also plays well in this band. Danny Masterson, the oldest actor of "kids" is also very good. Laura Prepon (Donna) looks better at earlier concerts as a natural redhead (who came up with the idea of ​​making a blonde out of her?). He often shows very good talent and comedy time. It also looks good without make-up. <br /> <br /> This is one of the better entries on FOX in the sitcom section and the most successful live action from Married With Children
