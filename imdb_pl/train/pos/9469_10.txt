There is a scene in Dan in real life, in which the family competes to see which sex can finish the crossword first. The answer to one of the guidelines is Murphy's Law: anything that can go wrong will go wrong. This is exactly the case for Dan Burns (Steve Carell, office) columnist for the local newspaper. Dan is an expert in providing advice in everyday life, but he realizes that things are not so perfect in his own. Dan in real life is amazing in capturing these ironies of everyday life and is successful in the comedy, tragedy and beauty of all. Also, this movie is damn funny. <br /> <br /> The death of his wife forces Dan to raise three daughters on his own ... each daughter on their own key stages of life: first daughter try her driver's license, middle one on her teenage phase of anger, and the youngest sail away from early childhood. Dan starts spinning to go to Rhode Island for a family reunion and come across an intriguing woman in a bookstore. <br /> <br /> Her name is Marie (Juliette Binoche, Chocolat) and she is looking for a book that will help her avoid awkward situations ... what is in store when they are thrown into the Burns family home. <br /> <br /> If you saw Steve Carell in The Office or Little Miss Sunshine, I knew he was incomparable with comedic time and an incredibly dynamic actor. Steve Carell is amazing in capturing all the emotions associated with family life: frustration and sincere compassion. The family, as well as the home itself, provide a warm environment for the film, which contrasts the internal chaos that grows throughout the film, and finally breaks out in a rather tense climax. The film lacks only some predictable results, but at the same time life consists of both irony and predictability: which is an irony in itself. <br /> <br /> Dan in real life is definitely worth seeing, for the pleasure of watching all the fun subtleties that are often lacking in everyday life, and most likely I will like it a second time or even a third time. Just "put it in my card".
