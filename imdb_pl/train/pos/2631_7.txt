If the Lion King is a serious tale of a young lion growing up to avenge his father's death, the Lion King 1 and a half is the complete opposite, full of capriciousness and joy. The Lion King told the story of Simba, a young lion, a year and a half from the perspective of Timone and Pumba, a less-perfect meercata duo who left home because he could not dig tunnels without burying his friends and neighbors and a warthog who has a problem with fragrance. The film is a bit short, but Disney does a good job, filling up time with various sketches with Timone and Pumba, because they "watch" the movie with us. My favorite is singing, which happens in the middle of the movie, make sure you're watching a bouncing mistake! Disney announced a year and a half as "the rest of the story," though it really is not. It is just a different perspective of the Lion King, without all the serious things that have penetrated most of the second half of the original Disney classics. Credit Nathan Lane as Timone and Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa for working on the voice, without their efforts, the movie may not have worked. They sing, play and make us laugh. They also give us a reason to avoid a hot tub with a tumor.
