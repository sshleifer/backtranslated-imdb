Standard story to fame, which has several high points. First of all, Lonette McKee as a sister who gives a stunning, stellar performance. The fact that it has never become a great sensation after this event is beyond me. Unfortunately, she is a supporting figure and we are forced to focus on the neuter form of Irena Carter, Sparkle, whose reach to fame is easy, boring and unconvincing. However, every time girls enter the stage and perform, the film comes back to life. Curis Mayfield's original music must be praised. The copy I saw was a very old VHS tape. The image quality was quite low, as were the production values ​​that I am guessing. In summary, it's worth looking at.
