This movie is great. It's real and cordial, but at the same time completely crazy. Heroes fall in love easily because they have so many different minds, but each of us can relate at least to this. In Canada, we do not have many films from Eastern Europe, and for the few that I've seen, Loners is one of the best. It's very funny and magical. If you want to see something new and refreshing, go to Loners.
