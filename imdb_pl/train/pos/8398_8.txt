A realistic picture of a young love for a student set, but also attractive for an older viewer like me. It has ups and downs, turns and corners, and it makes me drop a tear or two. We rarely watch films with black urban characters that could appeal to older, non-black viewers and show a more real life of young black adults. <br /> <br /> This movie takes place on a university campus and a city where two people meet and fall in love. In the background are friends of different friends and situations that affect them better or worse. A typical plot that some might say, but it really was unexpected. <br /> <br /> I found myself supporting the relationship of the couple, seeing their own story in their history. Moments of deep thought and revelation poured out of the actors' performances. <br /> <br /> This is a bright movie that I would support for those young at heart, in love or ever in love. Great movie. I will be looking for a copy to be added to my movie collection.
