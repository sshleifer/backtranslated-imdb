I liked the movie, sweet and funny. I think this movie is a good family movie. The dirtiest part of the movie was when the New York Yankees were made. You must be in the Red Sox country to understand that NY Yankees are a dirty word. I'm sorry to say to Yankee fans. I recommend this photo for the whole family. Of course, with a typical film about love / comedy, there is a long moment in the movie, with love and what I do, but the film makes up for it all at times with a slapstick. The screening of the film is a few moments, like the nation of Red Sox (in Fenway Park), how fans felt that at the end of the 86 years Soxa always screwed up and how love for Sox and love for another man go hand in hand.
