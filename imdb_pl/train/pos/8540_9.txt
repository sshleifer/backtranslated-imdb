It's funny how your life can change in a moment ... To participate in "The Waterdance" for the first time it was an unforgettable experience, the way you have to get used to a new lifestyle, it may seem scary, and to notice that other people are going through a similar situation, this can help in continuing. <br /> <br /> The performances of Eric Stoltz and mainly Helen Hunt (about man !, Helen is the purest and graceful woman on earth ...) are wonderful, Wesley Snipes also surprises you in one of your last major roles. A simple and at the same time deep movie that will not leave us indifferent to the message conveyed: enjoy every moment of your life ... <br /> <br /> You really do not participate in the movie like every hour! (sorry, this is a Brazilian expression ...).
