I read so many comments that I also shared the fact that I remember the movie and wanted to see it so much, but I did not know the name of the film. Fortunately, due to searching and finding the title on this site, I read the comments left here and realized that it was a movie that I remembered. Then I searched and found a movie and was so excited that I could watch the movie again 40 years later. Because of this page and your comments, you've helped me, so I want to thank everyone. I want to share how I found this movie for everyone who was also looking for a copy. It was in the VHS version of Wonderful Disney World "Call it Courage", which contained two films, the second was "The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle". I was touched now as well 40 years ago, and now I have my own copy. I think it is only available on VHS. I found it on eBay and saw some copies of it there. Enjoy it, I know it! <br /> <br /> It's a great story about the boy's love and the eagle he cared for. When the time came to sacrifice the eagle, the boy released the eagle because he could not let it be killed. After the boy was forced to leave the tribe for punishment after the release of the eagle, the eagle also saved the boy's life and, moreover, taught him how to survive. The proximity with which the boy and the eagle shared in the wilderness was so moving that filming was truly extraordinary. What a great time it was. I've never seen anything that would even be close to this movie!
