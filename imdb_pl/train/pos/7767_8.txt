Stack should receive an Oscar for this performance, period. It's a crime he did not do. Amazing how humanizes a rich, worthless character. <br /> <br /> Dorothy Malone has won the Academy's deserved prize for her performance. In fact, all the acting in this movie is perfect. <br /> <br /> The story begins with a taxi ride, then travel by plane, and then continues an exciting ride that will interest you. You will be entertained! <br /> <br /> However, this is just a gluttonous soap opera. One-dimensional, 100-percent soap. You can call it the most perfect soap, because action triumphs over the material. He worked perfectly, he was well-directed, but strictly in his own kind of soap. I would not call it even a melodrama (such as "Mildred Pierce" or "Imitation of Life"). Without negating the great entertainment value of this film, one can only imagine what this talented cast and director could achieve thanks to the more important subjects.
