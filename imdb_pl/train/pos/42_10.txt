Busy Phillips performed the hell of the show, both comedic and dramatic. Erika Christensen was good, but Busy stole the show. It was a nice accent after The Smokers, a movie with Busy who was not that great. If Busy did not receive any nomination for this film, it would be a disaster. Forget the smile of Mona Lisa, see Dom.
