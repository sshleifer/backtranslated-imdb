I did not read anything about the film before I accidentally watched it on the last Saturday night. And then, when I watched it, I felt the misery of Lena and Boesman in my bones. I was so fascinated with acting and tone, as with filming, that I was only partially listening to the dialogues. My husband fell asleep soon after we went to sleep, and I was sleepless under the influence of the movie. I wanted to wake him up, saying, "If I ever voted for an Oscar nomination, it would be for these two actors." I decided to wait until the next day. Then I read more about the movie on IMDb and sadly found out that Mr. Berry died before the release of the movie and that he probably never saw the last version of his brilliant work. I still want to tell him that for me his film was a real independent film, in its concept and spirit. Actors should be praised not only for their brilliant performance, but also for the part without glare, without showing off, on the contrary, showing a real picture of human depression. Sad but moving.
