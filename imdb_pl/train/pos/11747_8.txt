A great effort on the Australian show. which is probably not surprising, because it seems to be somewhat revival in Aussie quality. dare I compare this show to the glow of love on my side? No. but it reminds us of the secret life of us early. the cast is great, gibney works his magic in the first two episodes I've seen, the British cast is also strong, especially in the form of callus and lizzie. but it can be a saving light (not that it requires saving) if this concert is to be the next season. I was not a fan of his performance in the amazingly amazing series of the past, which took place a few years ago, but he was great as always in a greener way. it's good to see brooke satchwell again. Let's hope that the program will improve with each episode.
