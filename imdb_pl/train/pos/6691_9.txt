This movie is great fun. What makes it wonderful is two things: one is the simple way that characters adopt stereotypes, as well as discussions about their costumes and superpowers. There is a very endearing sincerity that is very appealing; the second is the basic sweetness of heroes and the quality of chemistry. Claire Forlani deserves special attention as the object of Mr. Furious's desires. There are lots of talents here. I realize that some of high expectations may have been disappointed, but this movie is great fun and something sweet.
