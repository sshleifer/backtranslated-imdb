Usually I'm not a fan of musicals, but if I had to choose what would be my favorite, then it would be Oliver. This movie is so well made, the characters are well presented, the costumes are in place, the acting is good, and the songs are great, my favorite is "Browsing the situation by Ron Moody, who gives a great picture of Fagin. I was not old enough to see Oliver when he was released in the late 1960s, but my sisters were, so I had to reconcile with them for many weeks, singing bloody songs, it was usually: "Who will buy my wonderful roses, I already knew all songs before I saw this movie. It is a timeless musical that can not be changed, it is not accurate in relation to the book and I do not think it would work so well if it did. I do not think Charles Dickens is disappointed when he wrote Oliver to portray poverty in London, orphanages, homes and what the poor had to go through to survive, and the movie portrays the portrait is also very good. Another great reason to watch this movie is Bullseye the Old type of English Bull Terrier, notice its long, thin legs that were bred from the breed many years ago, had to hunt high and low to find such an item, and he is exactly that how the English Bull Terrier would look in Victorian times. Note that he has scars (which are probably makeup) on his face, Bill Sykes probably used him to fight a dog or a rat. Terrier had a record number of killings in the abyss of rats. He is a beautiful dog and he noticed that he disagrees with Bill Sykes after he killed Nancy, of course he has his own standards, which he was not the boss that Bill Sykes thought. great musical to watch, if you like musicals, and if you do not like musicals, try it in any way, in this movie everyone will find something for themselves.
