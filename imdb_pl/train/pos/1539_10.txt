I saw it at the Mill Valley Film Festival. It is hard to believe that this is the directorial debut of Mrs. Blom, it is beautifully made and performed. A large cast of characters could not come from Anne Tyler's novel, i.e. They are covered with a layer of history and a potential future, there are no false notes, surprising explosions of humor among the fears and real, if not damaging, dilemmas of the earth. If you see "The Best of Youth", you will recognize how well the heroes are in small moments, even when the story moves energetically. I really hope it will be widespread in the USA. I live on a fairly sophisticated film market, but we rarely get Swedish movies.
