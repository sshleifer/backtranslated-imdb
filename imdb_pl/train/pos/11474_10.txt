This film is one of ages. First of all, I must say that after watching this movie it has become one of my favorite movies. Why? Straight; Ben Coccio (writer, director) created a real work of art. Where 99.9% of movies are purely entertaining these days, director Ben Coccio gives us the truth, gives us reality, gives us a learning tool to know why it happened. The mainstream media is spinning and spinning, but Ben Coccio is looking at school shooting in the face, able to go where there was no other form of media, to the minds and hearts of two young men planning to kill their classmates. Although it is certainly graphic and frightening, how could it not be? Gloves disappear, lies and the sugar coating of our media masters is pushed aside and we are taken to a place where we can find the truth in what has happened. Sometimes it is not just a loose screw, as everyone likes to think, no, sometimes hatred and isolation are deeper, they are more human, we show that these boys are us and us. Society has left them behind and the consequences are terrifying and real. <br /> <br /> Respect and love your neighbor. A lesson that we all should learn, thank you very much for making this film, Mr. Coccio, I hope that with great anticipation you will continue your film career.
