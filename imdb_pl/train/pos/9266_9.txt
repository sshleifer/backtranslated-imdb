Ah, the best and the funniest movie about women football fans, just a bit better than the teenage saga of 1982 in North London. Incidentally, I just watched it in movie 4 [2008-12-21] and ruin my inability to set PVR). <br /> <br /> This is my second favorite football movie after "Mike Bassett: England Manager", but this time with an additional accent to look like a guerrilla movie from a band that apparently continues to make films that are banned in the country, they are created (think only about where the girls are) taken from the stadium, just like the sun sets: quick reactions around). <br /> <br /> It's rare for a movie to make me laugh, but when a country soldier escorts an avalanche girl, forcing her to wear a buttoned mask from Ali Daei's poster, I could not stop waking up at home with my snorts, especially when the young soldier misunderstood the grandfather's call to help ... <br /> <br /> Speaking of toilets, I would just say farsi that I could write a letter on the walls of the toilet (yes, there were some scribbles in Roman magazines, but in most of them related to American rock band wagons). <br /> <br /> Also in the village and Farsi topic, do not you think that Omid Djalili sounds like a yokel when it says Farsi? Listen to the sergeant in this movie, and then "Yup." <br /> <br /> I will not be bored about Iran's sexual politics and I will not be bored of doubtful acting; my love for this film comes from the script and editing: top-class materials. <br /> <br /> Here is a list of my favorite football movies: 1. Mike Bassett, England Manager 2. Offside 3. Those Glory Glory Days 4. A Shot at Glory 5. The Secret of Arsenal Stadium
