I just finished watching the 139-min version (panoramic) with a few friends and we were delighted. I do not bother repeating what others have said. What the filmmakers are doing with this concept is unexpected and fun. The huge battle is exhausting. Then we were stunned when we discovered that it was still almost 30 minutes, but that did not stop us from total involvement and entertainment. <br /> <br /> There is one thing that almost ruined it and it was a terrible music / song. Blues, Country / Folk and Rock Ballads do not belong here and every time we use them, we all burst into laughter. It's hideous. You have been warned, but history and storytelling make you grounded. <br /> <br /> There are several outstanding moments that make you appreciate talent behind the camera. There are many uses of silence and slow motion photography that work beautifully. I really want to be able to erase the music, but unfortunately. <br /> <br /> Look for this. It's fun, it's different and leads to places you would not expect, and it's very refreshing.
