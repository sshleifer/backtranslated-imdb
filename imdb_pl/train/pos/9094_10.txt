I saw this independent movie when he was in Philadelphia and it was a nice surprise. I left the theater with a smile on my face. One of the things that made it so funny was that it was based on a real story - fun! It also has some great actors in it. Mindy Sterling is in it and is very good. I loved her at Austin Powers. Howard Hesseman is also great. I remember him from the head of the class. I'm tired of all the dark movies that are still being made. It is fun and light, and I can watch it with my family and not be ashamed. I check when it appears on DVD. I will definitely buy it.
