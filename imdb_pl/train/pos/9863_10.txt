I thought that the ice age was a perfect movie! As a 30-year-old woman, without children, I still think that I really like these funny, witty animated films. Sid is the best character I've seen for some time, better than Bartok in Anastasia (though he was really funny and I did not think his character could be matched or even beaten) and even more humorous than Melman in Madagascar. I have seen this film at least 15 times (of course I have it) and I quote this film at work (on many occasions ... yes, still). My favorite scene is the one in which Sid says, "Oh, oh, oh, I love this game!" And Sid and Manny are still wondering what the squirrel is trying to tell them about "tigers" ... "A pack of wolves, a pack of bears, a pack of fleas , a pack of mustaches, a pack of noses, a pack of derma? a pack of lies, a packet of trouble, pack a package, a packet of birds, a packet of flying fish ... "or some part goes! This is the funniest part of the whole movie, although I really liked the humor of "putting sloths on the map" and many other parts. The only animated film that can be compared to the ice age is "Brother Bear".
