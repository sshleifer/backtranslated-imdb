Although this movie has some weaknesses, it's worth seeing. I chose him because of the cast and I applaud Bonham Carter and Branagh for choosing roles other than what they did in the past. Both present very restless people, along with warts, but they make them nice because of their humanity. The story is moving, but the performances are soaring. "Bonham Carter's" Jane "is an amazing achievement, the search for romance has opened my eyes to the aspects of being disabled, which I had not thought about before, but it was also interesting for other reasons. I felt that the film ended too abruptly, but better than the emotionally drawn ending (see "Stepmother"). A very real English setting gave me joy - England in the 90s, both urban and rural, without depression.
