ScareCrow was one of the funniest killers I've ever seen! Besides, he jumped most of the time, which was amazing! He also had a perfect voice, that is, he was perfect for him. The plot was also excellent. I like how the soul of the children was moved to ScareCrow, which was cool! And he had a reason to kill what I mean after what these people did to him ... I would be angry too! The ScareCrows look was really good! his gaze gives the person "OMG!" a reaction when they see him! Which was great, his looks were funny! These people were stupid who stared at each other for a long time! They should take a look at their lives ... although that would not matter!
