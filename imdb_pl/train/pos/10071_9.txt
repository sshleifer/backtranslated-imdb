When tradition demands that the artist communicate his great skills and magic to the heir, an aging and very proud street performer, known to everyone as the "King of Masks", desperately wants the young man to accept and cultivate. br /> <br /> His warmth and humanity, like him, pays a few dollars for a small person who has been replaced by devastating natural catastrophes of China, in this case huge floods in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> He takes his new 7-year-old companion to his straw boat to live with his esteemed and beautiful "General" monkey, only to discover that the child is a child. <br /> <br /> His life is immediately transformed because the love he feels for this little slave girl is intertwined with a stupid tradition that requires him to hand his art over to a young man. ... many people are touched, and the culture of China opens to our Western eye. Thousands of years of heritage boil down to a glass of drama, and few will leave this DVD with a dry eye. <br /> <br /> The technical transfer itself is not very good, because the sound level was everywhere and actually saw video transfer lines in several parts of the movie. I highly recommend :-) 9/10 stars.
