Michael Cacoyannis has a relatively long career, but has surprisingly few points to his name, including some real duds, such as the unpleasant satire of the Cold War The Day the Fish Came Out. Ifigenia is, however, the highlight. Adapted by Cacoyannis from Euripides' performance, it is a perfect reflection of the classic tragedy, and recently appeared for the first time on television for many years in the United States courtesy of Flix Channel. The film is shot on an epic scale, but it is definitely not a "big" movie with an emphasis on a simple story: in response to the gods, King Agamemnon (Kostas Kazakos) is forced to sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia (Tatiana Papamoschou) to the consternation of queen Clytemnastrae (Irene Papas ). Kazakos and Papas are outstanding, but this dazzling Papamoschou brings the most interesting elements to the screen, combining the innocence of childhood with the dawning awareness that he is a pawn in a political game. I highly recommend it for fans of international cinema.
