Fast, funny, sexy and spectacular. Cagney is always great. Blondel enchants you with her wit and energy. It is obvious that it is a film before censorship from the insinuation in the script, costumes and the way they come in contact. And a bikini in front of a bikini! This is not an obstacle for everyone. However, I do not understand the problem of John Garfield. Does it matter, is it in this movie? If it is, the screen is so short that it is basically a prop. You have to watch him frame by frame to even find him if he is there. I'm a big fan of Cagney, but I've never seen it before. I found this on Turner Classics. I found it through a miraculous accident. Sit back and enjoy the ride!
