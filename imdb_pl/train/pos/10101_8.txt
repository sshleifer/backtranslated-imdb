Dominion tank police is an exercise in contradictory film making. The plot in four parts combines thoughtless action, a humorous grip, touching humanity and thought provoking philosophical questions. It's hard to believe that there was only one director, because the style changes from episode to episode. A compulsory movie for anyone who likes anime.
