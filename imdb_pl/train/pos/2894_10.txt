As a young boy, I always hated Cinderella because I was voted by two sisters when my parents wondered what the Disney movie would buy. I wanted "Dumbo", but my sisters won, and we have "Cinderella." They liked the movie very much, while I sulked in the back of the room playing with their Star Wars figurines. <br /> <br /> Many things have changed since then. My love for Disney theme parks gave me an internship at Walt Disney World, and now I have two young nieces. I like showing them Disney as much as I can, and recently we watched Cinderella together. With my newly discovered appreciation of everything that is Disney, I watched Cinderella with a new perspective and was impressed with what I saw. <br /> <br /> However, from the beginning of the movie I did not fully understand why Cinderella was trapped in such a terrible position. Why was she a slave to her family and why could not she just escape? I was not very nice to Cinderella, but as the story progressed, I found myself in this story. Maybe eye-catching animation or happy characters have attracted me, or maybe they were timeless songs. Listening to songs such as "Bibbidy-Bobbidy-Boo" and "A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes" made me return to the theme parks. I can imagine myself in this carefree and fun atmosphere, looking at the inspiring Cinderella Castle. <br /> <br /> Something in this movie evokes the magic of Disney. It can make a lot of people mock, but go to Magic Kingdom and see all the little girls dressed as Cinderella, who are excited about this fantasy world, and you'll know what I'm talking about. Cinderella's paintings and a glass slipper - just like Mickey's Mouse, Winnie the Pooh and Tinkerbell - epitomize why Disney is one of the most beloved companies in the world. <br /> <br /> While Cinderella may not be the strongest story, it's a kind of iconic Disney story and movie. It represents a funny, idealistic and fantastic astonishment that we had in our childhood. I imagine that this movie has many meanings for many, many people. Maybe this is not my favorite Disney movie, but it represents everything I love and admire in the company. <br /> <br /> My IMDb Rating: 10/10. My Yahoo! Rating: A (outstanding)
