This movie has a great style, fantastic visuals and hot sex scenes with a beautiful woman. It ends up failing because the twists and turns become a bit extreme ... but in general, I recommend this movie only because it has a good old Russian feeling ... big, impressive, powerful, gloomy and brutal and at the same a time of beauty in the old tradition of tragic beauty. <br /> <br /> PLOT: A guy who can throw away the blade of his own will (not a spoiler because they show him in the trailer) when he is REALLY mad at you that you are trying to have a girlfriend ... he discovers that after killing one hand with a sword, it's hard to keep a stable relationship .... <br /> <br /> The sword boy is on the planet for some reason ... he just does not know what it is ... YET. <br /> <br /> Many dark street fights with the boys are unexpectedly fascinated creatively. <br /> <br /> RUSSAIN in POL inscriptions ... slick worth seeing ..
