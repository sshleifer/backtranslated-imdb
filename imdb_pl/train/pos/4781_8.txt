MULHOLLAND DRIVE made me a strong fan of David Lynch. He is a modern genius because he is not just a filmmaker. His stories and style have a spell that permeates the screen. So THE STRAIGHT STORY was a big surprise for me because it was easy to follow the story and the solar sets. Nevertheless, Lynch is there, and although it is far from his best, it is a film that can not be missed. Richard Farnsworth's late performance is one of the reasons. <br /> <br /> 8/10
