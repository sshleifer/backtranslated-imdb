Master Blackmailer, based on the short story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle "Adventure of Charles August Milverton", is the first story of Sherlock Holmes with Jeremy Brett, whom I saw. The story is interesting and dark. The film is a bit gloomy, but it is quite funny (with a few particularly funny scenes). <br /> <br /> * Spoilers * Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson are trying to discover the identity of an illusory blackmailer who ruins some of England's most famous families by publishing private letters that will ruin their lives in one way or another. In the end, they find out that it was Charles Augustus Milverton, the "art dealer", after some tragic consequences for victims who could not pay. Our heroes must then help Lady Eva Blackwell, who must pay a sum that is out of her means, otherwise her coming marriage will certainly be canceled. The scene in which Holmes and Watson break into Milverton's house is intense. Although the film has a generally happy ending, the tone is sad and pathetic. <br /> <br /> Outstanding performances by Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke (as usual) and Robert Hardy as the infamous villain (most viewers probably recognize him today as Cornelius Fudge in Harry Potter), Serena Gordon as Lady Eva Blackwell , Norma West as Lady Swinstead and Sophie Thomson as Agatha (scenes with her and Holmes are riots). I give him *** 1/2 of *****. My only complaint is that there was not enough inspector Lestrade. (I would like them to add in the scene at the end of a short story, where they give a description of two burglars, one of which suits Watson).
