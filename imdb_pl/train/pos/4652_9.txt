I think this movie is well made and realistic. You're used to watching Hollywood action movies and you use this as a standard to judge this movie, you'll be disappointed. This film is much closer to real life than 95% of what Hollywood can produce, and that's what raises it above the average action movie. I have no experience with the Swedish army and therefore I can not point out any mistakes in the way I act. But because I've seen that "creation" is additional, I'm convinced that much has been done to avoid mistakes. This is a movie that I recommend to others to watch. High quality realistic story and movie.
