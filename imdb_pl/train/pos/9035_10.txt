Acting in this movie was great. As a rocket amateur, I found very few mistakes. As a man, he touched my heart and soul. To watch actors, you would think that these are real characters. Laura Dern, my favorite actress, did not leave anything to her performance. Young actors playing Rocket Boys showed their talent beyond their years, especially young Homer. Homer's father inspired this eternal love / hate relationship between father and son to be true. If you do not get a lump in your throat or spill your tears when your first successful rocket rises or your father and son come to an agreement, check your pulse (you may be dead).
