I saw this movie for the first time 40 years ago on TV N.Y. and I thought it was a depressing look at the future. Wells sees the restriction of private freedom as a good thing. ("No private planes." 30-year war in the film was the reason why the film was not shown to British viewers during the war. Korda and Co.'s concept of the future and the concept of the future The future is the real movie star. Ralph Richardson as Boss is the best actor to perform. The combination of Winston Churchill and Edina from the comedy series Absolutely Fabulous. It is noteworthy that the negative personality of the boss is somewhat similar to the Churchill war period.
