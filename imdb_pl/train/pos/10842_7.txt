Instead, I rented "Still Crazy". When I described Hardcore Logo to a guy from the video store, he said it sounded like Still Crazy. So I hired her. Was I disappointed? Well, yes, because Still Crazy focuses on the classic rock band, not on the punk band, but it's okay. Still Crazy tells the story of Strange Fruit, a rock band that broke up in the 70s at the peak of popularity at the big rock festival. Twenty years later, all members of the band are fighting for maintenance and have the opportunity to play a concert in the twenty years of this festival. They make an offer and decide to reform permanently, traveling around Europe. There is quite a funny hijinks and all characters undergo subtle changes. By watching this movie, you feel more like a viewer of a carefully edited document than a participant. And it is not bad at all.
