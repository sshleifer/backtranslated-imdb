This film shows life in northern Cameroon from the perspective of a young French woman, France Dalens, whose father is an official of the colonial (French) government and whose family is one of the few white families in the area. It gives a sense of what life was like for both colonists and natives who they associated with. This is in line with another film that I saw about Africa in a similar period of time (Nirgendwo in Afrika (2001)), but I have no idea how realistic or typical it is. It's not just an impression - everything happens in the movie - but the story is understated. The viewer remains to draw his own conclusions, instead of forcing the filmmakers to impose on him, although storytelling as a retrospection from a woman's visit to southwestern Cameroon as an adult provides a certain perspective.
