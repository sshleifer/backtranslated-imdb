Darkly scanner, minority report, Blade Runner, Sin City and Sky Captain and the world of tomorrow? if you're a fan of any of them, it's worth checking. <br /> <br /> The French animation project "Renaissance" needed seven years to get a modest budget, and tonight I saw him in a private screening at the International Film Festival in Stockholm. My spontaneous reaction is respect; my further reflection is "huh, neat", and a closer analysis, unfortunately, produces loud "meh". This is a great science fiction triumph on the surface, but outline it and even poke it a bit, and its unnecessarily complicated plot becomes grossly visible, just like flat characters. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it is obvious that people in Onyx films did something spectacular on the surface. The visualizations are stunning. They used the function of capturing live motion, suited to the animation of key frames, with sharp black and light white contrasts and a strongly shaded background with a rotoscope. For those of you who have nothing to do with "technical language", the movie looks like a fully animated Sin City. Its smooth, transparent, dark and stylized template is completed with great lightning. It's a vision. However, a lot of merits also deserves a clear sound effect, which takes the form of futuristic noise, strained music, heavy raindrops and shards of glass. That's every wet dream tech-nerda ... <br /> <br /> The movie brings you to an incredibly illuminated, gloomy, futurescape Paris, in which the main corporation called "Avalon" began to intertwine in the lives of citizens with supervision (think about liquid transparent screens from the Minority Report) and genetic engineering. The latter leads to the mysterious kidnapping of the young researcher Ilona (expressed by the charming Romola Garai). Move to our cooked-to-death and hero Karas (Daniel Craig) ?? a man who takes the law into his own hands? which was assigned the case of finding and recovering Ilona. In this case, Illona's sister helps him, with whom he also starts an affair. A very careless affair, if I can say that. <br /> <br /> The world of the Renaissance is extraordinary. Director Christian Volckman throws himself into a whirlwind of melodies, and the result is a city jungle full of boys, rats, femme fatales and lone detectives who hide in the shadow of dumpy slums. The problem is that the creators undoubtedly felt the need to have extremely clear and written archetypes in history, or the film would be "too surreal" for the mainstream of the audience, because of its horrific format of animation. It follows that we have a lot of stereotypical characters, such as villains, villains, capricious heads of crime and massacres of hard chicks who smoke every chance. It sticks into our faces and it is not necessary. <br /> <br /> What's worse, the dialogue is a bit invented. It seems that each line exists only because of the story's propulsion. It is nothing fatal, because the plot is so complicated when it starts to work that it needs a clear direction. Daniel Craig also helps here by introducing a senseless attitude to his hard character from the policeman. At some point in the Renaissance he is seen in a live car chase, which is certainly one of the most adrenaline and top-class film sequences. Unfortunately, the novelty of the sci-fi visualization disappeared after the chase after the car, and "Renasaina" could take advantage of being a bit shorter. In conclusion, a very interesting but flawed experience of a futuristic comic. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
