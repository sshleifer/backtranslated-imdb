Despite loving Rita Hayworth, finding the last few sequences of the film intriguing and appreciating some of the more subtle "symbolic" aspects of cinematography, "The Lady of Shanghai" did not work for me. I had a problem with most performances, the script and the overall structure. And in a film where most people talk to each other in different situations is a big problem. The Lady from Shanghai ended for me with a very low "C" or 7. <br /> <br /> The Lady from Shanghai is really all about the character of Orson Welles, Michael O'Hara. O'Hara sees Elsa "Rosalie" Bannister (Rita Hayworth) in Central Park on a carriage ride and hits her. Later he saves her from assault and she shines him. O'Hara is a sailor from Ireland, and Elsa, who travels around the world, has a yacht with her husband Arthur (Everett Sloane), a very well-known and powerful California attorney. They talk to O'Hara about working for them, despite his initial reservations - it seems to him and the audience that Elsa is looking for someone with whom he has an affair, and O'Hara does not want to get involved. <br /> <br /> Soon after starting work on his yacht, a strange man, George Grisby (Glenn Anders), who says that he is Arthur's partner, appears in the port and begins to cause trouble. Eventually, Grisby asks O'Hara to enter a very dubious and dangerous plan. Stupid, O'Hara agrees. Of course, it causes him a lot of trouble and eventually reveals many secrets. <br /> <br /> Maybe my problems with the movie are that until now I'm not exactly such a huge fan of Orson Welles and here he produces, writes, directs and consumes most of the time on the screen. I have not seen anywhere near most of Welles's works, but I had a tendency to like his later films better when he became a bit more camp and performative. For example, I love F for Fake (Vérités et mensonges, 1974), and even enjoy his performance at Casino Royale (1967), when he strangely insisted on doing magic baccarat at the baccarat table, but Citizen Kane (1941) never did much for me, even though he gave me 3 or 4 chances for years (including about a year ago, my grade was low 7 - the same as my current rating for a Shanghai lady). <br /> <br /> Welles's performance and the dialogue he wrote for him proved to be touched and pretentious to me. It's a little motormouth, a bit quirky and a bit monotonous - it seems to sound like it's read. His performance reminded me of what I saw in the version of Moby Dick Welles (mentioned on IMDb in 1999, but "finished" in 1971, You can also see her in Orson Welles: The One-Man Band (1995)), where it seems to just read in the camera and believe that it is by nature, incredibly dramatic. I'm also someone who hardly ever complains about accents, but somehow Welles manages to give his Irish accent a sound and pretentious influence on me. <br /> <br /> When it comes to other performances, I can only say that Hayworth did a great job. Of course it's great, which does not hurt. Lots of sweets. Like Welles, Sloane seemed a little touched and pretentious - I never bought his character, his handicap, and so on, and Anders is just quirky when the bizarre does not seem to fit. Welles often shoots him closely, and Anders almost always has an exaggerated, manic expression on his sweaty face. <br /> <br /> Structurally, the lady from Shanghai is very uneven. The first 50 minutes are extremely bland and soap opera, although in soap operas often approaches to them from winding diagonal sides. When Grisby introduces his schematic, things get a little better and most rise when we get to the end. But before The Lady from Shanghai becomes a crime / mystery film, it is too late and quickly turns into a drama before a sudden, thrilling ending that appears almost out of the blue and is too fast for its relative to be perfected. <br /> <br /> The ending is more action-oriented, less heavy dialogue, more varied and exotic in settings, and sometimes quite abstract. Welles skillfully deals with this combination of material as a director. If The Lady from Shanghai were to a large extent a combination of crime / mystery and artistic ending, it could easily be at least 9. The final scenes are easily 10s, because Welles moves from the Hitchcock scene of the suspense to the Chinese opera in San Francisco for the next scene suspense in the Chinese amusement park. The climax of the funhouse uses cinematography, which was experimental in those times. It is well integrated with the script because it allows for complex resolution and feeds a lot of symbolism. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is interesting, even if it usually can not compensate for the problems in the foreground. Welles blocks scenes with skills. There are many attractive scenes from Central Park to Acapulco and various locations in San Francisco. Welles effectively creates a symbolic background for his action, from the highlighted heights and steep drops of Acapulco to the labyrinthine streets of the Caribbean, the beautifully framed and the silhouette images of the San Francisco aquarium, and so on. The romance material, for which the Aquarium serves as one background, is interestingly mitigated by a kind of anxiety throughout the film, but on the other hand, it makes the romance never work so romantic. <br /> <br /> Certainly, serious Welles fans will certainly appreciate The Lady from Shanghai much more than me and of course it is worth watching if you love Rita Hayworth. In my opinion, the Shanghai Lady is not really a scary movie, but it is dangerously close to "passing." Proceed carefully.
