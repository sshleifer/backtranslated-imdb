That's easy 9. Michel Serrault, better known for his comical roles earlier in his acting career, is doing a stunning and even disturbingly stunning job of impersonating Dr. Petiot, the legendary serial French murderer. <br /> <br /> It's so credible at every moment of the movie that the actor completely disappears behind the character - only the best achieve this feat, and when they do, it's only in a handful of parts. > <br /> The whole story (a real story that happened in XXth century France) is so powerful, so ominous - it creates a very strong movie that you remember for a long, long time.
