Mary Poppins is definitely better, but it's still a beautiful movie. Angela Lansbury is wonderfully delicate like Engletine Price, and David Tomlinson has a great time as Mr. Brown. Their chemistry was simply brilliant. The children, however, lacked the same luster, although Paul is very funny and sweet. The songs were not as bad as some say, "Beautiful Briny Sea" is the best, in fact all songs are outstanding. The special effects were great, they had lots of magic, and the story is original enough. The most important, like Mary Poppins, were animated sequences. The underwater sequence was beautiful, but my favorite was a football match that was absolutely fun. The only other criticism was that I did not quite finish when I saw it for the first time. In conclusion, a beautiful movie that hardly ever appears. 8/10 Bethany Cox
