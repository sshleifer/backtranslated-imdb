If I was interested in Nancy Drew's book, I would make a book and read it. I'm not. Since I can remember, I've been reading people who are destroying movies because it was not a book. I'm sorry - in the digital era we can no longer watch flipcharts, but I'm sure you can still find some short silent movies in the form of a book. When the Lord of the Rings appeared, people complained. When the third one won an Oscar - "The book was better". When I watched To Kill and Mockingbird, "the book was better." Now many people are upset because Nancy Drew was not like this book. I'm not saying that Nancy Drew will win any Oscars - if it's one of those Nickelodeon Blimps or Kids Choice prizes at all. I'm saying to give the movie a break. It's a movie, not paper. As a film, I found Nancy Drew to be quite a good entertainment - starring Bruce Willis and Adam Goldberg (The Hebrew Hammer) and supporting roles with Tate Donovan (Jimmy Cooper at O.C.) and Rachel Leigh Cook (She's All That). I first saw Emma Roberts in the movie and to be honest, I like her job more than most Julia and Eric; its character remains consistent throughout the film and responds well to conflict. The relentless film in the spirit of Harriet the Spy is good from time to time. <br /> <br /> I give him ten stars because I really enjoyed the movie, I'd like to see him again and probably buy it on a DVD edition.
