I have never seen four hours to go as fast as when I saw this movie. This movie restores Hamlet's power and art that he always had. Even such famous speeches take place in a new and ingenious way. And the cast is amazing, Brannagh the brightest star. It is his charisma, strength and commanding role that defines the film. The creation of the full and complete version fills so many holes and allows for a new appreciation of the tragedy despite the length. Where we can expect a dark, gloomy castle, we are treated to a sumptuous feast for the eyes. The only darkness comes from Hamlet himself, as he should. It's worth spending your time, all four hours.
