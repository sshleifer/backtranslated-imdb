I was about 12 years old when I saw this classic cartoon 'Casper the Friendly Ghost'. I thought it was one of the first, because Casper did not look good *, just as Porky Pig does not look good * in the old fairy tales from the 1930s. But digression ... <br /> <br /> In any case, this episode in the afterlife of an apparent phantom involves making friends with the young fox todd, whom he calls Ferdie. I remember that I was happy to see that Casper had a friend, because those who watched fairy tales know that most people run away from him, shouting "Ghost!" <br /> <br /> Casper and Ferdie are having fun together, until someone else appears ... I hate to leave you with a half-spoiler, but the cartoon has only seven minutes, so you can not be too ambiguous. In addition, anyone who reads the IMDb animation summary can deduce what is going on ... <br /> <br /> The finale is a bit painful. In fact, this is probably the saddest thing I've ever seen on the cartoon. But that only means that it moved me, which probably explains why I decided to write a comment on this particular cartoon and not many others. Or the hell, the fact that I do NOT REMEMBER about this cartoon is due to its emotional impact on me - I have not seen it since. But the cartoon ends with a happy note and I was happy to see that Casper and Ferdie are happy again. <br /> <br /> I gave this cartoon 8 out of 10 stars. Second, after the Warner Bros. comic book. "Peace on Earth", this is most moved by the animated shortcut.
