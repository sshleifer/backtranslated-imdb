One of my favorite movies so far begins as an adventure through the wild side of a team of four men from Atlanta. The idea of ​​living on the Chulawasse River before transforming it into a lake comes from Lewis Burt Reynold, who unknowingly drowns his peasants in their worst nightmares. But if the first half of the movie appears to be like an action movie, the second half moves the viewer into a completely different story, and our people are forced to make a decision that (knowledge) changes their lives forever. In a very bad way. At the end of the film, every person will have to deal with scars, which were supposed to be just a weekend on the river, but they suppressed the struggle for survival. The film (except for a few fairly obvious fools) is very well directed and beautifully integrated into the paradise of nature, which steals breath. Photography is also perfect. Voight, Reynolds, Cox and Beatty perfectly show how a single event can destroy in various ways four different lives related only to the same mistake.
