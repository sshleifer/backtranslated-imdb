I am rather surprised that so far no reviewer has commented on the elementary chess joke in Luzhin as a white against a nameless opponent just before the final. Despite using Jonathan Speelman as an expert chess consultant, Luzhin manages to win the game with illegal movement. Between fast cuts and back to the board, it is not hard to see that after Luzhina's connection to the queen's dedication, his tower on d1 is still pinned by the black c1 tower against his king in the corner in h1. In this way, he is not able to play the alleged Rd1-d8 mating movement, which would be illegal - but he showed that he does it with the audience's delight.
