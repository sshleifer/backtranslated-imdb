Although the elements of the story "The Eighth Day" seem to be performed many times, the film still has many sparks, mysteries and symbolism, which had the first Jaco Van Dormal movie. Although not as good as "Toto the Hero", which will always remain on my favorite list, the film still leaves a lot of excitement. Daniel Auteil, since 2001 the tasteless "The Closet" belittles his role, fearing the abuse (rightly, the role could easily be ruined if the actor was too dramatic). I felt, however, that this part requires a bit more realism, focusing more on the character itself, and not only on character development. <br /> <br /> Do not enter this movie, expecting dark humor and unexpected twists and turns you got from "Toto the Hero" because you will be disappointed. However, the movie still serves as a decent, if not defective movie
