I remember Parker Posey in "As The World Turns" before becoming the Queen of the Independent film. In this film, Posey shows her potential as a leading actress. In this film, the supporting cast includes Omar Townsend as Moustafa, a Lebanese immigrant who works as a falafel vendor on the street who aspires to become a teacher. The cast has a great actress who plays her godmother and the only relative of the family, Judy, an old-fashioned librarian, devoted and menopausal. Posey as Mary learns that he needs to grow up and mature. Losing the position of a librarian officer makes her realize how much she misses the place in her life. Mary's life is surrounded by friends in the Lower East Side Village of New York before she was gentrified with yuppies. This movie is pretty good for independence and I came to enjoy Parker Posey as Mary and other characters from other movies.
