I can not tell you how much I love this movie. I have read reviews that say this movement is "too misleading" or "like swimming in drying concrete". I say that these reviewers have no imagination! For anyone who loves Fantasy Fiction, this movie is for you. If you've ever loved playing Dungeons & Dragons ... this movie is for you (especially if you got into Oriental Adventures), I'm sorry I did not see this movie on the big screen. (More motivation to get your own big screen t.v. :-)
