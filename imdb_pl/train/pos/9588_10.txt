When Paris Burning came out, I totally rejected her. I have not been in the whole phenomenon of Madonna and fashion. I thought he would be dingy and stupid. How wrong I was about this movie. I watched it after the movie was for ten years and I ran out and bought it. He took me back to the time and place of fun and excitement. I felt like I knew all the characters personally. The 1980s were spectacular, and the film captured the essence of gay culture. What a great job! I went to the Internet and found out what some of the original cast members were doing, but I could not locate them. If anyone has any information about cast members, let me know. <br /> <br /> I hope they will make another documentary. I LOVE IT
