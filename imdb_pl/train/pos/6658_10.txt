Mahatma was depicted as a man who neglected his son in this film. Do not get me wrong. I do not condemn the film; it's such a great movie and he left the cinema with a lump in his throat. We need to understand the spiritual position of Mahatma, he is a real spiritual leader. Only a fully enlightened man could break away from his loved ones. A man with such a caliber leads his family and followers by example. According to the film, he talked to his son and tried to understand where he came from, but poor Harilall could not understand his father with such a small intellect. When Harilall went wrong, Mahatma could remain calm and accept that his son was a great tragedy. <br /> <br /> If they were other parents, they would risk their values ​​to help their son get up. Mahatma did not do it, he is a real leader who leads by example.
