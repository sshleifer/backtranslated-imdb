He could not understand why Jeremy Irons thought it necessary to show the most disturbing accent, spoken by clenched teeth and behind his throat. In fact, he ruined the film and distracted me from what was probably his good performance (very annoying). No other actor or actress seemed to have such a clear accent, and although I always judged Jeremy Irons as a great actor, I would not classify this movie as one of his best. The film, however, sharpened my appetite, as did other comments on this film, which I found very interesting, and now I am going to read the book.
