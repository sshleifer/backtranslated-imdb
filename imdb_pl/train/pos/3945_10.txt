The rating is only 5, because it is a movie that could have used a better game and direction (or at least music!). However, for Walt Whitman's achievements he deserves the 10th. The previous poster calls him a bad film, but I think it is a simple case when we do not see a forest for trees. The creators of the film were apparently more interested in telling the story than the Hollywood feature film. And that's how I applaud - the fact that it's not mainstream also reflects Whitman's life. This film is more documentary than for acting. Being fascinated by such a story when you rarely hear about the type of stories that shape today's mental health is the most important thing. I consider it a very pleasant look at history.
