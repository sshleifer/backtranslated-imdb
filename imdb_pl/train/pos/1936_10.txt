this independent film was one of the best films at the high grass movie festival I've ever seen, I liked it a lot, there are so many things that were great in the film, except that the cast and the crew I had the opportunity The meeting was absolutely phenomenal . I thought that Avi did a great job in his role. and Ricky Ullman was absolutely faithful to his role as a Disney actor. I was amazed by his talent to be able to go from a tacky teenage comedy to such an adult role without any problems that the talent in the movie was simply amazing because the pictures were just great, you want to see an independent movie, you really should see. I think Mr Gruver would be so proud of such a submission at his festival, and his parents loved the movie so much that he won the audience favorite. and saw it again. it was a really great movie, it was dark and funny, sad and really emotional, it was just fantastic. I'm honestly just delighted with this movie and I really do not want to spoil it for anyone who sees it and I'm really surprised to find out that the creators really have what it takes to go to places and I hope to see more work from them in the future.
