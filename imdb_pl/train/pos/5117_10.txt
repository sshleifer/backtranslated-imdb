Very few films have influenced American culture in the way Urban Cowboy has. Thank God it was temporary. But UC is almost classy in itself as one of those movies that when you rotate channels at 3:00 you just can not take your eyes off ... my three best are Animal House and Walking Tall BTW, but this is unrelated to the topic. I remember that Urban Cowboy hit theaters and was too open, that honkytons were opening at every corner, men wore cowboy hats with their moccasins, and if you did not know how in two steps you were considered a social idiot! Personally, I think it's a great movie. Travolta really surprised me after SatNiteFever. Who would be stupid. He is also credible. The soundtrack is amazing. It is a pity that Charlene Tilton of television celebrity Dallas ruined Johnny Lee's career because this guy was just great. The show's host is Scott Glenn, who is the older ex-con redneck cowboy. And I do not mind a cowboy ex-cowboy, but I've always envied what I consider to be the greatest energy line of all time ... "Like" make my day "Clint. And looking at Sissa being patted around is the closest thing my Julia Roberts fantasy will do, yes ... As I said, beautiful. 9/10
