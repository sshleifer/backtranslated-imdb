Holes, originally a novel by Louis Sachar, has been successfully transformed into a fun and well-made film. In the main roles, Sigourney Weaver as the head, Shia Labeouf as Stanley and Khleo Thomas as Zero roles were very well manned, and the actors presented their roles well. he led to the end. The main story is Stanley Yelnats and his penalty for a year and a half in Camp Greenlake. The second story is about Sam and Kate Barlow. This thread is about racism and it is a deeper plot of the film. The third concerns Elya Yelnats and Madame Zeroni, who explains the 100-year curse on the Yelnats family. In my opinion, these stories have been very well connected. <br /> <br /> In contrast to the beliefs of many people, I think you do not have to read a book to understand the movie. The film is quite easy to understand. <br /> <br /> Acting in the film was well done, especially Shia Labeouf (Stanley), Khleo Thomas (Zero), Sigourney Weaver (head) and Jon Voight (Mr. Other members of D-Tent, Jake Smith (Squid), Max Kasch (Zig-Zag), Miguel Castro (Magnet), Byron Cotton (Armpit) and Brenden Jefferson (X-Ray) have enriched the comic relief of the film. However, the best parts are Zero and Stanley, who created a great team. <br /> <br /> Although Holes is a Disney movie, it deals with serious problems such as racism, shooting and violence. The dramatization of the film at some moments is very well done. <br /> <br /> I would suggest this movie to people of all ages, regardless of whether they read the book. You should not miss it.
