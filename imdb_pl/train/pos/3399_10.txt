It was the 101st film by Eddie Robinson and his latest film. He died of cancer nine days after shooting. All this makes its key scene in the film all the more moving. <br /> <br /> Although some styles of hair and clothing are a bit outdated (pay attention to the video game shown in the movie), but the theme of the film is timeless. Heston said he wanted to make this movie for a while, because he really believed in the dangers of overpopulation. <br /> <br /> Several things make this film a classic. The story is solid. <br /> <br /> The acting is at the highest level, especially the game between Heston and Robinson, with nice performances also by Cotten and Peters. <br /> <br /> The music is absolutely perfect. Compilation of Beethoven, Grieg and Tchaikovsky combined with pastoral visual elements makes some really moving scenes. It was the icing on the cake for the movie. <br /> <br /> And the topic (or "point") of the movie is significant. Yes, it is a film about overpopulation, but on a more important note this is a warning about what can go wrong with man's management of the Earth. Under the text is the real message of the film. Pay attention to what Sol says about the "ancient times" of the past (which is our present), and pay attention to how Thorn can not understand what Sol says. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of my best science fiction movies of all time.
