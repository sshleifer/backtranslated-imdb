Although the word megalemania is often used to describe Gene Kelly, and sometimes his dance is too stiff, you have to admit that a guy knows how to show a show. In America in Paris, he creates a choreography for some outstanding characters, some of which are stuck in the story, but are nevertheless amazing. (Check out Gene Kelly's "Get Out Of Bed Routine") <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly stars in GI, which is based in Paris, has been there to paint, he is soon a gigolo woman, but he really He LOVERS SOMEONE! The old story is certain, but the musical numbers record the performance here! I really liked Georges Guaryta's voice in this piece. His "Stairway to Paradise" and his duet with Le Gene on "S Wonderful" is wonderful. Oscar Levant and Leslie Caron can take or leave. In all, a pretty good, but not a dynamite movie.
