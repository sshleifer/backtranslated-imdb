"Home Room" was a total surprise. Having no idea what this was all about, it paid off very much, because there are no blows, and what we see changes lives by an act of an unsatisfied young man who decided to victimize his classmates who are the innocent victims of his hasty actions . <br /> <br /> Paul Ryan, a director who works and assembles his own material, is a talented man, rewarded by an amazing acting act. <br /> <br /> Alicia Browning is an older girl who is trying to graduate from high school. She has not been there for several years and it seems that she does not have the same wavelength as other students. First of all, she is a rebel with a punk look, a large make-up and lips that cut anyone who dares to approach her orbit. Alicia was among the students in the family room, in which nine students were killed, allegedly killed by her boyfriend. We realize that Alicia is a wounded girl who has had a terrible experience in her life, but we are not getting any hints about it. <br /> <br /> A tragedy follows. is focused on a young woman who has survived. Deanna Cartwright is a rich teenager who should not be at school at all. When it hit a ricochet, it is hospitalized with more than one wound. He tries to survive this dark period in his mind, but nightmares do not let her forget. <br /> <br /> Alicia is forced to go to the hospital by the headmaster. Because he does not cooperate with the police, the head of the school wants her to see Deanna in her terrible condition and maybe soften and tell the authorities what he knows. Alicia does not like Deanna, but in a few days both girls will make a room. Until the last sequence, we do not realize what really happened on this terrible day at school. <br /> <br /> Busy Phillips makes excellent Alicia and Erika Christiansen as good as Deanna. Victor Garber, James Pinkins, Taylor Holland and the rest of the cast play as a band. <br /> <br /> The film is very intense because it is not clear in showing how the shooting took place, which helps the tone that Mr. Ryan wanted to give the film.
