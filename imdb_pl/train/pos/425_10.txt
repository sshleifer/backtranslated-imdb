I would like to comment on the April Love movie. This is one of my favorite times because my father, Nelson Malone, plays a horse trainer. I remember clearly when Hollywood arrived in Lexington, KY, where we lived at the time to make April Love. My father took part in numerous plays and was a talented man. I persuaded him to try one of the offered parts, and here he came home with the script. How exciting! In addition, many of my classmates were in the crowd stages - especially those shown in the theme park. It's very nostalgic every year in April, when I see a movie screened once again, and the April Love song by Pat Boone is still being played on the radio. A timeless and reminiscent of times gone by when you see movies that they do today with all sex, vulgar language and violence. It would be refreshing to see more films like April Love coming back to the bottom ...
