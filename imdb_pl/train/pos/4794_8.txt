Going through David Lynch's eccentricity requires patience, but ... for a change - the life chronicle of Alvin Straight's journey, but stick to it. Although he moves as slowly as John Deere Straight, when he meets strangers on his pilgrimage, we learn a lot about the isolation of aging, painful regrets and secrets, and ultimately about the power of the family and reconciliation. Richard Farnsworth limits his career to the most authentic performance of the year, sad and poetic, gentle and caring. And Sissy Spacek matches him to his "slow" daughter Rose, who is judging her private loss while taking care of her dad. It is rare for a contemporary film to be so positive about a family.
