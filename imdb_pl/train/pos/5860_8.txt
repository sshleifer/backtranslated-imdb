Pleasant game that offers a fun and easy game and the ability to play well. Staying true to the comic book and providing a low learning curve, this game offers something that is not present in most of the action cartridges today. In addition, the narrative and animated scenes used (although long animations are replaced by slideshows in the Nintendo 64 version) fully utilize the capabilities of the platforms.
