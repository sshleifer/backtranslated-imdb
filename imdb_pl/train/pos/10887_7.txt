Horror is filmed and things are not going well. It's a masked killer. The director talks about the killer before the cast and crew. It's crazy and it kills two people. He killed himself and the movie never ends. Twelve years later, a group of film students decides to try and end - but there is a curse. People who try to finish it are killing themselves. Students ignore this. Guess what will happen next? <br /> <br /> The plot is old, but it's not bad ... what it is (low-budget movie slasher). It is well done with a young and quite talented young cast. Nobody is wonderful, but nobody is terrible either. He also avoids the obligatory (and unnecessary) scenes of naked women. It moves quickly, the blood is pretty and bloody, and the script does not offend your intelligence. Also, Molly Ringwald is at a time when she has her own life playing a weird, faded actress. I give him 7.
