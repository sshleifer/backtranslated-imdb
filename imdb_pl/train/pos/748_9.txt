This is the year 2009 and the underestimated jewel thus lost nothing of the power it had 31 years ago. It combines a very wide range of different characters and stories without looking littered. <br /> <br /> Clothes and music may have changed over time, but in the end it's a story that will never lose its usefulness. And especially this movie does it quite well. Of course, it is sometimes tacky but very moving. <br /> <br /> The performance of Jodie Foster is striking and shows that she is a real-born actress who showed her true potential, especially in her earlier films. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this.
