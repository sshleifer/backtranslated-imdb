This is the biggest movie I've seen in 2002, while I'm used to mainstream movies. He is rich and creates a beautiful artistic act from these 11 short films. From technical information (selected directors) I was afraid that it would be an anti-American basis, but ... it is a kind (11 times) of personal homage. <br /> <br /> The weakest point comes from Y Chahine: he fails to "swallow his pride" and considers the event to be a well-deserved punishment ... It is really the weakest part of the film, but it shows true freedom of speech for the whole song. The strangest comes from a Mexican film about conceptual art ... I'm still not sure what Gonzalez Inarritu meant. 9 others are perfect (K. Loach, S. Penn, S. Makhmalbaf, ...) or almost perfect (C. Lelouch) and made me either smile or weep, and even left stunned. I still do not know if the tale of S. Imamura is really related to the September 11 disaster, but it is so pretty that its finale is deeply rooted "makes it".
