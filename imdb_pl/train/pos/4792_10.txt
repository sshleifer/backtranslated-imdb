The Straight Story is a multi-level exploration of America's goodness and beauty. On one level, a slow walk around the heart of the country, its nice inhabitants and amber grain, on another level about aging and remembering what is important (and actively forgetting what is not). David Lynch gives us time to make this movie and helps me remember that so much can be said in silence. An extraordinary movie that will accompany me for a while.
