It's a really well made movie. Sumitra Bhave has always created a sensational cinema and this is my favorite movie. This film should win the National Award and would be my choice to represent India at the Oscars. It is at least a thousand times better than "Shaaws", which will go to Oscars from India this year. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that information about this (and all other Indian films) on IMDb is missing, and sometimes even bad. Sadashiv Amrapurkar played a very important character in this movie, and he is not even recorded on these pages. The rest of the cast and crew are also not mentioned. Prizes and nominations for this film are not awarded even if Sonali Kulkarni won the Indian National Award for this film. There was not even one vote for "Doghi". <br /> <br /> "Doghi" is not a Hindi movie. This Marathi, fortunately escapes from the song and dance sequence, will not get caught up in brilliant glamor and half-clever design equipment. This is a true story, full of ghosts, a story created with rare understanding and respect. <br /> <br /> "Doghi", which can be roughly translated as "two women" is the story of two sisters, Gauri and Krishna. In fact, this is a very simple story, Sumitra Bhave does not go into many threads, which makes the film very difficult to make. The whole film is set in an indescribable remote village in Maharashtra, and the screen rarely goes far away from the home of two heroines. No aesthetic sunsets in this. <br /> <br /> The film opens and we get to know the whole house, which is getting ready for Gauri's wedding. Gauri and Krishna's father, working as a farmer, the house is full and happy; in their simple life, I do not want anything. However, on the eve of the wedding, future husband Gauri is facing a fatal accident. Gauri's father can not bear the tragic news and suffers a serious stroke. Without a strong working member, the house could fall apart, but Gauri's mother was responsible. He works as he can, but he can not make ends meet. But her life is still easier than Gauri. Superstitions that people are trying to forget without being convinced, make Gauri a bad lucky guy. He is an outcast from society. <br /> <br /> Mother Gauri writes to her brother. Desperately looking for help accepts his suggestion. He takes Gauri to Mumbai, where he is forced to work in brothels. Gauri sends home the money he earns and their conditions improve. Gauri gives his life for the life of his family. <br /> <br /> However, when Gauri returns home for Krishna's wedding, her mother does not go out to meet her. He does not allow Krishna with her and he does not allow Gauri in front of the guests. He loves Gauri, but he is afraid of Krishna's life. It completely destroys Gauri and decides to return to his unfortunate life. But Krishna runs out and holds Gauri. He begs his beloved sister to come back. Krishna promises to stand by her. Promises that they will face the world? together. <br /> <br /> There is nothing in this movie that you do not need. Everything is necessary and sufficient. Gauri is going to Mumbai, but you never say what he's doing there? subtle dialogues tell us what to know. This is just a naked story that is deep in its simplicity. <br /> <br /> "Doghi" is a responsible cinema. It is full of respect for the subject it deals with. He respects the audience? he does not consider them a mentally capable four-year-old. <br /> <br /> Acting is paramount. The direction is wonderful? silence moves the story forward in such a way that no words could have. The script is well researched. <br /> <br /> Anyone who values ​​good cinema certainly likes "Doghi".
