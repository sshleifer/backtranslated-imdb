When I went to see this movie, my expectations were really low, but I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> I thought I would watch boring teenagers, but in fact the plot is interesting and well made, the acting was somewhat convincing - especially from Melville, who really shows his talent in this film, and the battle scenes were - on the needs of a low-budget film - very well done. <br /> <br /> I think this movie deserves a wider audience than it received. It is a movie that the whole family can see - maybe not the smallest of children, because it contains quite rough scenes. A film about love and problems that can arise when you oppose your family. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is very similar to "Bend it like Beckham", but in reality I think it's better.
