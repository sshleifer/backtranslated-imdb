Originally conceived as a solo vehicle for Dudley Moore, "Not Only ... But Also", he saw his former collaborator "Beeyond The Fringe", Peter Cook, at the first show, and so well received that the BBC-2 controller insisted that will be from that every week. They were a classic comedic band - Cook was tall, handsome and witty, while Dudley was short, charismatic and musically talented. The sketch that brought the house had it in a pub, wearing flat hats and scarves, fantasizing about movie stars like Jane Russell and Greta Garbo. It remains one of the funniest skits of all time, and even when Cook is trotting, it keeps going well. <br /> <br /> These characters - Pete's idiot and even bigger Dud idiot - hit the right show, seen in a different environment, such as a zoo or art gallery. In the latter, crunchy sandwiches while discussing works of art. "This Leonardo Da Vinci ... I can not see a joke!" Says Dud. Pete points out that when he was unveiled for the first time, he probably had people in him. Dud almost suffocated because of his reprimand. "You really like these sandwiches!", Ad libs Cook. The couple rejected their humor in a way that was cheerful. The sketches themselves set new standards for comedy, standards that would not be matched by the time Monty Python appeared. <br /> <br /> With the increase in the popularity of the series, the quality of guests has also increased. For example, Peter Sellers and John Lennon, the latter depicting a filmed object based on his poem "Deaf Ted, Danoota, & Me". "One Leg Too Few" - he had Duda as "George Spigott" (the name was later re-used in the film "Bedazzled"), a one-legged man who jumps into the Cook's film office for audition in the role of "Tarzan". Cook tries to disappoint him. "I do not mind your right leg!", He says. "The problem is you do not have it either!" <br /> <br /> Dud interviewed the eccentric Sir Arthur Streeb-Greebling (Cook), who, when he did not teach crows to fly underwater, planned to open the restaurant "The Frog & The Peach". Another classic was "The Leaping Nuns" (again used in "Bedazzled"). But my favorite must be "Superthunderstingcar", a wickedly funny (and accurate) parody of "Thunderbirds" by Gerry and Sylwia Anderson. Pete and Dud played all the roles, the latter doing "Lady Penelope." Ludwig had Ludwig van Beethoven as the star of the TV series This Is Tom Jones. "The Immortal Bargo" was a documentary parody about the life of a lonely movie star "Emma Bargo". In an unforgettable moment, she rode through London, screaming through the loudspeaker: "I want to be alone!". <br /> <br /> Season 3 is "Poets Cornered" with stars like Ronnie Barker, Spike Milligan, Barry Humphries, Willie Rushton and others suspended over the tank. Each of them had to improvise the line of the poem, and anyone who did not do this rhyme was in nasty things. <br /> <br /> In total, three seasons were produced, produced (at different times) by Joe McGrath, Dick Clement and Jimmy Gilbert. Unfortunately, very few editions have survived. Worse, the scripts were also destroyed. This brings with it the conviction that this situation could have happened. <br /> <br /> The performance ended in 1970. The comics then hit Broadway, made the infamous tapes "Derek & Clive", but Cook's growing cook alcoholism overcame them. Eight years later, Cook announced that a new series was starting, but from his side it turned out that it was wishful thinking. His former partner was making films in America and he was not going to cooperate again with Cook (not at that time). <br /> <br /> The long enough material has been scraped for the BBC-2 repetition season in the early 1990s. As expected, some items did not hold up as well as others. Cook died in 1995. And as a tribute to B.B.C, he prepared a program compiled on the basis of various "Parkinson's" interviews and "Not only ... but also" programs. It ended properly, and Pete and Dud were in Heaven. "Bloody Hell!", Exclaimed the latter. Moore went through in 2002.
