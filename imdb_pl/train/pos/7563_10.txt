An independent function can now be seen as both a work of film art and a resume. Come in Broken and aggressively promoted, twenty minutes of short styles and enthusiasm. But is it good as a movie or does it only work as a demo piece? Ah, this is rub. <br /> <br /> Broken is the story of Bonnie Clayton, who is kidnapped after waking up from a terrible nightmare one night by a "sadistic stranger and his colorful dawn" (quote from the video box). When she is trapped, it becomes obvious that the hijackers know things she did not even know about herself. When they ask her, a soldier in black clothing shoots at his hideout trying to save her. Chaos follows. <br /> <br /> Luckily for us, director Alex Ferrari seems to know what he's doing, or at least he's very good at pretending. Broken does not suffer from a lack of visual talent, which is especially worth recommending given his budget and the lack of experience of all involved. What he suffers from is weak and is a kind of handwriting. Think Long Kiss Goodnight meets the Matrix, written ten minutes after reading the Fight Club. The good news for Ferrari and producer / writer Jorge Rodriguez is that the story elements are easily ignored for sweets shows. Is the story so important within 20 minutes to show the technical skills of its creators? No, not really. <br /> <br /> Although it would be unfair to neglect the negative aspects in light of the budget and length of the films. Broken is not a classic genre. The biggest problem was that it would actually work better as a full-length movie. The last "turn of the action" does not give you enough time to shock. If Ferrari had time to slow the firing of functions, the plot would seem less accidental and the movie more complete. Here is the chance. <br /> <br /> The Audio Broken presentation in Dolby Digital 5.1 is unmatched in the independent world. I have never heard such an aggressive surround with such a small function. The Matrix-inspired soundtrack is very rich and deep, shots have impact, and even dialogue affects spatial effects. From everything that is presented on this disc, it is the sound that praises the contemporary independent DVD production. The set includes the equally impressive Dolby 2.0 surround path, which is the default menu. <br /> <br /> Extras There are literally hours of creating functions on this disc. There are so many extras that I consider it unrealistic to list and describe each one of them here, still expecting my readers to continue reading. Regardless of what shortcomings may be, the DVD is unprecedented in terms of information resources. People who liked this film can learn everything about its production, including everything from concept art to a promotional campaign. People planning a separate movie can learn everything about these functions. <br /> <br /> The extras are divided into a categorical menu. These include: pre-production production, production, post-production, after a short, and biography of the cast and crew. From a critical point of view, I discovered that some sections were quite short. If they were changed to one descriptive function for each menu option, the navigation would be less frustrating because the cursor selects the upper selection by default each time you return to the main menu. This is, of course, only boring, but perhaps for future DVD releases, the filmmakers will take my advice to heart. <br /> <br /> He has six audio comments and hours of recordings of interviews and talented people, and despite the consonant of the seller, their true colors are shining. <br /> <br /> The desire to share your film secrets with anyone who picks up this DVD is quite generous. From the add-ons, I found out what editing and effects software is the most reliable and effective the camera brand creates the most professional look at the lowest price, even where cheap air weapons can be obtained. In addition, I received several alternative options in case I could not find any products used in this particular production. We would like the filmmakers not to read a book about it, watching this DVD. <br /> <br /> In general, I scored a short episode as 6 out of 10, but I would like to have the option of movie length potential and effort, because I would get 8 or 9 points in those fields. I recommend the DVD because of its features and as a perfect example of what can be done with just eight thousand US dollars. Those who buy DVDs may think of themselves as ghost producers for a larger project, because the more attention they devote to these guys, the more media the full-length version will receive.
