Although it was considered the best movie film about the difficulty of having a home in a country built (or bought) according to your specifications, this is not the first or last. In 1940, Jack Benny and Ann Sheridan were leaders in the film version of George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart's comedy GEORGE WASHINGTON SLEPT. And about fifteen years ago Shelly Long and Tom Hanks had an advantage in PIT MONEY. The first concerned moving to an eighteenth-century country house, which ... wanders, needs work. The latter relied on the construction of a dream home - in the late eighties. Although both films have their moments, both are not as good as BLANDINGS, which were based on an autobiographical novel of the same name. <br /> <br /> Jim Blandings and his wife Muriel (Cary Grant and Myrna Loy) are noticing the tight corners of their apartment that they share with their two daughters Joan and Betsy (Sharyn Moffett and Connie Marshall). Although Blandings has a good income as Director of Advertising (in 1948, he earns $ 15,000 a year, which is similar to earning $ 90,000 today) and lives in a luxury apartment - which he rents in New York that day! - feel that they should look for something better. He and Muriel go to the country (Connecticut) and soon find an old ruin, which both imagine that they can be repaired as the dream home they want. <br /> <br /> And they both fall into the financial hole, which buy land and construction can lead to. First of all, they are so stunned by the idea of ​​building a house that they do not pay attention to the warning from their wise, if cynical friend and lawyer Bill Cole (Melvin Douglas, in a nicely sardonic role). For example, Jim buys land from a Connecticut dealer (Ian Wolfe, quietly sucking chops), checking before double checking the correct cost of land in this part of Connecticut. Bill points out that he paid five or six thousand dollars more for land than he is worth. There are problems with water supply, which both Blandings simply do not think, such as hard and soft water - which leads to the water softening of Zis-Zis. They are convinced that the projects they have in mind and developed jointly with their architect (Reginald Denny) can not be cheaply rejected on the spur of the moment when Muriel decided to build a small turret that no one planned. <br /> <br /> The rising cost of the project is one thing that makes it difficult for Jim. He was appointed to serve the account "Wham" ("Spam" became a popular result of World War II, because society began to use it as a substitute for meat in the light of its success in the armed forces). Jim can not take care of it (he is not alone - one or two other managers have rummaged in front of him). He thinks the following piece of "poetry" (?): <br /> <br /> "This little pig went to the market, <br /> <br /> He was pink and cute like ham. <Br> <br /> He smiled in his tracks, <br /> <br /> When he gave him a siekiera - <br /> <br /> He knew he would end up as "Wham"! "<br /> <br /> His secretary looks at him as if he needs a simple jacket when he reads it! <br /> <br /> Jim is also more and more suspicious of Bill's attention to Muriel, although (in this case) Bill is innocent. But he's always around (Jim constantly forgets Bill is carefree, and that stops Jim and Muriel from making so many mistakes). All three have blunders, preferably when they are locked in a room in a half-built house, just like the men left for the day. They can not open the door, and Jim (in panic) tries to break the door by moving the battering ram. It breaks the window and the door opens itself. <br /> <br /> The film works quite satisfactorily, and all actors are clearly enjoying themselves. This is one movie that (despite the changing levels of prices and wages) really does not get old. After all, most Americans dream about having their own home and always have. <br /> <br /> A few years ago, a painting company used a great scene with Myrna Loy and Emory Parnell to make different rooms in connection with Parnell's painting. He carefully shows clear shades of red, blue, etc. He wants - even giving a polite Parnell a single thread for the right shade of blue. The ads suggested that the paint shop has a wide range of colors to choose from. They proudly named Loy "Mrs. Blandings' in the introduction of advertisements. You can imagine how Parnell, who does not make sense, cope later with the situation when Loy leaves him with his crew.
