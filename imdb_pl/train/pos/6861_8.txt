Comparing what Brian De Palma did in the '80s with what is now entertainment, his films still look better and better. "Dressed To Kill", "Blow Out", "Body Double", "Scarface" and "Carlito's Way" are excellent works of a film craftsman at the height of his power. This is pure Hitchcock with 80 years of madness of perverse perversion, affectionately told tale of lust and murder with lots of twists, huge style support, stunning result of Pino Donaggia and cheesy giallo storyline. working with the camera and juicy, blood-smeared visuals help to beat the logical holes, while great performances by Dennis Franz, Keith Gordon (good director), Nancy Allen (then de Palma wife) and Michael Caine make each stage unique Make the virtuoso take away You will be in a surreal, frightening, erotically charged odyssey, and you will enjoy every cage "Dressed To Kill".
