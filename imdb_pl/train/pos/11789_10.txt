Hello, this little movie is interesting especially for an artist, filmmaker or creator of a music or visual artist, because: <br /> <br /> You can feel and explore David's touch / style straight from a short piece of relatives simplicity. <br /> <br /> You can see the rhythmic intervals between arrows, pans and sound elements. <br /> <br /> Even as a simple movie, this creation is a multy layer. For example, some sounds that drone all the time, while others appear (although subtle), at some points to handle some of the pictures. <br /> <br /> You can also see several types of frying pans: some go up and down in a gentle way. It is the diagonal of the pan. Sometimes they also return there and back. <br /> <br /> The lightning and composition / arrangement of elements in space is, as usual and obviously, the work of a painter / artist. You can feel it even in this shitty room. That means: you can create unique art thanks to the simple art of placing the look / view and composing the scene. Then comes time for visualizations: like digonals, parallels, etc. Light degradation and colors, although without too much searching for textures, like in big productions, are also fine. This is the type of the artist's sketch ... <br /> <br /> All this is not calculated, but made with an inner feeling and this feeling gives the touch / touch of David, as with any real artist.
