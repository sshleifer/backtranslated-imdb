I saw this movie yesterday at Turner and I could not stop watching until it was over, although I could guess what would happen. Farrell was great in his role, and everyone else did a great job. Some of them seemed to stretch the borders, but I liked it all in all !! If you have a chance to see it, do it! Actually, I cried for a few scenes, but then I guess you would be a mum. Loretta is beautiful, and I was surprised by the very idea of ​​being unmarried mothers there, it seemed to be ahead of her time. I say: SEE, if you can, and do not listen to criticism. As they say, I laughed, I cried! I liked it very much!
