A small funny movie. This is completely unbelievable, unbelievable, impossible. But the funny thing is that an introvert masochist can become completely dependent and hypnotized, and even hypnotized by a girl he hardly knows, but who was able to fall into his fantasies. Of course, this is a condemnation of stupid transactions that you can get on the Internet. You must not believe in ten percent of what has been said to you, and never, never consent to tie your hands in one way or another with someone or something or an organization you do not know personally. Most of their "companies" are in some way or other cheated and invaded. But here, the guy deserves a victim of such gangsters, because he is not only naive, he is absurdly stupid. But then the movie becomes funny because it ends up being a victim of an unfair business that has the advantage and ends up playing the same game with its victim and winning. One thing is also certain. Security at English airports is not exactly what it should be, but I think that nowhere else in the world is better and even now has tightened all rules and regulations, it is just good to go through their procedures and systematically thwart them. Then they have vengeance, losing luggage, a real plague in modern airports and do not expect fair compensation. Or even confiscate a bottle opener or can opener because it can be dangerous. I see myself cutting across the side of the plane with a can opener. Funny, right?
