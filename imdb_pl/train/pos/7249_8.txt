It is difficult for me to assign a "fair" number of stars to this film, but I decided on 8 due to high production values ​​and what in 1968 was an innovative approach to the war movie. Also, remember that I have not seen it since 1969. But it made a strong impression. <br /> <br /> The Long Day's Dying must be one of the liveliest anti-war movies ever made. This simply accomplishes by presenting in a very realistic way the activities of a handful of soldiers in North-Western Europe in 1944-45. No film before it showed a war at infantry level with such brutal details, all in a cool, dispassionate way that allows actions to speak for themselves. There is no proclamation, no sentiment, no comic relief, no complicated scenarios. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is also no subtlety. Partly because of their situation - trying to stay alive - the characters meet as flat, familiar phrases. As "entertainment", the movie does not do it, although it apparently was not intended for "entertainment". It was meant to fly you through the head with the misery and horror of World War II and modern war in general. It was twenty years before the platoon and thirty before Saving Private Ryan, both of which are much more "watching" films. Here flat and generally unpleasant characters, the lack of real plot and realistically unpleasant images (including what may be the first on the screen vomit in the history of the theater) make the film difficult to sit down, although it's only 95 minutes. <br /> <br /> So, 10 stars for production and realism, 4 stars for the feeling you will have when it's over, an extra star for having the heart in the right place. Average: 8. <br /> <br /> Like the underestimated "The Victors" by Carl Foreman, an equally slow but more interesting and provocative movie, The Long Day's Dying does not seem to be on DVD. Why not? Both films have been repeatedly on the cable.
