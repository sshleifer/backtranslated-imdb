Despite the excellent trailers for Vanilla Sky, I was expecting disappointment with this film because I heard that there are no great reviews. I left the cinema, however, with great admiration of how good Vanilla Sky is. <br /> <br /> There was no bad action in the whole movie, every character is credible. The romantic moments between the character of Cruise, David Aames and Cruz, Sophia, are shockingly realistic and intimate (probably due to the fact that they were soon real couples). <br /> <br /> The plot of Vanilla Sky will mislead you in the last third of the movie and there is a very small chance that you will guess the ending. The end, however, is connected to the end, leaving a strange mixture of feelings consisting of sadness, shock and empathy for David Aames. <br /> <br /> The film is intellectual and you have to pay attention to it. It's not that difficult, because chances are you'll be completely drawn into the movie and do not take your eyes off the screen for one second. <br /> <br /> I usually leave the cinema, forgetting about the movie I'm watching. But Vanilla Sky still stays in my mind a few days after watching. I recommend it to anyone who wants to change simple, shallow films.
