This is a great new crime series, combining the three old forces of British television (Denis Waterman, James Bolam and Alun Armstrong) as retired detectives brought in to help explain old cases under the leadership of a younger, career-focused Amanda Redman. Three strange, touchy old cops form a great team, using twenty years of detection methods in the police, which have since gone a long way - sometimes with the effect, sometimes to the dismay of senior officers. These three are presented with compassion, warts and everything. There are great comic scenes and some very moving ones, because each of them has to come to terms with the aging and heritage of their past. <br /> <br /> At the end of the first six-part series (we promise the next series next year), each character has evolved. Widower James Bolam can not accept the untimely death of his wife. Lothario Denis Waterman learns to accept his grandfather's role. And even obsessive Alun Armstrong helps his new friends fight the demons of their past - and take drugs! While Amanda Redman has to face too-well-known conflict between life and career. The plot lines are interesting, if they rather depend heavily on the wonders of DNA testing. But the interaction of the four best British actors made the series unacceptable.
