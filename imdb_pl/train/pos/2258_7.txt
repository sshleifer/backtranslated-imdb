I believe that Sarafina is a huge effort of Whoopi Goldberg. Apart from her, there are no other stars in the film, and her role is smaller than the title character, Sarafina. Since I work in high school with urban children, I think it is an important film showing the South African history of apartheid. Sarafina is a film about education and the teacher's relationship with her student Sarafina. I bought the video virtually for free on video. I watched it and rewound the music numbers quickly. But I definitely recommend this film to teachers and their students to understand. Now that I do not know other actors and actresses in the film, I assume that they are very popular in South Africa and I'm glad they filmed with the South African cast and crew, except for Goldberg in a small role, but if people watch this movie, Whoopi reaches out all over the world.
