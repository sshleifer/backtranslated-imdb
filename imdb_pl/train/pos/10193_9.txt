This review is dedicated to the late Keith Moon and John Entwistle. <br /> <br /> The original drum and bass. <br /> <br /> It seems that in these days there are very few Who's recordings more than it allows himself, now-days it tends to be a very different kind, which completely, with parody, a shadow of their (much) better years. To be honest, none of them has to prove anything to anyone, he deserves respect and overtime. <br /> <br /> This concert material for me is one of their best. To command an audience of about 400,000 plus strong foam, you need skill, charisma, wit and a whole lot of damn good music. <br /> <br /> We all know about other files on the list of The Doors (their last will ever show weeks before Jim Morrison's death), Moody Blues, Hendrix, Taste, Free and many more. The point is, whoever was there was the one most of them came to see. This program was a year after the Great Hippie Fest in 1960; Woodstock. The film and the album came out, like the greatest work by The Who so far, Tommy. The hungry crowd always wanted a taste to be able to experience their own unique event to be able to "Grove and Love" knowing that this concert was their own. To do this, you needed everything that Rock 'n Roll had to throw at the thirsty crowd. <br /> <br /> At two in the morning at the end of August 1970, M.C. announces, "Ladies and Gentlemen, a small Rock 'n Roll band from Shepherds Bush London," OO. " <br /> <br /> John Entwistle's coverall is made of black leather, the front is the outer line of the human skeleton from neck to toe, Roger wearing his traditional stage outfit with long cocks and long hair, Keith in white t-shirt and jeans, as Pete had his white overalls and Doc Martins, which he preferred to wear. <br /> <br /> The Who has never stopped the High Energy Rock attack for more than two hours, performing their biggest and other songs, such as Young Man Blues, Shaking 'All Over, and then in the queue, Keith lures songs to' Shut up, it's a bloody Opera "with Tommy, Rock Opera. Hell went crazy. That's what they heard, and who did not fail, straight on Overture and never appeared in the air, until the last note, "Tommy can you Hear me?". Incredible. <br /> <br /> To capture the show of this size band with such an increase at their peak at the Festival, which was to be the last of its kind anywhere in the world, was a fantastic piece of the History of Cinematography. <br /> <br /> The English DVD only appears in the soundtrack of English / Line PCM Stereo, just like in the States, I think you can get it at least with 5.1, "Check local press info for details?" on well. <br /> <br /> The duration of the DVD is 85 minutes with no extras, which is a disappointment. Yes, for a piece of Rock and Festival History this DVD will send you on a nostalgic journey through memory as soon as you hit the play, for some of the best concert recordings Who, how it was supposed to be, Live, Raw and on your face! <br /> <br /> I would give this DVD a ten, if not for the lack of 5.1, and some extras would be nice. <br /> <br /> Thanks to Roger, Pete, John and Keith.
