I've seen this movie twice with my teenagers who love him. This one should be iconic! The best line "Your dress is deeply cool!" Says Prince Cinderella. Kathleen Turner shines like a stepmother. I also like cars and motorcycles from the 1950s. The melancholic prince is a great departure from the typical swashbuckler. He tries to remain calm, but he does not hide his love for the fairy-tale princess. Her slipper is not glass (true to the original story), but Cinderella loses, but recovers it from the heir to the throne. My only complaint is that it is not shown anymore and it seems almost impossible to get. I hope that Blockbuster or Amazon will soon start to store this product.
