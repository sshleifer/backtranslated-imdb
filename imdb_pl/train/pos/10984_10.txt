One question that should be asked immediately is: would this film be made if the women in it were not the aunt and cousin of Jacqueline Lee Bouvier Kennedy Onassis? <br /> <br /> The answer is probably not. <Br /> <br /> But fortunately they are (or were) cousin and aunt Jackie. <br /> <br /> This movie of the Maysles brothers about existence (hard to call it life) Edith B. Beale, Jr. and her daughter Edith Bouvier Beale (Edie), have the same charm of the train wreck - you do not want to look, but you have to. <br /> <br /> Big Edith and Little Edie live in a once-magnificent mansion in East Hampton, New York, which is slowly falling apart around them. Once beautiful gardens are now jungles. <br /> <br /> A magnificent oil painting is based on a wall (with cat droppings on the floor behind them) and their beautiful portraits when young women compete for space on the walls next to the cover of old magazines. <br /> <br /> Living alone for many years, they broke many barriers between two women, but raised others. <br /> <br /> Clothing seems to be optional. Edie's favorite outfit is a pair of shorts with a snake pulled up over them, and pieces and cloths wrapped and fastened around her torso and head. <br /> <br /> As Edith says: "Edie is still beautiful at the age of 56". And it really is. There are times when it is almost shining and both women show the beauty that once was there. <br /> <br /> There is a constant flow of sexual tension. <br /> <br /> Their eating habits are (to be kind) weird. Ice cream on crackers. Edith birthday party with Wonder Bread sandwiches served on excellent porcelain with plastic dishes. <br /> <br /> Time does not matter in their world; as Edie says: "I do not have any clocks." <br /> <br /> Their relationship with men is so strange. <br /> <br /> Edie feels like Edith has thwarted all attempts at happiness. He says, "If you can not force a man to suggest you, you might as well be dead." To which Edith replies: "I will take the dog every day." <br /> <br /> It is obvious that Edith does not see his role in the absence of Edie's male association. At the beginning of the movie he says: "France fell, but Edie did not. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it is difficult to hear exactly what you are saying. Both women talk simultaneously and constantly argue with each other. <Br There is a strange relationship with animals in the film: Edie feeds the attic sheds with Wonder Bread and cat food, and cats (and there are many) are everywhere. <br /> <br /> At some point, Edie declares: "A characteristic feature of the aristocracy is responsibility." But it seems that they are unable to take responsibility for themselves. <br /> <br /> It is a difficult movie, but worth the effort.
