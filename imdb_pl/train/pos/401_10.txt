I just came back from Hong Kong for my summer vacation and saw the Legend of ZU. I thought it kicked * s! It was so creative and unique. It's a Crouching Dragon Hidden Tiger with a much smaller drama. Even if some people think that there are too many special effects (yes, good!), You can not complain about the cast. Zhang Ziyi and Cecilia Cheung are okay !!! Legend ZU ..... copies * s !!!!!!!!
