OK, let's explain it. I'm not really a science fiction fan, but for some reason I love Stargate SG-1. <br /> <br /> Jack O'Neil takes his SG-1 team through the gates. A round device that creates a wormhole. It gives you the opportunity to travel to distant worlds. It may sound like an ordinary science fiction series, but it is not! The plot is set today not in the distant millennium, like many other science fiction series. I think it's great. It gives you things, events and things that you can relate to, and you can jump into the series at any time without having to learn many new terms and names of all gadgets. Of course they have a little, but thanks to O'Neil, who likes to stick to simple terminology, there are not many. <br /> <br /> The series has a nice combination of action, humor and drama. If you like a lot of special effects, you will not find it here. They do not use a lot of bad, but a limited number of well-made special effects.
