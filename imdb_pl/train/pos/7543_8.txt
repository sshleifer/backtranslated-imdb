it is a visual adaptation of the manga with a very small dialogue. what dialogue appears in balloons with the word, as in the manga. the plot of this is existing, but only vaguely included. this is a manga edition, on which it is available in English in the collection of explosive books, "japan underground comics," and has actually signed a dialogue that explains the story a bit more than here. I recommend checking this volume if you liked it, because it explains part of the "story" of the movie, which is otherwise inexplicable. When it comes to animation, it's pretty decent, good unintentional use of computers and images is mostly well done. jumps in and jumps out of the episodes, as the heroes, cat and his dead old cat are wandering and emerging from a series of strange images: a boat, a circus, a desert. for only half an hour they go through a lot of half-threads and scenery, which leads me to believe that the director chose many problems with long-lasting manga to adjust them randomly, but most of all it was chosen visually. knowing what is happening, you can increase appreciation slightly. It reminds me mainly of the things that they played on the MTV TV show, cartoon sushi, in particular the short part depicting a cat chasing a house cut off with the buttock of a man. only in this case the cats look more like hello kitty, and their adventure expands to death and reincarnation and many other topics [though it is not so easy to say what's going on]. The DVD with this has a director's comment and "create" functions, but I can not comment on these because I have not been able to reach them. I'm giving 8/10 for now, here's not much to compare in the anime and I hope for a more similar one.
