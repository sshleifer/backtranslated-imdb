LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT was the first film I saw in 2000 and I doubt that I will see better this year. This beautiful tragicomedy by Belgian filmmaker Benoît Mariage takes place in the industrial wastes of Wallonia. Benoît Poelvoorde plays a father who desperately wants his son to win a car for him (Lada!). To do this, the son must break the record door. What my father really wants his son to be because he has never been known as a local news reporter for a newspaper ironically named L'Espoir (Hope). Of course, nothing works as planned. This film is best compared to Aki Kaurismäki's DRIFTING CLOUDS, although it is more dramatic and the mood is darker. Like in this movie, the tone is more melancholy than depressing and ending optimism, without being unrealistically happy. Humor is absurd, making the plot unbelievable, and Mariage finds stunning images in grim settings that never seem artificial. The best thing about LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT is Poelvoorde. The actor became famous for the iconic classic C'est ARRIVÉ PRÈS DE CHEZ VOUS, in which he played the charismatic hitman Ben. Since then, he has only played two small roles in films that have not been released in the Netherlands because, as he said in an interview, he was not convinced of his own acting abilities and all the roles he was offered were repetitions of Ben's character. After returning to the main role in the LCA there should be no doubt about his acting. He is simply brilliant as a stupid man and bad enough to put the family in poverty, but clever enough to realize what he did and to be torn by remorse. You must see.
