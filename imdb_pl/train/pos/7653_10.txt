The shot at the heart is wonderful. It perfectly illustrates the fate of Gary Gimore, condemned for the murder, who demanded death. A heartbeat shows the passion that the Gilmore family passed through, torn by hatred. This film is an amazing psychological study and is wonderfully depressing and uplifting. 10/10
