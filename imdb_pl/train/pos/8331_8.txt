this movie is a very relaxing, romantic comedy that is very pleasant. Meg Ryan does a very good job as the brilliant niece of Albert Einstein, although he believes in his own skills. Tim Robbins does just as good a job as a mechanic who falls in love with her when he walks into his shop with his fianc√© after the car crushes. I loved Walter Matthau as the only Albert Einstein. This film is just very relaxing and at the same time it has a certain degree of seriousness (if it is possible, it happens here). <br /> <br /> Personally, I think that this movie is extremely funny, especially old scientists - I thought they were great and fun! This film does not seem fully appreciated. If you have a brazen sense of humor, this movie is for you!
