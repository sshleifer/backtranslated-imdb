Great fun. I went with 8 friends to watch this movie. We came to see another, but after 10 minutes we were wondering what the hell we were in at the time, the jokes became funny and remained fun throughout the whole movie. In the first part you just ask about things "raspberry" and "bellini" (there are many other examples of this jargon), and because they repeat the same jokes (with different twists and turns), they become more fun and fun. In the search for this Malinski, all the main characters are introduced first, even more crazy than others. Until half the movie ended, we did not even know the name of the movie, because there were no initial credits, and we went to the preview, but we definitely had a good time. The house was loaded (about 250 people) and I think half of them did not like it, and the other half loved the movie. If you like weird comic movies with great dialogue, you'll love them. In addition to Clooney, this movie deserves a much better result than the 5.6 IMDB rating it has when I write it, but when more ppl sees it, I'm sure it will go up. 7.0 seems reasonable to me, I would give him 8 out of 10. (10 out of 10 after a few beers) <br /> <br />
