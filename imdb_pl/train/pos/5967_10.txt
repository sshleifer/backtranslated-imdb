Sammi, Curr, a metal god, tried to stop him, tried to ban him, tried to censor his music !! (as in real life Dee Snider from Twisted Sister, [Tipper Gore] or Ozzy Osborne) Killed in the fire, Sammi Cure was supposed to play at Halloween in his old high school for dancing .. Now Eddie Weinbauer, his # 1 fan and the only one who he knew what he was and what he felt (or maybe he?) Nuke, a DJ at a local radio station (Gene Simmons) has and gives the only copy of the last album Sammi Eddie .. But when Eddie tries to play back the disc, he discovers that Sammi he talks to him from the dead and tells him what to do back on the rascals in his school who hate him and his music ... Everything works until Sammi kills him !! A great movie and must be for fans of heavy metal band, with a great Fastway soundtrack and just in case, if you do not know what they sound like Fastway songs and do not like them, they changed their voice and style a bit, as well as sound like more known Cinderella, or Ratt .. Is the movie a real horror movie? Well, it depends on what you call a horror movie. For me, a real horror is a slasher, with a lot of killings or just terrifying ... This movie is not enough deaths, but you can not call it action, comedy, drama, suspense or thriller, so I guess it must be horror .. So if you want "Rock N 'Roll, Rockin' at night, steel, your soul !!" Than Sammi Curr and Trick or Treat is for you ... I mean "what are you afraid of? It's just Rock 'N' Roll!?! "
