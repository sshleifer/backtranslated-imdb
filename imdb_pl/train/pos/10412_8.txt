Baghdad robber is a treasure. First of all, this is a good story. Although my first exposure to this story by four children, the most famous story about Arabian Nights, comes from Disney Corporation, Baghdad Thief was interested in the end. History is moving at a good pace and includes two or two joints that reduce predictability. Sabu, who plays the young thief, Abu, also faces one of today's teenage actors in the appeal, judging by how I heard my eldest daughter say, "He's cute!" <br /> <br /> In 1940 The film won Oscars for photography and special effects. Today, of course, these effects seem very outdated ("Look, it's Barbie flying in the air," said my daughter at the sight of the flying genie). But they fit history well. In the end, the film is over 60 years old. The effects match the script. What's more, what they see in The Thief of Baghdad has remained almost at the highest level for the next twenty-five years. To see this, just compare the initial montage of the 1967 Star Trek episode. It was quite an achievement. <br /> <br /> It qualifies as a family movie, although there are some quarrels at the end. Acting is so obvious and the wounds are as bloodless as these scenes are almost as artificial as animation. <br /> <br /> In total, a funny movie worth watching either at the evening of pure entertainment or the historical value of the effects. I recommend it.
