A great movie, enough laughter and action for every audience. <br /> <br /> Since the last person who published this movie took a phone call to Woody Allen incest and did not comment on the movie, here I am. /> <br /> The film follows an unlikely duo, Johansson and Allen, who follow the clue given to them by the spirit of the recently deceased English reporter. Their search takes them to the killer's house and eventually to a somewhat tragic end. But do not be fooled by the story, the movie is really funny, and the acting is great. <br /> <br /> It seems that when the directors reach a certain age, they really do everything right. Clint Eastwood, Allen and Pollack seem to do the most imaginative work in their careers. In addition, by watching a movie in the theater of pacts, you can simply say that people really love Woody Allen and are ready to really come back. In the second moment the audience spread on the screen. There is something in this man and he really shines in Scoop. <br /> <br /> Check it is worth the trip.
