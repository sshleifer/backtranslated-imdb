First of all, this is an excellent series, although we have some effect from James Bond. My point is that while the new Casino Royale takes place in 2006, chronologically is the first adventure 007, and dr No (1962) is the second, while in the Golden Eye the first movie with Pierce Brosnan, Judi Dench. as a new deputy for the male "M", so how could it be at the beginning before Bond became a double 0, apart from the fact that it is clearly 14 years older? This is more or less a "poetic" license for emotions. We need to turn our heads a little if we want to have fun. No, the new Star Trek movie does not have any primitive electronics of the original series from nearly half a century ago. In the 1960s, instant messaging was a fantasy. (now we call them cell phones) and the levers were moved instead of the buttons. OMG, do you think they would improve Rogaine for Jean-Luc Picard in 400 years? Let's give the producers some freedom. <br /> <br /> But to try and standardize a bit, let's just think about creating a Cylon for 60 years before the end of Battlestar Galactica. If this is the case, where did all the Cylons who populated the original earth come from? We know that technology exists for spontaneous jumps through space. Well, what would happen if one of Cyclon's ships fighting Capric's fleet was shelled, or there was a sunspot or whatever, and one ship loaded with human Cylon was wrapped not only in space, but over time, a thousand or ten thousand years with a crippled ship near Ground One. They colonized him, discovered that they could re-populate him and eventually destroy him, but not before they sent a fleet of "rags" to look for the legendary Caprica, just to find a habitable but uninhabited planet they colonized to become people who eventually invented the Cylons. Paradox of time? Of course. Which one was first, chicken or road? Who cares? It's funny!
