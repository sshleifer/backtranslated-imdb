A bit slow (somehow in the movie Sofia Coppola), but still a very addictive movie about the discovery of sexuality by three teenage girls. The magic of the film lies in its ability to restore many memories of how it was to be their century. Confusion and uncertainty are presented in a very simple way, but so faithful to life. The music is perfect and the acting is amazing. The camera also works beautifully. I highly recommend it to those who are not afraid to look back at this particular period of life, when we discover our sexual impulses and our desires. I would also say that this is a great movie for young people going through this period. There have been so many films about growing up, but it really captures the real essence of exploring the world of adult romance and its complexity.
