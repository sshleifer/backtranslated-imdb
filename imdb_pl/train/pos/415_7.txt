The master of the film performance Cecil B. De Mille goes to the West. Using three legends of the old West as heroes (probably never met), Gary Cooper plays Wild Bill Hickock, James Ellison as Buffalo Bill, and Jean Arthur does a nice Calamity Jane. The tale only serves De Mille to hang great sequences of actions, such as a great Indian attack. Such scenes are extremely well made. If you do not mind a slightly higher cast performance, this is a very funny western. Look at the very young Anthony Quinn, who plays the role of a brave Indian who took part in the Battle of Little Big Horn. This part made him at least noticed him in Hollywood.
