What are the chances for a balloon balloon Helium from Yuba City, circa November 8, 1993, and landing 4 days later (November 12) in MERMAID, Prince Edward Island, Canada. nice). It's a great movie. It is based on a real story. This movie helps not only children to cope with losses, but also the elderly. I hope everyone will like it !!! Rhonda
