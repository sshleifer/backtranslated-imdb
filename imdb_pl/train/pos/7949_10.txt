SPOILERS ALERT <br /> <br /> Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey is an important movie of my life, because it is the first movie that I remember in the cinema of my hometown as a 4-year-old scamp. The story is based on Sheila Burnford's novel and is the reason why you can not write this one as a mindless Lassie clone. <br /> <br /> Basic story: Two dogs and a cat happily live in the Seaver Family, when the new husband of the mother of three children, gets a job in the city and have to temporarily move to inner San Francisco while the animals are sent to the ranch, to live for several months. Ties between animals and children, which they consider, and Shadow the golden retriever and Sassy the Himalayan cat are broken are very strong, as are children, although a young and lucky lucky American bulldog known as Chance is a little less disturbed and somewhat cynical (partly because of his voice explaining that he was abandoned as a puppy, taken to an animal shelter and bought by a family), although his development as a hero of the story provides a lot of important story. <br /> <br /> Three animals escape the ranch and go to a wide and dangerous desert (by the way fantastic settings of wild nature), driven by Shadow instincts. Along the way, they face several dangers, hoping to return home, while the ranch family and farmers are suddenly afraid of the disappearance of animals. There are hilarious moments all the time, a great dialogue between three animals and funny lines (see - unforgettable quotes) and a moving companion that grows between the main characters during the story, interrupted by moments of sadness (eg when Sassy's arrogance trying to cross the river without getting wet makes it fall into the river and drains from the waterfall, it leaves a moment of loss that is deeply felt by the viewers. <br /> <br /> Somehow, I do not see what the inclusion of saving a girl lost in the desert adds this story and the journey that They somehow seem a bit unnecessary as part of the story. Ending causes an increase in rates when the shadow falls into the bottom of the trainyard and after getting hurt the leg is difficult to get out and gives up, exhausted, and then Chance entering with him to convince him to leave, telling him how important he is to him and how he pushed them so far, that it should not be so easy to reject. <br /> <br /> The way this scene (well done) has not been completed, leaves the ambiguity that moves to the last scene when Chance and Sassy return home, but Shadow You can not see anywhere. Then, just as everything seems lost, it slowly appears and rejoins the family. Finally, Chance's application speaks of the friendship that has developed between him and his companions during the journey, and understanding what the house really is from his long journey leaves a good epilogue to show how much his character has grown, but also how the other two have. Wait a second, I think I'll cry ... <br /> <br /> In any case, I did not read Sheila Burnford's book, so I do not pretend to know where the differences between a book and a movie lie. But it is a movie that the whole family can watch, while while little ones will love talking animals, older viewers will understand the story better (as it was when I watched a movie after a few years without seeing it). This film is a masterpiece in the cinema and I suggest that if you have not seen it, you go out and get it! <br /> <br /> And please, avoid continuing (see my review for Homeward Bound II!)
