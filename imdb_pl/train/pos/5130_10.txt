... it may seem exaggerated, but it is not. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to understand - why did not they create such musical shorts? Was not the beauty of it obvious to everyone? I do not think so. So many shorts have been produced only for commercial reasons, and with any luck there may be some artistic value in them. This is one exception - the only one? - where it seems that they were a director, they had a vision and could clearly appreciate music as art. Why did not anyone think about making Lester or Charlie Parker live? Crazy, man. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that there were no sequels. If you've seen something of similar quality, share it!
