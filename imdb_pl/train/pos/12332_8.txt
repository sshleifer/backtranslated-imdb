After seeing the short marathon in horror a few times, I think it is a humorous parody that connects with the main point of reference. <br /> <br /> Although topics are rugged and outdated for today's viewers, this is by no means a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Although the student film does not justify it, the proof is that it seems to be done with little or no budget care. br /> <br /> As other reviewer noted, it is less than ten minutes, which is a lot of time to clear the palate of watching with a toast of joy, sit back and laze through the movie. <br /> <br /> I think that this short film should be happy with the title, and the viewer should relax with it.
