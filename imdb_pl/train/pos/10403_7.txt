It's an oriental fantasy of thousands and one Arab night - lots of amazing adventures, fantasies and wizards. The malicious vizier Jaffar (wonderfully played by Conrad Veidta) with the powerful magical abilities of Prince Ahamad of Baghdad (attractive John Justin), who loses the throne and then escapes thanks to a small thief named Abu (sympathetic Sabu). They come to Basora, where Ahamad and the princess (great June Duprez) fall in love. But the prince and thief visit Jaffar, Ahamd is blind, and Abu becomes a dog. The story gathers some fantastic ingredients, such as the transformation of the stars, flying horse mechanic, magic bow, flying carpet and of course a colossal gin (strain made by Rex Ingram), which gives three wishes to Sabu, the magical eye, the figure of the goddess Kali with several hands, among others . <br /> <br /> This amazing photo is one of the best fantasy films of all time. Produced by Alexandra Kord from London Fim and directed by the definitively awarded Ludwing Berger, Michael Powell and Tim Whelan with a stunning scenario by Lajos Biro and Miles Malleson. The outbreak of World War II caused a paralyzing shooting, and then the three brothers and collaborators of Kord left for the USA, continuing their shooting at Grand Cannon Colorado. Great pictures Technicolor, frame and FX have produced three Oscars: set design by William Cameron Menzies and Vincent Korda, photos by George Perinal and special effects by Osmond Borradaile, although today they are outdated and require urgent remastering, because the colors are worn out. In addition, one nomination for the evocative and oriental score of Miklos Rozsa. This vivid tale with huge doses of imagination will appeal to fantasy fans and classic cinema lovers
