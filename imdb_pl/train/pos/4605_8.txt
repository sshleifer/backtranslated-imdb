This is not just one of Jackie Khan's greatest films, but also one of the biggest kung-fu movies of all time. <br /> <br /> We came to expect crazy acrobatics and fast, creative action in Chan's movies, and this sets the benchmark for others. It's two hours of pure entertainment that delights all the way. <br /> <br /> In addition to a great action, we have a real story and credible characters, and Chan takes what seems more western. writing, mixing eastern methods of solving problems (ie kicking the butt). <br /> <br /> Generally it's fun, serious, fun and groundbreaking. A must for every kung fu fan, while remaining available to a wider circle of film communities.
