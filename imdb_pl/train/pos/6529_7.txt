I was forced to see it, because a) I have an 11-year-old girl and b) we showed her films Bonita Granville Nacy Drew from the thirties of the twentieth century, which she liked a lot. Personally, I did not think it was as much fun as movies from the 1930s, but on the other hand, it was not a disgusting piece of offensive intelligence that I was afraid of. It was a harmless, slightly entertaining movie. Although I'm glad they did not try to "improve" Nancy's hypnotism until the 21st century (Veronica Mars is called "Modern Nancy Drew"), I think they made it a bit too bland that it was not enough to develop Nancy Drew - the film could be titled "Jane Doe, Girl Detective". I have to blame the script: I think every actor did a good job with what he had to work with. I liked Emma Roberts in this role, but they gave her a TV version, not a cinema script ...
