I liked this movie and I had very low expectations due to all the negative reviews I read before I left. I went because I was curious about what's going on in all this fuss, because some of the comments were so mad at the movie and the Koreans. Oh, and from Korea, which has published some of my favorite movies. I liked the Host, but not my absolute favorite. Some of my favorite science-fiction / fantasy movies, thanks to which you can feel my taste: Mirrormask, Stardust, Serenity, Gattaca, Willow, Matrix, Resident Evil, LOTR, Stargate and Dark City series. <br /> <br /> It was not confusing, as everyone said, and the monsters looked good and the battles were great. There are a few holes in history, but it did not really matter. In a way, I'm tuning things up and stop asking why I've seen summer hits a long time ago. The Korean legend was interesting, the reincarnation was different and I thought that the main characters suspiciously dressed like Korean actors in other programs. Ethan's (Behr) hair looked so Asian. <br /> <br /> Yes, it can be better and I hope that in the future Korea, with its unusual bizarre sense of life, intense emotions and unexpected humor, can bring a bit of variety to the genre of hits. Maybe in the future a combination of Host Wars and Dragon Wars?
