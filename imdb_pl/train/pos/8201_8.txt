Sudden Impact is sometimes treated as Eastwood's artistic defeat at some point in his career, when he gained a good reputation as a director. The reason for this is not the movie itself, but the attitude towards vigilism that seems to support. In some places it owes more to Death Wish than to the original film of Dirty Harry. You can argue whether this is so - at the end of the day it is a film about feelings of guilt, justice and revenge. For me, at the end of the day, there is more empathy than compassion. However, because of all these arguments it is easy to overlook that a sudden hit is a terribly well made movie. Forget about "Go forward, make my stage of the day", it's iconic, but not original. But look at the views of San Francisco from the air, bringing the city closer. The first 15 or 20 minutes are quite spectacular. Or look at the brilliantly performed scene in which the character of Sondra Locke visits her mentally ill sister in the hospital. Eastwood makes a great use of facial combinations. All in all, Sudden Impact is a very visual film that really shows how mature Eastwood is a director. And if I remember correctly, it was the first time that Eastwood put it on screen, although in the action movie with a disputable ideology. I also think that this is the first well-made movie that Eastwood directed. Although Eastwood has a huge directing talent, dramaturgy has always been his weak spot (see Play Misty, Windy, etc. for me). The space of the narrative leads to the fact that the visual elements are well integrated with the film and do not distract him from the story. The only thing that is really annoying is the dog to fart.
