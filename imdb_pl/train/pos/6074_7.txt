Laurence Fishburne is a great actor and deserves respect for trying this, but he is not in the class with great Shakespeares like Olivier and Welles; and he still suffers from Kenneth Branagh. This Irishman, always brilliant, steals the show clean. Olivier recognized this potential in his production and cast Iago on someone he knew on stage. I did not realize the possibility of Iago, the most evil character of Shakespeare, but Branagh shows us the depths. Nice to see the sights of Venice.
