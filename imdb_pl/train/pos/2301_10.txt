Really ... and an amazing movie that, though not very popular ... extremely moving and almost changing life ... was at least for me. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing and buy ..... Added to my favorite list of movies .... is number one now .... <br /> <br /> It's a very moving movie that all people should see. <br /> <br /> Man in the Moon ..... we'll just be amazing. Now it's my favorite movie and I saw it today only and I recommend it to anyone who is over 15 years old, if you are a little mature ... If you really do not try to feel the characters' emotions, then you will never gain the true meaning and value of this movie. ... But it's really amazing ... just watch, because it will change the way some people look at life .... worth seeing 5/5
