The continuation of the popular Cinderella story reminded me a little about what they did with one of the Beauty & the Beast movies. That's basically three short stories in 1. <br /> <br /> OK, the mice are cute (I love Gus! It's so sweet!) And Lucifer is amazing (as usual). I also liked some of the newer characters (Pom Pom was charming, and I liked Prudence.). Even so, the plot was somewhat limited, but still very charming. So I'm voting 7/10.
