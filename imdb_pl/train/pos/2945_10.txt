I watched the movie several times in the 90s and almost parted my pages laughing every time. I love Eddie Murphy as an actor, but this performance is something else. He is so funny. Even P.C. the brigade would find it funny. You need to watch it, and even better if you have boys or girls for a drink. Michael Jackson's start is like him, if you close your eyes, you believe he's singing. The things he describes are loyal to life and seriously you would have to avoid humor if you thought it was not funny. My local video stores no longer share this video, but I would like to get a copy to show my husband and boys when they are mature enough to appreciate humor. In any case, I strongly recommend, I hope you like it.
