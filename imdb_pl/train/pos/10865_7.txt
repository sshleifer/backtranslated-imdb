This movie is great fun to watch if you love organized crime videos. Those who are looking for a crime movie with a charismatic hero with dreams of bad takeover, may be a bit disappointed with the way the movie is going. <br /> <br /> It's a game that can be persecuted by a criminal world, and if you're not familiar with Hong Kong movies, you can be pleasantly surprised by this movie. I was a bit disappointed with some of the choices made in a story, but overall a good crime movie. Some things did not make sense, but it seems that this is the norm for films from the East. <br /> <br /> People just randomly do things no matter how their personalities have been set before. It's a bit of an irritating pattern that permeates even in this movie.
