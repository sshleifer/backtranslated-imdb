It happened that this movie seemed much more complicated than it had to, but I think it's part of its charm. The observational abilities of detective Philo Vance seem to be greater than all oriental obsessions of the era combined when it comes to the final assessment of the murder. Dropping the dagger with a Chinese vase was a kick for me; I mean, could anyone not abandon it? <br /> <br /> Vance (William Powell) at the beginning of the movie had a line about "the psychological inability of Archera Coe" to kill himself - I had to think about it for a moment. I wondered if there really was any scientific basis for this concept to be true and not for psychology. It seems logical, but there is always a case that does not match the rules. <br /> <br /> You know, I got a kick from the upset coroner (Etienne Girardot), who reminded me Dr. Star Trek. McCoy said several times: "I am a doctor, not a magician" and "I am a doctor, not a detective". I can imagine DeForrest Kelley watching the movie and saying to himself: "I will have to use it one day". <br /> <br /> Once the killer's identity is revealed, it does not seem like a big surprise, but so far it's probably no one. But Archer and Brisbane Coe aside, the movie did not answer the main question posed by the title and murder I really was interested in - who killed Sir Thomas MacDonald Ghillie?
