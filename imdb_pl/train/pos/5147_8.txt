The first week of May, each year brings back the memories of the holocaust through films on the TV set. Among the many films they showed, it was the one I did not see. <br /> <br /> The story is about Hilter's life and how he came to power. It starts from childhood and ends with maintaining the highest position of power in Germany. <br /> <br /> The film was previously presented as a television series, and later transformed into a movie format. Scottish actor Robert Carlyle plays Adolf Hitler with great courage, conviction and flame to give a real picture of this man. <br /> <br /> This is a good script and narrative that educates the public about the main events that lead Hitler to power, and also tries to show the likely psychological composition of Hitler. Is the film a biased view of director Christian Duguay? who shows Hitler as a song, threatening, angry and screaming? who had such a strong influence on the Germans and the people around him. Hitler is not shown as someone having a charishma and a train, and there the movie does not convince Hitler's image. <br /> <br /> Although the venture was about television, all production components are first class and on a par with every main stream film. The value of production, sets, costumes, etc. They were perfect. <br /> <br /> There are many criticisms of this film in the authenticity of the historical events presented. But still the movie is thrilling, addictive and funny. Robert Carlyle overpowers and dominates the screen like no other. He is amazingly good? excellent! I would like a more balanced view of Hitler's life, because I think that Hitler was able to bring out the dormant feelings of millions of Germans and not only he should be blamed for the Holocaust. As I have said several times that ?? unfortunately, our society loves a garland or prosecution of one person, respectively, as a representative of the good or evil of society.
