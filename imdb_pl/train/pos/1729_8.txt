In 1943, a group of RAF officers, including Eric Wiiliams, decided to escape from the POW camp using the Gymnastic Horse in the courtyard. In 1950, it was decided to make his account, and this started a kind of British film genre - the history of the military prison that reached its apogee in Danger Within (1959). <br /> <br /> A wooden horse is one of the quietest movies I've ever watched. There are no dramatic moments, but a stable plot finally leads to a climax that is more tense because history does not give way to unbelievable dramas, cuts or jumps (something happens!) To music. It is absolutely time and works beautifully. <br /> <br /> Leo Glenn, Anthony Steel and David Tomlinson lead an interestingly low cast of extras and (suspected) non-actors. Without exception, all are constantly mono-tonal and quiet. They keep emotions outside their roles. Because until recently there were so many ex-services, I suspect that they recreated their war roles as "Officers and gentlemen". <br /> <br /> This emotionless approach does not diminish any dramatic tension. On the contrary, unlike most war films, history does not end with barbed wire: this fact alone sticks me to the end.
