My discovery of Jan Svankmajer's cinema opened my eyes to the whole tradition of Czech animation, of which Jir√≠ Trnka was a pioneer. His Ruka is one of the best, most technically impressive animated films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The potter wakes up and water his plant. Then he goes to make a pot. But there comes a huge hand that breaks the pot and demands that the potter make a statue of himself. He reaches out, but soon returns and ties him in a cage for birds, where he is forced to carve a stone hand. He comes up to it, faint from exhaustion, but eventually does the job. <br /> <br /> In a wonderful sequence of metacinema, the potter uses a candle to burn his visible puppet strings that keep him in captivity and flees home. He closes himself and is accidentally killed by his beloved plant when he falls on his head. <br /> <br /> This film does not hide the fact that it is pure animation, in contrast to modern movies that try to be realistic (why?). A hand, for example, is clearly someone's gloved hand. Everything else is clay. The strings are visible and form part of the narrative, which makes it the forerunner of the movie Strings. The atmosphere is amazing: this hand after a small potter managed to instill more fear in me than many connected horror movies. <br /> <br /> The movie is obvious, but it avoids total manipulation due to its simplicity. is a tale of artistic freedom and tyranny that can not help win the heart and mind of anyone who has freedom as a natural right.
