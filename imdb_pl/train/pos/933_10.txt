I saw this movie in the sixth grade around Christmas and I was very excited to see him, and when I heard George C. Scott was in it, I was really excited because I really love George C. Scott! When I and my class watched this movie, I really do it, and when it's over, I was really impressed, I thought it was great! This is the best version of Charles Dickens' classic novel I've seen so far! George C. Scott's performance as Scrooge is something else, I thought he was the perfect choice, he was Scrooge, he is the ultimate Scrooge! I've seen two different versions of A Christmas Carol, the other is the one with Patrick Stewart, but this one is better! <br /> <br /> What's really great about it is acting, I thought the actors were fantastic, they were all ghosts, Tiny Tim, Bob Cratchit, everyone could not find anybody better than they did parts! But the best part of the movie was George C. Scott! When I saw him, I thought he was absolutely the best! He is the definitive Ebenezer Scrooge, I do not think they could find someone better! I do not think they can find someone better to replace anyone in the movie! <br /> <br /> This movie is probably the last adaptation of Charles Dickens' movie and I really think you'll agree, you think this movie is fantastic! I will probably have to buy this movie on DVD because I thought it was totally fantastic! I totally recommend that you see this masterpiece! This is the best version of A Christmas Carol, period. <br /> <br /> 10/10
