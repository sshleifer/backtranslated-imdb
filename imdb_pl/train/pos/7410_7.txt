I appeared in the "Shower" section of the foreign video of my local video store and gave it several times because it looked like a farce or comedy from its cover. Then I found a copy to buy at an affordable price and I'm happy with my luck. "Shower" is a story about three (3) men, a father and two (2) adult sons, each of whom has come to terms with life changes, because the world around them is also changing in contemporary China. As with many "foreign" films, Chinese culture itself is one of the most interesting aspects of this film. <br /> <br /> In addition to the fascinating features of the local Chinese color, giving the scenario of this story, it is a difficult but touching relationship between men and the only woman involved in history, all against the background of a village bathhouse. <br /> <br /> The family history moves from alienation to understanding and I am happy that I met you. Numerous small figures, clients of the baths and their individual conflicts and friendships have been added to the main story. "Shower" is a film that goes away from the smile and is touched by its warmth and humanity.
