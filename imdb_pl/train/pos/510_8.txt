I just watched it for the first time in a long time - I forgot both how ingenious pictures were and how witty this film was. I did not forget, however, the initial scenes that (with the scene in the club by candlelight at Waterloo Bridge) are among the most romantic films ever filmed. <br /> <br /> Everyone who is interested in politics or history will love hand-made references to the film - anyone interested in romance will be touched by Hunter-Niven, and anyone who loves visual imaging will enjoy the image of the world afterlife. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie remains "Odd Man Out" made at the same time - but this one is great. <br /> <br />
