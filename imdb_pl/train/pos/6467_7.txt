Two films in the back that concerned Indian prisoners of war; Veer Zaara and Deewaar. Although Veer Zara was a love story for a guy who gives everything to someone, Deewaar focuses on the main topic. It is not concealed that many Indian prisoners have been rotting in Pakistani prisons for years - for whom neither Indian Govt. he has time or compassion or the other side. I am sure that some Pakistani prisoners of war are also in India, but let's focus on the film. Full of actors. Some were stage actors, such as Raghubir Yadav, Rajendra Gupta, etc. Amitabh Bachchan, who plays the role of major, acted well. Akshaye Khanna did well. Amrita Rao had nothing to do but a few giggles and a few songs. I think that Sanjay Dutt's role was the most solid, though it was not too long. He was really good here, and his dialogue was impressive. If you compare it to LOC, which was nothing more than a full-day movie with a story going in all directions (if it had a story) - Deewaar is a well-made movie that keeps the pace and justice to all actors. 7.5 / 10
