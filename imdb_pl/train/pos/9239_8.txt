As I said in my comment to the first part: These two films are better than most Science Fiction followers. <br /> <br /> The scenario in the second film is not as moving as we see the destruction of human civilization, but the consequences, thousands of refugees escaping in tiny space cans, protected only by one powerful spacecraft. <br /> <br /> But when Battlestar Pegasus appears, the story warms up, transferring the battle to the Cylon Planets. Okay, she's got a bit of Mad Max, because everything they're fighting for is fuel for their spacecraft so that they can travel to find a distant Earth, but it works for me. It is a thrilling science fiction entertainment in which great actors and decent special effects play (although you have a tendency to repeat yourself at least :-)). <br /> <br /> I would like to continue the game with Starbuck and Apollo on the board. Instead, we got the second sequel with no names who proved that the story worked before, especially because the characters were so well chosen ... <br /> <br /> Thumbs up for the 1980s production, but thumbs for two films from 1978 year.
