"Match Point" and "Scoop" convinced me that Woody Allen does not only do a decent job of making movies in England (and that Scarlett Johansson is the right cast member), but he confirmed what I've known for years: he should not focus on neurotic rich New Yorkers. In this case, Johansson plays journalism student Sondra Pransky, whose magician Sid Waterman (Allen) puts in his disappearing box, where he meets the ghost of the murdered reporter Joe Strombla (Ian McShane), who tells her that serial killings plagued London were committed by millionaire Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). So he meets him and ... well, I do not know how much I can tell you without giving him back. But I can say that this is probably the funniest movie of Allen for years. There is his omnipresent, unique style of humor (especially the line about his religion). <br /> <br /> So you'll love this movie. If nothing else, make you fall in love with London. But most of all it's so damn funny. Even if you do not like Woody Allen, you must love it.
