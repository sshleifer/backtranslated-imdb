I must say that sometimes 'appearance' matters, as Jeremy Clarkson of the BBC has noted (though not about our land, but he is right). <br /> <br /> And when it comes to looks, this movie is such an amazingly stunning beauty that you will surely like what your eyes will see. <br /> <br /> And then there is also the personality of the movie, interesting, with the engaging voice of the narrator and the narrator stories that will touch your soul while watching these wonderfully filmed images. <br /> <br /> The movie will probably not affect your lifestyle, ruining these beauties, but it will certainly remind you how precious our land is on. <br /> <br /> This movie deserves 10 stars because it is one of the few stylistic documentaries that I really liked.
