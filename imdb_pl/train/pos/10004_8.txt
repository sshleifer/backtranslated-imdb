This is not comedy Robin Williams, nor is it a bizarre / crazy Robin Williams from the recent famous thriller. It is a hybrid of the classic drama without excessive dramatization, combined with the new love of Robin's thriller. But this is not a thriller per se. It's a more mysterious vehicle in which Williams tries to locate a sick boy and his protector. <br /> <br /> Sandra Oh and Rory Culkin starred in the main role. the character is approaching his goal. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I was very entertaining, although this movie does not teach, does not lead, does not check or amuse. I felt more like watching a guy (Williams), just like he did things from a third person's perspective. In other words, it was true and I could sign the premise of this story. <br /> <br /> In general, it's worth watching, although it's definitely not a Friday / Saturday night. <Br /> <br /> Ocenia 7,7 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fienda :.
