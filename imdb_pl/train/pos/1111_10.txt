It's not "so bad it's good", it's purely good! For those who do not understand why, you have a four-year-old intellect (in response to a comment ...) In any case, Killer Tomatoes Eat France is a spoof of yourself, a parody of you and a parody of me. This is the most brilliant text in the history of the film. I have him and three prequels on my DVD stand next to Herzog and Kurosawa. It personifies the recognition of the absurd and undermines everything that you or I call the standard. I write scripts, and this film alone has opened up for me a genre of comedy that we have never seen. It can only be taken in portions ... its use ... so far I've been trying to use a minimum of ten lines. My comment ended some time ago. I hope it works when I send it now.
