This is one of the best crime movies in the late 90's. He was full of great cast, strong plot, and many players involved gave great performances. Pacino was great; he should have been nominated for something. John Cusack was also good until the spectator did not mind his accent Louuu-hay. It can go away as an annoying one if you can not stand this dialect. The way in which Pacino's hero interacted with Cusack was sometimes credible, dramatic and somewhat comical. Danny Aiello was wonderful as always. David Paymer was great in the supporting role. Bridget Fonda was good, but she did not remember. It happened that this picture mentioned so many characters, probably too many. I remember it may take a second review "which Zapatti was that?" After so many links you have to stop and think to summarize. The ending did not have much sting. It was built for so long, and then he was a little disappointed. It was one of the few problems with the film. Because the film was not considered a "huge hit", a big hit on the screen made some people forget that this movie exists. Pacino and Aiello were great, but the lack of a "splash" in the movie theaters could not give an appointment. He was partially successful on the domestic market, and viewers are still learning that this title is now available. Created in 1996, it still stands today and will remain popular for many years. <br /> <br /> So make yourself a lemon pudding (you'll see) and see this movie!
