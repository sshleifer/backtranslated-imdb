This film is one of those that are very familiar to him. It is earthy, grounded and a movie that will make you think ... and smile. Paul Reiser and Peter Falk will take you on a journey you will not forget. The soundtrack is beautifully varied and matched; and the film itself is like a breath of fresh air. This certainly deserves recognition for both the film and the actors! Finally, a work of art that differs from the obvious love story and the frequent special phenomena that are visible today. I never left the movie with such a deep heart and a sense of reverie; it was as if someone had just wrapped him in a fluffy fleece blanket. Watching this movie is finding a real treasure and enjoying it.
