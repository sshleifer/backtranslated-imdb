At the time, this film had controversy written everywhere (like most Verhoeven projects). <br /> <br /> Containing very graphic depictions of death scenes; A parachute that does not open * slap * guys on the floor. The guy eaten by Lion * chomp * teeth in his throat. And a guy running a speedboat * zoom * a bloody corpse going down. <br /> <br /> But apart from that, this movie also contains wonderful (and stunningly beautiful) scenes shot in the gray fishing town of Vlissingen; <br /> <br /> Thousands of rosebuds flying over the screen, in a slightly insignificant part of the movie, a beautiful (holy) woman putting flowers in a can of milk, surrounded by plates of dripping blood of meat and a steamy love scene between two male characters in the cemetery. <br /> <br /> The story ends madly, but completing 10 minutes that will not disappoint you and will leave you a sigh of relief. <br /> <br /> Of course, the pros are cons, some of the special effects are too exaggerated and are obviously done to see how far Verhoeven can push the gore factor (eg a few hanging eyeballs from their nests). In addition, while the two main actors (Jeroen Krabbé and Renée Soutendijk) do a great job, breathe life into their heroes, Herman's character (incarnated by the rather not-so-charming Thom Hoffman) just feels extremely poorly developed, making it difficult to take care of himself, even after his tragic death. <br /> <br /> I have done my best to give you a light idea of ​​what to expect from this amazing film, and as you can see, it is not easy to summarize in words. Do yourself a favor, if you find this movie somewhere, watch it! And enjoy the unique style and content of this masterpiece.
