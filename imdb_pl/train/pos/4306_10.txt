The fact that I'm still thinking about the movie ten years later is what really says about the movie. For me, this confirms the Grand Canyon as a film that touches you in one way or another. I really believe that the Crash was before the movie. The main difference between the two films is, in my opinion, the moment of their release. I will not argue which one is better, but I will fight with the idea that they share the same message. I would like to hear from those who have an opinion on this subject. I will start a comment that you can find at http://www.myspace.com/62229249. You can also find me there to post other topics about movies that we can share, because I have a real love for the movie.
