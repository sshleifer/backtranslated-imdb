This series is "something different". Sometimes European series are less accurate than those from the US, but this time the authors hit the right target, creating a mix that runs smoothly. Edel & Starck is great, he has everything: a great story, intelligent, witty, always well-prepared lines, amazing theatrical timing shown by all the stars and beautiful shots of Berlin, one of the most interesting cities in the world. It's funny to see how it works in the field of justice in other countries than in the US and for the time being a "feel" old way of dealing with life in Europe. Recognition for the entire cast and crew for a well-done comedy that will have to be seen in the coming years. Watching the series in German is great.
