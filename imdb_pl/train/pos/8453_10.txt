I could write a large enough comment about one of the characters in the Gundam Wing, each of them could run a series with their internal conflicts. Instead, we get 8 great leads, which will lead us through 49 golden episodes of anime bliss. <br /> <br /> Contains a dialogue that can be played in the head for months ... years, then come back to and derive a new meaning, a masterpiece in script writing (although it has a typical anime feature consisting in discrepancies between subtitles and English dub). He has a lot of concepts and philosophies that make you think about your views. <br /> <br /> The relationship between cold, unfeeling males and loving female characters is a separate aspect of this series. Relations between Heero and Relena as well as Milliardo and Noin are joy. The apparent rejection of a man is based on an internal confusion that makes love (the word never mentioned in the series) of women necessary to them in their harsh soldierhood. Women are chasing men who are rare, if at all, making the leading men more enigmatic. Heesen needs all 49 episodes to show some care, but he will get there, and when he does, it's a big profit. <br /> <br /> And then fight with a giant robot. It's fun to watch amazing sequences as good as any Hollywood epic battle scene. A less-focused person would see a gigantic robot struggling as a stupid cartoon function for children, which became clear when I try to recommend this series to my friends, but they are wrong. Many of the giant robot battles in the Gundam wing contain a huge dose of pathos, usually involving young rebels fighting for what they believe in oppressive society, making their beliefs obsolete. <br /> <br /> The constant change of tone throughout each episode makes the Gundam Wing impossible to bore, it is a captivating, thought-provoking study on the potential of the human mind and body.
