I know that you have already entered this at film festivals (or at least think that I can come up with it), but I think that in each of them it should be "the best animated film". Bravo. I can not wait for the full movie. I realize that you often do not hear it because of the bizarre nature of your animations, but hear it now and accept it as the truth. Kudos, my friend. Okay, now I'm just trying to get ten lines of text ... Although I still understand it. And here comes another - YOU! - and I can not stop here. It is very annoying, and at the same time I have nothing better to do. In truth, I will probably watch all of your films in the next spasmodic "Jason Steele Marathon". I have a lot of them. <br /> <br /> -R
