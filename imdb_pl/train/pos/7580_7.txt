Although I enjoyed Hanzo with Razor, three are definitely enough: "Who's Got The Gold?", The Japanese lawyer's latest adventure with an impressive package is quite a nice piece of Pinku cinema, but offers little new in terms of ideas, taking a big step back when it comes for outrage. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the appearance of a woman's spirit and seems to intend to explore the supernatural territory, something that could take the series in an interesting new direction; unfortunately, after spooky turned out to be nothing but a scam in the Scooby Doo style (prepared by a corrupt tax official who wants to keep people away from the lake where he hides the stolen gold), director Yoshio Inoue is pleased with the recycling of known items from the first two films were rather outdated. <br /> <br /> Once again Hanzo leads the investigation, which requires him to interrogate women with his powerful penis, cutting his enemies and abusing his superiors. Along the way, we get wild orgies, good-natured rape (Hanzo forces women who end up appreciating his will) and bloody sword fights. <br /> <br /> If you've already seen and appreciated the first two movies, you might as well see this part to complete the set, but beware, this is probably the least satisfying one of them. <br /> <br /> 6.5 out of 10, rounded to 7 for IMDb.
