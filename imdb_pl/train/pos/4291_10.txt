From the initial shots of the main actor, we get an early view of how many male lives are run by women in them and the humor that goes through everything that happens during the day of "normal" life. <br /> <br /> Eric Lartigau, the director, wonders how many Europeans feel that they have full control over their lives, but without the help / support of women around them, it does not seem that everything works. The use of face image throughout the film is great, and his clever positioning of the older family member (mother) is in place. <br /> <br /> Although the movie is more than enough laughter, it still deals with lonely parents / adoption and the strength of the family in society. Really satisfying to watch, and again those that only the French seam can do. <br /> <br /> So far one of the 50 best films I've seen this year and worth five stars. I am looking forward to adding this to the DVD collection when it is released and I highly recommend it at any age.
