Actor Herman Jos√© plays the role of a football player who acquires a pass from two African players and tries to sell them for little money to Benfica club rival (club with his heart), FC Porto, so those players did not play well and he wanted Port FC to be disadvantaged by this. But it happens that these two players are finally good, and FC Porto sells them too much money to a foreign club, creating a good deal. Film for a small country like Portugal, without great predecessors in great films, is a very good and funny comedy, showing the entire rivalry between the North and South of Portugal (FC Porto / Benfica). Highly recommended
