"Dick Tracy" is one of our family's favorites - the actors are great - the direction of art is unique - the music is magical. This should not be "It Kill A Mockingbird" - it's a fun experience. <br /> <br /> Stephen Sondhemim's songs are great: "Back in Business" is brisk, "Sooner or later" is okay "What Can You Lose" is haunted - even songs like "Live Alone and Like It" add to the history of <br /> <br /> I love the staggering performances of Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Glenn Headly, Charlie Korsmo, Mandy Patinkin, James Caan, Dick Van Dyke, supporting the villains ... The list is too long. And yes - even Madonna and Warren Beatty are amazing. Written with a smile for a minute (how many times have we looked at each other and said: "Wait a minute - I think - it's gone!"?). <br /> <br /> One of the most eloquent things in this movie is that everyone involved seems to have a good time - and this primarily increases the spectator's pleasure. So, if you have not done it yet, give Dick Tracy the chance - accept what it is - a Sunday comic brought to life - and in a wonderful way !!
