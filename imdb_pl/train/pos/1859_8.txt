In his directorial debut, Denzel Washington adopts a true story that is also a very difficult story and casts it on the screen with the integrity we expect from Washington's acting activities, but now we see this touch as a director. <br /> <br /> We have recently seen some of the catastrophic effects of children who have fallen from public protection cracks. This story tells of a terrible existence that leaves terrible scars, but suggests the triumph of the human spirit in the end. <br /> <br /> We may not appreciate some problems with the first effort, too many close-ups, and not the best editing of these scenes, but the simplicity of other scenes that design such power can not be understated. <br /> <br /> If the academy skips this movie, it will be a parody. This film does not make blows and goes into hard facts with purity, which usually does not go beyond the screen novel. This is of course a tribute to the Director. <br /> <br /> This is dandy, so go and see, as well as tell your friends!
