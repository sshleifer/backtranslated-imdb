I like stories about ghosts. Good ghost stories at night, voices that can not be explained. Now I see them many. Because special efx has more and more control over today's films, sometimes to find a real gem, you have to turn back the clock until writers and directors really had to use their heads to create really good ghost stories. Now this one, very rare, pilot episode of the Ghost Story television series "The New House" was one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. It was once in 1972, ... I was only 9 years old, but since then nothing compared to him. With the entire remake that takes place in Hollywood, someone should do it "as is" without any special effect than the original. This episode was terrifying as hell. I'm lucky to find it on DVD today and it's very rare and hard to find. The only two other Ghost Stories stories you can even find are ORIGINAL "The Haunting" and George C. Scott in "The Changling". I would like someone to do more such ghost stories.
