Before Lost, everything shown on TV was predictable. You can predict who will die or who will find something, but in Lost you can predict NOTHING. Every thing was so surprisingly stunning and really a secret, not because it has so many secrets, but because there was nothing like it before everything was so great. I literally became addicted to it. LOST is a classic work of art. It gives you something you can expect every week. It `s genius. The setting is great, it is calm and warm on the beach and so scary in the jungle. Characters are a brilliant work of each of them, especially those already on the island. The castaways are so dramatic, but we can never predict their deaths because they have much more to do and much more to say and have secrets about other survivors who are dying with them.
