Stardust Another Guarded Review (originally written on June 15, 2007) <br /> <br /> The marketing machine has just begun (there is no page yet), so I doubt that most of you have heard of it. In truth, I did not (in a sense). When I received the message, I thought it was another code name and I was really afraid it was Transformers, one of the movies I want to see when I'm not working, so I'm glad that it's a 100% regular filmmaker. It turns out that it was not Transformers, and I was aware of it at the time when it was "Neil Gaiman's film". What is it about? In short, this is Gaiman's tale of a boy and a fallen star. More than that, and I would give out information about the plot that is (a) a breach of contract and (b) spoiling your fun. If you really want to know what's going on, go buy a book. Rumor has it that Gaiman can be a writer. <br /> <br /> Do not know what to expect in a movie, it can be so enjoyable if surprise is worth it. And it certainly was. This show was "unique" because it included not only film critics, but also exhibitors (they rarely have mixed projections) and local science fiction / fantasy people. You know the expected audience, right? I mean, with this crowd and the Star Dust title, I knew what to expect. <br /> <br /> Oh, how sweet I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a story written by an author known from the comic. But it was not Lord of Rings. It was not even another Lord of the Lord of the Rings (ahem, Eragon). It was much more intimate than all this. <br /> <br /> But, like the Lord of the Rings, it's just that the film's humanism sells fantastic features. It is certainly a romantic story, but with generous humor. And this humor is the kind that is not a slapstick. It is more like dramaturgy than comedy. Before we go any further, let's do this movie review. <br /> <br /> The operation is at least good. It is always hard to say more than in the case of fantasy films, but I believe that there were significant, brilliantly played roles. Michelle Pfieffer is unfortunately not one of those people. She plays the villain and she does her job. Nothing special. Rupert Everett, however, was a real jerk. This is a great villain. Peter O'Toole is, well, Peter Frickin 'O'Toole - which is great. Ricky Gervais is perfectly manned and shows why. Robert De Niro seemed to be having too much fun. But when he wanted to deliver the goods, he did it. And Charlie Cox (who?) As the main character, he was a great surprise for a guy I never heard of. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes. Claire Danes. Claire Danes. I've always had a mixed opinion with her. She can be great, and then it may seem that she misses the sign. This is the first one. And he is literally the star of this film. Sure, her accent stumbles here and there. And yes, it's not as good as it can be when Coxa is not on stage. However ... well, see for yourself. <br /> <br /> The special effects are muted, but achieved and significant only where they should be. The best flying ship - sorry Potter. The direction is light and flows nicely. The cinematography could have been better, but not everyone made films in New Zealand. Everything else is the best bracket. <br /> <br /> And now it's over ... <br /> <br /> ... a letter. Oh, writing! Neil, you devil. In today's climate it's hard to do something original, and at the beginning you start to wonder. Kingdom, dying King, a boy who proves his worth, witches, ghosts, quest (or three) - what's new? But Gaiman's story attracts you with its superficial knowledge only to turn it all into a sweet, original story about the boy and his heart. And although you suspect that all this will happen, you will start thinking in the third act and - if you are me - you will fall into a thrilling climatic confrontation and count on the best. Ultimately, this story, this movie, is what all fairy tales should be, but not too often. Fantastic and real. <br /> <br /> (It is a pity I can not talk about Septimus with Tristan, but I will not ruin it.) For those who read the book, be sure it was done correctly.)> <br /> Ci I talked to later, they had the same impression as me. A great movie for all ages, and a new movie for this generation. The empty space is filled only after the movie is in a wide version, because, well, you can expect it. In any case, you will know when you will leave. I sincerely hope that Star Dust will not get lost among the clubs. Even if this happens, I will be happy to fall into the hands of everyone I know. <br /> <br /> --- <br /> <br /> I forgot to add the disclosure of {WITHHELD}. I was a few years late, but ... "A great movie for all ages, and the new THE PRINCESS BRIDE for this generation". <br /> <br /> Perhaps a bit sublime, but I'm still sure that the years are shaping now, it will be the same answer "Oh, I love this movie" as now for The Princess Bride.
