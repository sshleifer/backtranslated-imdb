Being a huge fan of monsters, seeing the "Yeti" was an absolute must, especially after I heard a lot about it. Thanks to the good bootleg market I managed to find a copy quite easily and I was surprised when I saw that this movie was actually, I dare to say, decent. <br /> <br /> Decent about what it is, it's actually a bad flutter of a giant monster. It starts quickly because the Yeti is found almost immediately, and we get to know different characters. They consist of several disgusting, good and girls, who is definitely one of the most strikingly beautiful girls in any bad science-fiction movie. <br /> <br /> Yeti looks like a long guy from the original Woodstock concert, and he really is not so bad with a guy, especially after he was presented to the world in some cool, cage-like things. Godzilla is not - despite his naughty awakening, he does not even go crazy (actually he rarely destroys anything in the whole picture), but looks a little surprised to try to come up with something. Yeti seems to understand English quite well (my copy is in English) and he knows who the good guys are. <br /> <br /> However, we want to see how the giant Yeti does his, and he is in the whole movie, and in a typically low-budget style, it seems that it changes depending on the stage and even a few "false legs" are his photos . <br /> <br /> Yes, special effects are not the best, but they are definitely good here. The scene in which the Yeti breaks through the magazine is done very well, and in another it uses the building's windows as "ladder steps" to get down - smashing every window with the foot and often shocking the inhabitants inside - in one sequence that really looks a lot, much better than in such a "bad" movie. <br /> <br /> "Yeti" never bends as low as "APE" does. Actually, the only time she's even approaching real stupidity is when a beautiful girl makes the Yeti nipple stand straight and he raises his eyebrow in a "yes, dear" way. But even this is not so bad, and even laughs at the viewer. <br /> <br /> The film is quite long for such things, but it's not surprisingly enough boring - the story is really good, and just watching this great actress on the screen will make every male viewer happy. <br /> <br /> "Yeti" may not be in the upper part of the giant monsters, but it is definitely better than the other rip off King Kong '76 like "APE" and "Queen Kong" very far away.
