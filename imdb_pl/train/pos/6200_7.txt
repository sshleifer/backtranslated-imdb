Henry Fool is a better movie. But this is a great way to continue a movie like "Henry Fool". To take Henry very seriously, his "lies" and his mysterious aura. Even the "Henry Fool" shot, when Simon puts his ear on the ground when Henry walks over the hill, is more visible in "Fay Grim". The best jokes, which are more or less meta-jokes (about writing the movie and the jokes themselves), are good, but the opening of the film is somewhat saturated. Also Hartley's use of Dutch angles throughout the film is shocking, yes, it's the intention, but it seems forced and over-used, goes beyond the shock, which I would call annoying. This is a flawed movie, but you must see it for every Hartley fan or "Henry Fool". <br /> <br /> And do not listen to stupid reviews, do not watch this unless you saw the first movie. Intrigue, satire and prank of this movie are completely lost if you have not seen Henry Fool. This is a continuation. It's just stupid.
