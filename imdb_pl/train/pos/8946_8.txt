This impossible story concerns a witch who chases a mortal man in a mortal world. Her "community" is open to her members, but she hides spells from mortals. Hmmmm ... it starts to sound familiar. LOL. This is not your typical movie. The very "camp" performances of Jacek Lemmon and Ernie Kovacs make boredom impossible. Kim Novak is always a pleasure on the screen, but I found that her connection with James Stewart is unusual (but not terrible in history). <br /> <br /> With the newly discovered interest in all spells and darkness, this movie deserves to be discovered and rediscovered by the old and new audiences ...... IT IS STILL!
