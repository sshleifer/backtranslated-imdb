"Shower" is a story about loyalty, about the unstoppable development of the modern world to the detriment of rather traditional and more human ways of life. Man forced to choose between a successful career in business, urban life, wife and delayed younger brother. Eternal doubt between what we WANT to do and what we should do. Contemporary China versus ancient. Public baths with meetings, cricket battles with shopping centers and a tower block. Many old men and women who are no longer needed. China, one country, two systems, as Xiao Ping said ... although one of them kills the other. <br /> <br /> Tender, mobile, full of funny moments and bittersweet. Sensitive people will cry and laugh evenly. The actors are huge, especially the one who acts as a delayed boy; and Yang Zhang does a good job, easily, simply, letting history flow by itself. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10
