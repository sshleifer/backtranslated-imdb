The non-stop entertainment and content film drew a comparison that deserves a comparison with "Run Lola Run". The film quickly transforms into a sequence of chases, during which viewers get to know three main characters through flashbacks and dream sequences. The pursuit is not as fast as the climax, but the journey that makes up the majority of the movie. During the "run" we see how the characters grow and temporarily forget about their grim life, about the "macho" roles they have bought, and eventually forget why they started running in the first place. Just as the struggle provided "clarity" to the characters of "Fight Club", running provides the heroes of this film with resources to depart from the false values ​​that everyone allows the society to create for us. Their course serves as a way to truly taste life from an undisturbed perspective, and all three find a certain level of clarity and joy in the process. <br /> <br /> My appreciation and joy only faltered at the end of the movie, where instead of learning from their experiences, the characters seem to come back to play those false macho roles that I thought they had escaped from their journey. <br /> <br /> However, the only real problem with this movie is that it was not previously distributed outside of Japan.
