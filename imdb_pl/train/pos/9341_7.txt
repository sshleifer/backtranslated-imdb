Sandler is amazing again ... I've already become a Sandler fan. This film is Sandler's saddest story. His expression is fantastic. I cried more while watching Click, but there are several similar points. Consideration of the family's value before losing it and the ability to say "I love you" are just some of the most impressive truths in life ... It's difficult, it's real ... actually the real owner of this success, Binder. I do not think that another director could convey these emotions in such a way. <br /> <br /> Cheadle and Burrows are also amazing ... Cheadle is one of my favorites since Crash. Do not expect laughter or a positive atmosphere ... If you're ready to face the realities of life, do not miss this movie.
