As a Westerner who observes the views of another culture and marriaging tradition, I found Just Married hypnotizing and delightful. The idea of ​​entering into a marriage with a stranger by mutual understanding of parents is difficult, especially in this modern age. However, this is Hindi in this movie. Speaking with humor and a fresh perspective, we find out about Abhay and Ritika, who met only once and are now in their traditional five-day honeymoon. As has been said, it is difficult to believe in the affluent age of a mobile phone that such an archaic custom as arranged marriage still takes place. We see the awkwardness that this young couple feels when they meet on the first night and how they try to forge a bond, even if they do not know each other. We see different views about marriage and engagement presented by other couples also on vacation, from a few forty years married to others, still uncertain of making marital commitments. There is a song, witty dialogue, poignant moments, mixing and comparing new ways and traditions. Watching a movie with subtitles certainly loses part of the truth of the story, but it is still a pleasure to watch. Granted that part of the plot is a bit banal, and the bus accident is somewhat stretched and invented; however, the whole movie was worth watching.
