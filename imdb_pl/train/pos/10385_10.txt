It's been some time since watching this movie and the series, but now I am refreshing my memory! It was a very funny movie based on the classic series! Johnny Knoxville and Seann William Scott were fun. Because and Luke Duke help Uncle Jesse in leading Moonshine in General Lee. When Boss Hogg forces the Dukes to leave the farm, Bo and Luke sneak through the local Hogg building site and find carbon samples. They soon realize that Boss Hogg will smash Hazzard, unless the princes can stop him, with the help of their beautiful cousin Daisy. My only problem with the film was that Burt Reynolds was not right in the role of Boss Hogg, and the sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane was too serious. Besides, I highly recommend BOOK HAZZARD !!!
