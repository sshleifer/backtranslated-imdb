Every once in a while, Eddie Murphy will surprise you. <br /> <br /> Especially in a movie such as "Golden Child." It's a movie that could star Harrison Ford, Kurt Russell or someone else. But Eddie really works; he is smart, funny, brave, kind, polite, creative, clean and everything that should be a hero. <br /> <br /> He was elected to secure a mystical child who has the key to protecting the world from complete evil (perfectly embodied by Dance), Eddie travels from California, to Nepal and back, while the beautiful Kee Nang (Lewis) he wonders if he is everything he says, he is a crazy old holy man (Wong, as always perfect) he is. <br /> <br /> It's exciting, breathtaking, shocking and, of course, funny. Eddie is the only action hero I know who could start the movie, making rude comments for a guy reading a porn magazine and ending with clever comments about Ed McMahon. <br /> <br /> There is no problem with this "child": it is a "golden" find. <br /> <br /> Nine stars. Viva Nepal!
