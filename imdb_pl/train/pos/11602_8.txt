Now I had the pleasure to see Contaminated Man for the first time when he premiered on television in December 2000. <br /> <br /> An expert in infectious diseases (William Hurt) loses his family when an unknown illness enters his home and kills them. Now a few years later it is now in Russia or somewhere. I'm not sure exactly where, I just know it's happening somewhere in this area. In any case, due to budget cuts in the infectious diseases laboratory, they are forced to lay off most of their employees. One of them, dissatisfied bodyguard Joseph Muller (who plays Peter Weller, best known for his role as the indestructible Robocop), goes in and demands that they give him his job. I need this job because he is divorced and needs her to pay maintenance. So he goes in there, a fight breaks out, and some things are overturned, dangerous things. It was soon discovered that Muller had been infected with a deadly pathogen. In fact, it is so lethal, one drop of his blood will kill a person in a few seconds. Soon a word appears, and a disease expert (Hurt) is called in to investigate the matter, and then he began working with an American reporter. Now Muller is determined to return home to see his wife and son, and he will stop at nothing, even if he has to infect the entire Russian population. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie is similar to Falling Down. We have an unsettled person (here Weller, Michael Douglas in Falling Down), who will not stop at anything to achieve the goal, even if they have to kill a few people. Then we have a character type hero (Hurt here, Robert Duvall in Falling Down), who is both sympathetic and determined to stop the antagonist. <br /> <br /> A polluted person is actually a very good movie with a good line history and some very good performances. <br /> <br /> 8/10
