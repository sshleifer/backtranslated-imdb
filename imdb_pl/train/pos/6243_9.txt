a film about the cruelty of this world. I found it liberating as soon as it can be true. It also contains quite funny bits. Some activities are extraordinary, see for example Maria Hofstätter. The director tried to present life as realistically as possible, being successful. Consistently, the sex scenes are clear and are no more false than those of the hard-core movie. Although I almost did not understand the sentence, I saw a film in the original language with much more satisfying subtitles, because half the great work of the actors dies on dubbing. The voice of the character played by Maria Hofstätter is particularly difficult to copy by the dubber. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie
