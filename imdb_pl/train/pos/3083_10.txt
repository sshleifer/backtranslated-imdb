It deserves 12 out of 10. Absolutely refreshing show with real characters and real stories. This show has to come back, I've seen every episode and it's real quality. <br /> <br /> The shows focus around several New Yorkers, they play with the concept of six degrees of separation and cleverly intertwine their lives. Bridget Moynahan and Jay Hernandez are delightful, just like the lovely Caseman. The scenery is amazing and the wardrobes are exquisite. <br /> <br /> We need more shows that make viewers feel intelligent, not thoughtless drones. <br /> <br /> If he never comes back, six degrees will be very short.
