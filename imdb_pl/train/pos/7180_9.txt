Twisted, bizarre, charming and funny! I could not stop laughing while watching this movie. Darren Stein presents the films he made on a family camera growing up in southern California in the 1980s. It's an interesting look at a novice filmmaker, his motivations and the ability to manipulate the camera. Manipulation is a strong word, but are not we all watching videos that are to be manipulated in some way? <br /> <br /> From the very beginning I was amused that the boys in the movies seem to be shirtless whenever possible. Later, Darren comments his budding homosexuality and you can see it on the basis of hints (great tips!) Extravagance at an early age. Maybe it was just warm weather in southern California, who knows? As a homosexual who also grew up in an educational environment, it's great to see that his parents supported him and loved him, and his friends seemed to be delighted with his nascent talent behind the lens. <br /> <br /> Put the Camera On Me "is a look from the 80s untouched by commercialism. You will remember hair, music and fashion. I am the same age as Mr. Stein, so a trip back to the memory was welcome. His solo dance number is priceless, enhanced by the Frankie Goes To Hollywood T-shirt. <br /> <br /> Movies deal with dark themes in time. Violence against children, the Holocaust, nuclear war, sexual fantasies and social dysfunctions. No childhood is completely carefree, and the way Stein deals with these themes is at least interesting and entertaining. <br /> <br /> Watch as early as possible!
