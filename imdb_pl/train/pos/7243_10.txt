A brilliant Russian emigrant invents Stanisławski's system to win on the contract - which makes him and his beautiful wife GRAND SLAM Sweethearts from America. <br /> <br /> What could only be another stupid soap opera is raised thanks to its excellent production values ​​and excellent acting for the status of a very pleasant comedy. A few unexpected accents were drawn in to let the viewer's attention be involved - the way the cast is introduced as faces on a deck of cards; introduction to the story of an acrobat for reasons other than madness; and the way a wide range of different Americans turns out to be fascinated by listening to the final game broadcast. <br /> <br /> Paul Lukas and Loretta Young are doing very well as Bridge Sweethearts - Lukas polite and sophisticated, while Miss Young is passionately loving and beautiful (even if the script makes him puff a bit too much). They watch them well, even if their behavior is not always the most reliable or convincing. <br /> <br /> Frank McHugh gives another good performance as an unrelenting cheerful ghost writer who loves Miss Young. The wonderful Glenda Farrell avoids her usual, wise personality in a small role as ditsy gal dumpy McHugh. Roscoe Karns supports a fast-talking dialogue as a brash radio announcer. Diminutive Ferdinand Gottschalk is a great expert in the field of snobbish bridge. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers recognize Dewey Robinson as a warrior patron of a nightclub; Emma Dunn as a nobility sister reporter; Paul Porcasi as the owner of a Russian nightclub; Charles Lane as a Russian waiter; and Jimmy Conlin as kibitzer at the last bridge game - all uncounted. <br /> <br /> The film uses fashion for a contract bridge that has swept across the country since its development in the 1920s. He expects the viewer to have a basic understanding of the intricacies of the game and will not try to explain anything to the uninformed.
