Usually, musicals in the 1940s had a fixed formula - and if you studied movies, you know what I'm talking about - some running, very "spectacular" performances that were great on the surface, but never fell into real personality characters, etc. <br /> <br /> IT IS DIFFERENT - and light years better and worth the nomination for the best picture of the year - 1945 (although it did not have a chance to beat the final winner - Lost Weekend). <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly was probably in the best form of his career - yes, I know about "American in Paris" and "Singing in the Rain". This one is different. He really falls into the character of a "sea wolf", thinking (at the beginning) that "picking up any girl on vacation" is nothing but a lark. And if you had to come up with a "history" to get it - let it be - up to. Just like the Man of Music when he "catches his foot in the door". The final cheerfulness of the film stems mainly from his and his new buddy (Sinatra), who tries to make the "good" story to "get the girl", in which he REALLY falls in love and unexpectedly falls in love. You will have to see a movie to see what I mean. <br /> <br /> Besides, there are many other elements of a great movie in this film, it's a classic story of a pal, nostalgia to the times when the world war is almost over (the war ended about a month after the premiere of films), the awareness that the guy who always laughed at life, can learn that he really is a great man, great songs and probably a few other elements of classic movie making that I can not think right now. <br /> <br /> Why not 10? At the end - almost 2 1/2 hours begin to be a bit longer. There is a small ballet number that Gene Kelly does, which must have been a sensation in 1945, but it seems to be outdated and seems to add minutes now. But overall, it is a definite winner in every level.
