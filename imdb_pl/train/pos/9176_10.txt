This review is almost 30 years old. Nevertheless, it should be mentioned that I found a copy of this film in early 2008 and watched it repeatedly for 4 months! I just had to write about it! I was stunned and I forgot everything else when I saw this movie. How ironic it is that I see the ugliest male hero of literature portrayed by the most handsome man! what a welcome irony! It suited me perfectly well, especially since Timothy Dalton gave himself his full role. He managed to get amazing and triumphant performance! I have never seen anything like this! All other actors are very good too. The whole film has been beautifully composed. I do not care what someone says about this movie. I just love it and I love it! It gave me pleasure and satisfaction. It crushes me a little, but I prefer Jane Eyre 1983 from P & J A & E, which in my opinion is the best mini series. <br /> <br /> Parts of Jane Eyre scared me a bit at school. I have never read a book seriously knowing the plot. Seeing this particular production, the story came alive for me and led me crazy. Mr. Dalton's scenes and voice haunted me endlessly and finally led me to seriously read the book, which of course is a masterpiece. Bravo for the whole team, especially for Mr.Dalton !! This movie is now part of me. <br /> <br /> I give him a rating of 10/10.
