I was not aware of Steve McQueen in 1958. I only knew that I was very afraid that I would see this film. (I was devastated by the film Trantula at the age of seven ... but I was now ten years old). The first scene in which Blob crawls over the farmer's stick and absorbs his hand, was enough to want to leave the theater. But I was and suffered from every attack of our monster. I felt so scared when Steve and his girlfriend barely left the doctor's office (poor doctor), and even more so when Blob entered the cinema and devoured a large portion of the audience. . . so much in fact that he came out of the front door, too big to fit in one. It seemed to be indestructible and unlimited in growth potential, and when he imprisoned poor Steve in a diner-like diner, he looked like a supper. <br /> <br /> To say that Blob was cold would be a modern description, but in the end, better icy than terrifying and mentally tearing small children. <br /> <br /> I remember coming back home with my uncle Nick, trying to act bravely. He knew I was in trouble, and when I got to bed that night, I not only felt Blob in the room, but when I called up the courage to look at the floor, there was a red pulsing, heart-hungry guy sitting down, waiting for me to try and get up and go to the bathroom. Healing took months. <br /> <br /> I am 57 now. . . I did it. <br /> <br /> Of course Blob has not been destroyed.
