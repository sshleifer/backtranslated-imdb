In this first episode of Friends, we meet the six main characters of the series: Monika Geller, Phoebe Buffay, Chandler Bing, Ross Geller, Joey Tribbiani and ultimately Rachel Green. <br /> <br /> We discovered that Rachel, a rich girl who is a friend of Monika from high school, left her fiance, Barry, at the altar, since she discovered that she did not love him. He also decides to live with Monika and become independent of his father, gaining a new job as a waitress in Central Perk. <br /> <br /> Ross discovered that his wife was a lesbian and lost her for Susan, her partner. (We see him moving to a new apartment during the episode) <br /> <br /> Monica, in this episode, meets (and eventually sleeps) with Paul "guilty guy" who gave her an excuse to be powerless since he divorced wife. But in reality he just fooled her. <br /> <br /> Ps: I just tease Joey and Chandler's hairstyles in this first season! =)
