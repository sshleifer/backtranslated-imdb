I do not understand why other comments are focused on McConaughey. He was never a very interesting film actor. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie is to write and prank. Alfred Molina and Patrick McGaw create an extraordinary comic duo, definitely not the type of inventory. Although you can not say that their characters are well developed, which does not make them less fun. <br /> <br /> The version I saw was on HDNET and had subtitles for the Spanish dialog, so it certainly was not a problem. The use of the Spanish language gives it more authenticity. <br /> <br /> A very underrated film, judging by the extremely low IMDb members' scores. I thought it was fun and interesting and worth at least 7. A lot of interesting movies with better results and high salaries at the box office is much less interesting.
