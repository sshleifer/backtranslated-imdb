Okay, before we look, I have to ask: why is not it listed separately? Perhaps it was just a TV show in Italy, but for international fans, Lamberto Bava is his own film. In America, this movie is distributed on VHS and DVD as "The Ogre" or "Demons 3". Yes, I know it has nothing to do with the "Demon" except one cast member and crew. But yes, personally I was upset that it was so hard to find on this page, which is so useful. <br /> <br /> Finally, let's review "The Ogre". I've seen this trailer many times on YouTube and honestly found it rather frightening. The film itself (this is the length of the function, thanks to which it is a movie) has many strengths and is not able to scare him. The last act was dissatisfied with me, but overall I do not regret that I bought a DVD before I saw it (available at the Shriek Show). I think that the television's origin of the film is explained by the last act. I will not give away any spoilers. <br /> <br /> The plot is somewhat familiar: an American horror writer spending his holidays on an ancient, weird castle with her husband and son, to discover that it exactly resembles the scenery of her childhood nightmares. There are weak echoes of "Shining", but it is another brand of supernatural horror. The woman (Virginia Bryant) finds more and more evidence that this is the real place of her nightmares, but her husband will not believe her. Great atmosphere and horror follow. <br /> <br /> Many nightmares were quite strange. The Ogre cocoon effect was good, it reminded me a little of Uncle Frank's resurrection from the first "Hellraiser". There are also several good shakes and a well-made underwater scene. I give them props that the film never bent over imitating American films with similar concepts, namely "Nightmare on Wiązów Street". "Ogre" is the original. And the monster itself was terrifying when it was presented correctly. <br /> <br /> The DVD Shriek Show features an interview by Lamberto Bava, in which he cautiously mentions that this is not part of his classics "Series of Demons. It also gives much recognition to the real castle where the film was made. Indeed, this setting greatly contributes to the movie. The music of Simon Boswell also helps. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of good things here. "Ogre" is not perfect, but it's worth seeing. Take this smaller achievement Lamberto Bava.
