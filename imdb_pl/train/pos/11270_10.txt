Make no mistake, Maureen O'Sullivan is without a doubt the most beautiful Jane ever and never will be more beautiful. It is visually stunning. Besides, to make a good movie, you need something more than a beautiful woman. It's a great movie. It has not only the classic Tarzan atmosphere, but also the atmosphere of continuing the saga. We are engaged in two white hunters who are looking for ivory, one of them in love with Jane, the second, rogue catalyst, whose character may be one of the best-defined and best-researched in the history of the film. a great action movie stands out as a classic. Uncomfortable racism is presented. However, Africans are portrayed as individuals, and finally the two become even more heroic than white hunters and stand out as such. In fact, the one that has not been mentioned probably produces more sympathy among the public than any other character. The finale is also one of the reasons why you should enjoy this movie. The attack of the big lion has never been duplicated, and the horror is well implied with the reactions of the characters more than the modern movie gore with a graphic representation. If I leave something, it's because I do not want to get the picture dirty for those who have not seen it. But that's all you could want in a movie.
