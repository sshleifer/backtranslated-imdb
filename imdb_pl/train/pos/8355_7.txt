The film has a clear (though brutal and rough) humanity on all its border depravity - an irritated / lyrical result indicates the comic side of their adventures, and even when they are the most brutal (like terrorizing women on the train)), half-pathetic defenseless lurking never lurks far away (Dewaere sucks breasts like a child). Blier cuts away from the scene in which Depardieu can rape Dewaere, so we're never sure how clearly to read clearly the homoerotic aspect of their relationship - anyway, this incident is the beginning of their relative humanization (so the film could certainly read as pro-gay although you could probably read it as anything you want). The film has many opposing scenes and points of sexual politics and it is probably best treated as a general cartoon about the weaknesses of both sexes, mocking the whole concept of sensitivity and integrity, and hitting numerous points of possible depth on the basis that if you shoot enough shots , some of them will be hit.
