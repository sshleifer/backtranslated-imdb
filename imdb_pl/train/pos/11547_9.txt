and laugh out loud from many scenes. <br /> <br /> The basic plot of the film is well described, a story of opposites trying to find a way to survive in the near vicinity. <br /> <br /> This is undoubtedly the best film of Lemmon and Matheau as co-stars, and the interaction between the sloppy Oscar and OCD Felix is ​​classic. <br /> <br /> The scene in which Oscar sets up in a double date, leaves the room for a short time and returns to find Felix, and both girls cry pricelessly. <br /> <br /> For every fan of intelligent comedies, The Odd Couple is a film "do your best to see it".
