I love this program. Dot. Actually, I have not watched too long, probably only about six months, but now it's my favorite program and probably it will take a long time. I love all characters, except that I do not really care about Donna. I'm not sure why. I just do not think it's funny and I do not think Laura Prepon is a very good actress. Beyond her, the rest of the cast is pretty good. Kurtwood Smith and Debra Joe Rupp, who played Erics's parents, were very funny. Topher Grace is also a great actor. Unlike many fans, I did not hate the eighth season completely. I'm still watching him and it makes me laugh. But if you compare it to the shows of earlier seasons, then ... it's not good. Randy is terrible. The finale was decent, nothing extraordinary, but good. =] I think it would be better to cancel the concert after Ashton and Topher decided to leave, but well. I have a fourth season on DVD and I hope that someday I will have all eight seasons on DVD. In my opinion, some of the most entertaining episodes are "Dine & Dash", "Grandmas Dead", "Red & Stacey" and "Streaking", but I love every episode I have seen so far, and most of them seem to me. =] 9/10 stars, I definitely recommend it. =]
