I saw this with a few expectations and absolutely enjoyed it! Bend as Beckham is a rather typical film about growing up, telling a rather unusual girl. This is the groundbreaking role of Parminder Nagra ("ER"), playing Jess, a teenager in England, who is caught between his traditional Indian family and football love (football is for us, Americans from the North). And despite being much older than his character, he plays a perfect role. <br /> <br /> This is a friendship film - especially Jess's friendship with Jules (Keira Knightley), her teammate, who also goes through family problems, especially with her mother who wears purple nail polish and small bows on shoes, and who wants Jules to be more feminine, wear lace underwear and flirt with the boys and is terrified that doing sports means that her daughter is a lesbian. Jules and Jess love to play this game and have trouble convincing their families to let them follow their dreams. They too, unfortunately, both love the same man - Joe, their coach (played by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers). The love triangle causes some tension in their friendship. <br /> <br /> In some places Bend It Like Beckham falls into cliches. In other scenes, they drag on too long, and this movie could probably benefit from a more rigorous editing. <br /> <br /> But it was a refreshingly funny movie about growing up, the clash of culture and love for football. It's about empowering women, pursuing dreams and supporting friends. Funny, cute and funny, Bend It Like Beckham is a small movie that he could ... and he did. <br /> <br /> Excellent. 8/10.
