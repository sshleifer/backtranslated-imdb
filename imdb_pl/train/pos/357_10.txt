The film is extremely pleasant thanks to the great cast and great director James Eves. The film is funny with a very charismatic performance by Stephanie Beecham and everyone is perfectly staffed. James Eves has a good eye for the casting and directs himself like a conductor, knowing exactly when to turn up the action, fall, and then reach a climax. He does it with an element of humor, lots of twists, emotions and blood. It's the return of an old movie about vampires, with lots of blood, blood and screams. The movie works with great speed, and the characters take you on an amazing adventure, but what makes it work is that the film does not take too seriously with a lot of tongue in the cheeks.
