Strange, all previous comments only described the beginning and left details. I feel the need to confirm that this is family work, because Marina Vlady was also the wife of Robert Hossein, and excellent - jazz music was written by the director's father, Andr√©. Under these circumstances, it is not surprising that it was a really good thriller that could be seen after the release and immediately identified with music. The tension was impeccable and lasted until the end. Robert Hossein, one of the best European footballers, also managed to impose himself as the main screen and director. He still puts on great stage shows, preferring religious themes. Charry carasso, Paris, France
