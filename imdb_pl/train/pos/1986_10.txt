Expedition on tour! OK, the kid who plays Oliver is a bit sweet! From great photos, colors, costumes and the most impressive performances, this is a movie to watch. I saw a few adaptations of this great novel, but this one stands above them and is musical to run! He is a master Fagan who never leaves his character to perform a song. You never know if you like it or not, the same feeling I got in the book. In other versions, you hate it from the beginning to the end. Bill Sykes ... when you read a book, he's mean, so he's in this movie. Oliver Reed was masterful. His wife directed the masterpiece. I went and saw his last movie, Gladiator, based on his many great performances, not on viewers. Music suits times and mood. Who will buy this beautiful movie? You should!
