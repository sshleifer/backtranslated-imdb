I was very happy that I came across this short film. I am always so disappointed that it is difficult to find short films, so when I saw this and saw that he was nominated for the Live Action Short Film during the Oscars, I was so happy that I had a movie that I was cheering for. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite simple, the director, screenwriter and star Nacho Vigalondo tried to come up with a reason why people would suddenly explode with a song and a dance number, like in movie musicals. The result is extremely funny and the song is really catchy. <br /> <br /> It's a well-made short film, well-assembled, and the actors do a great job. And the last shot of the movie is perfect. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie.
