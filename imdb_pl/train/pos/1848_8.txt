A few years ago, the navy kept away from the creation of Men of Honor, a film based on the experiences of the first service of the black master of service, which fought to overcome virulent racism. Always willing to support movies showing the best page of our US Navy. Nimitz and two assault helicopters, with auxiliary shore installations, were provided to complement this captivating story of a young sailor's battle with uncontrollable fury. Part of the film was shot on board the American Belleau Wood. <br /> <br /> Antwone Fisher wrote the script for the debut of director Denzel Washington, in which he appears as a naval psychiatrist in the treatment of Fisher, played effectively and deeply by Derek Luke. <br /> <br /> Fisher is apparently a bright soldier assigned to the USS Belleau Wood (LHA-3), the front assault platform for helicopters. Fisher can not seem to avoid launching his own attacks with minimal provocation from other soldiers. Sent to MD as part of any pre-separation proceedings, Fisher slowly opens up to a black psychiatrist, revealing the horrible childhood of great neglect and trembling brutality. <br /> <br /> History is developing cautiously, but more and more often as Fisher trusts his doctor and has the courage to follow the love interest of a sailor named Cheryl, played by the stunningly beautiful Joy Bryant. <br /> <br /> Fisher reluctantly engages with the doctor, asking long-agitated questions, but soon realizes that he must seek answers, however painful, to grow and move away from destructive behaviors seeking conflict. <br /> <br /> While all the main characters are black, this story goes beyond the race, while unwaveringly shows the evil of lively religiosity and the accompanying hypocrisy in a foster family. Viola Davis, a versatile actress seen in many recent films, is a picture of grim immorality, but nothing compared to her adopted mother, Mrs. Tate (Novella Nelson), who in short but burning scenes would earn - if there were - Oscar for brutal intestinal brutality. <br /> <br /> Films about patient-therapist interaction follow a certain predictability (all of these transfers and countertransference), but Fisher's honesty and his doctor / mentor is realistic. This is a good story, well said. Period. <br /> <br /> "Antwone Fisher," though embedded in a navy, is in no sense a service history, like "Men of Honor," a great movie that was about crushing racism against a real person. It is not a black film either. It is about the survival of terrible childhood experiences and, as Fisher says, the possibility of proclaiming in adulthood that the victim is still "standing high". Stalkers shrink in size and meaning when a brave and strong young man claims to have the right to live decently with the help of a protective doctor. <br /> <br /> My only argument is that Washington is the commander of a lieutenant, but he is addressed as a commander. When all navy soldiers are listed at the endpoints, someone should tell the director of Washington that his character, like all naval officers below the rank of commander, is referred to as "the master." Is not that a big criticism? :) <br /> <br /> I do not know why this movie plays in so few theaters. It deserves wide distribution. Derek Luke can be nominated for an Oscar. <br /> <br /> 8/10. <br /> <br />
