I really can not condemn the movie because it works. There are enough elements of noir film to be considered a noir film, but I think it's only in the category. <br /> <br /> There is nothing wrong with this song and noir elements fail there. Of course, the disease can be considered ominous, but it is difficult to see. The film points to a darker side: Blackie can be smuggling people, the police in New Orleans are too eager to arrest a reporter, the specter of the plague hangs over all the people in the film ... but these are really just hints. <br /> <br /> There is no attempt to undermine Reed's motivation, as in the case of Marlowe or Spade, nor is there an attempt to bring Blackie to the side of people, which would make him even more contemptuous the human trafficking has actually been played out. <br /> <br /> This lack of depth is what ends up with a movie failure. <br /> <br /> The story is decent, the acting is good, the writing and direction are well done ... but there is nothing to do this movie that you should come back to. It's worth seeing once, maybe twice, if you do not remember it from years ago and then put away.
