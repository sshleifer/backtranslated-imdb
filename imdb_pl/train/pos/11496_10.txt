I also love this movie. I saw it when it was first shown in Germany in a small, independent cinema in Frankfurt. It was really busy and it was a very ambitious atmosphere. The eroticism of the film reached the viewers, and the discussion with Moritz Boerner, producer and director has always been underlined. In his genre it was a very ambitious film, especially when you think it was an independent film. <br /> <br /> There are not many copies of this movie, Mortitz Boerner came from the theater and did two or three short films more and worked on television before becoming a kind of therapist. <br /> <br /> For people who want to see this movie again, you can find it on its home page, which is not easy to search, but it's possible.
