The case of being in the right place at the right time. What a fascinating movie. It's easy to see why Chavez is so popular with his people. He takes care of things. Is available. It is also easy to understand why the West hates him so much. He has control over the resources of his country and transfers profits to people. Mainly poor. And it's easy to see how television stations can present misleading images to put a case there. Like the war in Iraq or the war on terror. Or the missing weapons of mass destruction. Or as with the axis of evil. People have to wake up. And get different points of view. Stop ruling the world. Watch this movie with an open mind. And think about it. Then I suggest that you see Aaron Russo: America: freedom against fascism. It's not America's people who are a problem. It's a government.
