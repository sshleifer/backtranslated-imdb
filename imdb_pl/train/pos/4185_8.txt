This movie has everything that makes the movie worth watching - messy editing, little continuity, crazy dialogue, bad (you can even say nonexistent) acting, senseless storylines, shots that last MUCH too long ... and is perfect for MST3K style riffing, not to mention the "Corpse Eaters Drinking Game": Snip on the forms ... take a picture - Sign your name ... take a picture - Catch the wrong edition of Foley ... take many, many shots. <br /> <br /> The only reason I did not judge him for more than 8 is that there is not enough nudity for free, and because, despite crazy madness, it's only an hour - hell, that movie should have passed by at least 20-30 minutes!
