It's almost the same league as "Black Cat", although I would give it 9 instead of 9+. It's really a praise for a movie that was so unappreciated that it's amazing! <br /> <br /> 'The Invisible Ray' is part of a horror movie, a partial drama and certainly a part of science fiction. In the case of a film made in 1936. Science fiction elements were ahead of their time. A mixture of horror, drama and science fiction is the perfect mix, and the acting of Lugosi and Karloff could not be better. <br /> <br /> Director Lambert Hillyer captures many of the elements that James Whale did so often. I'm saying that this movie is amazing and well filmed. The scene with the gargoyles outside Lugosi's room is a perfect example of the mood. This is a special moment in a film that is so lacking in today's genre films. <br /> <br /> As with "The Black Cat" and "Island of Lost Souls", I do not understand why this film has not yet been released on DVD. When you're thinking about some of the garbage that has already been ported to DVD, it's a lot more puzzling. <br /> <br /> In any case, watch this movie if you have a chance. Once it's released on a DVD, download it quickly and put it in a place of honor in your DVD library.
