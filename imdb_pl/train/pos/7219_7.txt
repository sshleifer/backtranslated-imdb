Unlike HELLO, DOLLY Tinseltown !, Jay Presson Allen adapted Ira Levin's hit to the thriller on Broadway and could not wait for his incarnation on the screen to open on the silver screen. White gear! The opening and closing stages of the film are shot in the intimate New York Music Box Theater, where DEATHTRAP has been playing for almost five years. Even the last phase of film disappearance in the theater is a version of the famous stage logo. (Although marketers have opted for a more fun Rubik cube icon in the movie.) <br /> <br /> Now, in a cheaper version of the DVD, DEATHTRAP seems as fresh and ingenious as ever. The cast is fine (better than their counterparts on the stage), and the scouts should be applauded for finding the right ghostly home for our "one room, two thrillerers", which will take place in a surprisingly simple and innovative way, director Sidney Lumet wisely means everyone "New" material at the beginning and end of the film, leaving the wicked, winding center of Levin. <br /> <br /> The final scene of the film is a serious departure from Hollywood and slightly weakens one of them. Levin's feature points from the earlier film [Helga (about dagger): "Will be used by another woman because she plays."]. However, like Robert Altman's THE PLAYER, our new finale helps re-assemble the film and blur the lines between the stage, screen and (maybe?) Real life!
