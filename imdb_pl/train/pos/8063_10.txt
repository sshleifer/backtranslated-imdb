This amazing Oscar winner (a total of 4) and the first Oscar winner John Ford simply charms with the striking result of Max Steiner. His name was a film about art, because Ford had very little money to make this wonderful story of guilt and revenge, greed and stupidity. But what makes this film so classic is the direction and amazing photography and use of fog and lighting, which was so different from the usual American film, and more in the tradition of German expressionism. The victorious Oscar Victor McLaglen as a drunk Gypo is simply unbelievable.

But with all the money, he begins to blow a drunk night and give it away while the traffic leaders try to track down the informer. The whole movie is one night in dark and foggy Ireland and the cast of characters that are memorable, but the whole world of Gypo is approaching him, mentally. If I had to choose three directors who would have ALL of their films on an uninhabited island forever and nobody else, John Ford would certainly be one of them. What a remarkable movie ...
