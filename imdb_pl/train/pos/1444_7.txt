*** SPOILERS *** When the secret Brooklyn North Det. Eddie Santos, Nestor Serrano, was about to meet with his drug supplier Tito Zapatti, Larry Romano, in the Williamsburg section in Brooklyn, in a purchase and sale operation, and Tito became the one who was arrested that everything went wrong. Santos and Tito end up shooting themselves. During the deadly shootings, an innocent observer, six-year-old James Bone Jr., Jaliyl Lynn, also died in crossfire. <br /> <br /> In New York, the organization of the Democratic presidential convention in 1996 was planned this summer, which the extravagant mayor of Pappas, Al Pacino wanted, was a confusion over the tragic death of young James Bones, possible, later it was decided that it was a bullet from the gun Tito killed young James, a New York City member of the Municipal Police Department. <br /> <br /> Much more shocking than Bone's death was that his assassin Tito Zapatti was tested by the respected state judge of New York, Walter Stern, Martin Landau. When he should be placed behind bars for 10 to 20 years, he is arrested for a kilo of cocaine in the back seat of his car! It soon became clear that the person who got the job of Judge Stern for $ 50,000 was not Brooklyn's other political chief Frank Anselmo, Danny Aiello. It is Anselmo who is involved in the Pappas Mayor's land transaction, including the New York Subway System, which will bring tens of millions of dollars to him and his property friends in the next two years! This would indirectly connect the mayor of Pappas to the killing of the bones, joining him with Judge Stern, who enabled Tito to be free, who is a mutual friend of both him and his Gomba, or Landsman, Frank Anselmo! <br /> <br /> To stop all this from blowing up a late Det. Santons is framed, acting under the cover without authority from his superiors, in shooting bones. In fact, those framing Santos are going so far and hiding some $ 40,000 in cash in their summer cottage in the north of the state that it looks like it's paid for by Uncle Tito, mafia boss Paul Zapatti, Anthony Francois, for letting his own to his nephew for giving him drugs. Which can explain to him, like Tito, shot by Tito, who pays Santos! <br /> <br /> As it turns out, Deputy Mayor Pappas at the Kevin Calhoun City Hall, John Cusack, who finishes ruining everything to his boss, being too honest to find a person responsible for hiding Tito's criminal record that allowed him to take to the streets . The facts that Kevin discovered lead straight to Frank Anselmo, the main political supporter of the mayor Pappas, who, as it turned out, was connected by hip to the mafia chief Tito, Uncle Paul! <br /> <br /> A little exaggerated "City Hall" shows how corruption in the big city can filter, just like down, for all city residents without them, like the mayor of Pappas, even knowing about it. The greatest sin of Mayor Pappas was that he was friends with Brooklyn Boss Anselmo, who brought people to work, like Judge Stern, who had been blackmailed by the real boss Anselmo, Mafioso Paul Zapatti. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** Only the deadly shooting in Williamsburg launched everything not only by Tito, but Det. Santos and James Bone, killed, but why he was allowed to go out on the street to bring in the very popular mayor of New York. Mayor Pappas looked forward to much larger things, such as the governor or even the president, in his future political endeavors. As it turned out, his main deputy Kevin Calhoun, without looking the other way, was responsible for his death. As well as a good friend of the mayor Frank Anselmo and the person whom he helped put on the bench as a judge of state, Judge Stern. Who made the decision to release Tito Zapatti from this disaster, which led to at least half a dozen murders and one suicide!
