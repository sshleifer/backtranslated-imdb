It is not a "loose" but precise, faithful remake of the classic Monicelli from 1958 "I Soliti Ignoti" from Toto ", Mastroianni, Gassman, Cardinale etc. And that is why it is good, it copies all funny characters and storylines, even in details ( like a scene where a photographer steals a camera from a local market). <br /> <br /> I watched the great old version many times and knew all the gangs and the end by heart, but I still enjoyed "Welcome to Collinwood", which has its freshness and atmosphere. It is interesting how the lives and behavior of small thieves in Italy in the 50's are adapted to the US in 2002. Things have changed little. 8/10.
