Yes, the poster is quite a terrible work. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was fine ... nothing really outstanding ... I just hoped it would be a hardcore drug and completely destroy his life. <br /> <br /> Ahh, but this can not happen to rich children? Not for the son of a wealthy businessman who has big social parties and has a well-kept lawn in front of the mini-residence. <br /> <br /> No ... the kid is too good for his life to be completely destroyed. After all, who will lead a new SUV and who will go to law school? <br /> <br /> Ah, poor, small, rich children ... in their charming, nice home, with ivy league schools, ultra-clean homes and social events ... what will the world do without them? <br /> <br /> I hope everyone gets addicted to drugs, rejects their lives and goes to jail ... so maybe we'll see movies that do not revolve around the poor, rich boys and girls of the surreal world.
