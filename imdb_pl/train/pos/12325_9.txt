I first saw this movie when it was broadcasted around 1988 by the BBC when I was working on the British 2000AD. My friend Steve Parkhouse recorded it on VHS and sent it to me. So far, I've really only seen Shaw Bros kung fu movies, with their harsh lighting (so the audience could clearly see the movements), so it was a sensation for me to see something that looked like it was lit up Ridley Scott comes out of Hong Kong. It was also my first contact with the films of Tsui Hark (pronounced, apparently "Choy Huk"). <br /> <br /> But for all smoky, illuminated external and ambitious special effects (Stop-motion? In a film from Hong Kong?) In the heart of the Chinese GHOST STORY lies a simple and touching love story, the more real by the outstanding talent of Leslie Cheunga (which is a tragic, tragic loss of life!) And the beauty and elegance of Joey Wong. Granted Joey is wonderful, but her ballet gestures give her a character of unattainable eroticism that is difficult to analyze. And although Joey is almost 20 years older (gawd, who is not of us?), It will always be a permanent image of this actress. <br /> <br /> Some reviewers said that the film is simplified and there are no surprises, but they are missing the fact that this film was made on the basis of the famous Chinese story written by Pu Songling around 1700! It's kind of like complaining that Romeo and Juliet have a predictable ending and they're just copying WEST SIDE STORY. (I wanted to give it up!) <br /> <br /> For me, Chinese GHOST STORY is the quintessence of a romantic story. He has a great tragedy because we know that Chio Sin and Sin Seen can never be together. It is about maturing, because none of us can mature until we have experienced a great loss. It's about sacrifice because sacrifice is an essential element of True Love. And Wu Ma's comedic stylizations do not hurt either. <br /> <br /> Enjoy the Chinese GHOST STORY, trying not to watch it through the filter of Western culture and you'll be good with it.
