So what is the real independent film? At a time when the latest fashion of the Hollywood mainstream is supposed to be harsh and innovative, I am sorry to say that what the general public sees as an independent film is usually nothing but a clever marketing ploy. > <br /> That is why we should be happy that there are such films as "Hate to the minute". In general, this movie does not agree with its own template (indie horror). I love it or hate it, "Hatred" is not afraid of being what it is, and watching this movie, you have a real feeling that Kallio (the director) did not make this movie to splatter out fake blood all over the place to tell stories. Good. You can find this movie in the horror section of your video store, but do not be fooled, this story is also about love, about good people marginalized and about such a distant light at the end of the tunnel. <br /> <br /> If you expect filth, or Evil Dead ripoff, stay away from this movie. But if you delve into the trinkets of horror / suspense, check out this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes. Bruce Campbell has produced this movie and I'm sure he's proud to tell anyone that it's not "Evil Dead." Bruce never tried to ban on his "gray" image and it is obvious that he did not engage in "hatred" so that he could do it. <br /> <br /> My advice, however, for everyone. Deadly furiously devouring everything Mr. Campbell has done, he checks the movie and sees what else Mr. Kallio and Mr. Campbell are trying to show you. <br /> <br /> Acting is well done, although nothing in this film is an oscar record (maybe on purpose), it's good to see compassionate performances in horror. Often, actors in movies like these do not even try, with "hatred", it seemed that all actors took their caricars very seriously, never resorting to a typical horror movie. <br /> <br /> Technically speaking, "hatred" is just as competent as an independent film. Editing is fast, cinematography is good considering the budget, and "Hatred" keeps fast, without any dams or bad anti-peaks. <br /> <br /> In total, hatred may not have a glistening look at all these multi-million false indies, but personally I do not see this problem. It's a movie of people who care about the medium. People who reached out to them broke their back pockets, pulled out their threads and dimes, threw caution to the wind and made a damn good movie. <br /> <br /> Check it out.
