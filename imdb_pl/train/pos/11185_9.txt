Because this is one of the most favorite novels, I was very excited to see this move. I was not disappointed! Yes, of course, there are a few things I can choose, but I think the movie was faithful to the book and was a really good movie. It seems that Stephen King's films are usually badly rated, but this is one of the good ones. This is a dark story that I think makes me like ... and what's better than a dead life ... and something about animals coming back from the grave is also terrifying. If you've seen a movie, do yourself a huge favor, and now read the book! This is a well-written game on the screen, the actors could do a better job (I say it only for Rachel and Ellie ... she was so cut) I liked the others very much ... and for me the most important ... the truth with the novel got stuck.
