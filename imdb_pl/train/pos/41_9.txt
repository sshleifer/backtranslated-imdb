"Who did it?" Contains many bold laughs and gags. It is not only one of the best films by Stooges from Shemp, it is one of the best short comedies produced by Columbia. Director Bernds originally wrote the screenplay in 1946 for Stooges, but when Curly Howard suffered a stroke ending career, he was adapted to the comedy band Columbia Schilling and Lane (their version was released as "Pardon My Terror"). he was too good for Stooges to ignore, and eventually he was filmed by The Stooges in late 1947. <br /> <br /> The old man Goodrich calls the aces detectives Shempem, Larry and Moe for fear of being murdered. When they arrived at his house, Goodrich disappeared, and his niece and good gangs try to get rid of the Devourers. Will they find Goodrich and bring a niece and a fight for justice? <br /> <br /> Shemp is especially funny in this movie. His reactions after receiving the mickey by Christine McIntyre are wonderful; it gives its characteristic sound (eeeb-eeeb-eeeb), and Miss McIntyre clearly tries not to laugh! Other funny scenes: Moe watching the cup through the camera lens; and fight in the dark with all the cast members involved. <br /> <br /> Nikko the goon (played by Duke York) is one of the most remarkable characters ever to be featured in the Stooges movie. With broken hair, he could almost go to Stooge, if he did not tower over everyone else! "Who did it?" Is a jewel among the films of Stooges from Shemp. Even die-hard Curly fans will be happy with this! A real Stooge classic. 9 out of 10.
