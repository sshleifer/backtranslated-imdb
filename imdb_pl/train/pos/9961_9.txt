I must admit how it will handle the almost perfect assessment, because the content is really great. As commented by the previous reviewer, I have no idea how this movie was on the bottom IMDB list 100! It's absolutely funny! Other films - especially those that have a common dance theme - can not bring the candle to this combination of its highest-class, credible acting and amazing dance routines. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, completing the basic history (it's not just about winning the competition) is very easy to go deep and surprisingly realistic. None of the main characters is two-dimensional in any way, and at the end of the movie it's very easy to feel emotionally invested in them. (And even if you are not the type of crying, you can cry a little before the subtitles.) <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this film to dance lovers, and even more so for those who can appreciate the poignant and well-preserved storyline. How She Move is of course not perfect (what is the movie?), But it is definitely cut above the movies in which nice faces hide a half-baked plot and / or characters who lack substance. Actors and screenplays in this movie make driving very realistic, equally fascinating thanks to the amazing talent of dancers!
