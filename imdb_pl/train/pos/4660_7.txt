"Hot Millions" is a well-written, well-meaning story about the embezzler who (whoops!) - too low class, word for the embezzler, according to the main character Peter Ustinov) "hot million" from the London branch of the American corporation, creating corporations on the continent and using a supposedly secure computer to transfer funds to them. (Remember, police spoiler is a comedy, not a secret.) <br /> <br /> Since 1968, the presentation of this movie by computers may seem naive to today's people who know more about computers; but as someone who has worked with computers since the release of this movie, I would say that even then, it is painful that it was written by and for computer illiterates, probably in order to increase the perverse comedy aspects of this British film. <br /> <br /> If someone has little taste for this type of entertainment, the movie may seem to drag in places. Fortunately, it has a nicely packed ending; unfortunately, the end credits do not indicate the classical music used in it - a symphonic song at the end and a duet for a piano flute in the middle - only a song sung by Lulu, which I do not remember at all.
