Another attempt by contemporary Japanese directors to redefine the chambara genre. Success, not to a different extent. <br /> <br /> The Buddhist monk has a vision that he is going to kill the legendary (and very active) demon on the Gojoe bridge to achieve enlightenment. Although Buddhist thought is not in the first place, it is the heart of the film, just like Kurosawa's "Ran". Probably it made the movie the most interesting for me, although it is now near the "Ran's" league. <br /> <br /> The stylish visual direction and excellent photography make the film the most interesting in two and eighteen minutes. The main actors are equally perfect. The music is really good. Two weaknesses are history and battle scenes. The film drags inside, which could be repaired by careful editing. The fight scenes are mostly filmed in blurry close-ups. This works in most movies, but the finale seems like a crook. Another recent film is "Seven Swords" by Tsui Harka, a great movie, but the promised battle scenes are disappointing. Asano really does not move like a demon wielding a sword, his game is great, but it would be an addition to the traditional chambara fight scene. <br /> <br /> A good movie, you'll probably find it interesting just do not expect traditional sword fights.
