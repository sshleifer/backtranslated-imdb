Ever since I saw it for the first time, "Piedras" is a personal favorite and one of the few pictures I could watch over and over again. A wonderful scenario depicts the lives of several women (all connected in some way) with deep understanding and sensitivity. Ramón Salazar won a fascinating film in his directorial debut and proved that he is an effective acting director. <br /> <br /> However, not all performances are excellent. Of all the leading ladies, they range from the average (Najwa Nimri) to very good (Vicky Peña), but the standing ovation should be directed to the newcomer Mónica Cervera, who convincingly plays the late daughter Antonia San Juan. Enrique Alcides is irresistibly glamorous like a male nurse, and there are also nice little phrases from Andrés Gertrúdix, Geli Albaladejo and the director himself, Ramón Salazar. <br /> <br /> "Piedras" is beautifully written and filmed when I watched me so moved that I could not stop thinking about it for a few days. I would highly recommend.
