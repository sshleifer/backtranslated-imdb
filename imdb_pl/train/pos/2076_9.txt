Good Earth is a great movie !!! Everyone must see ... He is tearing and tears the heart. It cares for strengthening the formation of values ​​in perseverance, humility and love for the family ... History can be associated with our lives today, especially since poverty is on the threshold. The way we react to such a problem is very important, and if a person is not strong enough to face such problems, he can be vulnerable and useless. I am very happy with how characters justified their roles even to young actors ... Their emotions captivated the audience. The film could be made in black and white, but the story is so addictive that you do not want to end it. It makes it really great! You should introduce a new version of this very nice movie.
