This movie is huge for raising the level of ghosts. <br /> <br /> Every time I watch it, I see and hear funny little things that I've missed before. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is unbelievable. Mick Jones (Foreigner) and Chris Difford (Squeeze) wrote songs, making Strange Fruit the best thing ever to hit today's music scene. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Strange Fruit is a strictly invented fiction in the 1960s and 1970s, a band that has never been good at using drugs and internal struggle. One wonders what could have been listening to their fanatical soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The Fruit draws inspiration from The Rolling Stones, Deep Purple, David Bowie and The Who. <br /> <br /> Each member of Fruit is quite memorable. Stephen Rea played the role of Costello, who was asked by the promoter of the festival to join his band on a concert tour, hoping for financial gain. Costello inevitably approaches the ex-roadie of Karen Knowles, played by Juliet Aubrey, to help him ignite the flame of dreams from the past. David 'Beano' Baggot) and extravagantly glamouresque Ray Simms (Bill Nighy). Tumbling in is another ex-roadie, hippie-toker-jocester Hughie (Billy Connolly) who never fired a flame. <br /> <br /> When Juliet searches for the last member of their motley band, the elusive guitarist-songwriter Brian Lovell (played by the thoughtful Bruce Robinson), the united members argue, as they used to, fight for the rusty talent of others. <br /> <br /> The team has the opportunity to make a small Dutch tour to prepare for the festival. Together with young Hendrix Luke Shand (Hans Matheson), who occupies Lovella's place, the crew hits the road. Sparks fly like the flame of their memories ahead, threatening to burn their unfinished goals ... <br /> <br /> Be prepared for laughter, singing, cheering and crying when these unforgettable figures come back to your hearts ....
