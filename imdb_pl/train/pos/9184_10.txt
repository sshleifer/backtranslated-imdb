Yes, this production is long (good news for Bronte fans!) And has a somewhat outdated character, but both casting and acting are so great that you will not want to watch any other versions! <br /> <br /> Timothy Dalton TO Edward Rochester ... it's that simple. I do not care that other reviewers claim to be too handsome. Dalton is certainly attractive, but he has no beautiful boy. In fact, it has a rocky, angular dark charm that, in my opinion, is perfectly consistent with the mysterious, very masculine Mr. R. And takes over so piercingly sad, tortured Rochester personality. It depicts cruelty when the scene requires it, but it also displays the delicate, passionate, emotional side of Rochester. (IMO newer production of A & E suffers from the fact that Ciaran Hinds - which I usually adore - seems to be nasty and bullying all the time, I have read the book many times and never felt that Rochester was to be seen as an incessant snarling beast.) <br /> <br /> When I read the novel again, I always see Zelah Clarke as Jane. Mrs. Clarke, for me, reminds Jane how she describes herself (and is described by others). A small, childish, fairy ... although it is true that the actress does not look like 18, so well presents the attributes of Jane. While other reviews claimed that her acting is wooden or devoid of emotions, it should be remembered that the character spent 8 years in Lowood, training her to keep her emotions and "passionate nature" in check. Her main inspiration was her childhood friend Helen, who was a picture of humble surrender. Although her true nature was different, Jane learned to temper her temper and seem obedient, in accordance with the school's goals for charity students who would "serve". Jane becomes a governess at the house of rich Mr. Rochester. Certainly not * speak to him as an equal. Even later, when she gave as good as she could, she would always remember that her station was much lower than her employers. Nevertheless, if you read a book - to which this production remains remarkably close - you can clearly see the small struggles that persist in Zelah-Jane when he overcomes his emotions to remain gentle and balanced. <br /> <br /> I think the chemistry between Dalton and Clarke is fine. No, it's not like Hollywood in the slightest (thank God, it's not a Hollywood book), but their romance is true, devoted and loyal. And for a woman like Jane who never thought she had * love, she comes to mind, that's a small miracle. <br /> <br /> The rest of the casting is great and I love the fact that almost every character from the book is present here. The same is true of the rich, poetic original dialogue. This version is the only one I know to contain a charming, infamous "gypsy scene" and generally contains more humor than other versions that I have seen. In particular, mutual teasing between the main characters comes straight from the book and is so amazing! <br /> <br /> Jane Eyre was in many respects one of the first novelist feminists. In the end, she accepted love on her own terms and independently, and finally, as true equality Rochester. Just beautiful!
