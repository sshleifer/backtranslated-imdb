This is not a typical Mel Brooks movie. It was much less slapstick than most of his films and actually had a plot that was predictable. Leslie Ann Warren made the movie, she's a fantastic, unappreciated actress. There were moments that could have been a bit more developed, and some scenes that probably would have been cut to do it, but all in all, are worth the price to rent and see. Acting was generally good, Brooks did a good job, not addressing the audience directly. Again, Warren was the best actor in the film, but "Fume" and "Sailor" played their roles well.
