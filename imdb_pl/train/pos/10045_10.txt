I find it so amazing that even after all these years we are still talking about this film! Of course, this movie was not so bad, otherwise people would not even talk about it. Personally, I liked this movie and I'm still doing it! I think this film is not for everyone, but it certainly touched many hearts. <br /> <br /> As for those who think that this movie is "overrated" or "overdone" ... well, we only have an audience who thanks for that! lol * You see, it's not the authors of CRITICS / articles that make the film "HUGE" or "HIT" with the film audience. PEOPLE make the film a great success. Thanks to the Titanic, everyone was delighted. Let's face it, such a movie has never been made before. At least not with the type of special effects needed to capture the essence of a sinking ship. This film is so accurate that even James Cameron measured the actual sinking of the ship in the movie that REAL sank this dismal day in April 1912. Even the silver dishes fit well! <br /> <br /> Give this movie peace of mind! Critics thought that this movie will drown BIG time! When this film really appeared and people started to hear WORD OF MOUTH (which is the best form of advertising), that it was a good / decent / movie worth watching, everyone started to visit theaters to see this movie ... not once, not two but maybe 3 times and more! I really would not say that this movie was "overdone" ... at least not as in the case of re-loading MATRIX or HULK is "overdone". ha! Critics did not even think that the Titanic would earn enough money to cover Cameron's gigantic budget that had to be done to make this movie mammoth. However, the money from the movies took care of 200 million budget and MUCH more! <br /> <br /> Personally, I love this movie. However, this movie may not be for everyone. Do not say this movie sucks only because of the romance! It's the sexiest thing I've ever heard! I do not like the movie just because it has an affair in it! The story was sweet. The dialogue could have been better, but let's face it ... REAL movie star was not Leo or Kate ... it was the GIGANTIC Ship! I think all the actors, including DiCaprio and Winslet, did a great job. It's not their best job (I've seen a much better job than both of them), but it was not the WORST I saw earlier on the screen. Give them peace! <br /> <br />
