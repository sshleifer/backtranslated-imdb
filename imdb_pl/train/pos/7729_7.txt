THE JIST: See something else. <br /> <br /> This movie has been highly rated by Gene Siskel, but after seeing it, I can not understand why. The film is definitely original and different. Sometimes he even has an interesting dialogue, cool moments and a scary "noir". But it is not fun. There is also no point in the story, but above all in the motivations of the characters. I do not know anyone who would behave like these characters. <br /> <br /> It's a difficult movie to take - I suggest that you do not accept the challenge.
