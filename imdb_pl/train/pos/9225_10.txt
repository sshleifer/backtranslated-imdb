The beauty of Derek and the revolutionary direction of John Derek make this film worthwhile. <br /> <br /> Because, looking great than ever, she is recently a widowed woman who is going through the visits of her "dead" husband (Anthony Quinn). He has a plan. Because he must get the body of a young man so that her husband's spirit can transform from spectrum back into corporeal life. Can you find the right candidate? How will she do it so that Tony can do his thing? <br /> <br /> Thanks to Bo's attributes, John's unique direction, Quinn's film presence, and thanks to John, the very exotic look of the whole movie, this movie is a pleasant experience.
