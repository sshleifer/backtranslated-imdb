The dentist was created at a time when almost every profession had a psyche. We had crazy policemen, ambulance men, a secretary, and that was the beginning. The dentist showed up surprisingly late, because going to the dentist is usually a nightmare for everyone. <br /> <br /> The plot is twisted. Super Clean Dentist Doctor Feinstone lives perfectly in his wonderful "white house", has a beautiful blond wife and a great place to work as a dentist. Dark clouds approach his horizon in the form of a nasty guy from the IRS (Terminator's Earl Boen), a dirty cleaner to the "cleaning" pool of his wife, and suddenly everyone's teeth seem to pass through a dark filter. He goes and starts taking care of people's teeth in a nasty way. And you do not want to go to his path. <br /> <br /> The crew was professional. Producer / director Brian Yuzna has produced stylish horrors such as Re-Animator and From Beyond. He directed the sequel of Re-Animator, and his first film company was a nice spinoff from the film "Live" by John Carpenter. Film producer Pierre David is known for films such as scanners. The cast was great. Corbin Bernsen really surprised me. I knew him from LA Law and Major League, but I could have imagined him as a dentist. He was really great in his role and he was a bit sad. Linda Hoffman was beautiful and stupid as Feinston's wife. Micahel Stadvec did not have many lines, but after I saw him with women from the neighborhood, I knew my future profession. Ken Foree (Dawn of the Dead, From Beyond) was a nice sight as a policeman in the case. Virginya Keehne was an innocent teenager who will soon be another client of Feinstone. <br /> <br /> Last warning: If you're like me and have a dentist problem, maybe you should skip this one. But if you want to try, you should prepare for dark humor and many nasty boring.
