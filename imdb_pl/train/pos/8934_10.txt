Two things haunt you in L'intrus (Intruder): who is the intruder and do you watch a movie or a dream? The ending is so shocking that you lose the answer to one of these questions for a moment. An intruder appears as different characters, different people in different circumstances who do not belong to the stage, so they are thrown out, kindly or brutally, but often without emotional involvement. The main character, Louis, is a man of contempt. He has uneven roads, some have a job in mind and no heart. He needs one and follows him. He has a transplanted heart and then he decides to start a new life. Can this man succeed in the quest for redemption? That guy could cut your throat. You know that, but Claire Denis does not encourage you to judge him. From time to time there is a young Russian woman - a beautiful girl who seems to live somewhere between heaven and earth - who judges him. It can even punish him. But not Denis. There is a character played by Beatrice Dalle, who does not want to be interested in him: do not touch me, he says. But Denis allows this man to be himself, turns him in his self-absorbed pursuit. I do not know if what he's filming is heart or mind, but it's not the traditional basis of the plot. Whatever she's filming, you finally get it. You know who an "intruder" is, you know why, more or less, and some scenes come back to your mind with their full meaning. But was it a movie or a dream?
