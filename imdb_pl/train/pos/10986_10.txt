We came across a documentary "Gray Gardens" last Sunday and we were "pulled in" without warning. Everyone who came into the room was taken over by television and the persecuting paintings of Edith and Edie, who seemed to live their lives in practically one room in a large dirty beach house, eating ice cream and corn (which was cooked on the bedside table) - a cat pissing on Edith's bed and her unbelievable words: "It develops [smell]." We did not see the beginning and we were wondering what we were seeing and how these aristocratic women managed to enter the position in which they were. Enchantment! you must see !!!!
