I love this program, but the first episode I saw. After seeing the first episode, I saw why people were initially off. The humor of the first episode is not the best and they are trying to start the series properly. I still like the light and humorous attitude of the series. The characters develop significantly after the episode and become really nice characters. As the first episode, it does not exactly reflect the rest of the program, which is really quite good. The episode is not bad at all, but as the program progresses it gets better, so watch more episodes before you get to the quality rating of the series.
