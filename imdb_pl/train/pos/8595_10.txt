I can admit that the script is not very good and that it has some spare parts, but all critics of this film have to learn how to have fun. First of all, performances are great (Michael Douglas, Kim Basinger, Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria.) Michael Douglas proves that he still has them, and Kim Basinger plays a very interesting character as a cheating wife Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria, play a dynamic duet by adding the incredible talent to the pot, and secondly, this movie is the most fun I've had in Theodore for years, it's simple and simple, if you want to go to the cinema and have a lot of fun, see The Sentinel.
