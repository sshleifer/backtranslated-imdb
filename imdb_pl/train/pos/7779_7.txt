It is ironic that in the 1950s, when Douglas Sirk was the most successful in terms of audience attractiveness, he was practically ignored by critics? But he is now seen as the director of a powerful intellect who has achieved his best work in melodrama? <br /> <br /> "Written on the Wind" tells the story of the fall of the Texas oil dynasty surrounded by a worthless reputation, alcoholism and nymphomania? It's about twisted, fatal links between sex, power and money .... Stack draws a convincing portrait of a tormented drunk destroyed by frustration, arrogance, jealousy, madness and a deep sense of uncertainty? ? <br /> <br /> Dorothy Malone succeeds as an attractive woman with excessive sexual appetite, humiliating herself for Hudson and other people in the city? Her best line: "I'm dirty." In one crazy scene, we see her trembling, trembling and sweaty to the provocative mambo ?? In another man who is crying alone over the model barrel on her father's desk, the symbol of excessive wealth and male tyranny. <br /> <br /> The mad atmosphere is both tasty and enhanced by Sirk's wonderful use of colors, lights and the careful use of mirrors?
