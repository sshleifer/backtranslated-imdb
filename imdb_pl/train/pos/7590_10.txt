I do not care if you want my comment or not, but I think that you who write that the movie is not good ... you are obsessed with Hollywood movies that you can not see the movie I'm not a fan of Jay Chou, but I like his game and not only his ... and maybe you think the idea makes no sense and you may think it is not so interesting, but look deeply more than action in movies more than love and passion and tears is more than US in the world and it's good :) really good. And it costs a lot, so please do not criticize the actors, whose directors because you do not know how hard they work, that you would be happy in this hour and a half, looking at them thanks :)
