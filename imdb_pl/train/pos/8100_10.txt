This film, in my opinion, is, despite its flaws (which I maintain, are * a few *), an absolute masterpiece and a wonderful and wonderful work of art. <br /> <br /> What Mr Bakshi did was create a completely beautiful movie and showed his enormous talent and versatility as an animated film director. He does not receive 1/100 of the loan he deserves for literally saving the art of animation for an adult audience. If not for Mr. Bakshi, I do not believe that the animation would survive the Disney attack. What's more, thanks to the "Lord of the Rings", he not only created a beautiful animated film, but also created a completely new art form - unfortunately, which never made him come to light. <br /> <br /> Most people will complain about the use of rotoscopy in a movie (using live action images that are used as background images and often animated using different techniques that seem to be small amounts of dimming to full animation). But I feel that people who complain about it simply can not accept an art form that is beyond the norm. No, this is not a Disney animation. No, this is not a live action. No, this is not a "scam" - it is a new, fascinating and absolutely wonderful form of art. Something fresh and so new that he feels at home in such a fantastic story as the "Lord of the Rings". The pioneering application of this technique by Bakshi causes the subtleties of Middle-earth to become very dark and mysterious, in particular the darker creatures of Tolkien, especially Nazgul, are implemented in such a way that traditional animation or live action are not able to <br /> <br /> The screenplay by Peter S. Beagle (based very little, as I understand, on the early sketch by Chris Conkling) is a very loyal adaptation of Tolkien's works. Where possible, he uses dialogue directly from the novel and feels at home in the world that Bakshi created. There are many cuts that fit the first book and 3/4 for a single 2-hour 15-minute movie, but few changes in the storyline. There are a few holes that would be nice to fill: Narsilu rebuilding, Galadriel's gifts, Huorny at the Battle of Hornburg, but again with the time constraints he had (the longest animated feature in history), they are certainly understandable (though they wonder how they could be explained in the sequel). <br /> <br /> There is also a delightful (one of my favorite) result of Leonard Rosenman (who also won Barry Lyndon and Star Trek IV (a result that is clearly based on his WP work)). She is bombastic and bold and, I dare say, perfect. It is an independent triumph of the orchestra, but in combination with the images of the film, it enters a whole new world of symphonic perfection. So far away from the typical Hollywood tariff that many people turn off. <br /> <br /> Voice actors are great. Particularly noteworthy is John Hurt as Aragorn, who simply emanates the essence of Strider. <br /> <br /> The design of the character is also wonderfully unique, though not always for everyone. Remember, however, that the director's duty is to present what he imagines, not what you imagined, so Aragorn is realized with the characteristic atmosphere of the Indians, and Boromir appears in the costume inspired by the Vikings. It may not be what you imagined, but I can only praise Mr. Bakshi for showing us what he "saw". It can also be seen that he spent a considerable amount of time with Priscilla Tolkien on developing the characters' costumes for the film. <br /> <br /> One more word - the sequence of flight to Ford, in my opinion, is one of the most subtle beautiful sequences that have ever been caught on celluloid. Bakshi is not afraid to slow down his pace, and his mastery is clearly visible thanks to the incredible tension he is able to build. Bakshi's artistic ability and Tolkien's amazing work merge in this sequence with a glorious summit that has not yet been leveled. <br /> <br /> Recently, the latest DVD (2001) by Warner Brothers is missing. Although we can offer our eternal thanks that the film is finally available in a widescreen format, the package is woefully inadequate. How wonderful it would be to have a director's commentary, see 20 minutes of additional material that was removed for the cinema premiere. Another delightful addition could be the recording of a live action, which was later enlivened. The DVD release also features a horrible reader at the end of the movie, which is a departure from the simple reader who appeared in the last frames of the film. This version is plastered and poorly rendered at the score of the score. <br /> <br /> Of course, the biggest tragedy is that the sequel has never been made. We will never be able to see the interpretation of Gondor, Shelob, Faramir, Cracks of Doom, the battle of Eowyn with the Witch King or Gandalf's confrontation with him. We will never be honored with the picture of Bakshi Denethor, Palatir or Paths of the Dead. I am ashamed of the shame that eventually we will have to accept Peter Jackson's brilliance and brilliance in Hollywood, a film version of these later events in Tolkien's masterpiece, but I suppose that even this is better than the lack of a cinema version of all. <br /> <br /> Dawid
