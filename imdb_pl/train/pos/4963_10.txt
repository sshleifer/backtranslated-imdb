Leave it to Braik to set up a good program. Finally, he and Zorak live their own lives off the coast of Spac Ghost. I must say that I love both of these shows. They are completely what started Adult Swim. None caused him to become great thanks to the album, which appeared in 2000. Maybe he was not platinum, but his performance was very popular with many people who love Adult Swims. I must say that from all of the Adult Swim shows without a story, it must be the one on which no plot was created. That's why I like it so much that it's such a classic in the history of Adult Swim. I believe it's just such a great concert if you do not like it. Hey, there were tons that hated him, and tons that liked it.
