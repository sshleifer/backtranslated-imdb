Bunny Comes Home "This Man's Navy" deserves more credit than the clever scenario of Borden Chase directed by Wildman's Wellman. The film has the right feeling at the beginning of euphoria and goodwill after the Second World War, and none of the blind horror that appeared in the game a few years later. Produced in 1944, the Japanese defeated, battle scenes a bit deja vu, the melancholy attraction of Tom Drake for the radiant young John Clayton has solid chemistry, plays real and confirms Drake's career in Metro. The following year, Jan opened the Carousel on Broadway. Wally Beery, a little bold, always praising the disbelieving Jimmy Gleason? his memories are an improvement in relation to reality and give Beery a shadow similar to Ulysses who can play against. Shots of Navy LTA (Lighter Than Air) are authentic, photographed at Tustin and Lakehurst, and the P-38 squadron is outside the March AFB. Lot 3 doubled for India and Bunny's return? Bunny Comes Home ?? gives Beery an authentic piece of her past, something he wanted to believe was true? so the future we're screwing in is fantastic? Now on a larger scale, the newly designed Navy LTA with the possibility of taking off reconnaissance aircraft? how expensive, blissfully optimistic? still: "Do you have to believe it, in this way you make things happen?"
