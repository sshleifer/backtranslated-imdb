This movie has a great pace, you'll never have to wait for belly laughter to appear longer than about a minute, and this is much more than the initial premise of the movie. All this time, there is mockery from the traditional genre of "local boys - good-defeating-adversities", which they parody. Do not let anyone tell you that they are trying to get cheap laughs just by using obscenities - there are certainly plenty of them, but everything is contextual, not free. I loved this movie and it cost me only 2.99 pounds on DVD, so when it comes to quality entertainment, it was the best movie I saw this year.
