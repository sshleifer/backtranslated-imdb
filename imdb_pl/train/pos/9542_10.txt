Do not be fooled by stupid people, this is one sweet ride! The real successor of Tetsuo Iron Man and Ichi the Killer, this gem starts to bang and puts a heavy body on top until credits go out. It seems that aliens take human bodies and modify them into battle machines, which are then used to fight each other in a twisted game for the entertainment of their genre. The winner of the battle lives alive. This is mainly for the plot, but who cares if blood is so good? I have no idea how many buckets of mucus have been used, but it's disgusting to see. It is interesting and effective to use stopping traffic when acquisitions are in progress, and care-ful rests on all creatures and makeup effects. CGI is a bit limited, but in reality it does not diminish the overall quality, at least for me. It was a really funny and revolting movie that deserved a lot of praise and really deserved its place in the Cult Classics set. Find him and see, you will not be disappointed!
