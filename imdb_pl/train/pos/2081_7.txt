First watched 29/09/2009 - 7 out of 10 (Dir-Sidney Franklin): A well-told relationship of farmers in China and their promotion to rank and struggles with what the mother throws them. This film is based on an award-winning novel and chronicles the family, from the marriage of a slave arranged by the son. The film is doing a good job, keeping your interest despite the slightly hamishing performance of Paul Muni. These are the chronicles, Wong Long (the character played by Muni) and how he works on earth, he buys more land, he finally becomes very rich, but then he returns to the land he first began. The relationship between him and his wife, played by Luise Rainer, is the main theme of this story (except the earth itself) and despite the obvious non-Chinese actors, he is quite good at presenting the country and its people. It's obvious that MGM used his money to create a really great epic in this era where they probably could afford it. The locust scene is done extremely well, and the rest of the movie really looks good, guaranteeing the prize for the best Oscars pictures this year. The final definition of an epic is what this story is and it is quite well withdrawn.
