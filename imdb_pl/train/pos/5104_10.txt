It's a clever drama about the lifestyle of Texas Honky Tonk in the early 80's. John Travolta and Debra Winger show two very credible performances as Bud and Sissy Davis. This movie really opens the country music scene and helped bring America to the mechanical bull. If you love a good movie romance, you'll love this movie.
