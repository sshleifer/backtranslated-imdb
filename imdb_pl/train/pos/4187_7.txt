This is a pretty decent example of the noir movie. This is the early 1950s, when the communists are trying to steal the secrets of arms against the US government. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark is a kind of unscrupulous pickpocket. It gives a pretty decent performance, but there is no list about it. An interesting fact was that he was not only an antihero, but for most of the film, a disliked antihero. This is not normal. Jean Peters gave such a good performance as a whore with a heart of gold. This wonderful actress, Thelma Ritter, shines like a stool-pigeon. <br /> <br /> The plot had a lot of twists, wisecracks and difficult conversations. At the end of the movie there is a fight scene (at the metro station) which was quite rough and exciting. <br /> <br /> I think fans of noir (like me) will enjoy this movie. For non-noir viewers this may seem a bit outdated, and the whole Commie case is a bit exaggerated.
