The excellent quality of Gerard Philipe, who died too young, jumps off the screen in this witty, funny, sly comedy with lots of fencing and antics. Charming in his stories, impossible to resist. Sweet romantic comedy with a very young Gina Lollobrigida as a love interest. A movie that you will remember with great love.
