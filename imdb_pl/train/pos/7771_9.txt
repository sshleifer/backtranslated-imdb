The absolute summit of the work of the crafty Dane Douglas Sirk (born in Detlef Sierck), Written on the Wind, forces our prudent attention to every flashy frame. From the rightly famous starting sequence, with leaves falling into the baronial foyer in a Texas mansion and the wind driving the calendar page into a flashback, the movie compresses up to 99 minutes of all family intrigue that would drive such later fakes on the small screen as Dallas, Dynasty and Falcon Crest on the space of many years. <br /> <br /> The combination of wealth and dysfunction is a topic that Americans in our society based on the dollar believe they can not resist. Brother and sister Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are the spoiled, restless heirs of Hadly's oil fortune; boyhood chum Rock Hudson and new bride Lauren Bacall are sensible outsiders who try to keep the boiler in check. (There were rumors that history was based on Libby Holmann's marriage with Reynolds tobacco.) As always, maladjusts get all the scenery to chew - and the best spitting lines (Malone, in her Oscar acquisition as she drinks nimoni from Joni for Hudson, can detonate the whole fireworks display). Hudson, although he is good, can not compete with all this type of excessive emotions; Bacall begins with a strong, but grows recessively, it is the usual comfort of the story. Irrelevant; with successive songs shot in extravagant colors, Sirk gives a lesson in how to finish the overflowing melodrama embedded in America's lush consumer paradise of the late 1950s. Nobody did it better.
