I saw this movie at the Santa Barbara Film Festival and there was no dry eye in it. It is incredible to see not only what a great Darius man is, but also how admirable the rest of the band is and at such a young age. <br /> <br /> It also made me think about how disgusting she was when they were given the opportunity to engage and inspire in a positive way, they refused. Shows if they really care about the youth and their viewers at all. <br /> <br /> It's a great and heart-warming story ... take your handkerchiefs, but it's great to see how a caring and inspiring youth can be today.
