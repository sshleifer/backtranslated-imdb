This is the first movie I saw last year! It is incredibly funny, incredibly original, incredibly great looking (they chose this super cool, widescreen Technicolor look, which is amazing, and really has a depth of character and what it says about society). It's a really smart satire that nails everything from Internal Security to racing and at the same time makes you laugh and realize how much the world is living in fear. Carrie Anne Moss turns into a comedy game that I never thought would come from her! It's sweet, funny and sexy! Billy Connolly is great as Fido, who can only purr and moan! And Dylan Baker as a dad is priceless. In fact, the entire cast is perfect. Henry Czerny as a bad guy, Tim Blake Nelson as a neighbor with a hot sexy zombie girl (the idea now?) Playful, though provocative and simply amazing! Go and see this movie! It's like nothing you've ever seen.
