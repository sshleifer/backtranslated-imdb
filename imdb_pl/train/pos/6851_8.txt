De Palma's technique has reached high maturity until this film, which is a great showcase of his classic techniques, although unfortunately, as with many films written by De Palma himself, history serves more than the interests of exhibiting a fascinating story. <br /> <br /> The story begins with a crazy scene in which Angie Dickinson masturbates in the shower while she looks at her husband. Then he gets caught and raped when his husband is unconsciously nearby - and the whole thing turns out to be Angie's fantasy when her husband is pumping her mindlessly in bed. He has a short scene with his son, a dead bell to Harry Potter, which ends with a joke that "he will tell his grandmother that he is playing with his peter." Then he goes to a therapy session where he complains about his dead marriage before he tries to seduce his therapist, Michael Caine. He refuses and she is hurt and feels unattractive and unfulfilled. <br /> <br /> Then begins a daring 22-minute sequence with almost no words, which is probably the main attraction of the movie. Among the many things that De Palma collected from Hitchcock, is the understanding of the film as a purely visual medium of telling stories? and in a typical way, De Palma changes it in a way to show his great skills. The problem for me is that in this case, it begins to feel that the scenes are unnecessarily prolonged, just to show the director's skills. <br /> <br /> The sequence begins with Angie in the art museum. He observes strangers, all involved in sexual or family activities, and then begins to address the man sitting next to her. De Palma very skillfully tells an extremely complicated narrative without a word about the attractiveness of Angie, embarrassment, withdrawal and finally finding and subordinating to a stranger at the back of a taxi. Carrie shot. <br /> <br /> In the second part of the sequence, Angie slept with a guy and gets up to get back to her husband. Again, De Palma cuts a lot of narratives without a word of dialogue, because Angie realizes that there are no underpants that her husband is already at home and no doubt wonders where she is, that she probably contracted a venereal disease and that she lost her engagement ring somewhere in shuffling. All this is admirable, but it starts to feel a bit embarrassed, because we are forced to do things such as a long elevator ride from the seventh floor, and then again up, almost in real time. <br /> <br /> ... Spoilers from here! When Angie reaches the seventh floor again, she is killed by a large blond woman. The woman rejects her until she reaches the ground floor, when the door opens and Nancy Allen sees her there. There's a great sequence in slow motion when Nancy reaches the elevator, Angie reaches up to her, and the killer's blade sticks to cut Nancy's hands. Then take some electrifying pictures as Nancy looks up and sees the killer in the raised elevator mirror. Everything is fine, and until we have a dialogue again, you think; "Woah, these were only 22 simple minutes of a purely visual narrative!" Or maybe not, but I'm doing it. <br /> <br /> The younger Dennis Franz has a big role as a dingy and tough New York detective who would prefer everyone else to do their job for him. He interviews Michael Caine, making outrageous implications (though it seems commonplace) that Angie WANTS to be killed. Angie's son is there too, and he's working with Nancy, and they've started to spy on Caine's therapist and find out who the killer is. <br /> <br /> Once again, there is a strong relationship with the Hitchcock movie, in this case Psycho (just like Obsession is a Vertigo remix). You have a woman we should understand secretly, a whore who is killed in the first 30 minutes in a closed space, in this case in an elevator, not in the shower. Then the relatives of the deceased are conducting an investigation that reveals that the killer is a man who dresses like a woman to kill. De Palma even throws a doctor at the end who explains the psychology of the whole case. <br /> <br /> It is very interesting, but at the same time, the viewer may start a little jerk, and this is my main objection to this film. It is definitely an essential viewing and presents some of De Palma's greatest works, but the feeling that this story has a solid third place behind the need to show off De Palma and its somewhat obscene sexual fantasies makes it difficult to look at it with a heartfelt feeling. <br /> <br /> --- Check out other reviews on my page of bad and bad movies, Cinema de Merde, cinemademerde.com
