I can not believe that others have looked at it so seriously. God, Hopidy's support was very funny. It was a great tribute to Western series from many years ago. It was not meant to be a great cinematic experience, except that it was. So what if there was not a big bonanza effect? It was fun, look at old westerns. Man, relax and enjoy.
