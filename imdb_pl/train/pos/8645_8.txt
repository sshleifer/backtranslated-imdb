I saw this movie many years ago and made a lasting impression on me. Unfortunately, for many years I have strengthened in many films and did not expect that "California" will impress me after the last viewing. I am glad that I can say that it is as disturbing and possible to watch as ten years ago. <br /> <br /> There are two things that really give this movie power. The first is his cast. We have an amazingly disturbing turnover of the young Brad Pitt as Early Grace. Knowing Pitt, just like all of us, as one of the most durable hearts that Hollywood has ever had, refreshing him makes him so vile and unattractive. Pitt pulls out the show without resorting to a stereotype or parody in a white basket and remains really scary throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> Juliette Lewis is just as impressive as Grace's tragic girlfriend, playing a character like a ten year old girl with forty years of life experience. Lewis manages to arouse pity (for her characters in life), as well as contempt (for her naivety), but she strengthens her performance with subtlety rarely encountered by an actor so young. Personally, I think it was a tragedy that neither Pitt nor Lewis were nominated for any awards for their performances here. <br /> <br /> David Duchovony and Michelle Forbes are well-mannered as a yuppy couple who unknowingly travels through the US with Pitt and Lewis. Duchovony is aptly scientific and naive, and Forbes seems decidedly cynical and off, but both actors manage to convincingly portray the changes of their characters, because they are equally intrigued, repulsed and strangely drawn by Pitt. <br /> <br /> great casting and even brilliant acting aside, this movie really grabs us for the proverbial balls thanks to its flawless stimulation. At the time when California was released, Hollywood released a lot of cool movies that do not have psychology ("Single White Female", "Pacific Heights", "The Hand That Rocks The Cradle", "Deceived", " Sleeping with the enemy "etc.). Most of these films were consistent with the same formula, the only difference is the nature of the relationship between a good guy and a bad guy. "California" does not really deviate too far from this territory, but his first two acts are a perfect example of a slow-cooking thriller, and we are on the edge of our seats, waiting for the wave to turn. /> <br /> When the penny drops, and Pitt is released to play a maniacal bad man, the movie completely changes gears, and the last twenty minutes do not quite match the rest of the movie. He said that the action is thick and fast, and the resolution is suitable for cold. The fight is over, but the scars will always be there. <br /> <br /> A large part of the narrative (provided by the somewhat bizarre, before the X-file Duchovony) is a bit invented. Of course, this is due to the book written by the journalist figure of Duchowonie, so you can argue that the self-conscious narration should be a tribute to the sensational style in which most journalists write. <br /> <br /> The film is largely a success and certainly over 90% of the thrillers of the last twenty years are cut. I highly recommend it, but not for weak stomach or mind. This movie is disturbing at more than one level. But then it should be like that.
