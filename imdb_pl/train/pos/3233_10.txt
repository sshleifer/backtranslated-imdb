This is the best Finnish film this year, although Tango Kabaree is approaching. Director Lampela made another nice little film called Rakastin ep√§toivoista naista a few years ago (I was in love with a desperate woman). Joki is a true movie with a single Saturday afternoon in a small village / town. The actors are maybe not so beautiful or beautiful, but they behave beautifully. I certainly hope that many of them will receive the JUSSI (Finnish OSCAR) statuette next spring. he could also go abroad.
