One night I went to see this movie with a group of friends. I really did not hear much about it. So I did not expect anything. But when I saw it, I liked it a lot. Nicolas Cage and the rest of the cast were very good. I must say, however, that Giovanni Ribisi's acting required some pleasure. But such a small defect may be obscured. <br /> <br /> Gone In 60 Seconds is a retired car thief who needs to increase the number of 60 rare and exotic cars overnight to save his brother's life. The film is not predictable in any way. So the ending should be a surprise. Do you think it's another movie about fast car driving? Well, you're partially right. There is much more in it. Everyone should watch this movie.
