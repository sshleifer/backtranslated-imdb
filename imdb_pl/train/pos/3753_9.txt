This short film, which soon inspired the full-length movie - Spatula Madness - is a funny song that opposes similar cartoons giving many writers. In the short film Edward the Spatula, who was fired from work, joins the fight with the evil spoons. This assumption allows some fun content at the beginning, but is barely present in the rest of the function. The 15-minute duration of this movie is absorbed by some strange comedy and a small musical number. Unfortunately, not much else is below. The set plot has no time to show. But he certainly follows her better than many high-budget Hollywood movies. This film is worth watching at least a few times. Take what it is and do not expect a deep story.
