This movie is close to my favorite celluloid. I really do not need and I do not want to talk here. Maybe with the exception of "See this movie" and "Enjoy the great work of Daniel and Pascal", who will guide you through this neat, funny and moving story about "spending the eighth day" - your own day! <br /> <br /> Watching this movie made me seriously think about how I spend my eighth day = my life! It seems that some of us are wasting valuable time doing things that we think we should do. Is it pleasant or just watching TV programs and games. What we lack is the satisfaction of being someone else - change. About taking up space and time for spontaneous and vivid - NOW! (on the eighth day) ... At least I got it from "The Eighth Day".
