This NBC television movie from 1991 was broadcast six months before the release of a large screen version of Babe Ruth's life. For my money there is no comparison between the two. Television production is not perfect, but it presents Babe's story with greater depth and complexity than Goodman's one-story story. I particularly liked the movie of the complex love and hate relationship Ruth had with the Yankee manager, Miller Huggins, who always understood the brilliance of his star player, and also tried to show why Ruth's own faults never let him become a leader or a leader. The TV movie rightly notes how Ruth never fulfilled his dream of managing the Yankees because of his flaws, while the horrible version of Goodman is trying to push through a fake that Ruth was denied what should have been his goal. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great addition to "Eight Men Out" because the story begins with Ruth's arrival in New York in 1920, a year after the Black Sox scandal and when his home run uses literally saved baseball from the ruins . Indeed, the continuity between the two films is even emphasized by John Anderson, who returns to the role of "Eight Men" as Commissioner of Kenesaw Mountain Landis.
