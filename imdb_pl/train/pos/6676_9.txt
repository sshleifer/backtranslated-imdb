****** WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ************** <br /> <br /> So who are these "Mysterious Men"? Simply put, Mystery Men is a group of sub-heroes who desperately try to survive their adolescent fantasies, at the same time taking over both their true identity and super identity. Shoveller (Bill Macy) works in the construction industry during the day, and at night leaves his wife and children at home, while he is pacing the street in search of crimes that have to be dealt with thanks to his unusual and unique style of fighting with a shovel. Blue Raja (Hank Azaria) sells honeymoon cutlery during the day and throws tableware for monsters at night if his mother is not busy with the latest spy. Mr. Furious works in a junkyard to earn his salary, and then unloads his frustration on his friends at night, throwing badly thought-out one-liners to both friend and foe, and threatening to really get angry (leaving everyone to think , So what ?). Ben Stiller breathes such a life into this character, you can not not love him. <br /> <br /> Those three spend their nights trying to capture the "moment of glory" they dreamed about ... become real Super Heroes. Of course it could happen. Champion City has Captain Awesome, finally ... a flying, fighting super-police officer with enough company logo on the costume to stop an extra ball or two. Greg Kinnear becomes the star of the show as a middle-aged salesman who tries to regain the attention of his fans in the twilight of his career. <br /> <br /> Restoration of this "additional magic", which may gain further support, C.A. releases Casanova Frankenstein, WAAAAAY-over-the-top threat of a bloodcurdling perfection by Goeffrey Rush. This crazy genius has created a "psychofraculator" to distort the City of Champions in the reflection of their own madness ... and eventually gains C.A. within a few hours after being released from prison. It leaves only Mystery People to stop Frankenstein's evil plan, but with such supporters as Disco Boys protecting Frankenstein, the trio will need little help. <br /> <br /> Recruitment begins and after a painful recruitment event, the team settles with The Bowler (Janeane Garofolo), who initially has the only real talent in the team, with her mystical bowling ball, animated by the vengeful spirit of her deceased his father; Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell), who CALLS to become invisible when ABSOLUTELY NICE does not look at him; Spleen (Paul Reubens) admitted mystically powerful bloating by an angry Gypsy; and a very unused Sphinx (Wes Studi), who was shown to be able to cut his arms in half with his mind, then spends most of the rest of the movie, inventing mysterious puzzles and acting too much. <br /> <br /> This movie really is a genre hit. Anyone who wants to grab movies into neat, small categories must fight a lost battle. This is a parody of the genre of superheroes - from pseudo-Burton sets, processed into infinity (and sometimes parody of material) to funny costumes, the comic book genre gets quite a good delivery. But at the same time it is a serious superhero movie. Both at once. Although this is not necessarily a unique idea in itself (for example, this film is in some respects a reflection of the short work of D.C. Comic Inferior Five), it is quite innovative on the big screen. It offers a comic book world that needs to suspend disbelief in order to accept, and then throw inevitable hunger - and we all know if the superheroes were real, would these guys be real? If Big S's guy were flying around New York, you'd see half a dozen reports of idiots in underwear that regularly kick their butts. Sure, Shoveller fights quite well, and Blue Raja throws forks with great accuracy - all parts of the world of superheroes. But does it make them real super heroes? Only in their minds. <br /> <br /> This movie is also a comedy, though it's dark. Inevitable when we try to point out the patent funny nature of superheroes. Some liners fly when comical geniuses on the stage throw away many bits. The Janeane Garofalo dialogue with a bowling ball / father is especially wonderful. However, this is not a comedy in the sense of laughter or eternal jokes on the side. It combines a dose of drama, discovery and romance, but never really ventures into any of them. <br /> <br /> What really makes Mystery Men a good movie, in the end is very engaging. Weak / lame good guys are finally justified and, for a moment, become super heroes; justice is supported; and the film ends with a scene that reeks realism (as much realism as possible in a world where bowling balls fly, and glasses are the perfect disguise). If the viewer stops trying to stick a movie, then the movie can be a great game. <br /> <br /> Of course, no movie is perfect. Claire Forlani goes out as bored and without direction as Mr. Furious's love interest, despite the key role of his conscience. Tom Waits seems confused with his own lines as the crazy inventor Dr. Heller, although his initial scenes in which retired ladies in a nursing home meet are worth seeing. And villians are never more than gunmen (the point mentioned in the movie). Cinematography is restless and chaotic (as is the case in the average comic, so it is forgivable), music sometimes overpowers the scenery, and special effects are never very well integrated with the rest. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is amazing. You probably have to be a fan of comics and a superhero genre to really appreciate this movie, but it's great fun and a good way to kill a few hours and let your brain rest. <br /> <br /> 8/10 in my opinion.
