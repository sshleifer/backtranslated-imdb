This great TV production of the BBC in 1983 (not the movie, as others have written) of the classic love story "Jane Eyre," in which Timothy Dalton as Rochester and Zelah Clarke as Jane, was the best version ever made because it is the most faithful of Charlotte Bronte's novels in both concept and dialogue. <br /> <br /> The classic is becoming a classic for very specific reasons; when film producers begin to mix with classical power, then this classic is destroyed. Fortunately, the producers of THIS "Jane Eyre" approached history with respect and faithfulness to the original, which results in a spectacularly addictive mixture, which is worth watching many times to enjoy its multi-layered sweetness, delight and tension. The performances are delightful, the music is right, even the gothic house design and outdoor shots are beautiful and give the right tone of production. <br /> <br /> My only criticism, though small, is that this version, like any other version ever created by Jane Eyre, ignores the Christian influences that built Jane's character and influenced her moral choices. In today's modern world, a woman in Jane's situation would not think twice, but stay with Rochester after learning that she has a crazy wife and is still a wife. "Oh, just a divorce," she said to her man, or she would have lived with him in sin. But Jane Eyre knew that she could not content herself with this way of life and respect herself. Why? This decision was based on the foundations of the Christian faith that she had been taught since childhood, not the brutal Calvinist institution of Lowood, but the Christian example of true friend Helen Burns, who was tormented, and did not turn the other cheek. One day I would like to see a version presenting these influences a bit more fully in adaptation. A classic novel that ends with the character's writing, "Come, Lord Jesus!" Should not deprive the foundations of this faith.
