Seven young people go to the forest in search of a bear. Soon, everyone is persecuted and brutally murdered by a crazy veteran from Vietnam. "Infernal Tramp" is a pretty funny Mexican slasher that reminds me of "The Zero Boys". at a fast pace and there are a few good death scenes, such as a throat cut or an ax in the neck. Unfortunately, there are not too many gore, so grand-guignol fans will be disappointed. However, if you're a fan of slasher movies, give it a rarity look. Mexican horrors are quite vague (I only saw "Alucarda" and "Do not Panic"), so this should be another reason to see this nice slasher. My rating: 7 out of 10. Highly recommended.
