few chess movies have been created in the last few years, but this is more than just a chess movie about the need to be loved and the need to win, John Toturro plays a man with a psychological challenge, it does not matter to him taking 64 squares and 32 parts, the game confirms him as a person when he loses the game loses one thing that makes sense to him, and John Torturro expresses it in a beautiful way, even the woman's love was not enough to save him from sad existence. It makes you wonder if there are other Luzon who are obsessively thinking about this game, I'm sure they are, if you're a chess enthusiast, it will not hurt to watch. work done correctly and well done, it achieves its goals, unfortunately I doubt whether it will be a continuation.
