I'm a huge fan of Woody Allen, so when I saw that he was playing at the cinema, I could not resist. I wanted to see how Allen tracks his great movie "Match Point" because it is another of his films shot in G.B. (which is unique among Allen's works) along with what appears to be his new music, Scarlett Johanson. Scoop is much lighter than MP, and humor is the most enjoyable aspect of Scoop. The plot revolves around the figure of Johanson (a student of journalism) who gets a tip about the hot story from beyond the grave. He falls in love with a suspicious serial killer (Jackman) and must decide if it's worth knowing the truth. Oh, all this is done with the help of an inept magician who became a detective played by Allen. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I really liked Johanson's performance, but I'm a bit biased, I could watch three hours, film with Johanson in the squad and stay enchanted. Game ditsy, yappy, bumbling sweetheart, which is a variation in the sense of the stereotypical character of Allen affected by neurosis. Adds the appropriate body language for the comic effect. Needless to say, almost everyone who sees this will find Johanson's character disgustingly sweet and this is a plus. <br /> <br /> Allen is Allen ... He still plays the same character, just like Chaplin and his character Little Tramp. Something that happens in this movie makes me wonder if I will see a neurotic little hypochondriac again. He is not in the cast of his next photo and spends more time just behind the camera, how late ... <br /> <br /> Jackman is also pleasant as a polite suspect in the murder of a millionaire. I can not say that Jackman does something special to give him a role, but nevertheless fits his character. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, I can not help but feel that it is fresh ... In fact, it stinks of the Jade Scorpion's Curse. Johanson and Allen are more detective than anything else. I must, however, applaud Allen after he completes it, because he is a bit smarter than the typical, unmatched Hollywood version of the movie. Instead of everything that is black and white, things are painted in shades of gray. Being completely innocent has nothing to do with it, and there is no clear guilt. Although the plot seemed to be old, Woody still has talent for one liner. His allusions to his last film were interesting to me ... Come for humor, laugh and be cheerful. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, if you like Allen's work, watch it. If you do not look at something else ...
