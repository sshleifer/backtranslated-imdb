I also watched this movie at the Santa Barbara Film Festival. It was an excellent film about family relationships of adults. Paul Reiser wrote the film and gave some similarities to his family. It was fun, warm, moving and touching, and also fun. A film like this would very well fit for oral reviews. I would definitely tell my friends and family to watch this movie. Let's just hope that they will have a chance. I would rate this movie as one of the best movies I've seen in a year. It does not contain violence, action scenes, murders, sex, so the distributors obviously ask if they should pick it up. Believe me, there are people who would like to see such a film that has salutary value instead of many typical blockbusters that we usually give.
