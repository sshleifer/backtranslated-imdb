I used to watch The Tenant and interpret it as a horror movie. He uses many clues of the genre: a sinister apartment, suspicious neighbors, revelations, secrets, and hallucinations. Life of the hero, Trelkovsky, seemed to be surrounded by evil, secret forces trying to make him mad. <br /> <br /> The last time I watched him, I questioned this preliminary interpretation. If this movie is a horror film, it's just a horror movie in the sense that Kafka's novel is a horror movie. In fact, this movie can be understood literally, as a lonely man slowly becomes crazy without any external influence. <br /> <br /> Polański has made three films about madness in his career: Repulsion, which I especially dislike as because the development of madness in the heroine never convinced me; Rosemary's child, in which the heroine is insane by the forces of evil; and The Tenant, which may be the best study of paranoia in the cinema. <br /> <br /> Trelkovsky is a young man who rents a flat in which a woman killed herself. He is obsessed with her and slowly begins to become her: she wears her clothes, puts on make-up, speaks like her. But is he possessed by a ghost or simply let his wild imagination draw from him what is best? It is the hesitation between what is real and imaginary and what Polański never solves that makes this film so fascinating. Many events in the film can be attributed to the supernatural phenomenon as easily as they can be normal causes, and it is up to the viewer to decide what to believe. <br /> <br /> Although this is not my favorite film by Polański, it is a good example of his ability to create tension and present madness in a very convincing way. And technically, it's also a miracle. Suffice it to say that he collaborates with the film composer Philippe Sarde and the legendary director of photography Sven Nykvist (DP Bergman) in creating this film. Slow pace and sometimes uninteresting segments can make this movie difficult, but it's still an experience.
