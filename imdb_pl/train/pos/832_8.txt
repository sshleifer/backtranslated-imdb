It is interesting how much more realistic the performance of Brosnan is compared to the original James Bond novels as compared to the films from bonds. He is a neurotic, paranoid, alcoholic and feminine woman to take off. It's a perfect break for him, even if he makes fun of the bond icon. "I'm a mess, a parody of myself," he says. There is nothing better than this. I just finished reading Dr.No and that's how Ian Fleming played James Bond. Personally, I never liked Brosnan as Bond, because he was too close to the icon. He had nothing to personalize the character, compared to Roger Moore or Sean Connery. It's great to see Brosnan play a character who is grounded in reality and extravagantly from the wall. The tile is a figure trying to understand the deeper emotional and psychological problems that it does not have to deal with. This is an impressive portrait, and Greg Kinear's poetry is poetic. This movie reminds me of the dynamics established between the main heroes of "My Blue Heaven", but more authentic in their coping mechanisms.
