I just watched this episode this evening, on a recently added presentation of one of our local independent channels, which now presents two episodes of each day of the week. <br /> <br /> As you said in the second, previous comment here, I agree that maybe it was not one of the best programs in this series, but nevertheless I think it's fun. <br /> <br /> My father was a friend of one of the directors (in my hometown of Cincinnati), because young Rod Serling was working there in the media - and I remember how dad said how talented and creative he was remembered there. Generally, "Twilight Zone" is certainly one of the real classics on television, and taking into account its production at the peak of the Cold War, provides not only a view of this era in the country, but also (today) a nostalgic picture of technology production, creative viewpoints and the actors of this era a few decades ago. <br /> <br /> * Fine "spoilers" * <br /> <br /> This particular story presents, like other presentations from this series and elsewhere, the story in which the locale is to ensure the end of the "surprise". Sometimes characters are on the ground, from a different place, while at the beginning the story suggests that at least one is an "Earthling". They usually contained a message (as here) about the situation caused by the doomsday keys that were finally pressed by the superpowers during this period of the Cold War. <br /> <br /> Today's stories like this provide a nostalgic look in this world view 4-5 years ago and still provide some food. - like this episode. <br /> <br /> Although the dialog may not extend significant lead talents, it is still a simple, important message worth 20 minutes of entertainment and interest.
