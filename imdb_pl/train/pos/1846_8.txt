When I read the story of this drama for the first time, I assumed it would be like Sex and the City, but this drama is not like that. Stories that the heroes seem more real, more empathy in situations. The concept of the drama is similar, four of which women lead us through friendships and relationships with problems and disputes along the way. Katie the GP is a dark and dark figure that is difficult to relate and is the best friend of Trudi's widow. The heroine Trudi is a warming heart, because you can relate to the difficulties she has and also the fact that she is the only mother of four. Jessica is a party girl, very lonely and knows what she wants and how to get it. He is a nice character and is the closest to Siobhan, a newly married wife who, loving her husband, can not help her eyes to go to work. All in all, the drama is surprisingly addictive and if the BBC continues to produce the series, it can succeed. In contrast to other women's dramas, such as Sex and the city or Desperate Housewives. This can be another cold foot if you play right. Plus the masculine look is not bad at the eyes.
