A fantastic document from 1924. The geography of today's Iraq from the beginning of the 20th century was powerful. Follow this and tell me if Cecil B. DeMille did not take notes before submitting his Ten Commandments. Merian C. Cooper, photographer, later created Cinerama, an idea that probably hatched when filming amazing landscapes in this film. Fans of Werner Herzog regard this film as a treasure, with painful tales of battle, supplemented by the surrounding land, the human ability to survive was not so obvious. The fact that it was done when he showed not only the will of the respondents, but also the filmmakers themselves.
