Two great comedians in Neil Simon's great film based on his hit. <br /> <br /> A great combination, especially when the comedians are Matthau and Burns. No wonder why Burns won for this Oscar; it's as sharp and funny as ever. And Matthau is in every way his match, if it's a bit more curvy. <br /> <br /> This is Simon's known territory: two old vaudeville partners are again associated with the television specialty, but after all these years they can not stand each other. <br /> <br /> I am glad that we are watching these two pairs, and their scenes together make this movie an absolute delight. I personally especially liked the "knocking, knocking, knocking / ENTER!" Scene. And if you're a fan of Burns or Matthau, you'll like it too. <br /> <br /> In fact, you'll like the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Ten stars. Put some "sun" in your life.
