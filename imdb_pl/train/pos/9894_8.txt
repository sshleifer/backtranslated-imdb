"Slaughter High" is a completely absurd slasher movie about a school loser, Marta, who is always approached by some jokers. The joke goes wrong and ends up brutally burned. Five years later, all his captors attend the meeting. only ten of them, of course, and low, and here is Marty murdering them one by one. The British actress Caroline Munro ("Maniac") leads the cast as a heroine (and so she dies!). Acting is terrible, there are not many grotesque scenes of death to please gore-maniacs: the stomach of a guy explodes, another victim literally gets a sour bath, the couple having sex in bed gets electrocuted, the guy is crushed by a tractor, one girl is drowned, and the doctor gets a hypothermic needle to the eye. The killer wears a decent and rather scary mask of a jester, and the surroundings (beautiful old English castle) are really nice. However, the final of dreams is completely pathetic. In fact, it's true that "High Slaughter" is a piece of rubbish, but I liked it. Only for fans of really bad slass movies.
