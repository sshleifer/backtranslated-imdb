This can be the most nostalgic journey in time and until childhood begins the journey of memories back and forth, forward, forward and backward, up and down and around. Boy Jimmy, H.R. Puffinstuff, Dr.Blinky, Cling & Clang, Ludicrous Lion, and even bad Witchie Poo too much. Lidsville's inspiration from recent days, "The Special Brady Kids Saturday Morning Preview" by Sigmund & the Sea Monsters, and Land of the Lost, both new and old, are what filled the gap in The Show at the Donny & Marie Show, Brady Bunch Variety Hour aka Brady Bunch Hour and even The Paul Lynde Halloween Special. Maybe even other things between & Beyond the Buck simply continue and go beyond expectations and unexpected limits. Now that we get the update in March 2006, we know that Jack Wild has gone and now it's all the more symbolic for us to really become nostalgic. In this now, in August 2006, when Jack Wild is starring in Sigmund and The Sea Monsters, and when in the last episode, HRPuffinstuff does the same and remembers all the nostalgic journeys of all the characters of Syd & Marty Kroft, including The HRPuffinstuff Goodtime Club, The Donny and Marie Show, The Brady Bunch Variety Hour aka Brady Bunch Hour etc. To tell the truth, Stephen "Steve" G. Baer aka "Ste" from Framingham, Ma.USA.
