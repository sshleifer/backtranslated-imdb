I must warn you that there are some spoilers in it. But at the beginning I have "Spanish judges" in February. I mentioned that it was the last copy, but as I see, it was not ordered back. Anyway, I have it. I thought it was good. I wanted to see it mainly because of the great actor, Matthew Lillard (I'm surprised that no one mentions a scar on the review), although it's a low-budget type, getting enough money to make this movie worth the effort. Man, what a good actor. <br /> <br /> The story of an artist known as Jack (Matthew Lillard), who "claims" that he has a commodity called the Spanish Judges. If you do not know what Spanish judges are or have not seen this trailer and this is the first review you read, I will not even say what it is. I think it would be a great turn from nobody to know what it was. He needs protection, so he employs a couple who is also a crook, Max and Jamie (Vincent D'Onofrio and Valeria Golino), and a crook named Piece (Mark Boone Junior). He has a girl who will not even tell her name because she is from Mars, she said. So (mainly Jack) they call her "Mars Girl". Everything starts well, but then it turns into one big game. A game based on lust, lies and betrayal. <br /> <br /> There was more to it (Matt and Valeria, like Tamara, were not one of them). There were several scenes where they could do better, and the result could have been a bit better. Part of the score was really good. The subject they used at the beginning and end (before the subtitles) was a good choice, that's my opinion. The battle scene could eventually be a bit longer and a bit more brutal, but what can you do? One more comment to Matt: Shit, it's smooth and clever. <br /> <br /> I know it's a review, but I have to make a correction in relation to NeCRo, one of the reviewers: Valeria Golino is not a novice. According to this site, it has been operating since 1983. For me and hopefully for others, it is known as Charlie Sheen's Italian love in both "Hot Shots!" Cinema. But a good review. <br /> <br /> Although it seems to me that this is one of the rare films I have seen and is really good (that's why I gave it 10 stars above), I will give a class of what I thought the first time I saw it. <br /> <br /> 8/10
