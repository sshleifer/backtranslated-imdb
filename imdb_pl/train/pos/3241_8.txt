Share. Comedy. Uncertainty. This movie has it all. <br /> <br /> The plot says that 4 thieves are invited to take part in a robbery in a small town in Montana. every type of crime movie archetype is here. Frank, the main mind. Carlos, a weapon expert. Max, an expert on explosives. Nick, a safe cracker and Ray, a man from the car. Unfortunately for Frank, he is stopped by two inept detectives (very well impressed by Ed O'Niel and Daniel Roebuck) who are pursuing him from New Jersey after sending letters to the other 4. /> Our 4 characters meet at the railway station and from the beginning none of them likes or trust each other. The mix adds to the fact that Frank has gone and are not sure why they called together. <br /> <br /> Now Frank is taken back to New Jersey by two detectives, but he soon escapes on foot and tries to get back to boyfriends who have different problems. <br /> <br /> A really great movie full of laughter and great acting. Just a good movie for anyone looking for laughter or something else
