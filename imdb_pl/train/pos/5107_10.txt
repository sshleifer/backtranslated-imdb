What an overlooked soundtrack from the 80's. I imagine that John Travolta was singing some songs, but watching the movie, he seemed to personify everything that was the 80's cheese. You can clearly see movies that rely on mechanical bulls, bartenders and immature relationships. His poor accent from Texas was the best. Compare this with Friday Night Lights. I suggest watching Cocktail and Stir Crazy to start getting really stupid. Besides, by the way, Made in America with Ted Danson and Whoopie Goldberg is an extremely bad movie. I was so shocked that I realized that I had never seen it. One more strange movie of this genre would have to include "Cadilac Man" with Robin Williams. Remember that all these big stars played big roles in these CHEESY films. Tom Cruise, Richard Pryor, Robin Williams and John Travolta
