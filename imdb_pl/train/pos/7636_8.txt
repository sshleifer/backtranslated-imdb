It's been several years since I saw it, but remember it and I would like to see it again. It became a "therapy" for me with my own personal experience. <br /> <br /> A thirty-five-year-old man laments a baseball game in high school, in which he "missed the ball" and his team lost. He thinks about it 20 years later, "if only I would hit this ball" and how his life would be better because of it. Then he has the chance to find out ... and gets a little more than he expected. <br /> <br /> It reminds me so much when I was in high school, twice I tried for our exercise / dance team and it failed. This team was the closest sorority in my school. If you were on it, you were "all this". I have not tried the last two years of HS and for the second time, I took it really hard. I hit and shook my leg hard before attempting and I wore tights to cover my bruises, which made me fail. It was in 1987. <br /> <br /> For years, even now sometimes, I think: "If I just did not hit my leg, I would never wear these stupid tights." Now I do not sit and think that my life would be better, and even if I did, but seeing this movie made me realize that we never really know how different things can be, changing one small thing into the past. Who knows, this could change the course of events to such an extent that I would not recognize my son's father. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who has a moment in the past that they want to change. Be careful what you ask for !!!
