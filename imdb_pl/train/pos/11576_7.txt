He's trying to be an epic adventure of the century. And thanks to the cast of Sh≈ç Kasugi, Christopher Lee and John-Rhys Davies, this is a really great B adventure of all time. This is a really cool adventure, which even with its drawbacks attracts your interest. For the people who created it, it must have seemed the biggest movie in history. Even if it was created in the 90s, there is no modern look. This more has the same impression as the old film by Errol Flynn. A great adventure movie is again a big thing in Hollywood, but I'm afraid that feeling in them will never be the same as in old movies. This, on the other hand, has a real feeling. You can not hate it. I think it's a good adventure movie. And I really love the soundtrack. Shit, I want a theme song.
