I never understand why the MacDonald-Eddy swan song has always been so merciless - not only by their critics, but by virtually everyone. For me, "I Married an Angel" is more vivid and ingenious than any of the more well-known concerts of the duo. Sets and costumes are as generous as in MGM music, the script comes from the reliable Anita Loos ("San Francisco", "Women", "Gentlemen, prefer blondes" etc.), Rodgers and Hart melodies (though slightly modified by MacDonald-Eddy patrons) Bob Wright and Chet Forrest) receive the celestial treatment of Herbert Stothart (Oscar winner for recording the "Wizard of Oz"), and above all "singing beloved" look great in their contemporary clothes and seem to have fun with bizarre proceedings. Try to show "Rose Marie" or "Sweethearts" to the uninitiated today and may have difficulty sitting still, but this unconventional, fast fantasy certainly enjoys.
