This is the best dub I've ever heard from Disney, as well as the best adaptation since the biggest abuse on the soundtrack, themes, characters, dialogues in the Kiki Delivery Service. Urrrghhh <br /> <br /> This one has a different atmosphere, especially the deviation from the usual heroine. This one has both a hero and a heroine (although I really do not support the use of the hero and heroine here, because Miyazaki has nothing to do with the stereotype and the common motive). As usual, after entering by Spirited away, amazed Mononoke, worried Grave of Fireflies and deeply touched by Majo no Takkyuubin, this one start with a little doubt. Wondering if this will be Ghibi's first misfire. Well, in the end like Only Yesterday and Whisper of the Heart, it ended up giving 10 points. I would give 9.8, but an additional 0.2 is to share a good feeling, encouraging people to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> SPOILER Somehow I see it as a sad movie, people are dying in this lonely robot, abandoned place and ends in destruction. It's as if humanity really could not live with too much power. The falling scene gave me patches to finish Metropolis. It's just sad. The plot is also visible in most reviews and rules of the soundtrack (as always). Joe Hisaishi really belongs to Uematsu, Kanno, Williams. People who can enliven a movie, a game, an event, and even stay moments thanks to an amazing composition. <br /> <br /> a movie that once was part of the American cinema in classic days (this is a great life, etc.). Well, things are changing ....
