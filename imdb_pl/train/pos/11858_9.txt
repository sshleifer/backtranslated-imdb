this movie is just great. if you have a chance to see it, you should run it. Although the movie has almost nothing to do with the original from 1932, Pacino is doing very well playing Tony Montana to get around. they make it sound great. if you thought that Pulp Fiction is good with curses (if you saw it), you should also see Scarface to see a different angle, how an actor can say it. (it's pretty sweet) <br /> <br /> even if the movie has a lot of action, and the plot is moving very fast over time, not keeping the right aspect ratio, it's still easy to follow, but you always have to have eyes wide open to lose nothing. I personally found out that watching this movie makes three hours seem like a breeze, it's really so great. <br /> <br /> this movie is one of the films that are so well preserved and directed that you not only forgot that this movie was created in the bad 80's, but it really makes you eradicate the evil guy ... "Then say goodnight to BAD"
