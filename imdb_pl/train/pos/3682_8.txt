Often, these kinds of films are a mixed bag of great work with a slight tremor to fill the runtime. Regardless of whether it is support for big names or the project itself, Paris je t'aime never falls into this sphere. I believe that I can really say that the film as a whole is better than its parts. Between miraculous transitions and a fantastic ending sequence, combining the characters together in one last look at love in Paris, I think that the film would suffer if any cog was removed. It's true that there are certainly a few exceptions that outshone the rest, but in the end I have a permanent picture, even after only a fraction of a second of every short vignette. Love takes many forms, and talent here grows to surprise and move the audience through the poetry of haircuts and the elegance of many aspects of emotions. <br /> <br /> Quartier des Enfants Rouges: Maggie Gyllenhaal surprises as a drug - she has completed the photos of an actress in Paris and a meeting with her dealer. The discovery leaves a bit of balance when the infatuation between the two changes hands. <br /> <br /> Quatier Latin: Ben Gazzara and Gena Rowlands (reproducing the account of the old Cassavettes movie?) They bring a great sharp wit and sarcasm when they meet to discuss the upcoming divorce. What about their conversation is true, and what's just angry with the other, it's all nice, leaving a smile on your face. <br /> <br /> Quais de Seine: Director Gurinder Chadha gives us a touching portrait of love existing beyond religious and racial differences. It is a sweet little story about shy love between two people who apparently feel the relationship but can not express it fully. <br /> <br /> Tour Eiffel: I will be disappointed that Sylvain Chomet did not receive an animated sequence together, but this live story about the mimes in love with the Paris prison has the same bizarre nature as his film Les Triplettes de Belleville. <br /> <br /> Tuileries: Coen brothers stick to a strange sense of humor and sing some laughter. Steve Buscemi really shines and sells the performance without a word. His facial reactions to the verbal insults of the dissatisfied Frenchman are priceless. <br /> <br /> Bastille: Here is a poignant portrait of a couple about love just to return in the face of tragedy. Sergio Castellitto and Miranda Richardson move when the couple struggles with the problems and discovers how strong the bond of true love is. <br /> <br /> Pére-Lachaise: a surprisingly funny story from Wes Craven's horror movie. A little of Oscar Wilde's humor can give lightness to any relationship. <br /> <br /> Parc Monceau: Alfonso Cuarón wants to practice amazing, long moments that he perfects in "Children of Men", talking about two lovers in love, walking at the end of the street. When Nick Nolte and Ludivine Sagnier finally come together, we also find the real context of their conversation about "forbidden love". <br /> <br /> Porte de Choisy: a very surreal look at the charm of Paris. This is probably the most strange entry, but so intriguing that you can not look away from madness. Do not be angry with your Asian beautician, whatever you do. <br /> <br /> Pigalle: An interesting look at the relationship going through roles that seems to stagnate for years. Small diversity from Bob Hoskins is necessary to light a fire. <br /> <br /> Quartier de la Madeleine: Even the vampires in Paris can find love in the hours of feeding. I do not know whether to be pleased with Elijah Wood or not. Beautifully filmed and silenced to allow the blood to flow red, this short is strange, but just like love. <br /> <br /> 14. arrondissement: leave Aleksander Payne's strange sense of humor to really add some depth to this story with the teacher telling the American in Paris to find out what love is. Her sharp, uneducated Frenchman is a very sharp contrast with the authentic accents we have listened to until then? He just floated away enough to be both funny and completely faithful stories. <br /> <br /> Montmartre: An interesting introduction to the proceedings. Paris can be a city tormented by everyday activities such as finding a parking space, but when love is discovered, it will take its prisoner anywhere to continue the journey. <br /> <br /> Loin du 16éme: Catalina Sandino Moreno perfectly shows what love for a child is her subtle performance, because the story is sung by a small child, but each time completely different. <br /> <br /> Place des Fetes: My favorite story about this group. Seydou Boro and Aïssa Maïga are simply fantastic. The cyclical nature of the story and how fate brings the two characters together, so that Boro finally asked her for coffee, it is difficult to see. Sometimes love at your last moment is enough to accept leaving this earth. <br /> <br /> Place des Victoires: One of the best stories about a mother trying to cope with the death of her young son. Juliette Binoche is devastating like a mother, desperately looking for her son, and Willem Dafoe is strangely perfect as a cowboy who gives her a chance. <br /> <br /> Faubourg Saint-Denis: Sometimes you have to think about losing love, to accept that you have not been fully invested in a relationship. Melchior Beslon remembers trying to find a place where it went wrong, through a series of sharp, quick cuts from meeting Natalie Portman to "see" how much she needs. <br /> <br /> Le Marais: Leave it to Gus Van Sant will show us the story about the communication and understanding gap, because his films almost always refer to some form of alienation. His photographer from the Elephant is an American working in Paris, which is the catalyst for the artistic journeys of Gaspard Ulliel on love and his soulmates. Sometimes you do not need to know what is being said to understand what is going on during breaks.
