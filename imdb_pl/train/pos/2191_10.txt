Shakespeare said we're actors in a great scene. But when this stage is Israel, the work we interpret is multiplying by ten, and all the activities we do are full of hard style. Dan Katzir manages to make a spectacular portrait of a part of life in Tel Aviv, but besides, Katzir manages to penetrate the heart of the Israeli nation, and these people, far from being simple figures, speak to us from the heart. Katzira's film allows Israel to escape from the dark, informative heart in which they live, and this magnificent land arises in the light as a magnificent bird that is born of its ashes. This is very important to me, because the reality of the state of Israel, which Europeans only know for information dailies or newspapers, appears as a close and absolutely human reality, the reality of millions of people who are looking for their place, exploring the whole state, the whole culture with the sole purpose to feel part of this. Katzir creates an absolutely wonderful document and demonstrates that when a man is passionate, the strongest feelings are displayed with force, and these feelings go beyond our hearts. Thank you Dan for open eyes and gives us one of the most beautiful portraits of the most wonderful countries in the world.
