"Atlantis" is a new and proper step for the Disney function. It is a good choice to make a film of such a mysterious legend as "Atlantis". I did not have any expectations for this movie, but after seeing it I do not quite understand why this movie had such bad reviews. Even in my country the reviewers were not positive. <br /> <br /> "Atlantis" is not a perfect movie, but still one of the biggest Disney, I even doubt if this film ever gains the reputation of "classic Disney". This is another matter. It's funny to think that this science-fiction movie was directed by the same directors as "Beauty and the Beast" and "Hunchback" (so Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale are trying to escape the reputation of their monstrous films, he he, I'm only żartuję. <br /> <br /> Well, so many nonsenses. "Atlantis" is a movie that you can watch, excite and is very pleasant, even this movie is an action movie with a rating of PG, in my opinion also for children (parents, who mean the opposite, do not kill me for writing this, he on). <br /> <br /> the story is a bit predictable, but it will not ruin the movie. The comic book-inspired animation is suitable for the movie and will depart from the usual Disney style It's colorful, dark and detailed.The sequences of Deep Canvas are impressive.The film is sometimes funny, even I was more giggling than I was laughing through the film. (SPOILERS) The characters of this film are also very nice, but unfortunately it is not the amount of time on the screen to get to know everyone, so some characters stay (SPOILERS). <br /> <br /> The result of James Newton Howard is absolutely great. It's bold and exotic. (SPOILER) The most impressive in this film is how it makes the Atlantic language sound very natural, ethnic and authentic. It's really amazing (SPOILERS OVER) <br /> <br /> The script is tight and well written, but there are still some questions left unanswered in history. Fortunately, there are not so many of them. <br /> <br /> So, are you a grace for yourself, do not listen to reviewers and watch "Atlantis" because it's waiting for you ...
