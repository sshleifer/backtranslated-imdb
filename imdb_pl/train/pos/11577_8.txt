It was a really cool movie. It only proves that you do not need stupid little things like continuity and scripts to make a movie. He travels continents in a few seconds, people are shot and nothing happens to them, swords burned, samuari fight on sinking galleons, David Essex is the embodiment of slimey villainy, and John Rhys Davies is just a guest. I liked this movie, but I like s ** t movies, this is a great example of a movie that just KICKS ASS. If you like Battlefield Earth, you'll love this movie, its dizziness, its fast, its stupid, its samuaraitastic !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> It also looks as if it was created in 1972
