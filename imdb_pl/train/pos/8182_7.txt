Director Brian Yuzna had an uneven career in the genre of horror films, creating masterpieces such as "Return of the Living Dead 3" or "Bride of Re-Animator", but he also made horrible films such as "Faust: Love for the Damned" or the average "Progeny ". It is obviously better at the headquarters of the producer, in which his work producing films by Stuart Gordon was great. <br /> <br /> "Dentist", is one of his smaller works as a director, but the low profile brings benefits to the film and his lack of grudges makes it a very pleasant experience. He tells the story of Dr. Alan Feinstone (played excellently by Corbin Bernsen), a successful dentist who one day discovers that his perfect life is not as perfect as he thought when he discovers that his beautiful wife (Linda Hoffman) ) has an affair with her boyfriend from the pool. This incident disturbs his mind and puts him in a murderous madness when he takes revenge in the world for being so "dirty". <br /> <br /> The assumption is very well handled by Yuzna, who takes us on a ride after the day of Feinstone's revenge. What distinguishes this film from others is that we are not in the perspective of sacrifice, we follow Feinstone, because he is the main character. We are witnessing how it goes from a respected professional to a mental murder in one day. Yuzna manages to give the film the exact amount of tension, but adds a good dose of dark humor that really helps the movie. <br /> <br /> Most of the success of the assumption lies in Bernsen's performance as Feinstone. It can make you feel compassion and hatred at the same time, and the subtle humor of his character is another aspect that supports the film. The rest of the cast is not so good and I think that their sub-action harms the film more than it should. A notable exception is Ken Foree, as a detective trying to catch Feinstone. Although its part is quite small, it works great with it. <br /> <br /> With the dentist as a killer, blood scenes are expected, and Brian Yuzna delivers great SFX in the right amount. It is good to see that he does not approach him as usual, and I dare say that this is the most important part of the film. It has exactly the amount of gore that is expected, nothing less and nothing more. Yuzna refrained from his common excesses and the result is great. <br /> <br /> Although this is not one of Yuzna's best-known films, I would say that this is one of his best. Of course, this is not a classic material as his masterpiece, but it is a movie that entertains and is never tiring or boring. It's a low-budget, simple movie, but from what it is, I think it's shocked. 7/10
