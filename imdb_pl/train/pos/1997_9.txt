As a longtime fan of Dickens, I was invariably disappointed with the adaptations of his novels. <br /> <br /> Although his works presented an extremely accurate repetition of human life at every level in Victorian Britain, it was all a pervasive humor, which can be both funny and sarcastic, as narrated. In a sense, he was a cartoonist and a cartoonist. In the same sentence, he could be serious and funny. He cursed pride, offended arrogance, celebrated modesty, and emanated loneliness and poverty. It may be a clich√©, but he was a folk writer. <br /> <br /> And this is a comedy that is often lacking in his interpretations. At the time of writing, Oliver Twist is featured on the BBC television series. All misery and cruelty are theirs, but not humor, irony and wild scourge. The result is simply dark, gloomy experience: a story written by a journalist, not a novelist. This is not Dickens at all. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, "Oliver!" It's much closer to the mark. Mockery of officiality is perfectly interpreted, from a nasty beadle to a drunken judge. The classic distance between the pearl and Mr. Brownlow, in which the law is described as "butt, idiot", could not be better. Harry Secombe is the perfect choice. <br /> <br /> But there is also blinding cruelty, soulless indifference of the state, cold, hunger, poverty and loneliness are presented just as surely as the Master would like. <br /> <br /> And then there is a crime. Ron Moody is a treasure as a dingy Jewish fence, while Oliver Reid has Bill Sykes to perfection. <br /> <br /> It is perhaps no wonder that Lionel Bart - a Jew himself from the east end of London - has the freedom to reinterpret Fagin as a more gentle guy than Dicken's original. In the novel he was absolutely ruthless, sending some of his boys to the gallows to protect himself (though he was also caught and hanged). While the film portrays him as a wayward father-figure, a kind of charitable thief, not child corruption, the latter has long been an anti-Semitic sentiment. Otherwise, very few liberties are used with the original Dickens. The set contains all the most memorable elements. There is enough threat and violence to ensure loyalty to the narrative while allowing children to be sensitive. Nancy is still beaten to death, the Bullseye narrowly escapes drowning, and Bill Sykes gets a lively graphical advantage. <br /> <br /> Each song is perfect, although it is leaning towards schmaltz. Mark Lester mimics wonderfully. Both his and my favorite scene is the one in which the world comes alive "who will buy". It's nasty, but this is Dickens. <br /> <br /> I can go on. I can praise wonderful works of art, the contrast of the rich and the poor. There are more excellent actors than British regulars than you could throw a stick. <br /> <br /> I should give him 10 points, but I feel more like Scrooge today. Eat Christmas dinner. No original was made better.
