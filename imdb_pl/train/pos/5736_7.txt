Dumland focuses on the life of one (American?) Family ... Father; a brutal and obscene person who loves to fart and use profanity and who has no redemption traits. Mother; who seems to be paranoid, he never really says much. Son; vague annoying repetitive little guy. Animation is simple and primitive, but it complements stories and characters. The episodes were originally available only at davidlynch.com, but have now been released on DVD. There are 8 episodes on the album, followed by a short summary: <br /> <br /> 1- The Neighbor: We meet a neighbor from the neighborhood and find out about him three things ... he has a really nice shed, he has only one hand and he likes to do naughty things with ducks. <br /> <br /> 2- Treadmill: We learn that the wife has affinity for exercise, but the husband does not really think it's a good idea. In the end, the treadmill wins. <br /> <br /> 3- Doctor: The father has an accident with an exposed cord ... the doctor's examination is quite accurate (if not unconventional), but the diagnosis is "you are completely normal" (but we knew that). <br /> <br /> 4- Friend Visits: After a quarrel with a new clothes jack, a friend comes to us (believe it or not, he has one! but after we meet him, we can understand why), no surprises, when he tells us what his hobby is. <br /> <br /> 5- Get The Stick: We meet another neighbor, he has a stick in his mouth (although we will never know how it got there). Unfortunately, removing the stick from the neighbor's mouth becomes more difficult (and more violent) than expected ... but in the end it wins ... Jesus some people may be ungrateful !!! <br /> <br /> 6- My teeth bleed: It was my favorite episode ... and it was the most disturbingly repetitive and annoying (hmm, what does it say about me ??). I'm not sure why my son's teeth started to bleed, but believe me when I say it was minimal to the plot. What an oxymoron, because history did not have a story. But he had a funny ending (with the participation of a fly) !! <br /> <br /> 7- Uncle Bob: After meeting Uncle Bob and my uncle Bob's wife, we have the distinct impression that the Dumbland gene pool is very shallow. Uncle Bob is a sick man (I will not take care of it, not to ruin it). Uncle Bob's wife definitely wears pants in her family ... and my father definitely ends up on the wrong side of her large fist (and spends the rest of the visit crouched on a tree in the yard). <br /> <br /> 8- Ants: After the house has been infiltrated by the ants, and an unsuccessful attempt to splash them will fail ... it ends up spraying the bug worms in the face and starts hallucinating. Ants perform a fantastic song and dance show ... gets mad, trying to kill them, curls up in a cast of the whole body ... and let's say, the ants finally got their revenge. <br /> <br /> As bad as these stories, there is something that compels me to watch them. They give another insight into the mind of one of my favorite directors. David Lynch. Maybe they were an outlet for him, to get rid of some of his violent thoughts? I really laugh aloud in many episodes. Many aspects are ridiculously fun !!
