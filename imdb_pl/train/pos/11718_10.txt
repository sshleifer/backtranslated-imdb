Those who love Elivra, as I did in her late night chores, will love this movie - she's just cool - her car is great, and she's a bit of Transylvanian Dolly Parton - sometimes she's so innocent and naive and sexy all the time - plus, more than a bit of Mae West - <br /> <br /> The sets are also well made, and the comic cast is great, with Edie McClurg at its best - plus Sally Kellerman as Patty is funny. Every time I have to do something to recharge something, I'll think about how Elvira chrupie potato chips - <br /> <br /> This film should be watched again and again - just for fun. Now, I have to shoot the next part of the movie, Haunted Hills Elvira, and see if it survives ----
