I went to this movie expecting an artistic horrible movie. What I got was terrifying in fear. It's a horror movie in its core. It is not boring like other horror movies in which the haunted house has ghosts and gore. This film does not even show the majority of deaths that show fear of heroes. I think that one of the best things in this concept is that it is not just the house that haunts those who enter the house. They become haunted no matter where they are. Office buildings, police stations, hotel rooms ... etc. After reading some external reviews, I'm really surprised that the critics did not like this movie. I'll see it again this week and I'm excited about it. <br /> <br /> I gave the film 10 stars because it did what horror should do. It frightened me.
