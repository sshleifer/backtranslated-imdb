It's a great documentary. Every car racing fan should have a copy of this great movie. Director "Stephen Low" did a great job, as did the main movie stars, Father and son, Mario and Michael Andretti. The DVD looks and sounds amazing. And what is the most important is IMAX! A great home cinema test disc.
