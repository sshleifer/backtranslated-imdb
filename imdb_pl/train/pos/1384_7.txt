This film, also known as "Water Lilies", tells the story of two girls who are fighting for a world of love and sex. This story is told at a slow pace and works very well. It gives you plenty of time and space to get to know different characters and get attached to them. <br /> <br /> Using a small cast exerts additional pressure on people playing, because everyone has more time than normal, but people playing in this movie are doing well with it. Everyone is completely reliable. The visual setting is great, especially the underwater shots in the pool add a nice effect. <br /> <br /> Many films have been made on the same subject, but this one really does not stand out from any of them. It draws out some "standard" pressure methods from a high hat and works on them. It is not bad, it is not at all, but it is certainly not great either and I feel it could have been better if it took a little less studied angles. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 synchronous swimmers
