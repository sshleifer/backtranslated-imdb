My personal opinion is that this movie did not have a real plot for the first vampire John Carpenter, but I do not care. Jon Bon Jovi (Derek) was great in this film. He really pissed me off that he was a person you would never have thought he was a famous ROCKSTAR. There were a few bad things in this movie. As in the case of the story, there should be something more in the film. There should be a continuation of the movie that followed the plot of the movie and they should have kept the same main characters in all three vampire movies. I really liked the clothes people wore and the place they chose in Mexico. I liked how old Mexico was, not the new Mexico. with clay houses and old fashionable churches. I was a little confused with vampires and how they could walk in the churches, but it was fun if they did not follow the rules of Dracula's vampire.
