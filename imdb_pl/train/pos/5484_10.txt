This film is basically a document of a chronologically ordered series of events that took place from April 10, 2002. Until April 14, 2002, in the Venezuelan Presidential Palace in Caracas Venezuela. <br /> <br /> The pathos of the film are real and you feel the pain, sadness and joy of people who survived this failed coup of President Hugo Chavez. <br /> <br /> It is a departure from watching this movie that Hugo Chavez is really a great historical figure. Hugo Chavez's personality alone led the Venezuelan people to overthrow the 3-day old junta installed in the army and restore the democratically installed government of Venezuela. <br /> <br /> The footage shows that George W Bush helped and incited the Venezuelan coup d'Ã©tat. The fact that the mainstream media helped and instigated George W. Bush is not surprising. <br /> <br /> It is surprising how few people have seen this movie and how few people are aware of the total corruption of the American media. <br /> <br /> It was only 20 years before Ronald Reagan eliminated the Doctrine of Integrity in 1986 to change America in a blind state and without a helm. <br /> <br /> Let Hugo Chavez open the eyes of patriotic Americans to the truth and beauty of a real American vision.
