Possible SPOILERS: Nie wiem <br /> <br /> Watching The Lion King 1 1/2, I could not resist the impression of a mixed mood on the whole movie. This is definitely a good way to spend about an hour and 15 minutes. But there is nothing in it that would give you the same feeling as the Lion King. The story for those who have not read other reviews is about how Timon and Pumba meet and how they influence events in the original King of Lions. <br /> <br /> They are actually very funny jokes in the movie. My favorite part is to show a couple bringing up Simba. However, for me the worst must be the moments in which Timon and Pumba directly interfere in the events of the original. I can never look at the sequences of "Circle of Life" or "Can You Feel the Love Tonight" in the same way (I'm okay with the sequence "I Just Can not Wait to be King"). <br /> <br /> Voice talents are excellent. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella do a great job, like Matthew Broderick, a guy who does Rafiki, and hyenas. Even the actor who makes the young Simba sounded like Jonathon Taylor Thomas. But why did they even include a voice actor in Zazu? He literally only had 2 lines and none of them was very much needed. The additions of Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller just add talent, although you still do not hear Momon's voice and do not think about Marge Simpson. <br /> <br /> There are scenes that do not seem to match the original, the one that comes to mind when at the end is pride. How did they have time to fit in the initial fight against hyenas? <br /> <br /> As for the DVD itself, one can not help but think that for a set of 2 discs, special functions are especially lacking. It could easily fit a comment or other aspect ratio on the first disc. I liked the game "Who wants to be the king of the jungle", even if it's the most shameful example of cross-promotion I've ever seen. Some questions are really difficult. <br /> <br /> In general, a good movie, though not as good as TLK or even TLK2.
