It was undoubtedly the most disturbing movie I've ever seen. The first part of the film, although strange, has a light and fun quality. The journey starts with such a calm note that emphasizes and highlights the beauty of the Appalachian hills. But this is confusing beyond conviction. Obvious social problems (inbreeding) and deformations of rural residents are just the first disturbing aspects of the film. I still hear Bobby moan in pain and I shudder at the thought. Lewis's leg tired me. Although the film was generally very disturbing and disturbing, he asked interesting questions. When is moral or the right to life of another person? What can in some cases induce us to morality? Is moral dignity and integrity more important than life itself? Regardless of the conclusions that can be drawn from the film, it is an achievement in itself (despite some aspects that were terribly real and macabre).
