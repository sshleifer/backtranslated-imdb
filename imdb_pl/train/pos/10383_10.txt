I saw this movie in 1976, my first year in New York. I lived there for the next 26 years, but I've never seen anything as delicate and beautiful as this little TV movie. I was part of the PBS series, as I remember, and I never forgot. <br /> <br /> There are no sexual scenes to talk about, only delicate, moving, extremely touching moments full of tension and excitement, all within the conservative, Boston (I think) environment of the First World War, in which women played the role of a devoted wife awaiting her husband's return from the war and not seeking a career and financial independence. Frances Lee McCain is great as a career photographer and I spent the next 30 years looking for her in equally difficult roles, but to no avail. <br /> <br /> There must be a movie from this movie? Sure, it should be on DVD, but certainly at least on the film?
