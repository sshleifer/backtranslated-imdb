Sitcom revolved around a girl who must learn to take responsibility for her own actions. Because she had the power of magic, she often used it to help her loved ones, often leading to literal puns that are often catastrophic and always humorous. <br /> <br /> The program began with the adventures of Sabrina in high school in the fictional town of Westbridge, near Boston, Massachusetts (as opposed to Greendale in the comic). In the following seasons of the series, Sabrina graduated from high school and enrolled in university, and then she attempted independent living and working in a local newspaper. Breaking away from his comic roots, the show ended with Sabrina's marriage, although she eventually abandoned the wedding and fled with Harvey. <br /> <br /> Many episodes are related to the fact that Sabrina meets by nature or supernatural means popular music artists of that time, including Coolio, Violent Femmes, Backstreet Boys, Phantom Planet, Davy Jones from The Monkees, Britney Spears, Avril Lavigne, Daniel Bedingfield, Hanson, Eden's Crush, Savage Garden "N Sync and Ashanti. Course of Nature, a band by then-boy Melissa Joan Hart (now husband) Marek Wilkerson, appeared in the episode in 2002.
