It seems that this movie has no basis! Most of them take place in a dream and, like most dreams, it is often stupid and illogical. It is also a great production with some great songs and great performances, especially by our angel. <br /> <br /> Mortal, unconscious insults and various other faux pas at the reception of dreams are fun, and her jitterbug from Binnie Barnes is a surprise and delight. At some point, you can sing a fragment from Carmen, and then the last trio Faust (for some strange reason he keeps the dog), and then "Aloha Oe" on the beach! <br /> <br /> It's a surreal comedy - incredibly funny, if you can get to the rhythm.
