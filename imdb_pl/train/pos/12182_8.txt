I did not do any research on the film before the first watch, because it was part of the Welles cart box I had recently bought. A box set that I got mainly because I wanted to have A Man For All Seasons and also re-evaluate Waterloo. So I keep Orson and Rita in the player and I'm treated like class and confusion in equal measure. <br /> <br /> At first glance, the story seemed simple, the man meets a wonderful woman and saves her from a bandit couple, they immediately click, and the man gets a job offer on a cruise with a woman and her famous husband lawyer, then ............. <br /> <br /> .. becomes the mystery of the murder of created devilry and many shenanigans. Michael O'Hara (Orson Welles himself) does not really know what's going on, he's just as lost as a spectator, and it's wonderful when you watch him over and over like everyone in the movie. Of course, pulling the heart through the femme fatale about the beauty of Elsa Bannister (Rita Hayworth) has its moments, but you just know that everything goes pear-shaped. <br /> <br /> So many great things in the movie have it Welles's visual style, see the scene in the aquarium, which is wonderful, and the final sequences in the fun house are majestic in the eye. Narrative O'Hara is joyful and he's got a good relief in court proceedings with Everett Sloane. <br /> <br /> However, the movie is bizarre, and it's really an unstable viewing experience, because, as I found out, studio bosses cut out the movie for almost an hour, and this not only frustrates the viewer, but unfairly on Welles's vision. I am convinced that the full original version of this film would be praised and respected wholesale, because it is a very good and intriguing movie that unfortunately only indicates the love, but it remains a devilishly addictive movie that I am happy to be able to come back. 8.5 / 10
