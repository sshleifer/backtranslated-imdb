What a cool movie! If you're a Giallo fan, the Red Queen Kills 7 Times is a real winner. First of all, it's hard to go wrong with Barbara Bouchet and Marina Malfatti in the same Giallo. Both are wonderful - especially the innocent Bouchet with wide eyes, as a woman with guilt, worried about her life. Scenes of killing in the Red Queen Kills 7 Times are especially nice and contain enough blood to please most fans. One of the first murders comes quite unexpectedly and really makes the film start well. The killer, The Red Queen, is one of the most stunning and interesting murderers I've seen in an Italian film. Sets and fashion from the 70s are great. In fact, all the visuals are interesting, and the laughing Red Queen runs through the bridge at night, being one of my favorite moments in the movie. This intricate intrigue interested me all the time. Finally, Bruno Nicolai's result may be the best I've heard from the composer. The main theme is so memorable that I was unable to get it out of my head for two days. <br /> <br /> The only two problems that I have with the Red Queen Kills 7 Times are in the final of the movie. First of all, the person responsible for the murders is too easy to notice. If you've seen more than a pair of Gialli, you will have no problem determining who is behind the killings. Secondly, the ending seems a bit too hasty and as a result is a bit confusing. I'm definitely not the one who needs every storyline that I give, but I must admit that I can not explain it. The second display can explain this.
