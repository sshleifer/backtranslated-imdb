Born in Berlin in 1942, Margarethe von Trotta was an actress and now she is a very important director and writer. It has been described, perhaps even unfairly caricatured as a director, whose involvement in bringing woman's sensitivity to the screen outweighs her artistic power. "Rosenstrasse", which brought mixed and even strange reviews (the New York Times article was one of the most negative reviews I've ever read in this article), is not the perfect movie. This is a great film and testimony of the rare coexistence of a successful opposition to the genocidal Nazi regime of all nations, generally powerless Germans demonstrating on Berlin's street. <br /> <br /> The co-founder von Trotta uses a real incident at Rosenstrasse in the context of a young woman's search for information about her mother's never-to-be-born child as a child in the German capital during World War II. <br /> <br /> Ruth Weinstein's husband (Jutta Lampe) died and in a surprising return to the orthodox Jewish lifestyle, apparently suspended so far, Ruth not only "sits shivah" (weekly Jewish funeral ritual), but insists on adhering to the strict prohibitions of his faith. Her apartment in New York reflects the wealth provided by her spouse's work. Her American-born daughter Hannah (Maria Schrader) and her brother are somewhat discouraged by the mother's takeover of restrictive orthodox Jewish practices, but they fall. The mother refuses the presence of her fianc√© Hannah, a non-Jew named Luis (Fedja van Huet). The home crisis may break out when Ruth warns her that she will renounce Hannah if she does not give up her beloved handsome Louis. Stay alert. <br /> <br /> Cousin arrives to pay her respects, and also gives directions to Hanna about the war mystery about her mother's childhood in Berlin. Hannah is intrigued - she asks her mother, who strongly refuses to discuss this part of her life. This is very, very realistic. I grew up with my parents who fled Nazi Germany just in time and knew many children whose families, in full but in part, escaped the Holocaust. These days simply have not been discussed. <br /> <br /> So Hannah, learning that the German gentile saved Ruth's life, goes to Berlin in the hope that the savior is still breathing. If it was not, it would be a very short movie. But Ruth, pretending to be a historian, locates 90-year-old Lena Fischer (Doris Schade), now a widow. Lena tells her story of how happy conversations, but shaken by repressed memories, the scenes change quite smoothly between today's Berlin and the capital of war times. <br /> <br /> Young Lena from 1943 (Katja Riemann) was an excellent pianist wife of Jewish violinist Fabian Fischer (Martin Feifel). With the advent of the Nazi regime, he had to use "Israel" as a second name, just as Jewish women had to add "Sara" to their names (by the way, I would like IMDb not to name Fabian on the false list) Israel " preserves the Nazi name used as a sign of classification and degradation. " <br /> <br /> While the Germans deported most of the Jewish population to concentration camps, those married to the "Aryans" were released. Once. Until 1943, when the regime decided to take them (the majority were men, the minority were Jewish women married to non-Jews). The roundtable is shown here in all its terrifying intensity. <br /> <br /> Lena tries to locate her husband. She and many other women know that they are locked in a building at Rosenstrasse. A crowd of restless women gather, some pitifully seek help from German officers who predictably refuse to help, and verbally abuse them ("Loving Whore", which is one of the names). As a hint, Lena adopts an eight-year-old Ruth, who hid when her mother was kidnapped (remember, Ruth is now in Manhattan). Ruth's child presents himself very well in the role of Svei Lohde. <br /> <br /> Through increasingly angry protests, women finally won. Men and a handful of women are fired. Just like in the true history that the Nazis surrendered, one of the rare, almost unprecedented times when the madmen recognized defeat in their murderous agenda (another was the ending of the euthanasia campaign to free the Reich from mental defects and chronic invalids, but that's another story). <br /> <br /> Von Trotta builds tension, and the history of every woman is both personal and universal. Hannah still produces aging Lena, who is slowly gathering, he begins to suspect that he is not dealing with an ordinary historian, but rather with someone who has to find out about the girl she saved, the child whose mother was murdered. <br /> <br /> The contrasts between Rosenstrasse in 1943, a set and street today in a vibrant, rebuilt, unified Berlin are a repetitive thematic element. Today's Berlin bears heritage, but not the scars of a monstrous past. Von Trotta does it very well. <br /> <br /> The main actors are equally impressive. Lena's husband, though strong, also turns out to be completely helpless in the trap of imprisonment with the probable prospect of deportation (which, as you can see, has been understood by all characters - including the local police and army - as a one-way journey into oblivion). Elder Ruth is catalytically forced to confront the demons who have long suppressed in their happy New York. Hannah is very credible as a young woman whose father's death evokes the need to discover her family's past. These things happen (though the Times critic does not seem to know that). <br /> <br /> Von Trotty's hand is sure but not perfect. The scene with Goebbels in the evening enjoying Lena's violin is unnecessary and distracting. The suggestion that she could go to sleep with the propaganda minister, the most fanatical worshiper of Hitler at the highest level to save her husband, diminishes the wonderful achievement of demonstrating spouses and relatives. Most of the German officers come from the central cast and are formed by the school of the Teutonic malice of Erich von Stroheim. But that's understandable. <br /> <br /> The history of Rosenstrasse has been the subject of books and articles, and some argue that this is a paradigm argument for arguing that many Jews could have been saved if more Germans protested. Unfortunately, this argument is nonsense. The German women who occupied Rosenstrasse were deep and understandable. Most Germans were on the line between passive and virulent anti-Semitism. That is why the Rosenstrasse protest was virtually single. Regardless of whether you are buying or rejecting Goldenhagen's thesis that most Germans were eager for accomplices of real murderers, it can not be denied that before the Nazi endemic anti-Semitism a malicious strain erupted from 1933. <br /> <br /> older Lena notes that what women achieved was a "ray of light" at the wrong time. Most of the men and women who grew out of a journey near death survived the war. So the "ray of light" was von Trotta's film, which is a lantern of illumination showing that some were saved thanks to the courage of most ordinary women, and for every saved life there is an opportunity to celebrate. And it will always be. <br /> <br /> 9/10
