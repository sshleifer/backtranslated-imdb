Yes, Giorgio, it's a good movie. A little romance, great music, beautiful landscapes, comedy (great fight for food) and a bit bittersweet taste are the ingredients of Yes, Giorgio. Every film lover will enjoy this movie. Those who require huge special effects should look elsewhere. Most of us need some escape from time to time and how to do it better than a feast for the eyes, ears and heart? You must see!
