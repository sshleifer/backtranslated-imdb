This film captures the absurd essence of the authoritarian American patriot actor - the one who believes that his work (and politics) are just as important to the American people as the opinions of the president himself. Alan Bates has perfectly captured this thinking as Michael Baytes, and I will immortally remember Bates as this character. This is a film for Canadians and Americans. It is a valuable piece of cinema that is able to take the audience through the magic of making a film and reveal how easy it is for the producer and director to lose control over the actors' will and innumerable external forces. Wonderfully, "Hollywood North" does not suffer from the subject, which presents: Peter O'Brian directs with precision and total control, and commands both serious "behind the scenes" part of the film and film inside the movie "Flight to Bogota" with clarity and insight . If you're interested in the wit and power of Canadian cinema, "Hollywood North" is a great place to start.
