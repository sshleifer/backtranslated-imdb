Ah, the musical Kelly / Sinatra costume. Yes, friend, right? Yes, but you usually do not hear about it. In this way in the city. But if you stick, you can learn something. Well, probably not. In any case, Anchors Aweigh tells the story of two sailors during a three- or four-day holiday. Joe is a "sea wolf," and Clarence, a book type, begs Joe to give him a "dame." Now, after being picked up by coppers, they take the little Donald home. There, they meet Susie, this tempter, it's a jew. Just kidding! Clarence falls in love with her. At least he thinks so. Is he right? Or is it a moron? Or is it simply misleading the public? Learn more and more when you watch ANCHORS AWEIGH's fanfare! <br /> <br /> P.S. If you want to see that Kathryn Grayson is not disgustingly sweet, try Kiss Me Kate (1953).
