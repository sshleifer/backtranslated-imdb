James Dickey is a wonderfully described author. When someone reads "Liberation", he is immediately transferred to the lush reaches of the Deep South. When we look at the film version of John Boorman's book, we realize how he accurately reflects the essence of the book. The camera is as descriptive as the narrative. The characters are fully realized, and the portraits are fantastic. I saw the film for the first time in 1992, after the first year of study. I was in a phase where I watched films that were released in the first few years of my birth in 1973. Among them were Patton, Papillon and All the President's Men; good movies, all of them. This one was easily a classy group. That says a lot.
