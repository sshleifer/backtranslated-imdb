"Victor does not have much, but that does not stop him from trying to leave Judy, the prettiest girl in the block. He only has hope and a one-bedroom apartment that he shares with his family. His grandmother has no trust in him, his brother honors him, and his step-sister just announced war, but Victor thinks that love can really overcome everything in this warm, authentic and touching romantic comedy about life in this part of the city that most people never does not see "to summarize the DVD cover. <br /> <br /> Peter Sollett '"Raising Victor Vargas" evokes immersive "appearances" of the main actor Victor Rasuka (as Victor Vargas) and cast. Mr. Rasuk and juicy Judy Marte (as Judy Gonzalez) are sexy and endearing as "Lower East Side Kids" discovering the joy of the sexual train. Considering how attractive they look in this picture, it's not hard to predict that they've joined - and although one may wonder how truly "innocent" they are, their characteristics seem real. <br /> <br /> Victor's brother "Nino" is played by real brother Victor, Silvestre Rasuk, who looks at the role his older brother plays. Sometimes it's nice to see movie brothers who look similar; and hopefully they will cooperate again. Sister "Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs" Krystal Rodriguez (as Vicki) and old world Altagracia Guzman (as a grandmother) complete the promiscuous sex of the Dominican immigrant family. Are movies in the style of a mature camera in fashion or what? <br /> <br /> ******* Raising Victor Vargas (16/05/2002) Peter Sollett ~ Victor Rasuk, July Marte, Silvestre Rasuk
