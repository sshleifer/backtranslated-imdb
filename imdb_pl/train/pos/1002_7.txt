Only two comments ... Separated seven years? It barely proves the continuous pulling power of the film! As already mentioned, the status of a low budget telemovie 13 GANTRY ROW is a factor mitigating its limited attractiveness. Having said that, however, the thing is not without merit - either as entertainment or as fear per se. <br /> <br /> It is true that the plot in the most basic sound is a modification of THE AMITYVILLE HORROR - without much horror. More cases of intrigue! Gibney could have made a more valuable impression if she played in Halifax - investigating several seemingly unrelated murders with "home" as the main suspect. The script is better than average and the overall production level is high. It simply does not engage the viewer especially at key moments. <br /> <br /> After I had chosen a DVD for only 3.95 USD last week in my regular movie store, I can not regret my expenses. $ 10.95 would be an acceptable price for a movie. Do not expect fireworks!
