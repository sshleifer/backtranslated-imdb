In the human mind many diseases are born that have been endowed with life in modern times. Constant vigilance or information gathering in the field of Pyschozy has made psychologists, counselors and psychiatrists busy with enough work to survive for decades. Sometimes, some of these psychic phenomena are discovered by people without knowledge about their remedy, and even about their existence. This is the premise of the movie "The Night Listner". He tells the story of the popular radio host, Gabriel Noon (Robin Williams), who spends the evenings fascinating the audience with live stories about the gay lifestyle. Perhaps because his show loses the authentic veneer that causes the south to admit that he is no longer himself. Feeling abandoned both by his lover Jess (Bobby Cannavale) and his best friend (Joe Morton), he is looking for a shelter in deepening despair and isolation. It is here that the mysterious voice at night asks for help. The South needs to feel useful and reaches a desperate voice, which belongs to a 14-year-old boy named Peter (Rory Culkin). Reading the shocking manuscript of a boy who depicts early life and sexual abuse at the hands of his violent parents, the south is captivated and wants to help. However, things do not look as it seems, and the south soon becomes covered with an elusive and bizarre story torn out of a medical nightmare. This movie is pure Robin Williams, and if it were not for Toni Collette, who plays Donna D. Logand, Sandra Oh as Anna and John Cullum as pop, it can be hilarious. Instead, it can be one of William's most serious performances. ***
