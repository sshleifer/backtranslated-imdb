This one is great! Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding joined forces to create a powerful and highly influential movie. This is the true story of the first black diver from the US Navy and the obstacles encountered in obtaining a certificate from the hands of a racist chief diver. Along the way, he must also face ordinary old bigotry from all his classmates, none of whom want him in his class. After they leave the barracks. He finally gets the certificate and continues his great career as a US Navy diver. Watch this! This is a great story about courage and honor. As history unfolds, we can see how racism slowly dissolves and everyone begins to respect people one by one.
