I really enjoyed the episode, which was a big surprise, given the bad reputation it acquired. From the pure "The 16mm shrine" magazine, it is an absolute feast, with a fantastic dialogue and character analysis, typical for a pound sterling. In particular, I really liked the philosophical indulgences of the episode, touching the themes of existence and reality, at the same time balancing them with more psychological themes, such as denial, pride and desire. The "sixteen millimeter chapel" is an episode on how these ideas based on reluctance to accept change can seem to alienate a person to the rest of the ever-changing world. It is also a fantastic example of the brain's twilight zone; one that studies the mind, not the world outside it. All these elements combine very well, creating a provocative and incredibly interesting 25 minutes. <br /> <br /> The episode is not without flaws, mainly in the Lupino and Leisen shoes. Ironically, I felt that Lupino is unconvincing, only a few scenes that can be considered unforgettable. Of course, this is an absolute shame, considering how well Sterling wrote her character. What's more, Leisen did not seem to know what to do with most of his characters, sometimes having them with him without moving - which probably explains why he accepted Lupino's poor results in the middle of the time. Fortunately, Balsam does a good job, hiding many weak points, helping to buy back the show from the perspective of acting at least. <br /> <br /> As I said before, if you're a fan of classic film and brain science fiction, it should not be as bad as it turns out to be. In addition to the writing I mentioned above, the episode also contains a fantastic photo (I'm still amazed that the program looks so good almost fifty years later!) And a decent enough set-design. In general, the "sixteen millimeter chapel" is a great episode, and above all it is one of them that makes you think.
