This piece about adults, who return to the summer formation camp in their youth, was a very peaceful participant and ex-agent to theaters in autumn 1993. I would say it's a shame, but on the other hand, some of the better movies are quiet releases that are not too loud or praised. <br /> <br /> Diane LAne, Kevin Pollack, Elizabeth Perkins, Vincent Spano, Julie Warner, Bill Paxton, Kimberly Williams, Matt Craven and Alan Arkin (who is painfully well here) is a group of actors who perform these roles as people who have grown old with good, bad and funny memories of past years. This film includes a gambit of emotions, usually pleasant, and the film never distracts the viewer from the sense of what the protagonists feel, preferring to let the viewer enter the memories himself. Because I am a movie viewer who is brazen by blatant manipulation in movies, it's something that I appreciate from writer / director Mike Binder. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great cheap rental, a good main rent, and even a nice sit in theatrical cinema. You can come across it on TV, and I would definitely suggest to see.
