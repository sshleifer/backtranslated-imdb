Paul Reiser leaves the comedy spotlight to write a heartfelt and gentle story about the family - what we see and what we do not see, what we expect and what surprises us. ITEM FOR MY PEOPLE does not set any new standards for the film, but it is a great story that we tell well, reminding about the significant ties that the family represents. <br /> <br /> he was a workaholic, he sometimes pushed his wife Muriel (Olympia Dukakis), his daughters (Mackenzie Connolly and Lydia Jordan), and his son Ben (Paul Reiser) into the background. One day, Muriel leaves a note that after years of marriage he leaves! Her daughters, along with Ben's wife, Rachel (Elizabeth Perkins), immediately begin to look for her whereabouts, leaving Sam confused and hurt and displeased to sort things out on a trip with her son Ben. The trip becomes a time for two men to find out who they are and what each of them means for their father's and son's status and family members. He relaxes himself for the first time in his life and now introduces Ben's workaholic to the pleasure and joy of life. The trip ends with a phone call about Muriel's whereabouts and why she left, and the regrouping of a wiser family draws a warm ending to the story. Everything is not as it seemed: it is better and, well, different. <br /> <br /> Falk and Reiser play together like pros, but in many respects the movie belongs to the short moments when Olympia Dukakis is on the screen, reminding us that he is one of our strongest matriarchs in the film. Worth watching. Grady Harp
