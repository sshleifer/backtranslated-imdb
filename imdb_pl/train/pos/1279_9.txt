This film is a funny and totally sarcastic view of pop culture and its producers. I was impressed by the photography, which consisted of vivid colors and adjustable settings, especially when you think that this is the first great attempt by Zukovic. <br /> <br /> One warning, do not take this movie seriously. It is not about mass consumption (and this is not a compliment). This message is a somewhat stylized post-college, neo-classical vision of society. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the basic fictional line "zine", verbally breaking the 90's mobokracja.
