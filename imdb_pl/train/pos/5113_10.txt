This film was a classic. I must say that this film captured the best of man's work, which he learns from his mistakes. if we could all get along and find out how everyone in this movie did it. This had a significant impact on how the family is an important part of life and how pride can make you lose something important in life if you do not find "LARGE THROAT" and swallow it is pride.
