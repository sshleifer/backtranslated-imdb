I noticed that A NEW HOPE and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK are in TOP 10, but this one is not even in TOP 100. <br /> <br /> This movie has a bad reputation because of Ewoks, but there are so many reasons to love this movie: <br /> <br /> -Real Han Solo from Jabba: This official ends Han Solo in a debt underbidding that was established when we first met a character in A NEW HOPE. <br /> <br /> - Emperor was finally revealed: Well, it may not work so well that the prequels are already closed, but for the first time we saw The Emperor as children. <br /> <br /> - The Speeder Bike Chase: Okay, so that was the moment of special effects. But it was certainly one of the most memorable and exciting moments in all movies! <br /> <br /> - 3rd part of Climax: 1) Battle for Endor (led by Han and Leia) 2) Luke confronts father & The Fall of the Emperor 3) Destruction of the second star of death (Lando's Moment) <br /> <br /> - The Final Celebration with Our Heroes: As I mentioned, this movie has a lot of nonsense because of Ewoks, but I think it's cool that while the whole galaxy celebrates FALL OF THE EMPIRE, our heroes have private party in the forest. <br /> <br /> In all, it was a great chapter finale for our heroes and a fitting end to the STAR WARS story.
