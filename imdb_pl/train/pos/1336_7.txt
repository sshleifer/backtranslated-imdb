It's a nice movie in general, with a good story, great actors and great songs. Unfortunately, the photos were bad. One of the weakest points of the film is the annoying sequence of sequences copied from Pretty Woman. Why? Does it hurt the originality test, Abbas? Mustan? <br /> <br /> The film is about a young couple, Raju and Priyi (Salman - Rani). Priya can not get pregnant after an accident she had during her previous pregnancy, and eventually decide to use a foster mother who will carry the baby. They choose Madhubal, a vulgar prostitute played by Preity Zinta. The film is not really realistic, is it not easier to accept? And even if they choose a girl, does it mean that the man must sleep with her? Have you heard about insemination? In any case, if the writers heard about it all, the film would not be made, so the concept is clearly intended. <br /> <br /> Salman works very well. It's nice to see him playing a serious character. But his character suffers from unnecessary and cheap dialogues about his great love for his wife and how difficult it is to sleep with another woman. Come on, it's cheesy and unrealistic. Rani is fine; is generally effective and tries to do something with the role, but is completely eclipsed by Preity Zinta. <br /> <br /> The film belongs to Preity, who steals the show in his own way thanks to his excellent game. It easily and naturally transforms a loud prostitute into a vulnerable woman. He lives in the film, evokes emotions and makes you love her and admire her at the same time, partly because of her role, partly because of her magnetic and positive personality. This is one of the best performances in her career. There is no doubt that she is more talented than her industry peers. She should just do more such roles. <br /> <br /> The ending of the film only emphasizes what I said above. It is tear-jerking, exciting and very well made. Watch the video for Preity. <br /> <br /> 7/10 for the movie! 10/10 - for Preity!
