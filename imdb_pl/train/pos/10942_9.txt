I would give this program ten to ten if it were not for a fart joke. You people are so damn sensitive that it's ridiculous! So fast to point to the "racism" of the series and jokes, and at the same time to say absurdly sexist, pig shit, like "well, duh, some of these other shows make these jokes a lot better, because at least they have hot women. " Disgusting. Abortion jokes are great because, in fact, who treats an abortion anyway? At least I'm not a son * bored *. I heard that Reba McEntire and Sarah Silverman are joining forces to make a film about the sisters traveling together. Talk about the movie of the year!
