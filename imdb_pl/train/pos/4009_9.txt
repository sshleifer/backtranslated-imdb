Children - regardless of their age - do not want to know about the sexual life of their parents. Adult children are often seriously embarrassed and are worried by evidence that aging parents have an active libido. At the end, many moviegoers feel very uncomfortable, observing a careless, wretched widow who, unnoticed, will go unnoticed, discovering his aching ability and the need for a strict passion with a handsome man in the middle of his age. a provocative look at a little filmed reality - a woman who is not ready to stay at home, watch "television" and vegetate after her husband for almost thirty years, and a controlling, dominant colleague, packs her into a massive heart attack. <br /> <br /> May (Anne Reid) and her husband have two children, each dysfunctional in their own way. A male son lives with a beautiful wife who can lead him to the bankruptcy court with her extravagant commercial venture. Paula (Cathryn Bradshaw), a teacher with aspirations for success as a writer. She is attractive, not pretty and seems to have a close relationship with her mother - first. <br /> <br /> After returning home after burrying her husband, May decides not to stay. By rejecting a typical widow with his legacy of boring days and without adventure, he goes to stay with Paula, who has a small son. Pauli's boyfriend, Darren (Daniel Craig), is a stern handsome performer who seems terribly long to complete the May son's home. May is quite busy drunk Darren, who sniffed the coke, and Paula's treatment should alert May that he was certainly a member of the Royal Academy of Cads. <br /> <br /> a hectic romance between Darren and widow immersed in nonsense, and now bubbling alive (dare I say I do not advise?). The love scenes are graphic, but they take the second place for the pen and ink sketches of an amateur artist Maya, which then play a role in the surrounding drama (or defeat, take your choice). <br /> <br /> The Manhattan theater was packed into today's early afternoon, showing over half of the audience in the Maya age group. The fact that some were shocked or worried about seeing him throw himself with an erotic abandonment into the arms of a much younger man is an understatement. <br /> <br /> It is a blindingly honest look at the awakened passion of an elderly woman after decades of diligently fulfilling her husband's desire to stay at home and raise children (he also mentions that he did not like her friends - what a guy) has many problems . While the May foreman with Darren is not incest, there are real psychological dimensions and problems with the mother lying in the lover's daughter. And Paula is not made of the best things. Once revealed, romance allows for the opening of a mother-daughter relationship, which from Pauli's point of view left much to be desired. Mrs. Bradshaw is great as a daughter who wants to support her mother and her love - she has not been treated by a terrible hand, but it is not a bed of roses. <br /> <br /> Maja is strong in her resolve to both recognize her sexuality and expect, and even demand, a future of happiness. But it is also inevitable. He hunts on unknown emotional waters. Who controls her relationship with Darren and why it is difficult for her to understand, let alone solve. At the age of sixty is still in progress. <br /> <br /> "Something's Gotta Give" has recently shown mature sexuality, but in a fun, antiseptic way, ensuring that no viewer would be upset. After all, it's Jack Nicholson and always beautiful Diane Keaton ripping in the world of the rich. To ensure that no serious psychosocial problems are investigated, young girl Keaton, Amanda Peet, daughter of Keaton, not only blesses the match, but ensures that the public knows that she and her old (er) would-be lover never jumped in sack. <br /> <br /> It's not easy here. The inspired performance of Anne Reid forces some to discomfort and others to respect. Her naked body breaks from sexuality for some and seems absurd as an object of physical attraction to others (comments from members of the audience who are leaving today have reflected all these views). <br /> <br /> Kudos for director Roger Michell for addressing the fascinating story with verve and empathy. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
