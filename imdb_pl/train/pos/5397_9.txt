Tenchu ​​aka. Hitokiri- directed by Hideo Goshy - with the participation of Shintaro Katsu and Tetsuya NAkadei belongs (along with Goyokin, HAra Kiri and Rebellion) to the best existing chambara movies. <br /> <br /> This is a story about Shintaro Katsu (who plays Okada Izo) works for Nakadea, who wants to become a daymio. Okada, being "cleaner" for Nakadea is treated like a dog - and after a long time she realizes - what really is for Nakadea. <br /> <br /> But in this film there is much more - every fan of Japanese cinema should have seen it !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> (Tenchu ​​means heavenly punishment)
