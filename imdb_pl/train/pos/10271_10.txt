This film should not be compared to "The Sting" or other caper movies / heist / con game. What makes him such a great film experience is what he has to say about relationships, deception and trust. It is also quite a sharp criticism of psychiatry, considering that the heroine is a psychiatrist who is so easily deceived and then acts in such a primitive way in the finale. Did Mr. Mamet have unfortunate experience in therapy? I would highly recommend!
