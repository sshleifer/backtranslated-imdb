Riding Giants is an amazing documentary describing the history and stories of three influential surfers, Gregg Noll, Jeff Clark and Laird Hamilton. Stacy Peralta has done an amazing job, taking the role of a director and congratulating her for such a wonderful job. The structure of the film is superbly edited and perfectly harmonizes with narration, interviews, animation and surfing materials. The soundtrack simply increases the overall satisfaction of watching this movie, making the Riding Giants a great viewing experience. Personal events include Greg Noll's comments, his honesty at the point, Laird Hamilton's recordings at Teahupoo and performances at the end of the movie. But really, this whole movie is one big, recommended attraction that is highly recommended if you have the opportunity to see. It is a pity that it is not better known, but it is a jewel deserving of attention. 10/10
