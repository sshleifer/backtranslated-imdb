Although it's been well over, I've always had a weakness for YA fiction, so Naturally I was intrigued by Nancy Drew's return to the screen. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad movie. The main secret in which a long dead actress is involved is presented in simple, simplified terms, with a bit of danger for the young servant. Nancy and her friends never take risks seriously, so young audience members will not be upset. <br /> <br /> What I really appreciated from this story was that the final results were rather serious and meaningful, and Nancy seemed to understand and grow from experience. <br /> <br /> Emma Roberts is great as Nancy Drew and I hope to see her again in a different mystery.
