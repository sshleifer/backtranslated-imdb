It's a great movie and it's a pity that it will not attract attention outside of the artistic circles and students who will stay until 2:00 am to watch it on Channel Four. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple, but it works very effectively, the blur between a childlike fantasy and a nightmare is very blurry. The budget looks quite low, but considering the people involved, it does not show up very often. It also did not have such a big date. <br /> <br /> I was lucky that I recorded it from the TV when it was a few years ago and it lasted half a dozen inspections. This is one of those movies that will not please everyone; but as usual, those who have a more thoughtful approach to the cinema have learned a lot from it. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Buerke is having fun as Anna, a spoiled brat and it's a pity she seems to have disappeared from the acting scene. Cross is also very good, very well reflects the character of his character in the context of the image. <br /> <br /> There are some genuinely (and not so slightly) disturbing moments in this film, both half-seconds shocking and more stretched tensions. Watch with lights turned off! <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> <br />
