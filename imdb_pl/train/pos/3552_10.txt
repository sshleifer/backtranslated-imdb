I just want to add my two cents worth and forgive me if I repeat something that has already been published, but I think it's worth reminding people of the genius of eternal Damon Runyon. Without the miraculous street, the funny writings of Damon Runyon, this film would never have been made - nor the majority of other great classics who deal with gamblers, etc., before 1960. Damon Runyon worked as a journalist, and he was from Colorado, but he certainly did it on the street on the east coast. If you're not a devoted fan of old Hollywood comedies, I'd recommend a few other films from Damon Runyon's writings; "Lemondrop Kid" and "Little Miss Marker", both are Bob Hope, who outside politics has always been a funny man. (As a liberal from the West Coast, I find his policy quite amusing!) Damon Runyon is alive !!!!
