It was a great little American propaganda film that is both highly creative and openly discussing the Nazi atrocities before the entire range of the death camps was revealed. While at the end of 1944 and until 1945, he would reveal how angry and frightening he was, this movie, unlike other Hollywood films so far, is the most brutally honest movie of the time I've seen in Nazi cruelty. <br /> <br /> The film begins in the courtroom in the future - after the end of the war (the film was made in 1944 - the war ended in May 1945). In this fictitious world court, the Nazi leader is tried for war crimes. Wilhelm Grimm is completely repentant and is called one by one witnesses who reveal Grimm's life from 1919 in a series of flashbacks. Initially, it seems that the film will be sympathetic or will explain how Grimm was forced to join the Nazis. However, after some time it becomes obvious that Grimm is just a sadistic monster. These episodes are amazingly well done and definitely interest you, and also make the film seem less like propaganda, but a legal drama. <br /> <br /> In total, the film does a great job, mainly considering the movie stars of the second-level actors. There are many fascinating scenes and performances - especially the very predictable Jewish scene of extermination at the end, which can not help but lead to tears. It was also interesting how super-creative scenes appeared at the same point of the film, in which crosses are in a way that you can not initially see. Generally speaking, this is a must for lovers of history and anyone who wants to see a good movie. <br /> <br /> FYI - this is not a serious criticism of the film, but Hitler was called "this paper hanger". It is a reference to the myth that Hitler once made money on wallpapers. In fact, this is NOT true - earlier he was a "starving artist", homeless and served well in the German army in the First World War. A terrible person, yes, but never a paper hanger!
