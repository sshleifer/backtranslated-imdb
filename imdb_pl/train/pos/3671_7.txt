"Hollywood North" is the euphemism of the film industry that went to Canada to make films because of tax breaks and cheaper costs in a civilized city like Toronto, in this case Vancouver. Peter O'Brian, the director, probably saw many California invaders, that this movie seems to be the right way to deal with arriving personalities who are trying to use the economics that Canada has shown. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, "Moon Lantern", a successful novel written by a Canadian author, turns into "Flight to Bogota", which has nothing to do with the original movie. A great egotistic entity, Michael Baytes, who is obsessed with what is happening in Iran, receives a major role that turns out to be a disaster. <br /> <br /> It seems that the movie says that too many cooks spoiled the broth, which seems to be the case for the final product that was saved by the producer, Bobby Myers. With the help of Sandy Ryan, who made a documentary about making a film in Toronto, the movie fragments were eventually transformed into a coherent movie. <br /> <br /> The filming process is fun and the action is generally good.
