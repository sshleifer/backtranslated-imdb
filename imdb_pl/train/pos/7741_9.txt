The first of two adaptations by Jim Thompson released in 1990 (the second is the more well-known GRIFTERY), AFTER DARK has all Thompson's features: dangerous women, trust games and characters that are either not as weak as others suspect their being or not harmless. <br /> <br /> Jason Patric is great as a former boxer disqualified from this sport for life due to an incident in the ring (director James Foley uses the RAGING BULL-esquire sequence to emphasize the back story) and too little noticeable Rachel Ward provides also a great performance. But Bruce Dern is the secret weapon in the movie: his sweet saying grifter Uncle Bud subtly proves each of his scenes. <br /> <br /> there is almost no comical relief in this movie, so look at how he's getting ready to suck in the void.
