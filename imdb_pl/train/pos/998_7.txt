This is a really interesting movie. This is an action movie with a mixed comedy. Foxx collaborates with comic Epps in this movie to give him a comic spin. Thanks to that you'll be wondering what will happen to Foxx. It was a well-filmed movie, the director used the right colors in this film (dark blue colors) to give it the right character. Kimberly Elise also played in this movie and it's always nice to see her on the big screen. It plays its role well. Even Jamie Kennedy is in this movie. It's worth seeing it, you did not see it. It's definitely worth having it if you're a fan of Jamie Foxx. It deserves more than is actually awarded.
