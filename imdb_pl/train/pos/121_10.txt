Critics must review what they classify as a high-quality film. I think the critics saw too many action movies and succumbed to the movie in the Matrix style. Europe is a breath of freshness, a film with so many layers that one viewing is not enough to understand or appreciate this unique film. Lars von Trier shows that old filming styles can produce great cinema and build drama and tension. The effect of the rear projection, which he uses during the film, arouses and strengthens the characters, and also focuses on the conversation they have. Other effects, such as color and black and white in one scene, like Hitchcock and a girl with a red cloak, attract attention and reinforce the drama and meaning of the scene. The commentary is wonderful and has a hypnotic effect, again maintaining the focus on the main characters in the scene and action. <br /> <br /> I could talk about the effects more, but I think that everyone would agree that this pushes the film to their own category and really heightens the drama of the film. The movie to buy if you are not the owner anymore and to see if you do not have one. <br /> <br /> 10/10 Do not miss this artistic film noir from one of the great directors.
