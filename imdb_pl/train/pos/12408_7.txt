Viggo Mortensen plays the new prisoner of a haunted prison, in which the warden (played well by Lane Smith) has a terrifying secret that can be the reason why many prison guards and prisoners are killed by a supernatural presence. Lincoln Kilpatrick is a lifeguard who knows the secret and is afraid for his life. When I think about prison movies, I always think about action movies starring Stallone or Van Damme or high-class dramas such as Shawshank Redemption or The Green Mile. I did not expect, however, a ghost story more like the exorcist III. The prison is, however, an atmospheric effort and certainly remains the best film of Renny Harlin's career. The film is frightening and has good acting with cast (unknown) at that time. Lane Smith is the best because his head is not the usual stereotype of personified, but rather nervous and nervous evil, which adds some credibility to the film, which far exceeds expectations. <br /> <br /> *** with 4- (Good)
