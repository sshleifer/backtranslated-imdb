The Ramones, whom I consider to be the founders of modern punk rock, give their unique sounds a frighteningly twisted film about a noisy rock fan (PJ Soles) who faces the merciless helpless director (Mary Woronov) for rock law. <br /> <br /> Equipped with a soundtrack full of amazing music, RRHS is fascinating in concept and performance. It is a block full of rebellious gags (like a mouse experiment), a teenage ghost (probably my favorite movie opening) and bizarre moments outside the walls (straitjacket scenes). If you're looking for a movie that seems to be made of pure fun at the molecular level, look no further. But if you're looking for a nice, dignified, dramatic epic, maybe you should look a bit further. <br /> <br /> "Hello everyone, I'm Riff Randell, this is Rock & Roll High School!
