Tommy JOnes and Matt Dillon are proud of the gambling world. Different movements of the wrists had to be taught because throwing bones is a skill in itself. <br /> <br /> There are several surprises. As cynical as today, I fully expected that a "good girl" would cry over his grave instead of his Buddha. Especially with her remarks on "going to the funeral of her best friend" when she meets Matt for the first time. And then, of course, you expect Matt to kill a guy who threw acid in Mr. Allen's face, blinding him (the interesting role of Bruce Dern). WRRROOONNNNGGG !!! some of the other Hollywood endings happen, but the writing is so perfect that the action is so carefully made that you're blissfully unaware. <br /> <br /> And music is beyond the world. Transfer us to the 1950s, when our "native passions" were first unleashed by the music of Ray Charles and Bo Diddley. Even a small racism that strikes its ugly head in Chicago, but in a club called the wonderfully "Biloxi" with the Confederate flag supporting racist remarks. I will watch it again, just to hear the music. It's good that I have the FACTOTUM soundtrack, so I can listen to it in the car. Watch together and you'll see how Matt matured ... playing bar characters in both. No one that owns a bar at Paramount HOtel in New York probably has a great opportunity to study. A great actor, just entering his own. It shows greatly refined performances ... good and bad in its forms. His "young boy from the farm" is a wonderful study, especially touching because of his basset eyes. He also loves convincingly. Ever since he was in a couple of films with Diane Lane as a teenager, I'm wondering how to ... make love with the actress you grew up with. He adds conviction, I will say it.
