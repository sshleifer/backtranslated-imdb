This was another great movie at the Berlin festival. But in contrast to "Yes" Sally Potter, which I saw a few days earlier, when after leaving the cinema I felt a strong desire to embrace the whole world and I was just happy that I was alive, this time something was the opposite: something pulled me in, and the air suddenly became cold and difficult to breathe. It was as if nothing had left, all hope, the whole future had been taken to a dead place. <br /> <br /> Nina's life seemed bleak and closed, but then, one beautiful day, there is this kind of brightness that opens the horizon and makes you believe in the fulfillment of your dreams. There was no one there, but suddenly she found a companion, simply out of nothing, someone who was able to share the most hidden feelings of his life. That person was Toni, a tramp who does not seem to have any roots like her. <br /> <br /> But the title of the film is "Spirits", and ghosts appear and disappear as they wish, there is no way to stop them? Spirits also represent the hidden fantasies of people, strange ideas that occupy your mind and are seen only by you, hiding from all other people. Françoise, a French woman, is a victim of such ghosts. She once lost her daughter in Berlin, who had apparently been robbed of her at the supermarket, in a moment of inattention. Now the time has passed and Françoise returned to Berlin, still looking for a missing child. <br /> <br /> Nina could have been this child, eventually having the same scar on her ankle and a heart-shaped mark between the shoulder blades that seem to confirm her true identity. <br /> <br /> And Nina accepts this idea, he not only desperately needs a companion, but also misses his mother. But in the end he is empty-handed, Toni disappeared with a man, and her supposed mother turns out to be a sick woman. "Marie is dead," concludes Françoise husband, and the statement can not be more disappointing. Nina is simply "niña", a girl with no name, no hope for any divine fulfillment. In this world there is no Maria who would accompany our lonely life. That is why we finally see Nina herself, who is to follow the path that has opened to her, into a future that seems carefree and uncertain.
