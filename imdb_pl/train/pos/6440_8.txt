It seems to me that I never write reviews about IMDb unless I am very surprised by how good the movie is. This film belongs to the first category. Every year, I try to see all the nominees for Best Foreign Film on Oscars, even those I know I will not like. "As It Is In Heaven" seems to fit the bill. The plot sounds sweet and sentimental and slow .... For my tastes, which run more towards the original, dark and / or bold foreign cinema (Michael Haneke, Francois Ozon, Many contemporary Japanese / Korean cinema) "As It Is In Heaven" sounds particularly interesting ... It was not released in the US, so I sat down to watch the VCD I found in Singapore, preparing to "cross the list". After the boring beginning, "As It Is In Heaven" becomes a rare movie in which you really inspire what's happening on the screen. Weaknesses: The characters in the film are purely "spare" characters - Wounded Dreamer, Town Bully, Battered Wife, Loose Woman longing for love, repressed minister ... Fortunately, they are a very nice group, well-written and well-functioning. Ingela Olsson, as the wife of Minister Inger, would be nominated for an Oscar if her performance was in English. Strengths: music is beautiful, and the main song, sung by Gabriella, is really dramatic and unforgettable. And watch the fierce 87-year-old actress playing Olga, who follows dance steps and younger ladies! I will not discuss the ending, but I will say that it makes sense. There are many emotional things happening in the last hour of the movie and you are not sure why this is happening. Although nothing is explained in words, everything makes sense because the films come to the right crescendo. **** except *****. Probably the strongest Swedish movie I've ever seen.
