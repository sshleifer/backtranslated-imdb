When I was young, I saw very few films. My parents, in all their wisdom, have hired this one. I was very careful about the film, in fact I could not even see it. My brother and sister, of course, arrived and it made me very angry. So what did I do? I burst the VCR out late at night! He kicked the TV screen and called the police and reported vandals. Of course, I was arrested, I could not get my foot out of the TV before the police arrived. I was only given a strict conversation and sent home. My parents, of course, grounded me and told me to pay my debt for the TV and video recorder. It ripped me to shreds, slave labor really sucks me, but I had to do it. Responsibilities throughout the home. What happened at the end? For work I got a TV with a large screen, a DVD player and a surround sound system. How did I get the money? I easily made my own movies and sold them to Disney! Do you remember Finding Neno? I wrote this movie and made my goldfish in aquariums! Of course, they rewrote the story and did it in CGI because they could not afford to make a real action picture like me! In the end, I've never seen the movie "The head that has not died", and the rating I gave was the assessment of my life! It's pretty good!
