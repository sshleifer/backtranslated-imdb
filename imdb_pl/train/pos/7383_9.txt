Extremely tense thriller set in urban chaos in Sao Paulo, the biggest and ugliest third world nightmare in Brazilian urbanism. To make it easier for everyone who is curious about this intriguing and really well made movie, it has the Mexican feature "Amores Perros" with a character not too distant from Max Cady from both Cape Fears, although it is by no means a movie about the psychopath . Two partners (Alexandre Borges and Marco Ricca) in a construction company pay Hitman Anisio (Miklos) for switching off the third partner (and the majority shareholder) in the aforementioned construction equipment. The city is murdered for murder, but things start to look very grim when the witty and charismatic walking nightmare of Anisio decides that he wants to be in the vicinity of such nervous partners in crime, not only entering but, more importantly, deconstructing the strict rules that make up the Brazilian society. Anisio turns poverty into an attitude and wants to. The look is almost entirely manual, grainy, performances all over the world, especially as the first actor (and a member of the classic Brazilian pop group "Titãs"), Paulo Miklos, a dazzling and terrifying viewer with his rather amusing social terror. <br /> <br /> I saw this film at the Brasília Fest film in November 2001. Since then he has performed very well in Sundance and Berlin. Kleber Mendonça Filho
