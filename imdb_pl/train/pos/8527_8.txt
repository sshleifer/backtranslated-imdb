Let me get to the bottom of the matter: I have 3 children, between the ages of 5 and 10. I believe that a trip to the theater is a success when there are no talking animals. I have seen the majority of children's films in our collection at least 72 times. I can tell you when the movie turns in the "Wizard of Oz", an 18-year-old sexual joke in "El Dorado" and a tragic flaw with the ending of Rudolph the Redonos. I could probably tell Nemo from memory alone. <br /> <br /> What makes me support my child (it's different), who suggests this title for a family evening? In a word: Showerman. <br /> <br /> Moment of silence ... <br /> <br /> * sigh *
