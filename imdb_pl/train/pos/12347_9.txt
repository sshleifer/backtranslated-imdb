This is a great film about a brothel in a fishing village, which can best be described by means of stage constellations and the direction of works of the former Kurosawa, connected with the themes of Dostoyevsky's human psychology (O-shin - Sonia Marmeladova), the tragedy and cheerful Shakespeare and Hans Christian Andersen. The scenario is wonderful, the scenes are colorful and beautiful, some of the scenes are really impressed in my memory. The plot is interesting and unpredictable - each character is very well developed and interesting - there is also a small action, so if you do not like all the feelings, then you would also come to your costs -. It is not about mysterious geishas and proud samurai, which Bushido pours out of them all, but about the life, work and types of people encountered everywhere at any moment. A charming and fascinating tribute to Kurosawa, definitely worth seeing.
