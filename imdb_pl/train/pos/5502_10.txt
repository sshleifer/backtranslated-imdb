Regardless of whether this film is propaganda or not (I strongly believe it is not), it really shows the power of the media. The importance of this document is not to show how good a Chavez man is. It's really important to demonstrate how Bolivarians saw how it happened, how Chavez perceived it. Although supporting the film may seem inappropriate and biased, I think the point of view shown in the movie is completely justified. The Venezuelan nation through the private media corporation of Venezuela saw only one side of the coup, the neo-liberal side. This movie shows us how the inhabitants of Bolivia saw it. Call it propaganda, I say it's a judgment on your part.
