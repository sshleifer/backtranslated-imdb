The film will come to the cinema in Indonesia only this year (2007), two years after its official release and after many illegal DVDs have been made public. Apparently, the popularity of illegal DVDs led to the release in cinemas, and the audience will still be watching. <br /> <br /> The movie is a great epic, introducing Japanese culture to your home in an exciting way. The humor story is told about a theater writer who writes a story for his theater, because Kabuki's regular theater performances are something that he finds boring. <br /> <br /> At the beginning the audience may be a bit confused, which story we follow, but when the story unfolds, we see that the love between a male and a female demon leads to a great story for a new piece of Kabuki theater. <br /> <br /> the audience stays in the dark, if it is a story that was really going to happen in Japanese tradition and mythology, but it does not matter. <br /> <br /> The way of telling a story with love for the theater, expression, vivid colors, humor and tragedy, make it a great ride on the roller coaster of Japanese cinema as well as the theater. <br /> <br /> Allow yourself to completely watch this movie, try to see it in the cinema instead of the TV at home. <br /> <br /> However, the critical point: the soundtrack is sometimes a bit annoying. Although most of them are great music, there are a few moments in the film that I think should be more dramatic. But maybe the fact that the story contains moments of humor made the director choose lighter moments in music.
