This movie has literally every film cliche and all work in its favor. Straight from Lethal Weapon Gary Busey wisecracks, he shoots and chuckles through the movie with such reckless abandonment that he can not help but play and have fun. There are tanks, helicopters, battles for machine guns, grenades and vans for ice cream, and if they are not good enough to watch this movie, then what do you say for the best ... Danny Trejo. And if you do not know who Danny Trejo is, you probably will not like this movie.
