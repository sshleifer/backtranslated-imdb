This movie is very cool. If you're a fan of Tsui Hark and Chinese fantasy movies, you should love it. This film is the Asian lord of the rings: a story of high fantasy, based on real Chinese mythology. (I realize that many critics have called this movie less-fiction, I think they probably do not have any knowledge of Chinese mythology.) If you liked Stormriders or Warriors of Heaven & Earth, it should be on your avenue. This movie is still very hard to find in the United States, even though it was purchased for distribution in the US with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Iron Monkey. It is worth looking !!! This DVD is also worth having.
