An example of creating a documentary film from the Second World War, using first-hand accounts from real soldiers and civilians who participated in this terrible conflict, and archived materials collected more or less at the same time. one and a half years ago, without knowledge of the Second World War at that time, but it enveloped me, and now I consider myself a lover of the Second World War, I watch and read everything I can find about it, but nothing approaches this groundbreaking document, definitely it is worth buying a box set ............. <br /> <br /> This is simply a documentary performance at the highest level.
