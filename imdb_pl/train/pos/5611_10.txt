I saw this movie at a time when I was shyly playing with the idea of ​​moving to my own flat and starting my own life. Maybe that's why I took it so seriously. I believed completely in the psychological degradation of the poor hero in Paris of eternal construction, dust, misery, selfishness, rudeness, malice and decay. I devote all my attention to the artistry of Polanski in his direction, his play and his inevitable script, but I fainted during the terrible final scene and had to be revived by the cognac at the theater manager's office. Fortunately for me, my life has not turned out to be so catastrophic (so far), but I have always respected an artist who can do such illusions and completely immerse himself in the (false) reality that he tries to convey. Simply put, man is a genius of the first order and merit of the human race. This film is the sum of many, many examples of great acting and great casting. Because some performances were performed in English (scenes from Shelley Winters and Melvyn Douglas among others) and others in French (with most other characters), and Polanski did his own dubbing in English and French, I would heartily recommend it if you happen to be bilingual to switch the sound from French to English and vice versa, during the relevant scenes, watching the wonderful Paramount DVD transfer. This film is part of the so-called "trilogy of a residential building" by Polański, which also includes "Repulsion" and "Rosemary's Baby". Unfortunately, "Repulsion" has not yet reached a decent DVD transfer in Region 1. Needless to say, three films would create a great set.
