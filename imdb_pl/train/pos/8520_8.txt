I thought the movie was quite good. I liked acting and everything went well. The director seemed to really understand the story he was trying to tell. I have to see that a big budget is coming out today, of course they had a lot more money to throw it, but it was very observable. When you see a movie for a small budget, you have to take it into account when you watch it. There were a few things that could be better, but most of them are related to the budget. Acting was pretty good, F / X and stunts were well done. A few distinguishing features are the guy who played the camera at the beginning. and the boy who played the child. These kind of movies kept working in LA and it turned out to be OK.
