"Panic in the Streets" was a decent thriller, but I felt a bit disappointed. The main theme of the city attacked by the modern plague is fascinating, but the film never really explores or develops it. It's well made and funny, but it's not as interesting as it should be. The script for this movie is very weak and causes the entire movie to be shot down. None of the main characters is really attractive or credible. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the movie is very well made, so it compensates for weak scripts. Director Elia Kazan keeps the film in suspense and fast pace. There are some unique sequences, especially the unforgettable climax of the chase. When a few years later his direction was combined with better scenarios, the man could not do anything bad. <br /> <br /> Acting is also very good. Richard Widmark has always been a venerable leading man and he does what he can do with a guaranteed character. Paul Douglas spends his time shouting a little too much, but he also does a decent job. Awards in the cast are two black characters. Zero Mostel, known primarily for comic roles, is actually slimy as one of the best characters in the cinema. Jack Palance is not a surprise that he is a cold villain. "Panic on the streets" is disappointing, but it's still worth watching. (7/10)
