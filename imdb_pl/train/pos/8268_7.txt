This is apparently the second remake of this film, made earlier in 1911 and 1918. And in many ways it reminds me of a later film, A YANK AT OXFORD. Both films refer to conceited, hard people who come to one of the best schools in the world and both, as a last resort, show hard-learning team work and decency. In this movie, William Haines is "Tom Brown" and his main rival "Bob" is played by Frances X. Bushman. And in the supporting role is Jack Pickford - always remembered as a brother of Mary. Out of these three, Pickford goes out the best, as a nice loser who becomes a friend of Tom - he actually has a few decent scenes, as well as a dramatic moment just before the Great Game! All standard stereotypes and film are there because it was done many times before and since then it has offered several surprises. However, this is a nice movie and pleasant viewing. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, for a better movie about a quiet college, try Harold Lloyd THE FRESHMAN - his football scenes are honestly more exciting, and Harold is much more sympathetic and sympathetic than annoying Tom Brown. THE FRESHMAN is probably the best college picture you can find in the era. Another reason why BROWN AT HARVARD is a smaller picture is that William Haines played essentially the same incredible and bombastic character with the same story again and again (for example in WESTPOINT and THE SMART SET, for example) - and if I saw one from these movies, you've seen them all. Well made, but certainly NOT original! And because this is just a replay of his other films, anyone who gives the film 10 points is definitely recommended to watch other movies. <br /> <br /> 4/25/08 == I just checked and saw this little movie was the highest-rated movie on IMDb in 1920 !! Talk about overestimation! There are several dozen better films - how this movie has become the number 1, it's probably no one.
