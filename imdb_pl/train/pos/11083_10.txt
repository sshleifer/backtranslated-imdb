Glacier Fox is one of the most captivating and wonderfully photographed movies of wild nature ever made. <br /> <br /> The film makes you take care of each member of this family of foxes, from the blind to the strongest - their adventures are sometimes fun and tragic. The hearts of the audience placed on inhospitable countryside are enjoyed by family members. <br /> <br /> Music and lyrics tell a story with a narration about what is happening in general. <br /> <br /> Man remains one of the largest predators, but there is no doubt that foxes are capable of life, not just survival beyond human efforts.
