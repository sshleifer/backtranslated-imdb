"Five Days" is something special, a crime drama consisting of a series of episodes, each of which takes place on a specific day of police investigation. In reality, however, this element of history turns out to be less significant than it might seem at first, because the fact that the action in each episode is limited to 24 hours is hardly noticeable and very little distinguishes the program from countless other crime stories. In fact, almost no one can help compared to the last "Suspect" because one of the threads focuses on one cynical policewoman approaching retirement: not only the absence of Helen Mirren makes comparisons unfavorable. There are many hot emotions, manipulation of music and a set of seemingly invented characters, so that each of them is in a sense sympathetic, in another suspect. And you can guess the guilty party long before the end, not because of the internal dynamics of the story, but rather because of the construction of the drama as a whole: some things must be true to justify the way the series focuses on certain characters at certain times. Despite these failures, the series grew in me: towards the end I was quite calm. But it is a sad sign that the BBC, which once created such songs as "The Singing Detective", boasted about "probably the best drama of the year": because there is not much originality, and the statement reveals a lack of ambition, which is terribly disappointing. "Five Days" is not really trash; but it is formal and one can hope that the best that the BBC has to offer is something more innovative and fresh.
