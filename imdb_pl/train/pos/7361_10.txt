This film is usually classified as the worst film production in history. Always. But in my opinion it is probably the funniest thing. The frightening direction and scenario make this movie invaluable. I bought a movie by screening a DVD with opportunities at my local pound store. Me and a few friends watched what was admittedly drunk enough. Soon it turned out that it was not a normal movie. Instead, a priceless relic of what will probably be James Cahill's last film. At the beginning we were confused and we shouted that the DVD player would be turned off, but fortunately in our abnormal condition no one could worry. Instead, we watched the movie. In the end, we quickly realized that we found any dream of wasteful, something that you can laugh for many hours, laughing for all the wrong reasons. Soon we showed all our friends and they also agreed, it was not the work of a fatal movie. It was a movie that you can really get wet by laughing. It was a movie that everyone can enjoy. It was brilliant.
