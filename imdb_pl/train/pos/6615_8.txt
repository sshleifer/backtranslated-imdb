I am glad that I can say almost exclusively positive things about the film with the sisters Karas and Tasuiev, RENAISSANCE. <br /> <br /> And first, it looks like it should look; boys' adventure, RENAISSANCE is a story about a policeman's search for a missing young scientist Ilona Tasuiev, a geneticist and researcher for Avalon. <br /> <br /> The story of Karas, Ilona and Bislane is, although much less known than SIN CITY, a better movie and more appreciated by connoisseurs. For fans of French comics, it will be even more significant (I enriched my French collection of comics last week, though I'm not so good?). The atmosphere, music, characters, their lines, the plot are nice and endearing. The Parisian leading police officer, Karas, is found to find a young woman who was the rising star of genetic research, Ilona Tasuiev - a gently hot blonde, whose rebel sister Bislane was erotically better, I think. <br /> <br /> For me an old fan of comics and TV series, RENESANS, a wonderfully beautiful cartoon, was like a repeat of the WILD WILD WEST episode? here, the mythological past replaced by the mythological future? and blessed, but in a way as thrilling. RENESANS is not tight; it does not look particularly good; but it's seductive and hypnotic. What's more, you get a sketch, albeit in a nutshell, of the world, the real world and think about Avalon, Nakata, Jonas Mueller, Sister Tasuiev and Goran, Farfella and Karas talking about his distant childhood in the Kasbah? . I liked the feeling RENAISSANCE, a certain delicacy, kindness and adventurism, as well as a professional, confident appearance; among these new cartoons, this and the adaptation of Dick Linklater (- the only and the first adaptation of Dick ever ...) stood out for me as a work of beauty and real excitement. <br /> <br /> I thought that futuristic devices were appropriate and, if not conventional, brightly ghostly (like the costumes of invisibility). <br /> <br /> It is recommended that the characters have exotic names, such as Bislane and Farfella, mainly collected from the world of art and entertainment (Goran and Ilona and Naghib ??). <br /> <br /> It seems that none of them noticed that the RENAISSANCE poster has a look similar to Rourke - this guy is Marv; which does not make it a SIN CITY rip-off, but it's not a model of originality, and in fact is more similar to Miller's story, namely, the gloomy futuristic look of a spoiled society, brio hero (in fact a cross of Willis and personality characters Rourke in the previous movie ??), on the other hand, this drawing breathes more public air, the edge of a simple adventure, in a word, it's like SIR CITY for children, well, I mean rude children, because the exhibition has a bit of nudity. To what I have said, it can be said that these features are characteristic, even as cliches and places where more futuristic comics for adults look; it's true, and it was old Miller who brought these things to the screen, and RENAISSANCE bears some similarities here and there. Now it is also fair that every RING should have its ERAGORN, so to every city of sin, its renaissance. I admit that I am quite partial to these gloomy futuristic stories, a rather undemanding specialty.
