It must be one of the best films that will come out of HK for a long time, I've been waiting impatiently for me to watch this movie just by looking at the title. Lots of fantastic actors in this concert and I was especially impressed by the incredibly credible mad behavior of Sam Lee and Edison's portrait of a deadly machine that completely reversed his normal idol picture. I definitely recommend it to those who are looking for a stylish and action-packed movie. However, I must warn you that this is just as depressing because every character in the movie is in a dead end and has his own troubles and tries to breathe. It makes you think about what life really is.
