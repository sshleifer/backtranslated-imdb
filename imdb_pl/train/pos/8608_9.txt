It was a great movie with a good cast, all of them went to all cylinders. And when Dianne Keaton is at its best, it just has nothing better. But Tom Everett Scott, always underrated, was even better. He should be a star. <br /> <br /> My only complaint concerns one aspect of the scenario. None of the characters has ever admitted that the dead daughter was not always a good person. Nor her mother, played by Keaton. At some point, he breaks the promise she made to one person not to reveal that he was sleeping nearby. <br /> <br /> One of the other commentators said the film has a "political program". This is a strange thing. There was no policy in this film.
