A sharp, well-made document focusing on Mardi Gras beads. I've always liked this approach to making movies - pass ideas on a larger, more complex and often inscrutable phenomenon, breaking the problem into something familiar and a close home. <br /> <br /> I am sure that most people have heard stories about the workshops and understand the basic motives behind profit and capitalism and the impact of globalism on poorer nations (regardless of what people think about it). Instead of describing these topics and getting up to the soap dish (not that there is something wrong in addition to such documentaries usually preached to converts), this document simply shows Mardi Gras beads, how they are made, by what people under which conditions, then, in how they are used by consumers at the end of the process. The opening and strictly examines the motivations of all those involved in the process, including employees, factory management, US importers and finally the consumer at the end of the chain. <br /> <br /> I felt a little disappointed with this; equally by the Mardi Gras revelers, but also by the way Chinese workers accepted their situation as normal and normal for the course (even if they have some reservations about the details of how they are managed). Shots of the street sweepers cleaning the beads from the streets at the end made a special impression. But that was just my reaction; I can see how someone else can read this document a bit differently. <br /> <br /> Unlike other documentary films on the subject, I do not think that you need to have a specific political opinion. This is ultimately a story about people and our attitude to the goods we produce and consume. If you've ever bought a product made in the Far East, it should give you something to think about. <br /> <br /> Excellent and highly recommended. You want to see more documentaries like this one. Recognition for everyone involved in the creation of this film.
