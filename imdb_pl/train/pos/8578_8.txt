This film is one of the best American B-90s movies. If you're looking for a serious movie, look somewhere else. However, if you are looking for some action, lots of laughter and variations about policemen fighting against gangsters, it's worth to watch. Everyone chews the scenery a bit, but it's really about the movie and everyone is pretty funny. Donald Sutherland and John Lithgow have great chemistry and they have to make another film together.
