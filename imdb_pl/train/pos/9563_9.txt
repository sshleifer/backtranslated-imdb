First of all, I would like to say that Edison Chen is very hot and that Sam Lee looks much better than before XD! This is probably one of the most original films I've ever seen; shows a lifestyle background of poor Cambodia. The Cambodian (Edison aka Pang) revolves around, killing people to survive; he did it all his life. It is Sam Lee's (Wai) duty to get Cambodia for good. There are plenty of violent actions, but it has a good story. The film shows the struggle between these two characters; they both fight like angry dogs. GO AND WATCH PPL ... STRONGLY SUGGED !!! (GO HK FILMS)
