Pickup on South Street (1953), directed by the independent filmmaker Samuel Fuller, contains a stunning opening that creates a double complication. The Candy subway racer (Susan Peters) collides with the Skip McCoy pickpocket (Richard Widmark immersed in Sinatra cool shades). He is unaware that he carries a valuable microfilm; McCoy does not realize he'll catch him. Both are unaware that they are being watched by two federal agents. In this way, the griffin triggers a certain degree of knowledge. Candy is watched twice (Skip and police), and therefore doubly na√Øve; Skip, too self-confident, a small thief, is extremely unaware, pulled by federal agents; federal, everyone knows, they are ultimately helpless. They can not stop "passing" government secrets or the spread of communism.
