I saw the Freebird preview on the Isle of Man TT, which I heard on several motorcycles. Although I ended up mainly for racing, the temptation to see Phil Daniels in a motorcycle movie (yes, I love Quadrophenia like everyone else) proved to be enough to tear me away from beer and partying. Eventually! we did it! we British have made a great motorcycle movie (and it's not like Torque), it's there with the best British comedy. Mark my words, this is Phil Daniels' best performance, and when it comes to Geoff Bell, a new British legend has appeared. I loved Gary Stretch in Shane Meadows' fantastic Dead Mans Shoes and here he gives a quietly touching performance that he can proudly add to his growing film reputation. This is not just a movie for us, but I think that for everyone (even my girlfriend loved it). I hope that the continent will receive the same brilliant answer as on the Isle of Man. I will not go into the details of some of the classic scenes that this movie has (watch out for the store) because it would spoil the fun, but I would say go, see, enjoy and have one of the best nights in the cinema for some time. I really think it can be a cult classic. As they said on TT ... C'Mon Freebird!
