Bela took 9 photos for Monogram, but only in THIS, fourth, everything began to meet. The rest of the series would use this as a basic template for the production, writing and development of characters. From now on, better or worse, the series would also handle one basic topic: a scientist (usually Bela) experiments in a basement or an old house (sometimes in the basement of an old house), which causes things to bleed. It was also the first time that artistic director Dave Milton had the chance to spread his wings. He came aboard for BLACK DRAGONS, flick earlier, but THIS is where he's doing his craft to click. Lewis had a great time and did not mind all other monograms. The key to this is casting and it is quite a good B movie here. You get Barclay and Harlen (also from BLACK DRAGONS), along with Russell, who will play in the films of LOKÃ“W z Lewtons CAT ... and Rosetto, with SPOOKS RUN WILD ... a nice piece of Poverty Row's talent. If you have limited time and budget, start with this ... sums up everything you've learned so far, and gives you something to compare. Story? Bela steals glandular juice to keep her nasty wife in her youth. They both like to sleep in coffins. If you can read it and smile, the rest will be easy.
