The bartender just wanted to make a movie because he wanted to. It's just that simple and he did it. Not only for the purpose, but also in creating a great movie, especially visually. He knows how to use a pan, slow motion sequences, tracking photos, crane photos, etc. in a beautiful, fluid way. It gives the film a very relaxing atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The story tells about the lives of 8 very different characters who have nothing to do with each other, except for one thing: an event that everyone is asking for. the turning point of this movie. The beauty of this image does not lie in the question of how characters affect each other (in comparison with a similar, obviously better movie, like Magnolia). I just do not think it was Barman's idea. Beauty lies in the various details of the experiences through which people pass, which makes their lives. The bartender successfully tells these little stories that describe small experiences. He knows people ... and Antwerp. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of the film is also excellent, but it's not a surprise, because we know that Bartender is also a very successful songwriter and musician with his dEUS team. Music is sometimes hot and relaxing at the same time, which contributes to the sunny, smooth nature of the film. Another time we hear funk pop / rock melodies that give scenes the strength they need. <br /> <br /> There is only one drawback, and this is the last half hour. Was this the time of work that broke me? Or maybe the last scenes that until now were fresh and accurate than the scenes? I can not understand it ... <br /> <br /> In total a beautiful sunny movie that raises Belgian cinema. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10! <br /> <br /> (This is a breeze that flows through the girl's hair on a sunny afternoon, making it even more beautiful, it's a fresh breeze that makes you rest when you pass by in a crowded party when someone opens the door is the wind that carries the perfume of this beautiful girl sitting next to you in the park you just met a week ago, it's a breeze .....) <br /> <br />
