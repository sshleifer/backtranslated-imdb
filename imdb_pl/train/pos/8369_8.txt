Hrm-I think this line comes from old movie posters. <br /> <br /> It's a stupid movie that seems to be translated from a language that was completely unknown to the translator. Here's a tip: every movie that starts with a black screen and the text "In the future ..." will be fun. This means that the premise is so unlikely that they must explain it to you. <br /> <br /> In this case, "In the future ..." means that instead of fighting, the nations have guys falling gigantic robots and duke it to determine, well, it's never really clear, but it's probably something very important. There are good guys (of course, capitalists, ie "Nas") and bad guys (communists!), And there are big stop-motion robots. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately the budget of the effects was quite small, so not to see many large robots. There are plenty of cheap interiors, and then a great cosmic battle at the end. Space combat is especially nice because it does not serve purposes other than the blow of the rest of the effects budget. <br /> <br /> After these spent money, the climactic fight degenerates (and I'm not doing it up) two guys banging on sticks. I can always laugh at the bar, playing the last scene, along with the last line guaranteeing that no audience scratches their heads. <br /> <br /> As I said - it's stupid. That's why I bought the tape.
