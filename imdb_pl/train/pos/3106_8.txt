Without seeing the films before (and not being able to bear Matt Damon), I did not want to see the Bourne Ultimatum when we were asked to see him in film studies of AS. <br /> <br /> However, I was pleasantly surprised that even a movie with Damon can be pleasant. <br /> <br /> Fast fighting scenes, crazy motorcycle chases and BIG explosions were what threw you out of the TBU seat. The most difficult moments between the CIA and Bourne made you hang on your fingers and entertain you. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, a few things really hurt my cheese. <br /> <br /> First, the fact that the film was just a series of Bourne, CIA, Bourne, CIA, Bourne, CIA. This sequence has become repetitive and eventually boring. Although Damon played with us and seemed always a step ahead of the CIA, I was a little irritated by Bourne's continued survival. He crashed the car and got out, as if he was touching it or something! Very unrealistic. <br /> <br /> And secondly (inevitably) - SHAKY CAMERA. It was so unstable that it was completely noticeable and made me and everyone who went to see it in my class (even tutors) of seasickness. The teachers told us that if we ever used it in the film that we did in the class, it would automatically make a mistake and tell us to use the tripod. Okay, if Greengrass would like it to look like Damon and Stiles are talking, but we certainly would not shake our heads so sharply! <br /> <br /> But in total, TBU is a nice movie and worth watching. But I did not think it was the best film of the year, even though it is a funny piece of cinema. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
