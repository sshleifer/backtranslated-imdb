This film seems to draw a line - on the one hand, those who love it, on the other hand those who consider it unbearable. <br /> <br /> At the beginning there is a lot of comedy in this movie that many viewers do not get. Of course, Li's mask looks like Kato Bruce Lee - it should be a joke. A guy who has a clock bomb stitched to his heart - outraged? Of course it's a joke! Some readers will probably ask if this movie should be so funny, why all this excessive and bloody violence? well, on the one hand, tolerance for this level of violence is actually different, from culture to culture; and although the audience in Hong Kong would recognize that this violence is extreme, it is certainly only slightly more than the average for the HK action movie. <br /> <br /> Also, the Black Mask is really a kind of film that adopts conventions and pushes the genre to the extreme, simply because the conventions themselves are completely unrealistic. After decades of observing people shot without visible open wounds, many people were terrified to see how Bonnie and Clyde and the Wild Branch outlaws gush blood all over the world. But the fact is that when you're shot with a quick metal bullet, it's almost certain that the blood will start to spurt, especially from the artery. <br /> <br /> This movie is a Chinese comic book. It is true that Spiderman films will never get this top - but if they were faithful to reality, they would be! Well, despite the beginnings of the comic, this movie is faithful to reality. <br /> <br /> The only complaint I have is a brilliant, over-stylized film and editing. If the creators of this film made it with a view to nostalgia in the Hollywood style (such as The Rocketeer or a recent movie about Captain Sky), I doubt that anyone would find it offensive. <br /> <br /> But at the moment I was still having a good time watching this movie.
