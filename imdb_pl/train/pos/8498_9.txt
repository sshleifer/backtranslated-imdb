This is a great movie with a funny, wise story and the dynamics of cultural differences, and the theme of what is important in life makes this film very underestimated. Do not let the cynics of the world stop you from doing so. Keaton has great moments and I'm wondering that comedy is never appreciated because actors such as Keaton make the transition from humor to serious fragments look very easy. A great movie all around!
