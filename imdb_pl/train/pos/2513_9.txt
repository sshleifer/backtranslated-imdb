Beautifully done. A lot of anxiety. Friendship may not endure everything, but in the end it all matters, or a group of friends learn. I watched it over and over again. Music is also amazing. When Kei loses one friend he has, he surrenders until he meets Sho, an orphan boy who is not repelled by his true nature. On the illegal streets of Mallepy, they fight for their place among the crucible of Asian races and they learn that sometimes being on top can cost you more than you are willing to pay. A surprise that ends as hard as the whole movie. I could not have it. Gackt and Hyde do a great job, proving they're more than pretty boys who sing.
