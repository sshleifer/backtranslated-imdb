The message of the world on the edge of the war is ignored by the masses; The mythical city of Everytown in 1940 represents England in general, but it can also mean any nation of the world. When the war finally arrives, its devastation has not lasted for five years, but until 1966, when Everytown is completely destroyed. An additional trump of humanity is the "wandering disease", a plague that lasts for the next four years. <br /> <br /> The "things that come" balances both the fatalistic and futuristic worldview, where science is holding hope for a reborn civilization. The concept of "Wings Over the World" takes place somewhat trite, although his spokesperson Cabal (Raymond Massey) is unwavering in his mission and devoted to the cause. If he fails, others will go. This message is constantly being reinforced throughout the film, convincingly restored to the end of Massey's film speech. The insatiable human need to test the boundaries of knowledge and achievements requires a "whole universe or nothing" way of thinking. <br /> <br /> Images of automation and machines in the second half resemble the big silent film "Metropolis". Since Everytown is being rebuilt and transformed until 2036, the city revival play strikes with a resonant chord because the architecture of modern cities suggests an incredibly prophetic vision of the film comes to fruition. But where the film broke down for sixty-seven years, it was the first human mission to the Moon, but in 1936 a century-old schedule probably seemed more justified than in 1969. <br /> <br /> "Things to come" is one of the rarities in the movie, an image that makes you think. Which side will you come, strength for advancement in the face of uncertainty or maintaining the status quo? This is not a convenient question because both choices offer inherent dangers and unknowable results. Those who choose to be outsiders risk being kidnapped by forces beyond their control.
