No trash - no even close trash. Not the original? this is the last thing you can say about "2.4 children". Predictable? definitely not! Although it was quite an unusual series for the BBC, it was fun, funny and witty. I especially liked Belinda Lang and John Pickard - who, I think, did a great job. Gary Olsen was also very good and all other cast members. relatively young age. I would like them to do more comedies of this type, much more (and show them here in Israel).
