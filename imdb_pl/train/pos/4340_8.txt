I liked the movie, maybe because I did not see any reviews, etc. It was delightful and a little 'amused'. I do not know why he did not make a splash any more than he did. Regarding the story, I could refer to some aspects of Paul Reiser's character and I could "see my dad" in the form of Falk. I remembered many recent times when I was a child and I also listened to my grandparents. If you like movies like Grumpy Old Men or On Golden Pond, this is your movie. In my opinion, "sleepy" and one of those good feelings. Peter Falk and Paul Reiser had many wonderful verbal quarrels, but nothing was exaggerated. I would say that it has at least 8, maybe even more.
