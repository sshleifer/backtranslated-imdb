Although it certainly was not the best movie I've ever seen, it was definitely worth $ 8 (which can not be said for many films these days). <br /> <br /> It was a nice description of a real story, although many details of the true story were twisted for the movie (i.e. Billy Sunday's character is three or four people in a true story combined together.) Robert DeNiro was of course good, and Cuba Gooding, Jr. he was also impressive.
