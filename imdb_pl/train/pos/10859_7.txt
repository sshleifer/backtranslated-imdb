Not to be confused with the school movie Resse Witherspoon with the same name, it's a stylized look at Hong Kong gang triads. It's called elections because a new leader or "chairman" is chosen by ancient traditions every two years. The two candidates are in position and thanks to ego, bribes and past records the race is at least tense. Specially directed to introduce you to the expansive cast, never confusing the twists and turns of action before revealing yourself in all your brutal glory. He is not an Asian godfather, but he is a nice gangster thriller that will leave you on the edge of your seat and win over violence. Subtitle volume 1 I think it is safe to say that there will be other parts as we dig deep into the dark world of the triads and all their feudal and insidious business transactions. Anyway, this is a good start and if there are no sequels, a great movie in itself.
