I just watched it after my mother brought it to me from America, afraid to watch it after all the negative comments here, but I have to say that acting is bad, some effects are funny. <br /> <br /> But you have to remember that it was supposed to be 1898, not 2005, and with such a low budget, I thought it was quite good. I liked this version much more than the Spielberg version I saw last week. <br /> <br /> I have read the book so many times and almost all the time I went "ahh yeah, it's in the book", the second version almost did not exist. <br /> <br /> Well done, at least trying to create a real version.
