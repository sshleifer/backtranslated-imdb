This was my first introduction to the Bollywood world and now I'm addicted! Okay, that requires a different attitude to watching American movies, but when you let yourself enjoy what it is, you will not be disappointed. The songs are wonderful, melodious and very catchy. Actors are visually attractive, especially Karisma Kapoor, who is certainly one of the most beautiful actresses in the film world. Locations, the color is magical. If you want something different and want to be uplifted, excited and excited, I recommend catching this movie.
