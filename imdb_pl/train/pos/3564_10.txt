{The possible appearance of spoilers ... you have been forewarned.} <br /> <br /> This is absolutely one of my favorite musicals and movie musicals! (The second is the bloody Yankees with Gwen Verdon, Tab Hunter and Ray Walston). As we all know, sometimes the light (not to mention the songs) from the series is lost in the transition from the stage to the screen. In most cases, this is not the case here. <br /> <br /> Sets are divine, bright and colorful, characters are bigger than life, and you can not love them, and Michael Kidd's choreography is absolutely stunning. (I'm so glad that they used the original Broadway choreographer) <br /> <br /> All actors "reflect the ball" (that is, they have unmatched chemistry) to perfection in this film. Frank and Marlon are absolutely credible as the owner of the oldest established permanent floating-crap game in New York and the most famous gambler who puts down even the tiniest of things - such as his fever reaching 104, if he does not take penicillin. The sweet, fresh face of Jean Simmons is perfect for Sarah's role (although it is true that her squeaking pipes are not as outstanding as Isabel Bigley or Josie de Guzman) - a missionary doll with a gold heart and a ride to heal everyone. And last but not least (on my list) is Miss Vivian Blaine, who returns to her role on Broadway as Miss Adelaide - singer and dancer of Hot Box, who would like to finally end her 14-year engagement in Nathan's marriage and get rid of herself from the psychosomatic cold he gave her. <br /> <br /> First of all, fame for Stubby Kaye and BS Pulley, as they repeat their roles on Broadway, Nicely-Nicely Johnson and Benny Southstreet. There have never been two more nice gamblers than these guys. <br /> <br /> Brando is wonderful, as usual, and although he does not have the voice of Robert Alda or Peter Gallagher, you forget about it - because he has the sense of determination to bring everything in his power to the role of Sky Masterson. "Luck Be A Lady" gives me shivers every time I see him doing the number. It's especially nice to hear him say, "Dad ... I have cider in my ear." <br /> <br /> Simmons is charming and pleasant in a role that fits her look, voice and the way she wears. I miss her so much that you will not only get Heaven (or, eventually, believe him), but also to help people overcome gambling, drinking and other sins and live with God. Her performance "If I Were A Bell" is great, at least! <br /> <br /> Sinatra is a man. He's perfect for the role of Nathan Detroit - and here he sings parties that Sam Levene never did from Broadway (a great actor, but the guy was a deaf tone ... go). I really liked the addition of the song "Adelaide" ... I would like a guy to sing like this to ME. Frankie's cool, slippery behavior crosses the boundaries of this film. But most importantly, you want him to marry Adelaide. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Adelaide, Vivian Blaine is simply pure perfection in this role. From accent to her "Lament Adelaide", she is simply great. It is also my favorite part of the whole movie. It really makes you feel like in Adelaide ... especially when she cries right before and then again during "Sue Me". I still have not decided if I like "Pet Me Poppa" better than "Bushel and a Peck" ... but maybe I like them as well. Either way, he copes well with these and also with "Take Back Your Mink". (I am sad that they omitted the "hollanderize" of the movie ...) She is absolutely EXCELLENT, not to mention the funny and my favorite part of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about this movie is their jargon. It is a mix of high-class and street slang. They never use "To", "I" or "To". There is always "it is", "I will" and "it is". Generally speaking, Guys & Dolls is one of my favorite movies and musicals of all time, and this is one that you should take some time to watch whenever it appears. My only complaint? Not "Marry The Man Today." Now THIS is a good song.
