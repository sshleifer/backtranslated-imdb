When I saw this as a child, he answered all my questions and dispelled all the fears and misunderstandings I had. It is easy to watch because it is animated, which makes it unimaginable. There are no moral prejudices or aspects of "preaching", so no one should have any objections to him. It is a nice movie that simply gives the fact of menstruation in a calming, "matter-of-fact" way. I hope to show this to my daughter.
