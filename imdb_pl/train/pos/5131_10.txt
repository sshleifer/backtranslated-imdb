Jammin 'the Blues is an Oscar-nominated short film from 1944, which is basically 10 minutes of jazz improvisation played in one long cavity. Marie Bryant sings "The Sunny Side of the Street" in one moment to highlight the movie, and then jitterbugs from Archie Savage to bring this most fun "jam session" to an exciting end. Director Gojn Mili was a photographer and this experience shows some of the photos from the double exposure of some musicians, which make it one of the most innovative corners of the 40's. According to some notes, I read that one of the musicians was white and had to be filmed in a figure reflecting the social attitudes of those times. What a pity. Even so, this most remarkable movie from that time is available on YouTube, so if you love jazz, I suggest that you look for it.
