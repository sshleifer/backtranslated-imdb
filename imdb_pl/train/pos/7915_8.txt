This is "odysessy through time" through computer animation, supposedly the work of over 300 artists. Created in the late 1980s and released in 1990, it was the latest material for the day. I thought that the spots are good and quite interesting. <br /> <br /> Most of the short scenes did not make sense, only the forms evolved into other forms, but it was fun to watch. It's about visuals, not about any story. There were strange sequences in which strange-looking male beings danced with eavesdropped birds. All this is computer animated, which was something new at the time. Even the term "animated computer" was not well known. <br /> <br /> It's just a chance to show this new technology in short pieces of cartoon-like events with beautiful colors and imaginative scenes. No words, only pictures with electronic music. Stoners had to really love it. <br /> <br /> It's nice, intriguing 40 minutes of "sweetness" and "sweetness". Thanks to today's CG effects, it could have lost influence, but I think you would still be enjoying it.
