"Party Girl" uses Parker Posey's enormous charm. Sometimes the movie seems to be a vehicle in which Mrs. Posey lets herself be entertained, as usual in real life. <br /> <br /> The film directed by Daisy Von Scherler Mayer is a treat for Mrs. Posey's fans. Mrs. Von Scherler Mayer takes us on a crazy trip to Lower Manhattan to show us this aimless soul, whose life is dedicated to the fun in various clubs that constantly visit. This is an era that was still more na√Øve than the area and the neighboring districts of the meat market. At least in the movies, there is no grudge and we see how people approach their lives in a normal way, if we can call it that. It is thanks to Parker Posey that we enjoy the film more than if another actress played Mary. She is the whole picture. The rest of the cast is good.
