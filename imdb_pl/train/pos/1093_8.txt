I always like this movie when it appears on TV. <br /> <br /> The only scene that always stands out is for me the one with Myrna Loy and the paint brigadier, where he gives him clear instructions on colors and as soon as he walks away, he turns the boys around and says, "Is this you understood, it is yellow, blue, green and white "
