Some of Altman's well-known "masterpieces" seem to me sadder now. Maybe it's me. Like the last reviewer, I like even this "smaller" Altman (recently shown on FMC), although I do not think he's targeting a wide audience. Organization policy as a "microcosm" for public campaigns. Some of these satirical "docudramas" are now obsolete, like Dick Cavett watching the "Tonight Show", but I consider many of these dialogues to be fun and insightful (eg "You are really." History is not "deep", but I liked it. And performances are fun, especially Cavett (as "alone"), Lauren Bacall as an aging conservative figure, Glenda Jackson (who actually became a member of Parliament) as a leftist ideologist (on the opening stage of lecturing someone in the guise of a carrot about the sanctity of politics), and Carol Burnett as a basket. All in the unique style of Altman, though not entirely as unique as usual. But quite unique.
