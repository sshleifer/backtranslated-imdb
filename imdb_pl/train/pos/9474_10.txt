I had to see this movie in the preview and I was stunned. This is not a typical romantic comedy. I do not remember being so laughed in the movie, and yet I was moved. Laughs are not gags here - they are observations, laughter of appreciation, minor shocks: "Oh, my God, I thought I was the only one who felt that way!" I will not reveal a story that is more than just "Guy falls in love with a girl your brother. " The whole family plays an important role here. Probably the best mix of laughter and warmth since "When You Were Sleeping". <br /> <br /> Steve Carell goes much deeper than before, and for the first time I really liked him. The cast is amazing, a list of experienced theater actors whom I loved in other roles, but they create a convincing family. Dianne Wiest is cute like her mother, Juliette Binoche is great and funny (who knew she was funny?), And even the offensive Dane Cook gives a warm, quiet, touching performance. The Sondre Lerche soundtrack is a great addition and I will buy a second CD in which it is available. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this.
