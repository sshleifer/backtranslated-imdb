I do not know "Largo Winch" as a comic book (is it a graphic novel? I do not actually know), but I must admit that when I heard about an agent / character film, I was expecting something different than what I really got. <br /> <br /> Although it was surprising at first, it was nice to watch this move. You can never really tell where it will go (some phrases are predictable, but in general you can never really say if it will end). It's more than the main actor's stellar performance and a really good cast, so it's a nice watch. Not like some people can hope or expect such a movie, but a really good mix.
