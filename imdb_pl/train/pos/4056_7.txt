I saw it on SBS TV here in Australia in the second week, where it was called "Laputa: Castle in the sky". I turned on the subtitles and I think that SBS provided them with what was usually very good quality. <br /> <br /> I just checked "Laputa" on Wikipedia and confirms what I suspected ... the floating island of this story comes from the classic novel by Jonathan Swift "Podróże Guliwera", which was published at the beginning of the mid-eighteenth century. <br /> <br /> In any case, it's an addictive Japanese tale that contains English speaking in a voice. I think it is suitable for small children, but it takes just over two hours, so for some it may be too long, though not for adults like me. <br /> <br /> The story concerns two children who are looking for a legendary floating island with a castle. Children are not the only ones who are looking for this island. They have pirates, an army and spies who are also looking for an island, and want to capture children (Sheeta, a girl whose voice was taken by Anna Paquin, and Pazu, a boy, expressed by James Van Der Beek) to help them find it. <br /> <br /> The graphics are great ... sometimes photorealistic, especially stonework scenes lit by torchlight, or nice scenes of bright, sunny days, with white clouds, or fog. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
