I saw this movie for the first time as a young boy and I recently bought it on DVD. <br /> <br /> James Stewart brings great depth to the role of Chip Hardesty, a hardworking and devoted FBI agent. His life in the Office intertwines with his family life, which is not at all rosy. His wife (excellent character of Very Miles) lives in fear of the dangerous nature of his work, and even for some time they separate; Chip's best friend and co-worker, Sam Crandall (Murray Hamilton) is killed in the shooting; Chip's son, Mike, enlists in the Marines during World War II. Thanks to this, the family continues its courage and dignity. <br /> <br /> The action sequences are quite exciting, and the half-documentary style of the movie works effectively. And Max Steiner's music says it all; loyalty, courage and honesty. <br /> <br /> This country owes a great debt of gratitude to men and women from the FBI, as well as to J. Edgar Hoover. If Mr. Hoover's vigilance were observed, we could spare on September 11 a sharp increase in the number of crimes against children and many criminal politicians we had to endure from his death.
