Although I have not started reading "classics" in literature until I turned 47, it is never too late. Jane Eyre is a favorite for many reasons, mainly because there is no part of the book I liked less, only the parts I liked more. A mini-television series from 1983. With Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton, he was everything I hoped for. I saw it as a full-length film in 2006. Rochester "was very good, but I absolutely loved" Jane Eyre "Zelah. Referring to another movie, "Classics," which I last saw, I was disappointed with the production, direction and dialogue. It was only faithful to Hollywood's greed and arrogance. Artistic license for great works in literature is nothing but plagiarism. Using a title after such a license is a scam. Leave it to the British to get this right (among other things). You will not be able to read the book again without experiencing the movie in the right context and spirit. Good BBC job.
