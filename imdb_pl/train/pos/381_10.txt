I gave this film 10 not because it is a perfectly coherent movie, but because of its pure ability to evoke emotions in the audience. The story of the struggle of one woman with all adversities is already an old stereotype, but very few films have achieved it with such warmth and sincerity as The Color Purple. <br /> <br /> It also showed another side of the African-American experience - showing that after granting freedom to the slaves, many fell in the way of the hated "white man" and were abusive to their own people. I consider this to be an important point, because it is contrary to the trend of presenting white to black violence and winning-Oscar. <br /> <br /> Acting performances are also great - especially Oprah, which now has a new, recognized respect. <br /> <br /> It's worth watching - but keep some tissue at hand.
