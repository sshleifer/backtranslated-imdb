This is undoubtedly one of the funniest films ever made. Amitabh as a native, Arjun Singh, is funny. The best part is that laughter never ends. The plot is the same old story in which the child is separated from the mother, who sacrifices everything on her duty - with a happy meeting at the end. There are villains (Ranjit) and there are brothers (Sashi Kapoor), there are foxes (Parveen Babhi) and there are lovers (Smita Patil), and the blind brother and grandfather are thrown for good. But this movie is about Amitabh and that's all you can remember at the end. <br /> <br /> Amitabh comes to the city to live decently, and his delivery of dialogues and manners is fun. Later in the film, he changes into Angry Young Man, of which he is famous, but humor stays. Memorable parts include his walking, speaking and speaking in English, a song (pad gungaroo re bhand, meera nachi thi) and everything with his dadoo. <br /> <br /> In total, I was laughing with the whole movie. If you want 3 hours of entertainment with Amitabh at its best - that's it. It will easily give it 10/10.
