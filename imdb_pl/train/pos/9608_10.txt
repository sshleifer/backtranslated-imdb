If you have not seen this movie, I highly recommend it. It's a great real story. I love Alison Lohman, she is such a talented note: I also loved her in seventh heaven. The whole story is amazing and the way the characters chose it there were amazing. Acting in this movie is <br /> <br /> very amazing.
