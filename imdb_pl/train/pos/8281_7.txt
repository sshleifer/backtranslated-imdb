From the first scene I was very excited. "I can say that it will be amazing!" I thought. Acting was so good, I felt like I was watching the lives of these people. The music was also extremely disturbing. The plot started from an emergency, and then drifted forward (you could feel it) towards an irrevocable fate. The compilation was slow, but I personally like this kind of thing, as long as the calm tension remains on the track and is not derailed before it is ready for payment. <br /> <br /> So everything goes well and then the fireworks start and before you know it, the loans are rolling. "WHAT?!!!" it was all I could say with my companion film night. If you understand the intentions of the director, a blunt ending makes sense (for those who have already seen this movie, check out the fascinating and entertaining interview with Larry Fessenden on filmcritic.com), but I can not help but be totally distracted. <br /> <br /> This was probably solved with only ten minutes of material before the culmination. In any case, it's bad. Those ten minutes could change the world. (But for those who do not write or make movies, you should know that creating a story arc with the right time is a HUGE pain in the butt, and I certainly do not criticize it from any pedestal!) <br /> <br /> Wendigo feels like a masterpiece that was resigned before the end. But hay, I would take a blunt masterpiece every day on an overproduced piece of dog-poo with a surplus compensated by too many digital effects (like most horror movies nowadays). <br /> <br /> One more comment. Some scenes of monsters made me confused if I should be afraid or laughing. I do not know how to explain it, but in its more glaring "monstrous" forms I felt clearly in Monty Python. Although it may sound like horrible criticism for a horror movie - I do not know, it still worked for me in a dishonest way. I will never look again at a deer antler! :)
