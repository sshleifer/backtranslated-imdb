This is your typical cheerful and colorful MGM musical from the early 50's and definitely one of the best. <br /> <br /> The film was directed by an expert on the genre Vincente Minnelli and star Gene Kelly in the lead. They both made a lot of films together at the time, of which he is probably the best known. <br /> <br /> The film itself has managed to win the best Oscar painting in a year, which means that he has beaten films such as "A Place in the Sun", "Tram called Desire", "African Queen", "Quo Vadis", "The Blue Veil", "Death of a Salesman" this year. A true achievement, of course, but at the same time a little too much recognition for this amazing, bright and entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> When you watch this movie, you will certainly enjoy it, which is also thanks to the film its beautiful color and many nice characters in this film. Musical numbers are also nicely made, which is not a big surprise when people like Vincente Minnelli and Gene Kelly are at work. <br /> <br /> But really, it could not be that everything that was said in this movie was done about half as much? I mean, we already know where the movie is going, but it still manages to extend it as long as possible. Not because it causes the movie to be dragged in any part, but it makes it a bit longer. The film could also be definitely made using several smaller music numbers. <br /> <br /> One of the best MGM musicals, although it was not without flaws. <br /> <br /> 8/10
