"What would you do?" that's a question that will stay in mind for a few weeks after seeing the emotional Brokedown Palace. You are also wondering if Alice (Danes) is telling the truth or not - a question that remains unresolved and rightly so. This is a particularly well made and beautifully filmed movie. Although it is sometimes slow, its tempo reflects the story - but most of the movie will have you on the edge of the seat; wanting to know what's going on. The ending will also leave you to imagine yourself as the main characters that Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes play splendidly. Bill Pullman's performance is also praiseworthy.
