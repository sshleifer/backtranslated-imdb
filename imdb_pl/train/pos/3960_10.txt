According to the director, this film was popular in Asia. It is difficult to take these Mats Helge movies seriously because most of his films are filmed in a very tight budget. Almost no USD. But it's fascinating to find out that Mats Helge is finally ending what you would call an action movie. The Ninja Mission is - I think - the best of all the films he directs. Some special effects are quite pleasant. This is not a movie "B" or "C". This is a movie "Z" - but a nice and fun movie "Z"!
