She played in our theater in Amsterdam, and the movie we wanted to see was sold out, so we went without knowing anything about it, except that it was a documentary about the planet. We were very pleased with our unhappiness, because it was a very powerful film about life and the delicate balance that we all share with the rest of the Earth's inhabitants. This movie has some of the most breathtaking photographs I've ever seen in a movie, and took me to places ranging from deserts to oceans to rainforests and showing things I've never seen in a movie, TV or book! "Earth" is a film that every student should see before he becomes tired. I will encourage my niece to watch this film because he inherits the planet we leave. It is also a movie to watch on the theater screen or a very large TV, because photography is so powerful and exotic.
