Blonde and Blonder has Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards in almost every scene, and if you want something more from the movie, you're totally unreasonable. It feels like the late era of Carry On, when the series was no longer burning, but it was even more fun than not, think about Behind or England and you will not be too far from the mark. Pamela and Denise are lively, charming and clearly aware that this is not a masterpiece they do, although you can pass it on to many things that I like. The supporting staff is energetic, even if some of them are not particularly good; I do not see a few duffs in a film that has already been practically forgotten, which has a significant impact on everything, so just smile. I really think that Blonde and Blonder is an ace and I hope you hate me for that.
