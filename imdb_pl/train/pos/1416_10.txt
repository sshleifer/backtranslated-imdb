EARTH is obligatory for children and adults. My son had a great time watching all the funny birds and ice bears. We can learn a lot from this movie and we should be proud of our great treasure on earth. Some animals may disappear. Exactly this problem should prevent all authorities of our planet. <br /> <br /> This document offers many unique photos that I have never seen before. Then heavenly music accompanies well. The director did a great job that is very respectful. Nothing can stop me and my family to give EARTH the highest rate. I hope that these things will create a continuation.
