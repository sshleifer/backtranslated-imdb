I liked Longstreet who followed the success of the Ironside Raymond Burra television series and aimed to give him competition. But this concert was canceled after one season, because it was decided - I wrongly believe - that Longstreet was not able to compete with Mr. Burra's Ironside. <br /> <br /> I can add that the pilot of this program was especially well done and very unforgettable. I hope you will see a set of Longstreet boxes. <br /> <br /> Writers should note that this idea of ​​history has been briefly discussed here and that much more can and should be done to show the game and the interplay of disability on television.
