I liked the movie and after watching it I was wondering how much "Caitlin Rose" exists in the world. How many other girls have been subjected to this type of sexual abuse and torture by classmates and were too scared to open their mouths? How dangerous and cruel teenagers can be because, as the film shows, who is right, it is not the most important who is popular and afraid who manipulates the minds of young people and influences them to enable this kind of immorality. Tiffani Amber Thiessen he gives a strong performance as a rape victim, and Brian Austin Green is convincing as a guy torn between a girl who he thought he loved and his best friend. deserves attention. Excellent and brilliant, too good to be just a movie for television.
