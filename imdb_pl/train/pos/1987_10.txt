This movie was amazing! I can not stop talking about it. I think I'm a bit too old for musicals, but this movie deserves recognition, guys! My favorite favorite was Jack Wild. I, being a British actor's lover, you can not stop me from these pretty young men. I never knew that when Jack did this movie, he was sixteen! He looks like eleven. It's low, it helps. Try to publish your answers, other posters so that I can refer to your experiences. Oh, and what about Oliver Reed, this guy, Bill Sikes, I think the drone's look is really familiar. Any idea he played in earlier? If so, publish it, I would really like to know.
