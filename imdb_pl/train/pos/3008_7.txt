Reliable William Powell. He is a joy to watch on the screen when he breaks through unprotected situations around the world. He always seems to be at the top of his game and shows little concern to anyone who doubts him. Murders are projects, barely human. I noticed that this is the basis of the leader. In addition to the accidental weeping widow, the victims perform the function of being a film. Nothing more. There are enough twists to keep things interesting along the way, and Powell is a champion. There is a lot of political uncertainty, especially with regard to Asian performers. It's a bit difficult to take. The cast is great and the direction of Curtiza is also a constant asset.
