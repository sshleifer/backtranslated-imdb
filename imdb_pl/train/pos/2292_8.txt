I just watched this early Bugs Bunny (he was named here for the first time) and the cartoon of Elmer Fudd on ThadBlog as a link from YouTube. It was the first time Chuck Jones directed the "wascally wabbit", so Bugs has a different voice than Mel Blanc than Brooklyn / Bronx, with whom we are more familiar. In fact, according to Thad, he directs Jimmy Stewart (his "shy boy" personality of that time). In any case, after Elmer buys his pet, Bugs becomes unbearable to him, turning the radio loudly, pretending to die after his master repeatedly throws him out of the shower and says, "Turn these lights off!" whenever Elmer catches him in his bed. Even with a different voice, Bugs is definitely his mischievous self and I laughed all the time blue! According to Thad, an additional scene appeared at the end of Elmer, which simply gave the house to Bugs in the underworld he underwent, but it was probably too sad, because he is suffering from a mental breakdown, so it's good that he is lost. In any case, I highly recommend Rabbit Elmer.
