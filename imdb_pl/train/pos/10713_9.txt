An angry boy who lost his parents tragically is under the care of his grandfather. Together they find a common ground in Gaelic folk tales that have been passed down from generation to generation to the islanders. Although the stories appear tragic episodes, such as highland X-rays, there is a surprising amount of humor and merriment in them. Everything is filmed in Skye, so there is a double dose of beauty. The mountain landscapes are breathtaking and it is a rare opportunity to hear the spoken Scottish Gaelic. I am English, so I had to read the subtitles, but the sound of spoken Gaelic music is still great. The performances are exactly what you can expect from carefully selected non-actors - in other words, you're watching the real thing - people who care deeply about Gaelic folklore and history. The Gaelic community, especially on Skye, has done countless minor miracles to make this movie. Everyone who has the least interest in Gaelic, folk history, folk music, oral culture, Scotland, British history, multiculturalism or social justice, should watch this film.
