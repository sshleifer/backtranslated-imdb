This film answers the question of how the relationship will survive when your girlfriend is dependent, afflicted, needy, jealous ... and has powers and abilities far beyond lethal women? <br /> <br /> Without the corruption of the movie, I can calmly assure you that it is not so, but it's great fun along the way. Uma Thurman is perfect as a mercury superhero, uber-babe, a mysteriously named G-Girl who, unlike most in her sister company, is not * always * devoted to truth, justice and the American Way. <br /> <br /> Thurman is also credible as completely stupid, but still somehow astringent, curator Jenny. When she is abandoned for a less gifted but more emotional and well-adjusted rival, G-Girl goes ballistic, and hence, is not pretty. It's fun, but it's not pretty ... <br /> <br /> It's a cute assumption, hell is not rage like a despised superhero, and those who are involved in it do not lead him at all, but he has his moments, and I think I'll get a DVD. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie ..
