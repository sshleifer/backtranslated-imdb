The premise for this film is simple, as is the script: an older Muslim gets his teenage son to lead him in a similar older combi from France to the high in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, so that he can fulfill his holy Muslim duty he died. The father is clearly pious, but the son is not impressed; he accepts from his father's duty, not religion, he would prefer to be with his (non-Muslim) girlfriend. The father is stubborn in many things that the son does not understand, and the irritation between them is a device that keeps the drama, although it is often quite annoying. However, like any good road movie, strange characters are on the way; for example, a woman at a crossroads in Croatia who, after asking for directions to Belgrade, simply enters the back seat and points her hand, saying one word that assumes that it is a place but can not find it on the map. In Bulgaria, another man who asks for a confirmation path may speak French, but then provides a comprehensive commentary in Bulgarian. From time to time there is humor - in one country the son gets tired of eating sandwiches with eggs and wants meat - they get a goat, but unfortunately (perhaps fortunately for the viewer), he escapes before the father can perform a Muslim slaughter ritual. In the end, they came to Mecca - the Muslim equivalent of the Vatican, but on a much larger scale. For Westerners, everything is bizarre but fascinating. The film is not sophisticated, but it is charming in its own way, a kind of National Geographic with a soul.
