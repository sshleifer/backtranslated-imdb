For Muslim women in West Africa, marital life from the hands of abusive husbands can be very difficult. The community can not clearly support such behavior, but it may as well not be ready to perceive it as a crime, which of course allows it to continue. Fortunately, the letter of Cameroonian law promises everyone equality, and this document shows the real exploits of various women practicing in the Cameroon legal system, which try to ensure justice for many women and children. Remarkable (apart from the uplifting central story) is that despite their informality, the courts are actually pragmatically progressive if the matter is actually bought. The program also gives a fascinating insight into the entire lifestyle of Cameroon, which (apart from the horrible crimes committed in the cases described) seems surprisingly emotional and joyful compared to that enjoyed by the inhabitants of Europe or North America. And although I admit that this comment may reveal naivety on my part, this attitude seems to be captured in a charming pidgin-English who they say. Overall, it's a great movie and a lot more fun than you can imagine.
