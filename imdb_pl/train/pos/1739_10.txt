from the point of view of a NASCAR maniac like me, the movie is interesting. You can see many racing cars from 1983. Even difficult, the racing scenes are not so realistic. I must admit, however, that I did not see any race before 1995, because before that time they did not show any NASCAR races in Germany) <br /> <br /> from the perspective of Burt Reynolds I'm a fan, the movie is basically what we're used to from Reynolds in the '80s: Burt behind the wheel of a fast car, like in his Bandit movies. <br /> <br /> If you love NASCAR and Burt Reynolds, this movie is compulsory. If you only love one of these two things, I recommend that you also look at it. If you do not like NASCAR or Burt Reynolds, you should still give him a chance, but remember, this movie was far from getting an Oscar. <br /> <br /> This is the typical humor of the 80's. If you like movies like Cannonball Movies and Police Academy, you'll also like it.
