Three girls (a female media team, including the cult actress Barbara Bach, no less) visiting a small town to take part in the festival, rent rooms in the house, which should be avoided like a plague. Well done small shock, suffering a little because of unnecessary dialogue scenes and a fairly thin plot line (which does not hide his secrets very well). In particular, one of the basic themes is quite disturbing (as in vintage shock-material), and this is essentially what the film is developing. The performances and photos are well above average (compared to many other films from the late 70s and early 80s in the same spirit), but what the film really recommends to me is a fairly long climax scene in the basement. Since the introduction of the character "Keller Junior" his performance caused that my jaw dropped and did not close until the end of the movie. A very nice surprise for actor Sydney Lassick (who was funny in "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's nest", and now completely mad in "The Unseen") is one of the main roles.
