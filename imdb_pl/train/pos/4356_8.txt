"The thing about my people" was a surprise. We had no idea what to expect. The film directed by Raymond DeFelitta, based on the screen art of one of his stars, Paul Reiser, has been a pleasant time in movies. Although the film is predictable and we know what the result will be, it's a journey of discovery where Ben meets his father, perhaps for the first time in his life, Ben sees his father for what he really is and not for the mythical character he has in head. <br /> <br /> The film seems to be a vehicle for his star, Peter Falk, and he escapes with the film as expected. Mr. Falk, one of the most endearing actors working in films in this era and in recent years, is an actor of such height that must be reckoned with. As Sam Kleinman, Ben's distant father, he is a man who is clearly misunderstood not only by Ben, but also appears in the whole family and his wife for forty-seven years. <br /> <br /> When Muriel Matriarch of the Kleinman clan escapes, everybody gets panicked because this woman who was a strong family figure is essential to keep everyone together. Not knowing where she was going, Sam appears in Ben's house, confused when he suddenly feels abandoned by the woman he married and has been faithful over all these years. <br /> <br /> Ben, the youngest son, takes his father on a journey looking for a house that he wants to buy so he can take his family from Manhattan to the country. The journey is an excuse for Ben to get involved with his father in a way that he never knew, because the old man always showed the young son a way out of the way. Along the way, father and son realize how much they love each other and how the old man is misunderstood by his children. Sam's love for Muriel covers many years that they knew; they seem inseparable. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk is great in the movie. He's doing a great Sam Kleinman, a man who suddenly realizes that his life will change soon. Mr. Falk shines like an older man and never has a false movement in his interpretation of a man whose whole world is falling apart. <br /> <br /> Not being a fan of Paul Reiser, we must admit that it is Ben Kleinman, he is right. Ben and his father discover how much they have in common and their love for Muriel, the mother who sacrificed her life to keep the family together. Olympia Dukakis is only seen at the end of the movie. She makes a good contribution as a runaway mother. Elizabeth Perkins plays Rachel with a great style. <br /> <br /> The film has a beautiful look thanks to the photos of Dan Gillham and the great music of Steven Argili. Finally, the film shows a great team effort between its director, Mr. DeFelitta and Paul Reiser, who wrote it on the screen. <br /> <br /> Although this video is clearly aimed at older audiences, it should please everyone.
