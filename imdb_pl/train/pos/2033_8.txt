Actually, the answer only takes a small part of this great movie Imax, which educates us about our delicate self. CG and special cameras - assisted by Imax - unbelievably reveal the inner (and outer) activity of the average person, regardless of whether it is adult men and women, boys and girls or children. Almost every aspect of the human body is detailed: digestion, reproduction (with the impact of Marvin Gaye), heart, etc. Some particularly revealing moments include the way in which the baby can be submerged under water, and what the brain impulses look like. It's amazing how we function. <br /> <br /> The subject skips a lot. But all the time we learn a lot about our bodies that we should know about *.
