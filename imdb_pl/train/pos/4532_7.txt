It was Keaton's first feature and is in fact three short films, set in different periods (Stone Age, Roman Age, Modern Age) in the eternal romance triangle. The stories are parallel to each other, as in Griffith's INTOLERANCE, which aimed to satire. Strengths of jokes and gags are almost all based on anachronisms, introducing modern business to old settings. <br /> <br /> **** WARNING - SPOILERS COME TO OBTAIN THE BEST POINT ****** <br /> <br /> Here are the classic moments: <br /> <br /> Using turtle as a children's board (stone age); A wristwatch containing a solar disk (Roman century); Chariot with spare wheel (Roman epoch); Using a helmet as a tire block (Roman age); Early golf with sticks and rocks (stone age); Dictation of the will carved in the rock (stone age); Changing weather forecasts (Roman century); Chariot race on the snow -Buster using skis and husky with a spare dog in a chariot shoe (Roman Age). <br /> <br /> The above are all thrown gags that giggle us. There are also unforgettable moments: <br /> <br /> Buster taking out the shaving equipment to match makeup for makeup; Fantastic double serving, when drunk Buster is staring at his plate to discover that the crab is staring at him (jumped in a second to stand in a chair from a sitting position and jump back into the arms of the waiter - one of the funniest) moments that I've seen). And this lion - manicure - just genius. <br /> <br /> There is also a bit of racism when four African-American litter carriers abandon their lover for a Roman crap game. <br /> <br /> Printing Cinema is a bit blurred and contains numerous sequences of both nitrate destruction and film damage - most likely at the ends of the drums. The Metro function is evaluated using the piano and the flute, and borrows from Grieg. <br /> <br /> A lot of fun and laughter.
