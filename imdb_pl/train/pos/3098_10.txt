I really enjoyed the concert and I am so incredibly sad that it seemed to me that he was back, but only two silly weeks. This is terrible. I hate it when we never know how everyone ends. it sucks. Bring it back! ABC has stupid shows like Supernanny and whatever, but it does not give good time, like Six Degrees. If they complain about the ratings, it's probably because they had a bad slot because it was a really good performance that I could relate and predict. JJ Abrams has delivered it, it is amazing, I would like ABC to trust him enough to finish the story. I also loved the entire cast. I could not wait to see how everyone would meet each other. The story of all is now incomplete, now I will never know whether Steven and Whitney will meet, whether Carlos and Mae. I wanted to see what would happen to Laura, Damien and everyone else. This is really such a fall.
