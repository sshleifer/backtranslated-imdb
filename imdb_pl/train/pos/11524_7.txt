It's a weird little movie and I have to agree that there are some bizarre acts in it. <br /> <br /> Talks about the adventures of a young man who decides to become a famous Las Vegas illusionist and partly about following dreams, partly about the dreams of others, and all about the hardships of show business. I thought the movie is cute and has a moment or two of true magic that makes everything profitable. <br /> <br /> Alan Arkin is wonderful as a magician who has never been, and his mentoring Max makes a funny and moving relationship. <br /> <br /> Probably not for everyone, but if you like movies about the trip, then you probably like it.
