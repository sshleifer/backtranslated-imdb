Initially, I had doubts about this film (only because of the subject), but richly drawn figures, fabulous buffalo hunting scenes and a dramatic conclusion make it worth watching. Initially, I had problems distinguishing between two buffalo hunters, but as the film progressed, they became more and more distinctive. I'm still haunted by the last scene.
