Sure, it's not classic, but full of classic lines. One of the few movies that I and my friends quote all the time, and that's fifteen years later (maybe it was too many times in Cinemax!) Michael Keaton is actually the worst actor in this movie to figure out how to play it - but it's surrounded by a fantastic cast who knows exactly how to play this parody. Are you looking for a movie to cheer you up? That's it, but rent it with friends - it's even better.
