I decided not to believe what the well-known film critics say. Although this movie did not receive the best comments, this movie has made my day. I thought about it. What a fake world. <br /> <br /> What do you do when your loved ones cheat you. It is said that no matter how often you feed a snake with milk, it will never be loyal and will bite it when it gets a chance. In the same way, some people are those who are never grateful. This movie is about how selfish people can be and how everyone ultimately thinks about themselves and works for themselves. <br /> <br /> A brother accidentally dies at the hands of a gangster. The surviving brother decides to take revenge. Thanks to this process, we recognize the futility of this world. Nothing is real and nobody is loyal to anyone. <br /> <br /> Amitabh gave his life. The new actor Aryan gave a good performance. The actress who played Amitabha's wife stole the program. Her role was small, but she presented her role so diligently that her performance moved her. Chawla had a really great facial expression, but her role was very limited and she was not given a chance to express herself fully. <br /> <br /> Great movie Raj Kumara Santoshi. His films always convey the message to the public. His films are like the novels of Nanak Singha (a Punjabi novelist whose novels have always had a purpose and excelled at social evil) because they have a real message to the public. They are fun and give lessons.
