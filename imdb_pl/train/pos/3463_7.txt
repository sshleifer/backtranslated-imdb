I am a big fan of the Beatles. My favorite Beatlem is Paul, and my least favorite is John. I already knew a lot about the Beatles 'music and the truth behind the disintegration, as well as things like the John Lennon family and Paul Wings' band. I was curious to see how this movie will deal with the relationship between John and Paul many years after the breakup. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed with this movie. Although the story itself is a fiction, many references used by two musicians were very accurate. They included the way Yoko Ono will always be with John, wherever he goes, Wings' song "Silly Love Songs" is the number one hit of the year and a concert on the roof of Apple Studios playing music from the album "Let It Be". br /> <br /> The actors did a very good job in playing John and Paul. The accents might have been useful maybe a little more, but they seemed to act as I read two former Beatles who used to behave. I also liked the dialogue between them, which was basically what the whole movie was. <br /> <br /> The ending at the beginning disappointed me, but the more you think about it, the more you will be grateful, especially since it was how it really went in real life. They also show a fantastic sketch from "Saturday Night Live", in which the Beatles are offered $ 3,000 for a show in the series. (compared with 220 million others they offered) In general, I was not disappointed with this movie. It really gives you a sense of why the Beatles broke up and why they never came back to each other.
