After the first work of Fatih Akins, "Im Juli", which was quite good, he created a really great epic of the Italian family. This is a German film, which is unfortunately a bad prerequisite, because we rarely produce films more than moderate;). But this movie then makes very good photos. "Solino" refers to an Italian immigrant who comes to the German "Ruhr" region in the 1960s. Then the immigrant and his family start the first pizza restaurant in the region. Characters are perfectly drawn. Especially Gigi, the main actor. You live every second, every feeling it does. His brother, played by Moritz Bleibtreu, is not so good. Well, just do not believe him. But the character is well balanced and fits the script perfectly. I feel an urgent need to compare the style of this film with the "Godfather" style. Many people probably hate this movie, let's say it's boring. Not too much tension? - yes, but a scandalous movie. 9 out of 10.
