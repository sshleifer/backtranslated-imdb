What can I say about the first film? <br /> <br /> You can not rate this because it should not be fun. But if you MUST rate it, you should give it 10. It's great to see moving pictures from 1895. It was one of the most important films in history. I wonder what it was like to be one of the people who saw the first movie ever! <br /> <br />
