The humor contained in the full title proverb is derived from the dictates of the Sunday School that it would be better to prepare before you die to examine the devil, that is, the devil does not care when you are dead. There is no interest in trying to defeat the devil. The heroes apparently did not pay attention to the Sunday school and were forced to manage the crisis, avoiding the crisis. But even an experienced CEO would have difficulty managing these crises. Throwing dice is far more unpredictable than tossing a coin; when people are involved, the list of possible outcomes becomes even longer than the long list of Sidney Lumet's unforgettable films. Until now, Hawke may not have been an unforgettable actor, but he may have had an eye on earning Lumet All Stars, such as Steiger and Pacino.
