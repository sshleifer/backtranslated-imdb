The mating game is a charming, wonderful film from a bygone era. Hollywood must consider a remarkable remake of this movie. My wife and I would visit her. <br /> <br /> This is the perfect romantic comedy that we watched with my wife at AMC. <br /> <br /> This film has Tony Randall at its best. Debbie Reynolds is great, as always. <br /> <br /> I really liked it. We plan to order DVDs to add to our growing collection of movies. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that Hollywood no longer makes such films. <br /> <br /> Hey Hollywood ... it's time to dig some of these scripts from the old safe, update them a bit (without corrupting the original movie and script, as you did with other alterations) and hold the connection. <br /> <br /> Remake would be a huge hit on the silver screen, DVD and cable / SATTV. <br /> <br /> SN Austin, TX
