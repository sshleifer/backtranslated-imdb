I've watched almost all of the Gundam / Mech anime shows in the US and it definitely has the best story. The way his plot changes and changes attracts attention. Gundam Wing is a series that focuses mainly on politics and war. The series follows a group of five fifteen-year-old boys who have been trained to pilot the most modern mobile suits known as Gundams. The Gundam pilots were trained to fight the mighty uprising known as Oz. As things begin to warm up between the OZ and Gundam pilots, new political groups will form and the old ones will disappear. Old conflicts will end and new ones will appear. To get peace, Gundam pilots have to face the events that take place in their world and put an end to all fights. But how far do people want to go to achieve their goal. I recommend this anime to anyone who is looking for a spectacle about a deep story.
