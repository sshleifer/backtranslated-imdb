This series premiered on "Comedy Central" cable television in the United States. He was cut to death and shown out of order. It was sad for the audience that he should have attracted, it was not and fell aside. Fortunately at the same time, my TV company went digitally and got the BBC. Thank God, because I got "The League of Gentlemen" in order, complete and unprocessed. <br /> <br /> Team "The League of Gentlemen" is on site with English "Monty Python's Flying Circus" and Canadian "The Kids in the Hall". But ... warning. <br /> <br /> The "Gentlemen's League" is a step further. It's not just about dressing up and spoiling cultural problems, but much deeper and much, much, darker. I can tell many of you right now - it offends certain groups of people, it will enrage others. But remember, it's the only comedy. A dark, dark comedy. If it's not your thing, do not watch. If you think you WILL find a dark comedy, look at it - if you get angry and upset, you do not quite know, DARK COMEDY. <br /> <br /> These guys did it right and right on the button. They are brilliant, they are perfect and I liked creating every character. There is a full story that is told here from the first to the end of the episode. You can not watch this one episode at a time, not wanting to, this is one of the charms of this series. Watch it in order. See how creative and stylish these people are. Nobody and nothing is out of reach. That, my dear, is a "dark humor". Bravo!
