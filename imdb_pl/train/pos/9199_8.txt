Dead To Rights is a policeman named Jack Slate who finds his murdered father and pursues a man whom he considers dead. Jack is shot and bound in the murder of a man he suspected of killing his father. <br /> <br /> A few months later, on the day Jack is executed, he escapes from prison and searches the city in search of a man who framed him in murder. Jack's search leads him through the * signal * that does not end until everyone is dead. <br /> <br /> During the game, Jack uses the M4 Carbines weapon for his Shadow dog to kill endless streams of people on 15 levels. The game essentially involves "killing 30 people, find the switch to open the door. Knock 50 people, find the switch to open the door" over and over until the level runs out. or disarming bombs. <br /> <br /> Dead To Rights is also a difficult game. You'll be placed in an area rife with bad guys armed with Sub machine guns, while you only have a gun. At the end of the game the skill turns into dust and you have to rely on luck. <br /> <br /> Dead To Rights is as bloody as it is difficult. If you shoot a guy in the face with a gun, blood will splatter on the walls, ceiling and floor. And because there are a few guys in every area, the walls will be painted with blood. <br /> <br /> Family fun for everyone.
