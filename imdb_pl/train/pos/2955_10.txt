There is a certain charm that I always discovered, discovering a great (half) unknown film. These discoveries have almost always been dramatic films - in my experience, unknown science fiction, action and horror are unknown for very, very good reasons. I found "High Tide" on video in a garbage store, mixed up with countless tens of tapes of varying quality. Of course, this is the only place I can find him because he is still not on DVD. <br /> <br /> While watching Judy Davis (as Lillie) during this movie, I was somehow certain that he was watching a wonderful, undiscovered performance. Yes, I've seen Davis in a few small parts before - and one of the main roles in "A Passage to India." But although it was great in the movie, "High Tide" is a completely different animal. Recently, watching the later film by Gillian Armstrong, "Charlotte Gray," I was perfectly aware of the kind of actress who impresses her. Davis draws much more than just a similarity to Cate Blanchett - both in a way and sensibility. <br /> <br /> Judy Davis' performance is stunning, I can not say enough good things about it. He has an amazing relationship on screen with young Claudia Karvan (as Ally), another great actress of this film. There are many dramas and quiet humanity that they share, the details of which I do not intend to reveal here (see for yourself!). In "High Tide" it is too good to be described in one review. Indeed, I would not care - the movie speaks well enough for itself. In conclusion, I would like to praise screenwriter Laura Jones for her stunning dialogue, director Gillian Armstrong for understanding actors and great Russell Boyd for his brilliant, unappetized photos (please see his work in "Tender Mercy").
