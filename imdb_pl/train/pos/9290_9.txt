This is not a movie in which John Wayne is known. He plays a diplomat, a man who does things with words and persuasion, not physical action. The film moves with quiet realism through its seemingly uninteresting story. <br /> <br /> For people with open minds, patient and thoughtful, this movie is a rich presentation of an intriguing part of the story. <br /> <br /> There are two interwoven stories. A great story is an internalized, isolationist Japan and an external, expansionist America clashing when their interests clash. The small, human story is outside the barbarian (Wayne) and the initial enmity of the civilized geisha and the reluctance to turn to mutual respect and love. Human history is a reflection of the greater history of the two nations. <br /> <br /> The film is very well done and all actors play their roles well. The two main roles are performed to perfection. John Wayne is perfect as Townsend Harris, striking exactly the right combination of strength and negotiation in dealing with the Japanese. Eiko Ando is also excellent as the title geisha, charming and delightful. The interaction between her character and John Wayne is particularly well-represented. That's how the two people would behave (as they are shown in the film). <br /> <br /> The script is very well written. He lacks all the pomposity. and is a realistic representation of how the presented events could have occurred. The heroes are real people, not consciously "big" figures from history. What's more, the clash of cultures and interests is presented with great skill and subtlety. Indeed, the clash between the traditionalist and traditionally powerful isolationist Japan and the emerging powerful nation from overseas is very well summarized in one exchange between John Wayne and the local Japanese baron. Wayne complains that the shipwrecks are sailing after beheading in Japan, and the passing ships can not even enter the port for water. Baron replies that Japan wants to be alone. Wayne's character responds that Japan is at an increasingly important intersection of international shipping and that if things persist, before the nation is recognized as nothing more than a band of bandits attacking an important road. A very real summary of how both countries considered themselves to be right and perceived others as bad. The resulting collision of two hypocritical peoples with conflicting interests is reflected throughout history, a continuous theme that echoes in the present and future. <br /> <br /> The cinematography and image of Japan from the mid-nineteenth century, before the accelerated growth towards industrialization, which was to take place at a later age, is perfect. A visual feast and informative insight into the ancient civilization of Japan. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it to anyone, whether it's John Wayne's fan or not, to watch this movie if you have a chance. Just remember that this is not an action movie. It is a representation of an interesting place and time in history and a slow love story, which (to their surprise) dominated the personal life of the two main heroes. Watch this video based on its advantages, without prejudice, allow yourself to immerse yourself in its history and you will be very happy about it. <br /> <br /> In total, an excellent movie.
