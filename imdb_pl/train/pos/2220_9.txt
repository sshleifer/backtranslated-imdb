We tend to forget that the context of the master / slave of the last centuries leads to something more than well-groomed possessions, driven by large groups of enslaved people and a lot of money for white owners. This leads to a group of people caught inside - offspring resulting from slave owners interfere with their slaves. <br /> <br /> Some of these children just became slaves, while others were free ... but free and colorful, which at the time meant everything, but in relation to the number of their stallions. <br /> <br /> A class was formed around these descendants - gens de couleur libre or free people of color - and this class was able to, to a certain extent, own property, rise from the oppressed to the educated and achieve relative dignity. That means they were not slaves, but they were still used to some extent. <br /> <br /> Often women lived as lovers for white plantation masters and rich people, founded in their own homes, with accessories, a school paid for children and a kind of kindness, depending on the respect they chose for their families. In essence, they prostituted themselves to ensure their prosperity and relative independence from work - a system called pla√ßage. <br /> <br /> The Feast of All Saints is a beautifully written story about the children of one of these women, the result of such an agreement with a local gentleman and people who moved their lives, both in a negative and positive way. The story was a New Zealander to me, something that opened my eyes, without a real concept of black and white lines, let alone a gray area in the middle, in which gens de couleur libre tread carefully. <br /> <br /> The characters are very three-dimensional and have been well made in the adaptation of Anne Rice's novel. The parties are well-mannered, the costumes are great, and the brutal way of drawing lines, with smeared areas, even more pronounced conflicts through which the heroes pass. Gens de couleur libre could not marry whites, slaves could not resist, and whites, even compassionate ones, could not face the economic reality of doing so by the people they rely on. <br /> <br /> I recommend this story to everyone, both novels and miniseries, without reservations. If you can not cope with the truth, you will be circling and cowering through some parts, because one injustice for the other is meted out to the unjust, both by white tormentors and by their own people. Remember, however, that this is nothing more than reality, and this story is an absorbing way to get to know it. <br /> <br /> I know it may sound heartless, but this miniseries both entertained me and charmed me, the sour taste that I found in my mouth, what was happening, and I liked it a lot. Watch it. If you do not read this period, because it is a lesson that you can learn from all this.
