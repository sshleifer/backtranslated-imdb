An American In Paris is an integrated musical, which means that songs and dances blend in perfectly with history. The film was inspired by the 1928 orchestral composition of George Gershwin. <br /> <br /> The story of the film intertwines with impressive dance numbers in Gene Kelly's choreography and popular Gershwin melodies. The songs and music are "I Got Rhythm", "S Wonderful" and "Our Love is Here to Stay". He set a new standard for the subspecies known as the musical "songbook" with dozens of Gershwin's songs buried underlining. The highlight is the ballet "The American in Paris", an 18-minute dance featuring Kelly and Caron set in Gershwin's An American in Paris, with an impressionist dream of different painters, is one of the longest uninterrupted Hollywood dance sequences. The ballet itself cost over half a million dollars, which was a staggering sum at that time. <br /> <br /> It is funny to think about such a work of art born in a billiard game between film producer Arthur Freed (SINGIN "IN RAIN, OZ WIZARD, ON THE CITY, MEET ON LOUIS AND WAGON TEAM) AND IRA GERSHWIN . It was Freed's idea to buy the title so he could use, if in the film about Paris and Gershwin's idea, he would use only Gershwin's music. <br /> <br /> The original cast was to have Charisse's Cyd, but she found she was pregnant before the shooting started. The main reason why Gene Kelly suggested Leslie Caron as the lead woman was that he felt this movie needed a "real" French girl playing Lise, and not just an American actress playing her. Gene Kelly discovered Leslie Caron during a vacation in Paris, where he saw her appearing in ballet. When she called for questioning, she said, "Who is Gene Kelly?" According to Leslie Caron, her initial dance sequence, which included a seductive dance with a chair, was considered by some censors to be too suggestive. Gene Kelly directed short fantasy dance sequences shown as Lise. <br /> <br /> Vincente Minnelli first wanted Maurice Chevalier in the part of Georges GuÃ©tary, and "Celeste Holm" in the part "Nina Foch". > <br /> Minnelli was a breakthrough musical director with Meet Me in St. Louis (1944), An American in Paris and The Band Wagon (1953). He used colors and songs in a way that he had not used before. He used time and space with imagination. Most importantly, he allowed himself to break long ballet sequences ending all his films. The ballet in "The American in Paris" can be his best job. <br /> <br /> Although Vincente Minnelli is considered the only director, he was sometimes involved in a divorce with Judy Garland and other directorial projects, leaving Gene Kelly to take over directing responsibilities. <br /> <br /> Other attractions are Guetary's interpretation of "Stairway to Paradise"; Oscar Levanta's fantasy about conducting and performing Gershwin's "Concert F" (see why it was Oscar Levant's favorite). <br /> <br /> The ballet sequence, now that we know it was successful, everyone now wants to take this recognition, Freed, Minnelli, Kelly ?? but before the film was finished, the New York MGM office said not to spend half a million dollars on ballet. So Freed himself went to the studio of Louis B. Mayer to agree, New York said no. Finally, Gene Kelly showed the New York office how the British movie THE RED SHOES used a long ballet sequence, and this film has become a hit all over the world? and is still considered the best example of a successful artistic film. Well, the financiers finally gave up and signed the checks. <br /> <br /> After November 1, 1950. There was a break in production, when Gene Kelly began rehearsing ballet choreography. Until the release of production for this last sequence, on December 6, Vincente Minnelli finished directing another film - Father's Little Dividend (1951). <br /> <br /> Irene Sharaff designed a style for each set of ballet sequences, reflecting the various French Impressionist painters: "Raoul Dufy" (Place de la Concorde), Edouard Manet (flower market), Maurice Utrillo (Paris street), Henri Rousseau (trade fair), "Vincent Van Gogh" (Place de l "Opera" and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (Moulin Rouge). The construction lasted six weeks and 30 painters worked without interruption. <br /> <br /> Roger Ebert he said after seeing the recent renovation: "The American in Paris has many features, including the famous ballet production number, with Kelly and Leslie Caron symbolizing the whole story of their courtship dance." An American In Paris is often compared to SINGIN 'IN THE RAIN, which is the biggest musical ever made, and one of the critics put it best when he said: "SINGIN" IN THE RAIN makes me happy, and An American In Paris makes me feel good. "Ballet re presents Kelly's fantasies presented by great French artists (Renoir, Rousseau, Lautrec, Dufy) whom he admires. Organizing the screening for the then sick Raoul Dufy, the actor and the producer escaped to the final credits. There, with relief, they found the artist, moved to tears, asking for a second portion of the lavish finale. <br /> <br /> The film was also the first to win the Golden Globe Award for the Best Film (Comedy or Musical.) Gene Kelly was awarded the Academy's honorary award in the same year for the "versatility of the actor, singer, director and dancer, and especially for great achievements in the art of choreography for the film. " It was his only Oscar.
