The Journey of Hope (1990) tells the story of the wandering of many nomadic and poor Turks so that they can live in Switzerland. These people are so desperate to live like Westerners to abandon their lives and live trying to reach the promised land. So many of them are deceived by greedy cheats who persist from charging high for desperate people who have no chance of winning. One family fights with cold, a treacherous mountain range and predatory criminals just to discover that white light does not always shine at the end of the tunnel. This problem exists all over the world, not just in America. Some people forget about it. Breaker of the heart of the movie, which at the end of you is wondering. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it.
