Now I love American Pie 1 and 2, while 3 was great for Sean William Scott's performance as Stifler, but then the quality dropped. The Band Camp kept a fairly high standard with the characters you cared about, but Naked Mile was the same joke and story from recycling (Erik Stifler's sex problem is like Jim's). He had some fun moments, such as a football match with dwarves and Coozeman's "punishment", but generally lacked originality, and "Mila" was simply stupid and moronic. Not to mention an annoying girl who does not want to have sex. <br /> <br /> Anyways, about Naked Miles. I watched Beta House anxiously because I thought it might lead the series to a new level, but I was pleasantly surprised. Honestly, there is no real story, but it is full of hot girls (Ashley is amazing) and sexual jokes. Yes, it's formal and the jokes are old, but Dwight Stifler (Steve Talley) raises the bar with an amazing performance. The Greek Olympics is fun, especially the penultimate and final events, while the Christopher McDonald cameo is fun. However, there are weaknesses. Coozeman is just as annoying as in the first, I'm still amazed at how he ever got the part. <br /> <br /> While Coozeman is angry, Erik Stifler is worse. John White made Naked Mile feel pain, but at Beta House he took his performance to a whole new level. First of all, he lacks the charisma, Stifler's condition. You really do not care about him. The only reason I was worried about his relationship was that Ashley could have been on the screen! It shines above him, like the rest of the cast. Seriously John White is the best in bad acting and has more or less as much charisma as a dead fish. <br /> <br /> To say that the movie is funny and Coozeman's fear that his girlfriend is not exactly a girl is genially funny. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is worth borrowing, take a few of your friends and make yourself laugh at a vomit party and take your anger out of Erik's "loser".
