You know, when you look at Brian DePalma's movie today, I'm sure it's time to criticize what it's like. Also about violence. When I looked at this VHS movie when I was 20, I thought it was also violent and harsh. But I did not get this. <br /> <br /> A few decades have passed, and man, as I know, I did not get in this film !! This is a remake of a great film that was made in the 30's / 40's. How can you improve the classic? No. But you are telling a story that is updated by the eyes of the "new immigrants" during the most greedy decade, more than 80 lenient. DePalma, Stone and gang present an ambitious, disturbing and damn good movie. <br /> <br /> Yes ... Disco was dying, and New Wave / Punk took control of these Cuban immigrants who had to make a new home in Florida was not able to distinguish. It was exciting, it was what they wanted, but how to do it? There was only one way for these immigrants to get him in Florida, where they were ... having a lot of money and getting money, you had to take over the leadership of the drug empire. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino was fantastic to me as Tony Montana, "a small train that he could". What an amazing way to look at America as the main character: fight, kill, steal. lie, cheat on everything to get - "money, women and power." <br /> <br /> That's what Tony saw in the American dream. <br /> <br /> He wanted this, he wanted to live in him and in his circle he saw nothing wrong in how he went for him. The use of the English language by Tony Montana was heavily saturated with the word "f", but what did you expect, ending the Emily Post school for him and his companions? Look how they came to America, what they knew, what they were exposed to. In this way, Tony and his crew decided to "be everything they can be in America." It was about power. Tony Montana would have done and did everything to achieve it ... all his brutal, lying, theft, hurting, thieving glory. <br /> <br /> Part of the movie that personified me in the '80s is money laundering. Tony's crew brings drug sacks to the bank. Did they care about Tony and his crew? In the clubs where he spent and drank? No. Money was money, and you get power for money. Tony lived far away from a pig. He and his pretty blond American trophy, which he married, Michelle Pfieffer played well. <br /> <br /> After Tony Montana comes to power, he learns that he is really ugly there. He's full of doubt, he's addicted to drugs, he's paranoid, surrounded by those who want to take him on a bloody takeover, his drug addicted American 80's wife he discovers is boring, he has to stay on top of his empire, because ... goes down. And down goes into a terrifying brutal fashion, but again I'm asking, what do you expect? <br /> <br /> Here's the quintessence of a movie from the 80's that tells you a distorted story about how some people misunderstood the American Dream ... obsession. It's violent, bloody, too much ... but it disturbs the house. Not all Cubans expelled from Cuba who landed in Florida in the 1980s were like Tony Montana. Give me a break. But showing how unfortunate the 1980s were, with an emphasis on greed and money as the only means in the United States to "be somebody" and have power, adopted his tool on these poor heroes and their lives in America. <br /> <br /> It makes you wonder - have you learned anything since then?
