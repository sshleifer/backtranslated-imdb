Being on the plane, browsing through a large selection of movies, I came across Live! almost accidentally. for a boy! what a choice. <br /> <br /> I remembered that I saw the trailer a little over a year ago and I completely forgot about it, expecting only another bad nonsensical movie about a stupid reality show. Now I can easily say that it was a great ride. I do not remember when I was so excited lately, terrified. I'm not sure if it was playing at high altitude with my senses, but the tension gradually increases throughout the movie, until it reaches a climax in which you can not turn away from the screen, literally sitting on the edge of the seat and biting the other nails. you have. <br /> <br /> First you will pass a personal moral assessment of where you stand for the rightness of the performance. You will be drifting from thinking "how can it be that a human being can be so fierce" on "why not after everything?" Ask yourself if you will do it. Then find out about the players, their motives and start guessing. You will see how the player pulls the trigger one by one and is excited, even if you know that the first candidate is safe. <br /> <br /> Good game, good direction, movie experience that reminds you of old movies in which I knew what will happen in the next scene, but I still wanted more. <br /> <br /> * Spoilers * a few things that I would change: <br /> <br /> - casting players. I was really touched by the farmer and we should have some more to him. The idea of ​​a rich writer who wants to be famous is a bit stupid, it seemed that you do not care about some players. Although it may have been deliberately done, I think that the public should have been able to associate with most participants. - rules of the game, big fault: <br /> <br /> what happens if the fifth player does not die when he pulls the trigger. do you really think that the last standing guy will pull the trigger and kill himself !!! they should give all competitors the chance to live, for example: if the 5th is also empty, then nobody dies. <br /> <br /> interestingly, I did not care too much about these bad points, because I really enjoyed myself. I just want to have popcorn with me!
