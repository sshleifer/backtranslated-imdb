My only minor dispute with the film in which I grew up, knowing as STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN, is the fact that wonderful RAYMOND MASSEY has been demoted for the last twenty minutes on the trial stage. The attempt itself, IMO, is the least interesting part of this fascinating fantasy. <br /> <br /> David NIVEN and KIM HUNTER are wonderfully manned as young lovers, but ROGER LIVESEY gives you the most lively and credible achievements. The French accented MARIUS GORING is a delight (he even got his attention on Technicolor) as a celestial messenger sent to retrieve Niven when his wartime death would not be reported due to an oversight. Goring has some of the strangest lines and provides them with flavor. <br /> <br /> Seeing tonight at TCM for the first time in twenty years, I think it is a perfect example of how wonderful 1946 films were. Technicolor photography, slightly subdued and non-flashy, is perfect, and the way it moves towards B & W for celestial sequences is performed with great imagination and efficiency. <br /> <br /> The opening scene is really a spectator drawing on the fantastic aspects of history - and Niven's tense conversation with radio operator Hunter, while his plane crashes into the ground, unexpectedly leads to an unforgettable romantic encounter. A really great movie from start to finish, another triumph of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger.
