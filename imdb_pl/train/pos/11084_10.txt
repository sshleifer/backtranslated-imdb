<br /> <br /> I saw The Glacier Fox in the theater when I was nine - I listened to my parents to take me three times. I started looking for it on video about five years ago, finally discovering a copy on the online auction site, but I'd be happy to see that it was picked up by a new distributor and re-released (I understand that the original video was small), or have the rights purchased by The Family Channel, Disney etc. and shown regularly. It is a fascinating film that draws you into a story about the family struggle of foxes in northern Japan, told by a wise old tree. An excellent soundtrack goes well with the movie. It would be a good seller today, better than many poor offers for children's films today.
