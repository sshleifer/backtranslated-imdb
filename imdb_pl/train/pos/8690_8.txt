Alain Resnais' films are amazing in the sense that they are not really edited for the sake of continuity, but instead the photo seems to end right where the memory was edited. Love for death is sometimes a silent existential drama and a creative film with a realistic magic character, and anyway, it treats the audience of a completely new aspect of the Eros / Thanatos relationship ... or maybe it creates a new relationship, Agape / Thanatos. <br /> <br /> The beginning is like a bizarre surreal horror. The woman runs desperately around the house, and the man dies in his bed - did she kill him or what happened? Soon, this tension is resolved when the doctor comes and announces him dead, but from there begins a new, stranger drama: man wakes up and after death, a woman and a man fall in love with truly tragic consequences. In the meantime, their friends, who are both priests, guard and submit their debate to the nature of love, faith and devotion. <br /> <br /> It seems that Resnais always has a device that makes such narratives work. and what is so amazing in his films is that these devices always work. In this case, Resnais interweaves scenes with photos of snow falling on the exciting orchestral score, which fades and bleeds to subsequent shots that continue the story. Trapped periodically in this elegiac film, the film develops a rhythm not very similar to the epic poem, and I got a strange flashback to Dante's Divine Comedy, despite the lack of direct reference in the film. Resnais is known as a very poetic filmmaker, but extends beyond the cinematographic structure to something that forces the viewer a certain degree of introspection that has the ability to extract strange memories. Memory narration, Resnais creates. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
