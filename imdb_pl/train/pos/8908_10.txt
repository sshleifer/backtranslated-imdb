First of all, I did not see "The Blob" because I was 7 or 8 years old and seeing him as an adult was an amazing experience. Pages can be written about its impact on horror even today. And even more could be written on its social subtext with the "fear of teenagers" from the 50s. But this simple, short story of interplanetary horror is still a damn great awful movie if you let it. <br /> <br /> Sure, it looks as trashy as in our modern world. But "The Blob" packs in really terrifying moments, when a group of children follow an unstoppable creature when adults do not believe. In fact, there are even quite gloomy moments in the candy world. And Steve McQueen gives a lot more than a history deserved on paper that viewers really caught in the moment and believe in it. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, if you take off the postmodern irony filter, there is much more love here than at first glance.
