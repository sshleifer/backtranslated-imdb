This movie has one of the biggest comedy dialogues and unforgettable quotes collected in one movie! There is no plot, but enchanting chips are enough to make up for the difference. This is a timeless film for all ages, which you will definitely like. As a film form of art, it is very funny; and with major stars such as Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas ... how could you be wrong? <br /> <br /> Comedy dialogues and times like this have long been underestimated and very difficult to imitate. A good example of this is the fake movie from 1986: The Money Pit with Tom Hanks and Shelley Long. Despite the talent and physical comedy of these stars, the film stretched and received poor reviews and comments from viewers. Achieving a real comedy dialogue is art.
