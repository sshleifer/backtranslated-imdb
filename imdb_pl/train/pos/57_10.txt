I must say that this is one of the best films I have ever seen! I was bored and reviewed the t.v. file and I found "Home Room" and it was already in about 5 minutes, but I was pulled in. It was so interesting and moving. It shows what can happen in the lives of anyone. I give 10, more if it's possible. The director / screenwriter and actors have done an amazing job. I think teenagers should watch this movie and learn from it. It was great, drama, mystery and much more. I cried for hours! I think the director / writer should write more films like this one. I love it! I did not even know about this movie, which is sad because it was so good. It is a pity that he can not go to the cinema to see more people.
