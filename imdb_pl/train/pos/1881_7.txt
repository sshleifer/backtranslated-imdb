As a drunk playboy Millionaire Arthur Bach, Dudley Moore is ideal as an adult man trapped in childhood. As it turned out, the role matched Moore so perfectly that he also imprisoned him as an actor. Soon there were many disappointments (including the pale sequel to this movie), but it does not detract from the charm or charm of this image, which is cleverly written and directed. Some of Moore's drunken scenes are forced, fragments of the film are shaky, but the cast is so pleasing that it's hard to resist the movie. He has a very big heart and gives to the person who won the Oscar, John Gielguda the sly, dry, funny role of the butler Artur and Hobson; his relationship with Artur is delicious and they have a wonderful relationship. Liza Minnelli (as blue-love-interest) is disgusting, and Moore is bold, but clever and alive; he never shook off Arthur's shadow, but at least we have this document from a high-level career to cultivate him. *** with ****
