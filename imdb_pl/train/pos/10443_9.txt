Beautifully directed by Richard Linklater, a mixture of a youthful romance and a Parisian traveler is one of the romantic films of a thinking man from the 90s. Julie Delpy appears in one of the most engaging performances of the decade as a Paris lass who spends the day with Ethan Hawke on a strange train. Dialogue (and there are a lot of things in it) is sometimes meandering and too valuable, but this portrait of two young lovers creating a romantic, intellectual and spiritual connection with each other is full of wonderfully funny, moving and insightful moments.
