Before I watched this TV movie, I did not know much about one of my favorite actresses. After seeing this, I realized how sad the life of Lucille Ball was. It was also a great time, but I did not realize how sad it was. This movie was very good and told the story of beloved ball Lucille very well. I highly recommend him.
