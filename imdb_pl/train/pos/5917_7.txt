Streetfight (aka Coonskin) is a unique film directed by animation pioneer Ralph Bakshi. It's a cinematic spectacle and it's worth seeing. It is a live action mixed with animation that seems to have an impact on the legendary Disney song about the South, almost as if it was the answer to this move. Philip Michael Thomas, later assistant to Don Johnson at Miami Vice, and Scatman Crothers, the most known for his role in the Shining Kubrick, are fugitives from prison. Charles Gordone and Barry White (yes, this Barry White) are friends of Thomas and plan to help him escape from prison. They get stuck in a police blockade, and Crothers tells Thomas the story of a black rabbit, a bear and a fox who move from the south to Harlem to find a calmer existence. The story is animated and contains many wonderful things to see. Like all Bakshi movies, most will be annoyed and will not enjoy the animation. True animation lovers will forgive its fragility and fall in love with their ingenuity. The film is very violent, very sexual and mainly concerns battles between races. For a long time I thought that I was watching something extremely important, but after a while, especially after I looked at it, it began to seem that it is an ordinary blacksploitation flick, similar to Superfly. He is very messy and does not really say anything. Besides, is not Bakshi white? Regardless of the answer to this question, Coonskin / Streetfight is still worth watching for both animation lovers and cult cinema fans. 7/10.
