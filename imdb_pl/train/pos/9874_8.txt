In this film from 1943, Judy Garland is not ready yet for the great performance of a man who loves her - Van Heflin. This film was certainly a big change for Mr. Heflin, especially after supporting Oscar a year earlier in "Johnny Eager." <br /> <br /> Was not Spring Byington too old to be a widowed mother of 5 children, because four of them look like her grandchildren? <br /> <br /> Singing and dancing are simply wonderfully staged, but the way in which the flourishing romance between Heflin and Garland was presented, left much to be desired. It was similar to Gigi, in which the young girl finally gets scavenged by the sorcerer.
