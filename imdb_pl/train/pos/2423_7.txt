Once in Life, it means that once a hooligan, always a hooligan, and nobody comes in or out of "Life" for free. Hooligans from the neighborhood in New York sell drugs and cheat because they can not do it in a legal world, maybe because they have a criminal past or a drug habit, or because they are simply lazy. This simple story with a few twists and turns about most of the wicked heroes will be able to snatch sympathy for the audience for its main players because of their loyalty and compassion for each other. The film is written, produced and directed by Laurence Fishburne, who also plays the role of 20/20 Mike (all hooligans have nicknames) and relies on his play "Riff Raff". From the beginning to the end it seems to be a game, especially during the longest stage, in which the three main players decide who they can trust. Often the dialog box is very fast, much faster than on the stage and I think it's the biggest flaw in the movie. Mixed in flashbacks throughout the film are poems from the street, a type of para-metamethic rap, which is violent and suggestive of the world that reveals the film. Poetry makes it difficult to reject these people, those hooligans who murder, cheat and betray each other as unworthy of our attention or below our contempt. The worrying thing about this movie is that its realism shows us not only how these people live, but also how they suffer for the same reasons as all of us. One is too stupid, the other a junkie, and the latter suffers from conscience, while the audience wonders, and even laughs at the irony of the executioners requesting him to hang on the gallows to tell jokes in the middle of his death.
