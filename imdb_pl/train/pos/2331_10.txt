At first, I was surprised that the main character of the TV series could bring the dead back to life, but then I thought I would give him a chance. Guess what? I love "Pushing Daisies" and wait for Wednesday evenings just to watch them, and then for the next week I watch them several times on my recorder. Colorful characters, witty banter, quick dialogue and new unique situations attract me and captivate me from the beginning to the end. The relationship of Ned and Chuck Charles is interesting because they work on their romance around the fact that they can not have physical contact. Even the character of the detective Emerson Coda is constantly growing. And Olive Snook! Jiminy Crispies! She smashes me! The voice of the narrator is pleasant to listen to, and the photos give the impression that I am watching a movie instead of a television program. I instructed my family and friends to include "Pushing Daisies" and they are also hooked !!! The series is worth waiting a week for a new episode, and if you have not seen "P.D.", I highly recommend watching it!
