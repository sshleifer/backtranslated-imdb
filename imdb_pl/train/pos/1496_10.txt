I was glad that I was able to catch this movie on a very late late TV and that I was interested in the whole picture all the time. This wonderful, frightening, yet mysterious English home with sinister-looking decorations and decorated furniture and rooms that make you wonder why someone would like to rent this house or even own it. There are four (4) stories about this house, and every resident of the house encounters various problems. You will notice a beautiful lake and pond around the house, as well as the sweet singing of birds, but do not be fooled, there is horror everywhere. Peter Cushing, "Black Jack", "80" gives a great performance as one of the people living at home, and even Christopher Lee, "Curse of the Crimson Altar", 68 and his daughter Chloe Franks (Jane Reid) create a wonderful exciting story, his daughter loves to read DAWN BOOKS for some reason! If you like scary, scary and mysterious movies, with lots of surprises, this is THE VIDEO FOR YOU !!!!
