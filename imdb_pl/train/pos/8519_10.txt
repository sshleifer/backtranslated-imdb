Amazing .... Maybe it was a bad attempt to rewrite the already played Omen movie, but I certainly liked it. <br /> <br /> The last man who commented was a fool, this movie was one of a kind, and The Dark Music, Jerry Goldsmith himself, would praise the film. <br /> <br /> Great recommendations from me to watch or buy this movie. <br /> <br /> I collect horror movies and soundtracks, so listen to what I have to say, not this other idiot. <br /> <br /> There is only one thing that does not fascinate me, the ending. <br /> <br /> According to Prophecy, everything is inaccurate, including the ultimate conflict, and left behind. <br /> <br /> But my conclusion is ... There are great movies ... and should be visible before the Great Depression falls on us and the Democrats. Take over the presidency. <br /> <br /> So signed ... Jacob Eder ... Farmer, with the master.
