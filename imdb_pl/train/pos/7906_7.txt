Gus Van Sant made great films. I really am a fan. <br /> <br /> However, I can not resist the impression that Tom Robbins's book "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues" dies in the translation into a big screen. Sam, Tom Robbins and Gus Van Sant are amazing visionaries and towers of talent. Ultimately, however, this does not work. <br /> <br /> It was not that the characters were not well developed or the plot and content did not come to life. Simply, our imagination has much more power when reading such a book. We take us to a different time and place and sometimes we think the worst and / or the best, and this adds to the general roller-coaster book, because it neatly develops according to the author's precision. Films, however, can leave one of the less imaginative and roller-coaster emotions worsening the overall experience. What I believe has happened here. <br /> <br /> I suggest you read the book!
