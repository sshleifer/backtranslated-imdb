Usually, I do not like reality shows, especially those that profit from the success of American Idol. But the one I can live with. <br /> <br /> Comedians from all over the world do a short routine of celebrity talent scouts, and if they like it, these guys will be sent to perform the routine for the real audience. Then, ten or twelve comics are selected to live together at home and conduct "Survivor" contests using comedic tactics. It will then be referred to as "Last Comic Standing". I like to perform in comedies, so this is the only reality show that must interest my interests. Usually comics are usually chosen. It began with a career of talent such as Alonzo Bodden, Ralphie May and Josh Blue. <br /> <br /> My negative criticism is the fact that many of these comics have been chosen because of their contribution to reality show drama. At first they lived together in a house like "Big Brother", but now, thank God, they have liquidated it. <br /> <br /> And there were many comedians I felt, they were chosen not because they are fun, but because of race, ethnicity, attitude, sex, etc., when other comics clearly should overcome them. But in general, it is a well-realized reality show, which so far consists of two terms.
