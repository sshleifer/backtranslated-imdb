Resident Evil: veronica code is a great, well-made video game, has great graphics, very comfortable control, great storyline and a high fun factor. The plot of this is Claire Redfield is taken to the island for entering the Umbrella area and reaking havoc in their main laboratory while searching for her brother. The graphics of veronica are very good, the effects of fire and rain look great. The controls are comfortable, but the pattern of the button does not match the Dreamcast control, making it difficult to use it. It's nice to walk around some strange, disturbing place, shooting the guts out of the zombies. The code: veronica also has some "romance" between the two main heroes. You can also play as Chris Redfield from Resident Evil 1. The sound in this game is better than ever, for example, although I hate a new function when giant spiders crawl, feet that cause disturbing, terrifying sound, and guns sound much more realistic. Great graphics, great history, comfortable controls and the reality of Stic Sound makes Resident Evil Code: Veronica is definitely loved. I give him 10 out of 10.
