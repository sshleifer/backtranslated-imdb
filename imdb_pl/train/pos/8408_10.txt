"It was not me! It was, my twin brother Rupert! "Bobby talks to Dugan when he faces Sally. I have used this line several dozen times over the years (although no one has to believe it). <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the best in history for pure fun and unbelievable. Steven Oliver was perfect for the role of Dugan, to the extent that he was in "Malibu Beach" in 1978 as the same character (though not so much time on the screen). <br /> <br /> "Nobody calls Dugan dung!" is another line forever. This classic movie was definitely worth the admission price.
