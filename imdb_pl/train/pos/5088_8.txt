I never had the impression when watching a movie that was intended for an idiot box. I always thought it was a very successful movie from the late 90's. But after I saw on the Internet that it was for television, I was shocked because it is absolutely fantastic for a TV movie! I felt that one battle scene should be removed because it was completely unnecessary. It also began to drag at the end because it seemed that the adventure would never end. <br /> <br /> On the plus side is a strong, very interesting and captivating plot with great performances by everyone. I just felt Patrik Frayze looked a little haggard. I also felt that Gogool, who looked mad, was a little stupid in some scenes. <br /> <br /> I was delighted with the beautiful African landscapes. Also the first half of the movie would cause me to give this film 9. Still, it's a great movie for TV. 8 out of 10.
