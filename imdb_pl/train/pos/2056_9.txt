I do not think most people will give the film the same amount of merit it deserves. I love low-budget horror films, and it takes a cake, especially in the case of originality. Yes, Scarecrow is a fight with the terrifying Kung-Fu, but why not? Nobody else wants to go that far. I really did not have such a good time watching the movie from Candyman. So the city chooses this one kid calling him a scarecrow, even his mom does not care for him. Then he is killed, and the ghost is dragged into the Scarecrow, who then rages by killing. His fall is relatively easy to set up after the film starts. Dedication at the end goes straight to the group of horror directors, but with the greatest devotion for Dario Argento really hit me what cool, those people who want to make movies from a new genre. There are a lot of Arnold's rip-offs in the movie, with one liner you will certainly laugh like a stick and kill the sheriff with a stick. I would say, grab a pizza to your friends and laugh with this A $$ for this movie. I love it for its originality, the greatest fun.
