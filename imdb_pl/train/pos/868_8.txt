What is very French in this film is the time needed to determine the two main characters. This may require some patience, especially since none of them is "attractive" in a typical Hollywood definition. However, when the "attack" begins, the movie runs fast forward, perhaps sometimes too fast. But this is a real roller coaster ride and if you do not look too closely, everything is quite reliable. This movie about which you know Hollywood would be botched.
