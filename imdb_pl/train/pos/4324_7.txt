You do not need to read this review. <br /> <br /> An earlier Seattle pninson review has already identified all the major drawbacks of this production. I can only strengthen his basic arguments. <br /> <br /> Bleak House was a relatively late novel by Dickens and is much darker than his earlier work. It's too literally a director, Ross Devenish, who collects piles of darkness and fog too much. When Ada, Rick and Esther appear, a half hour in the opening episode, the relief just be in daylight for the first time. In some darker scenes, it was difficult to see what was actually on the TV screen. I watched the whole thing in one day, starting from the south. When the daylight has disappeared, it has become a minor problem, but I have quite a good TV and I have never encountered this problem at any time of the day. <br /> <br /> Stimulation is very purposeful (ie Free). I'm sure it was intense, but it's exaggerated. There are numerous shots of people dragging through the mud and darkness of Victorian London, which take longer than necessary to establish the mood and atmosphere. A good editor will probably take a few minutes from every fifty-minute episode, without losing the dialogue lines, simply trimming each of these scenes. <br /> <br /> I do not want to overestimate these two problems. Soon you will adapt to the appearance and pace of this production. The more important issue is that it does not always tell the story very effectively. Previously, Dickens' novels are as long as Bleak House, but they are not so elaborately drawn out. For example, I recently read Nicholas Nickleby again, because I was intrigued as Douglas McGrath pressed an 800-page book into his two-hour movie. The answer is simple: the book is full. McGrath cut out wonderful fragments of the novel, preserving all the essential elements of the story. It would not be possible at Bleak House. <br /> <br /> This production needs seven hours. He probably needs more time because many elements of his collapsed plot are not transparent enough or as well served as needed. Several random examples illustrate problems. <br /> <br /> Rosa's maid appears out of nowhere without a background, so Lady Dedlock's attachment to her is largely unmotivated. <br /> <br /> Consent Sergeant George in Tulkinhorn's demand for a sample of Horton's magazine is a bit deceived. <br /> <br /> It is not clear enough that Esther is in love with Woodcourt when she agrees to marry John Jarndyce. It is also not clear whether they agreed not to announce their commitment or why. <br /> <br /> The secret marriage of Ada and Rick has been omitted. In one episode, they are only lovers, in the next people suddenly call their husband and wife. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Rouncewell is introduced only at a late stage in the history and the alienation of Sargeant George of his family remains unexplained - just like the means by which she was discovered. <br /> <br /> Tulkinhorn's dedication to maintaining the honor and respect of the Dedlock family is underestimated, so his motive for persecuting Lady Dedlock is more obscure than he needs. <br /> <br /> Involvement of the bricks makers in Tom and (later) Lady Dedlock is a bit unclear. <br /> <br /> It is not obvious that Guppy renews his offer for Esther, because smallpox scars have disappeared. <br /> <br /> This is just a selection: they are different. These are not serious problems, and the main thread of this story is clear enough. Nevertheless, these are minor irritations that divert attention from its power: you should not have problems with small story points. However, there are more important structural problems that weaken history at later stages. <br /> <br /> The whole matter of Tulkinhorn's murder is somewhat rejected. Bucket immediately indicates Hortense as a suspect, undermining the uncertainty of Sergeant George's position and the importance of finding Mrs. Rouncewell. It also reduces the impact of the sub-story, which suspects Lady Dedlock and weakens the scene in which Hortense is exposed to Sir Lester. <br /> <br /> A more serious problem is that the murder, his investigation and subsequent searches of Lady Dedlock dominated the story for over an hour, during which time we completely lose sight of the second main plot: the legal case and its impact on Rick. His unsuccessful finances, Vholes and Skimpole gouging, Ada's despair, his deteriorating health, etc. Are paused for the entire episode. Maybe this is what Dickens wrote (I have not read it for years), but a good script should make different plotlines move forward together. <br /> <br /> Finally, the role of Smallweed in this story is so reduced that it is almost unnecessary. His discovery of the new will, which triggers the last phase of history, is also rejected. It happens off screen. <br /> <br /> After all, it is still very good production. Many performances are outstanding. The individual scenes are beautifully realized. His accumulated sense of tragedy is very powerful. I would still recommend it as a great adaptation of a great book, were it not for the 2005 production. In fact, I probably would not be fully aware of his flaws if I did not see how Andrew Davies did it. I was critical of the adaptation of Davies Jane Austen, but I must admit that he really knows how to tame Dickens' extensive books. <br /> <br /> This is an impressive and thrilling drama worth seven hours each time. Nevertheless, its probable fate should be seen mainly as a reference to the almost final version of 2005.
