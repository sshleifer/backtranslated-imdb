I bought a "All Saints Day" and it's not really a scary movie, but many things could have been better. It had a great historical value, played by a very talented actress / actors, and this is not a daily phenomenon in which actors can play such a role and be somewhat credible. There were a few parts that were a bit mediocre and confusing, but I would not say the whole movie was awful. When you think about it, you'll catch New Orleans from 1800 and do something, it's hard to get actors who can strongly mean these parts. But the only big problem I had with this movie was that most of the actors who played free color people were mostly fair-skinned Africans, not very versatile in throwing others who were not bright; one of the old Creole stereotypes that still exist. Whoever made the casting could choose a wider variety when it comes to shade, although many creoles are color-conscious. Instead, they chose actors who, in a sense, were close to white, could be more thought-out. The actors did a great job, I could write the script better, and generally I think that the performances were very reliable.
