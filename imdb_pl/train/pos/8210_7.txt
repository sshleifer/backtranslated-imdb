Clint Eastwood again takes on the role of Dirty Harry, who this time is in the case of the guard (Sondra Locke), who kills people who raped her and her sister in the carnival many years ago. Eastwood makes his role, and the film is mainly more action, then speaking, not complaining. A sudden impact is a really pleasant pastime.
