A very good war movie showing the effects of a war for a boy from a hometown who loses sight of Guadalcanal and needs to return home and adapt with the help of family and friends. Excellent cast of the actor makes this movie very funny. The role of Eleanor Parker as a girl was worthy of an Oscar nomination. In this movie he has such innocence. The role of Ann Doran was as satisfying as all her small supporting roles. I especially like the family atmosphere of pre-war Phildelphia. The hunting scene is very good. Of course, the war scene at Guadalcanal really showed the terror with which our soldiers struggled during this epic battle. A well deserved film and should not be forgotten
