This movie was perfect. A sad truth about how culture interferes with the sexes. It's just one big, warm, indistinct film type. You have a master who is steeped in tradition and a kind heart in his own way, Doggie, even though she is the girl who wins his feelings, and you fill her with one sweet monkey with a thousand facial expressions. In the end, it means a great happy movie. This film has a good job showing how steeped in tradition it is, so absorbed that it is ready to die without sharing its secrets. You see a side of a culture you've never seen before, which helps to reinforce the drama that takes place at the end of the picture. The cinema film is perfect, in particular the sequence of the opening parade with all sparks. Connected with Oscar for the best foreign film.
