this trailer of the short film tells that Superman and Batman cooperate with each other and create a restless alliance. Of course, two characters have very different views on how to deal with crime and what constitutes a punishment. I will not go to the story here. But I will enter the acting game, which is great. everyone is well manned. The two actors playing Superman and Batman fit well with their characters. they did Batman: Dead End and Grayson also created this short movie. of three, I probably liked it at least, but I still thought it was well done. For me, the best in the world is 7/10
