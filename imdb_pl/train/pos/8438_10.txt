HLOTS is a unique series that will never be NYPD Blue, HLOTS is true, the dialogue is real, the relationships are real. With HLOTS back as a movie, tying all the loose ends, it was good to have all the gangs together, even a few who left, appeared (they will not say how). the series was weekly in a week. Murder, Life on the streets, network drama at its best !!!! 5 STARS !!!! Thumbs up and that's all. Thanks to NBC for giving us Finally we did not get it!
