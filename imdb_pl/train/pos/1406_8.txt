You remember "Invisible Man" by H.G. Wells? Here is another such movie, only more extreme. "Hollow Man" is like no story of invisibility as a weapon of choice. Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Caine, a scientific genius who enters the world of invisibility and makes him useful for military purposes. Initially, the serum was an easy part, thanks to which the person did not come back. Most of the first trials ended unstable. Until one night, when he refined the formula. Who else, but Caine would be a lab rat. Gorilla was the first and almost died, so when he came to him, he was close. So when he did Caine, he decided to use it for fun. Then, when he was tired of not being seen, the team tried to bring him back to the world of the body. However, the visibility formula does not work as it should, and Caine would go into madness. So he ends up as one crazy invisible killer. It would be best to just leave the city instead of taking your life from your loved ones. I would not care about those who made a mistake. A great movie, lots of fun. 3 out of 5 stars!
