I remember that I did not have much respect for such an enterprise when it was first released. James "Not Jim" Belushi, hamster actress and cheesy title in the formula of John Hughes. You could not pay me to see it 15 years ago. But I was caught watching this when I was wasting my Sunday afternoon, and it struck me on several levels. Fairy tale (part of Pretty Woman, reverse part of Pretty Woman), very sensitive, Elizabeth_Perkins_in_Miracle_On_42nd_Street similar to Kelly Lynch, escapism. Above all, it gently involves very nice chains. It's hard not to fall into this story, fall in love with Kelly Lynch, identify with James Belushi, dislike stiff, bad boyfriend and laugh at the Curley line of Sue. It has all the ups and downs, a happy ending and the type of message you want to hear. Go ahead, waste time on this movie, it's worth it.
