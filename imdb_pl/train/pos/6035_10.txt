I'm definitely not in the target group of this movie. I am a man almost 50 years old who recently came across the world of an independent film. It happened quite by accident when a movie called Clerks was discovered late on TV. The first two things that I noticed in this film are: 1) technically amateur and 2) perfectly written. When I read the interview with the director in a local newspaper and said that one of his influences is Clerks, I became interested. When he said that his main influence was The Station Agent, a movie I saw on DVD a week earlier, I decided to go and check it out. The result can be described in the same way as for officials, although both videos are nothing like the content. Both films suffer from technical gaffs that can be overcome thanks to the amazing writing. While Clerks is a day in the life of a man who has nothing at all in his life and is afraid to ask difficult questions about himself and his situation, Less Like Me is about a man who is seemingly compelled to be constantly busy, he is always running one way or the other, filling out his life with trinkets, so that he will never have to deal with large ones. The themes and ideas of this film are strong and poignant. I can say that looking at the fact that little has changed since I grew up, young men still have the same problems that they always have. The writer dresses these problems and topics in his native language, performs wonderfully honest characters and makes them completely reliable things. When it comes to indie cinema, it may not be perfect from a technical point of view, but it is very close to artistic cinema.
