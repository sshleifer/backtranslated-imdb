Raising Victor Vargas is a movie you definitely have to see. I felt very cordial and I had a lot of humor that makes you dragged inside. It's so much like real life with what teenagers have to go through. Victor, a conceited teenager, but with a good heart at the end, deals with love in all the right places, dealing with girls and family. In the end Victor comes to know the true meaning of love when he is dealing with an old-fashioned grandmother, and the girl he wants to use also uses it. This is how much the movie has. One heart was when Victor's grandmother throws the winner on something simple. Victor was really the heart and he could not believe that he would do something like that. I was really sorry about it, as if it was real. Generally, I give this B + movie
