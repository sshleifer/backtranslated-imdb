This movie started me by kicking Nick in the cage. It is a story full of twists and turns - a movie of motives and movements. Of course, Dennis Hopper was a ham, but J.T. Walsh and Laura Flyyn Boyle are the perfect couple who will catch the unsuspecting man who fell into their network. Everything in this film is good - cinematography, tempo of the story and, above all, the end. Cage excels at what he does best - he is not supposed to be the hero of the action, but to be a man who fell into the trap of life.
