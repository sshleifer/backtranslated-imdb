This is a PERFECT example of the early talent of Bette Davis. Production is above average for the time frame of 1936. I do not understand why the owners of the rights to this movie did not put it on DVD. Owners, PLEASE PLEASE PROPOSE IT. I would buy it immediately. I have not seen him for over thirty years on television, but I remember it well.
