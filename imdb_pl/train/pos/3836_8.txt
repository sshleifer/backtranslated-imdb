Extremely interesting and intriguing movie. Similarities to David Lynch (which is even quoted literally by the presence of red curtains in the film) and Franz Kafka's novel (the house keeper in this film is called Mrs. Grubach, like the one in Der Prozess ...) are clearly present, but in this case they are accompanied by clear references to the colonial past of Belgium in Africa. The exact content of the film, which I can not clearly describe: this colonialism is an important part, as is the inability to deal with such a past, but personal memories of the main character are also the main problem and his striving for social contact and love. These are symbolic motifs that I deduced from the film, but they are really nothing more than impressions. <br /> <br /> But even if you try to follow a linear story without these symbolic environments, you will still discover an extremely fascinating movie full of great images (beautiful beatles, larvae and other nasty insects intertwine with wonderful sequences of dreams, as well as a dark atmosphere gives additional style for the film). Maybe you'll say that I could not get the film, but I watched it like a hypnotic for 1.5 hours, deeply impressed by the visual quality and fascinating mystery.
