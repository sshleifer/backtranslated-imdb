This show is so incredibly funny that I could not stop watching the marathon on Comedy Central tonight (despite the fact that I've seen all episodes before). I have always considered Silverman an enormous talent and this is finally a tool thanks to which this talent can enjoy a wide audience. I watch this program and I laugh a lot ... I can not say that many TV programs ... can you? This program is in the end something new and interesting and (most importantly) fun! This is a program I will never miss and it is one I will buy on DVD when it appears. You owe it yourself to watch this program ... I foresee a long series for this series ... And to make it clear, people who are offended by this program simply do not understand it ... maybe they lack the intelligence to understand it. ... they should stop making fools out of themselves by attacking something they do not understand. Anyone who uses the word "bigot" in relation to Silverman, or who claims to be only "shocking" ... is far from the mark ... It is exactly the opposite; you'll just see her, and you will quickly see that she is a big advocate of civil rights, etc. If you do not know that ironic covers all these scandalous points of view, you do not understand. And if you do not understand it, do the rest and be quiet so that we can all enjoy the joy ...
