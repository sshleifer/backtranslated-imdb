I saw a policeman named Mystery Men, who was a bit in the press and public (for example, an imdb voice), but my overall feeling is that Mystery Men is more entertaining than most films, definitely more witty than most of the so-called comedy movies and almost " clever. " <br /> <br /> The cast is outstanding; Greg Kinnear is great, like Geoffrey Rush and Tom Waits. Kinnear's limousine scene with Ricky Jay is the perfect "spoiled movie star" and gives his character the right balance between the quality of the comic and the realism to work. <br /> <br /> I admit that the stimulation is a bit out of place, and the visuals are certainly very brilliant, perhaps to the detriment of further make-up, but at the end of the day it is creating high-definition movies - it's about a little time "What's up Tiger Lily?" - and there are so many great in this movie that it's worth repeating.
