Every now and then in the wonderful world of horror, diamonds are made, and one becomes completely stunned by its pure glow. It's no less than a diamond !! It is a movie full of amazingness, chilling anticipation and dark atmosphere in your veins, and I think it's safe to say one of my favorite horrors of all time! And of course it contains probably the most horrifying sequence in the whole story of horror! Every time I see a movie and reaches the point where you know it will inevitably happen, I try to remember exactly when I'm afraid of my reason, but it never happens; I never understand it and feel as scared as the first time I saw it !! Now you have to say, to scare such a famous fanatic horror, it is pure perfection. Unlike the Americans, the British know their subtleties, are proud of the art of acting, do not need any special effect to convey the atmosphere, rely on the power of powerful history and creeping (in this case) suggestion and expectations. Each element is impeccable, from sets, actors, stories, to a dangerous atmosphere. Pauline Moran could certainly make the devil whine, that's for sure !! Finally, if for some insane reason you do not like this madness, you honestly do not know what the horror thing is about, and to be honest, do not deserve to know it. Thank you!
