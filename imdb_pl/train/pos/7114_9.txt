By far the top five of John Garfield's best films must be Pride of the Marines. This is the true story of sea private Al Schmid, at the expense of his own eyesight, while the wounded stopped the horde of Japanese assault on Guadalcanal. <br /> <br /> The story is nicely composed of three parts, the home life of Al Schmid, where he is a simple stiff worker who gets serious with a woman and does not like anything better than his bowling night. Pearl Harbor is bombed and is in a war while millions of others have been. <br /> <br /> The second part is on Guadalcanal and we see a part of the action in which he is in an isolated machine gun slot, stopping Japanese troops. His action made it impossible to cross the sea, but the grenade does it in his eyes. <br /> <br /> And of course the third part is his painful adjustment to civil life and making sure that people do not just care about pity, especially from the girl Eleanor Parker saw. <br /> <br /> This movie was broadcast in TCM on John Garfield's 95th birthday, and his daughter hosted a documentary on Garfield. One of the people interviewed said that Garfield was the most credible actor in the roles of the working class in possession and possession of a union card. <br /> <br /> In this regard, he was lucky to have landed at the Warner Brothers in Hollywood. Although he was still typical of the gangster in the studio's tradition, Garfield was great in these parts because of his origins, because he came from the kind of life that Al Schmid had, except Garfield's Jewish descent. <br /> <br /> In this respect, he was ideal for the role of a working class hero like Al Schmid who took responsibility for defending his country. There is no super heroic here, just a guy who would rather go back to Philadelphia but do the work that needed to be done. <br /> <br /> This is a great part for Garfield. This is a film that should not be missed. I wonder what happened to real Al Schmid.
