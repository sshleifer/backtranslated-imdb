Sure, it was well done and done, very well filmed and made! But the story was so weak. And Lincoln's image was even weaker. Not that Henry Fonda was not good, but the character he played was nothing but a loon. Do you want to tell me that Lincoln was a wise rogue, with no respect for law and court. I mean, who the hell was he supposed to be? Vinnie cousin? I mean, "Then I will call you Jackass" ???? I understand that Ford was a great funny hero, but I did not like this guy at all. He cheats in sport, he speaks like a real sweet simpleton and does not seem to know to sit in the courtroom. How should I take it seriously? <br /> <br /> The turn was even weaker. Come on! It was just stupid. The whole story seemed to be invented for about 5 years in his dreams. Saying that I liked it, it was very funny and it made me laugh on several occasions, so I can not say it's a bad movie. In fact, I have to say that I have to say that it is good enough, nothing that amuses me and laughs, can not be bad, but this lively and stupid story was so absurd that I can not understand how anyone could consider it for great. > <br /> I have no idea how historically accurate this movie was, but if all this was true, I would really have to shake my head.
