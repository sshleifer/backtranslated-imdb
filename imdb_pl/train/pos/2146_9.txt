I just saw this wonderful Japanese feature film at the 5th annual Roger Ebert film festival at the historic Virginia theater in Champaign, Illinois. <br /> <br /> Although this film, written in English, has a ballroom dance, the film shows the world outside Japan how rigid family structures, employment (salaryman) and recreation in today's Japan still exist. <br /> <br /> Scenorzysta / director Suo Masauki [I follow the Japanese custom of presenting the surname (last name) first and last name (last)] uses the not too popular theme of ballroom dancing to show the social structure of Japan. <br /> <br /> [I will not use the names of characters from the movie when readers of the world may not know Japanese formal names that may be misleading. I will refer to the actors <br /> <br /> according to their professional name listed in the online movie database.] <br /> <br /> He recruits the help of his real wife, professional ballet dancer Kusakari Tamiyo in his first and so far the only movie. She is a dance teacher in her father's dance studio. However, her real ambition is to re-compete in the International Dance Competition, from which she was disqualified in the past. No, I will not say "why". See the video. <br /> <br /> Salaryman Yakusyo Koji is the main movie star. He is a veteran of about 25 films since 1979, he gives a great performance of something from the 40s. <br /> <br /> who has a charming wife, teenage daughter and just bought his home, <br /> <br /> longing. <br /> <br /> And yet something is missing in his own inner happiness. See this video to find out how "engaged" in social dancing and secretly goes to <br /> <br /> lessons. Most of the dancing characters are liberated from the traditional Japanese hierarchy of social structure <br /> <br />. They are friendly and warm and inviting. Of course, this contrasts with the philosophy of Japanese society with "a place for everyone and everyone in its place." <br /> <br /> The film has many funny moments. Almost 1,500 theater spectators broke off <br /> <br /> for spontaneous laughter during many comical moments. This proves that comedy does not have a foreign language. <br /> <br /> Veteran actor Takenaka Naoto is funny and witty, just like Watanabe Eriko. They are two funny character actors. <br /> <br /> You can buy and read a textbook on the structure of life in Japan, or you can watch this wonderful movie and start to understand how <br /> <br /> the Japanese grow up in a fairly rigid social structure. Watching the movie "Do we have Dansu?" Is a quick immersion into further studies and watching other Japanese films. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to everyone. It's funny, cute, a little crying, and it'll warm your heart. <br /> <br />
