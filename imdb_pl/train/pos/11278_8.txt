The first of Tarzan's films with Johnny Weissmuller. The story has already been summarized, so I will not be entering it again. I just know that actors who play Jane and Tarzan were born to this role. If you have not seen this movie, and you have only contemporary Tarzan movies as a reference point ... you're missing the True Feast. It does not matter how far we've come to film production, make-up scenography ... no one will ever play Tarzan like Johnny Weissmuller. He was and is Tarzan.
