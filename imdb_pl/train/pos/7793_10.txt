My brother brought this film home from the rental and I remember that I expected it to be so boring. I think the title has particularly discouraged me. I never remember the beginning of a film with such low expectations and being so completely convinced. I watched the movie twice before I let my brother come back to the store. It is very rare that the film appeals to me in this way. I was completely entangled in the situation of Ruby, who tries to get through her life. The bad thing about this movie is that it ends so quickly. I could watch for many hours. Another downside is that I was not happy with everything Ashley Judd had done since then. It's perfect in this movie. This movie is easily in my top ten favorite of all time.
