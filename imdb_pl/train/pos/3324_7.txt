Someone has mastered the difficult task of combining sport with romance. In fact, sport and romance go hand in hand like oil and water. To successfully put these two elements together on the screen ... well, it's about the equivalent of atom division. I never thought it could be done. I will be the first to say that I generally do not like romantic comedies ... but I like sports and most sports movies. This movie was a pretty good combination of these two. Being a baseball fan, I could really appreciate the comedic gehenna in which Ben Wrightman (Jimmy Falon) was a furious Boston Redsox fan. Anyone who knows anything about baseball knows the curse of "Babe" that has been bothering Redsox for 86 years, and they know how ugly baseball is for many Redsox fans. The Farrely brothers did a great job of capturing this and creating a good comedy. It was a very good movie that would appeal to many.
