He picked up the film at the flea market for $ 4, he definitely got my money worth it! Do not worry about hot sticks, but the animation simply scared me away after a constant Simpson diet (I'm sorry, Mr. Groening). The best part, facial expressions. I recommend many reviews with cool melodies, good friends and a few cold ones!
