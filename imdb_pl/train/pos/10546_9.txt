I acted in this movie because I had a free new release of Blockbuster and I had to catch something quickly because the shop was preparing to close for the evening. A plain white cover and the title intrigued me. I am (relatively speaking) an "old" woman, and my son is a young man at the age of 30. I love movies that are pure entertainment, such as the Sixth Sense, Interview with the Vampire, Harry Potter and Beetle Juice. My son is a film graduate and likes very specialized foreign films, such as directed by Bergman or Hertzog. Usually we hate our film choices, but we both watched and LOVED the film Nothing! It did not look like any movie we've ever seen. We are both cynical / critical personality types and usually watch movies while watching them - but in this case, we just laughed and enjoyed the movie from beginning to end. We believe that if this film were promoted and screened in major streaming theaters in the United States, it would be very good.
