The idea is a very short movie with lots of information. Interesting, fun and leaves the viewer more. The producer has produced a short film of excellent quality, which can not be compared to any other short film I have seen. I rated this movie for the highest possible rating. I also recommend that it be shown to office managers and business people in every plant. This is due to the fact that people with ideas are never listened, their voice is never heard. This is a lesson that any office that wants to move forward can learn. I hope that the produced part will bring the second part of this "idea". Waiting for sequence browsing. Once again, we congratulate the Halaqah media for the production of a film of excellence and quality for the lesson.
