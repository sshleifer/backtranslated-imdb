Ultra-bleak drama drama by Pou-Soi Cheang, director of "Home Sweet Home". Tonally it reminded me of Billy Tan's "Run and Kill", though it's not so polished. Nevertheless, it is an engaging, vicious fragment of chaos about a Cambodian loner, Pangu (Edison Chen), who comes to Hong Kong to kill a lawyer. Escaping from the scene, he kills the partner of the policeman Sam Wai, who, to add insults to injuries, is dealing with his dying father, so Sam begins a crazy, obsessive raid for Pang, which results in a dozen dead bodies and constant violence. There must be something in the air lately, because I've never seen so many people hammering the pulp like last time. It's grim, nasty things, that's why I got used to it so much and I applaud its inept atmosphere. It is visually amazing, and the design of the sound is very special. Amazingly, everything flows down until every figure finds itself in a world of screaming pain. Podplot regarding Pang's attachment to a sexually abused girl adds depth to the story and evokes a surprising fourth act that prides itself on the wonderful act of a grotesque operation.
