This is at the top of my list of the most hysterical funny shows I've ever seen. I was laughing so I'm sure I missed half of the jokes. This shows Izzard as a genially talented comedian as he is. I especially like that it seems that it never "blunt" material for its audience. His timing is impeccable, and routine is combined as a song, not just a series of gags. Thumb up.
