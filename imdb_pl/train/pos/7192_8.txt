If you're a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones or general action, you have to see it. Directed by the team of aces of William Witney and John English, with Reed Hadley as Don Diego / Zorro, this series delivers! I will not bore you with a story (who cares? Less talking, more fighting); what really counts is the great interpretation of the hero by Hadley and the stunt work of Dale van Sickel and Yakima Canutt. <br /> <br /> *** STUNT SPOILERS ŚLEDŹ *** *** <br /> <br /> You can see the effect of this movie on Lucas and Spielberg - Zorro falls into the original version of Star Wars trash crusher in one chapter , imprisoned on the rope bridge and the Temple of Doom in another, he moves the horse to the trainer, and even escapes through the tunnel, while the villains turn over a huge reservoir of water and flood the tunnel behind him, just like Mola Ram of Indy in the Temple of Destruction. In addition, the whipping action is great because Zorro disarms villains, safety swings, etc. with his faithful throw. Most of the sword work is fair, except for the first chapter, which includes a frightening sword fight in a canteen choreographed by the legend of the sword / stuntman Ralph Faulkner, who makes the screen's rare appearance as a bad Rodriguez. It was the first show I've ever seen, at Matinée in Bijou, when I was a kid and since then I've been involved with them. <br /> <br /> Legion of fighting Zorro supplies goods "Z"!
