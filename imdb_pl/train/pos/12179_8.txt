It happened to me to watch this movie accidentally a few days ago while turning channels. My expectations were not very high, but it was an interesting movie. In "A Guy Thing", Jason Lee plays Paul, a simple guy from Seattle who is about to marry his fianc√© Karen (Selma Blair) and settle down the undisputed life of a middle-class home. For the first time we meet Paul at his bachelor party, where he confesses that he does not want to engage in any of the normal bachelor parties that encourage his (surprisingly few) buddies in case he is a little rude and feverish because of his short troubles and disputes. Of course, another thing that Paul knows is yesterday evening is in bed with a naked hula dancer and his mother-in-law phones to inform him that Karen is on her way. Oh, and the hula dancer is Karen Becky's cousin (Julia Stiles). <br /> <br /> From this little acorn of potential trouble arises a huge oak of mad misfortune, when Paul sneaks up from an unfortunate accident into an unfortunate accident, trying to hide what he was doing, while maintaining the appearance of a good family guy who is very excited about the upcoming a wedding. His efforts to ensure that Karen will not be left to anyone, wiser about any bad behavior on his part, ironically forces Paul to approach Becky's loving play, forcing him to question if he really wants a life that seems to be planned for him. The film contains the right mix of comedy and romance. It's definitely worth watching.
