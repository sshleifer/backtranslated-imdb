Recognition for Cesar Montano for reviving the movie Cebuano! Panaghoy sa Suba is very good - he has a drama, action, romance and a scene that will make you laugh. <br /> <br /> Although the story is not so original (love triangle - does it make a four-person love, Japanese occupation, rebellion, American as a man), its presentation is something cool, especially using it in the original language - bisaya for Filipinos, nipongo for Japanese and English for Americans. <br /> <br /> This movie will be one of the best Pinoy movies this year. <br /> <br /> Watch it!
