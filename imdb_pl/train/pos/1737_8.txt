I love old Burt Reynolds movies. They are more fun and better than all other combined films. They might as well have stopped making "Cannonball Run 2" movies, but I think they could know that it would not be good anymore? Man this movie is good. Burt Reynolds has to dress like a chicken and ride a racing car, and Loni Anderson's lush is on hand, looking extremely hot in the eighties. Burt and Loni, these were the days! I used to have this magazine in which Loni Anderson advertised a vacuum cleaner. I certainly liked this advertisement! Besides, there's one part of the movie in which the audience on the racetrack is upset by something that Stroker Ace does (Burty R.), and shows one guy in the audience leaning back and poking his finger in the ass to show his disappointment! I laughed so much that I almost died in the night! If you can find this movie, rent it! And then never again watch the next movie, because I'm telling you now: no sense.
