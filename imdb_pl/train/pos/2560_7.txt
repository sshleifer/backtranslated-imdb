Brando plays the jet pilot of the ace, just returning from MiG's shooting in the Korean War. On vacation he discovers his Madame Butterfly, he falls in love. Lovers recognize the stupidity of racism and cruelty that conservative cultural norms can bring to interpersonal relationships. <br /> <br /> This movie is an excellent affair with a nice touch that rejects racist, conservative standards that dominated in time in 1957. "Sayonara" will make you laugh and cry. Beware, however, that sometimes the music background will make you unnecessary, though the title song by Irving Berlin will lure your memory for a very long time after re-enacting the theater lights.
