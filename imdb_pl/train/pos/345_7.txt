The first hour of the movie was at least boring. However, later it improved when the Valentine began. In addition to the killer's identity at the very end, the murder scene in a hot bath was one of the few relatively memorable aspects of the movie. The garden scene with Kate was wound up well, just like the last scene ("twist"). There was real uncertainty and a thrill in these scenes, and the scene of murder in a hot bath had a nasty (way they should have been condemned) on the edge. Earlier murders are frustratingly bloodless.
