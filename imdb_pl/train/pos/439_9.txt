The true measure of any fictitious work is whether the characters grow out of their experiences and emerge from the experience changed in a significant way (note that this change does not have to be positive or beneficial) at the end. <br /> <br /> This is how Enchanted April is a great success. As a movie, he manages to manage a well-mannered band, well-developed characters that you care for, a great script and beautiful sets and places. In short, the film is charming. Although all performances are prime, three should be mentioned - Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent and Joan Plowright. He says something when Miranda Richardson does her usual good job, and yet she is overshadowed by many others in the cast. Most recommended, especially if you are a romantic heart. The further depositor says no.
