Made in 1946 and released in 1948, The Lady and Shanghai were one of Welles's greatest films after returning from a relative exile for creating Citizen Kane. Dark, meditative and expressing early Cold War paranoia, this film is as high as Film-Noir's crime film. The pictures for this movie are filled with typical Welles quirks with strange angles, quick cuts, long pans and ominous lighting. The use of ambient street music is the forerunner of the incredible long opening in the Touch of Evil, and the mysterious Chinese characters and sequences in Chinatown can be seen as inspiration, in many ways, to Chinatown by Roman Polanski. Unfortunately, Welles' obsession is technical filming that hurts the film in its entirety. The plot of this story is often lost behind the sometimes incomprehensible mess of film techniques. <br /> <br /> However, despite this criticism, the story combined with the wonderful performances of Welles, Hayworth, and especially Glenn Anders (laughs) make filming the joy of watching. Orson Welles draws not only the Irish accent but the torn identity as an honest but dangerous sailor. Rita Hayworth, who at that time was married to Welles, breaks up with her usual roles as a goddess of sex and assumes the role of true depth and contradiction. Finally, the strange and bizarre portrait of Glenn Anders or Elsa's law partner is nothing but a classic!
