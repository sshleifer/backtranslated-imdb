I got into this amazing program in the fourth season and since then I've seen all episodes got all the episodes on DVD and are getting better with seasons 9 and 10. Now maybe not have Richard Dean Anderson now, but adding Ben Browder and Claudie Black yet increased the power and originality of the show even after 10 seasons. Unfortunately, the science-fiction channel got rid of this amazing program without hope for the 11th season, in which two films are created directly on DVD and I hope more. Atlantis is still strong in its 4 seasons. The third spinning appears in the works, and the franchise of the stargate is not nearly dead. This TV program is compulsory for all science fiction fans and people from different genres, because it has such a wide range of things that can be attractive to all ages and all types. Watch IT !!!!! 10/10
