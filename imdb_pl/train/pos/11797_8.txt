Powers Booth is mesmerizing as the cult leader Jim Jones, who led his supporters of the People's Temple from 1953. Until 1978, when he led them in mass suicide in 1978, when over 900 people died. A very well made film that may seem a bit outdated due to the 70s, but it is worth the time of 8 out of 10
