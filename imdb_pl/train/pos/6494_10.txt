This is undoubtedly the best document ever produced, giving an accurate and epic image of World War II from the invasion of Poland in 1939. Until the end of the war in 1945. <br /> <br /> Honest and objective, this document presents views both sides of the conflict, giving the war a very human face. At the same time tactics and the importance of battles are not neglected, a lot of work was put into creating a detailed picture of the war, in particular high, low and turning points in allied fortunes. Being a British produced document, this 26-part series mainly focuses on the United Kingdom, but the contribution of Russia and America is not overexposed, but it is one of the advantages of a series of such length. <br /> <br /> Another remarkable thing is the score, music and the whole atmosphere of the documentary is confusion, struggle and perseverance. Just like the film in this series leaves the viewer no doubt the difficulties faced by the allies and Germany during the war, its climax reaches a climax at the end of each episode that serves to cover the thick World War II. After seeing all 26, the viewer has a broad knowledge of the war and is amazed at how much we owe to the members of the previous generation.
