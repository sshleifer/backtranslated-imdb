This film is a must for all people who like football as art. In this film about the world football championship, the way he is filmed is striking. In addition to the fact that you follow the game as a television broadcast, we have a generous video material dedicated to tracking individual players in games. It brings emotions and situations in which these people go through, trying to achieve glory. Today's television broadcasting style, so different from the one in 1986, is still inferior in quality compared to this movie. <br /> <br /> Players are not the only stars. The audience, the judges, the journalists dealing with matches and the environment itself play a major role in the development of what is history today. In this video you can see how all these factors play together in a very clear way. Therefore, today's style of television broadcasting has not yet reached such a level of quality, although it is now much closer than before. <br /> <br /> There are several renowned players: Maradona (Argentina), Elkjaer and Laudrup (Denmark), Francescoli (Uruguay), Platini (France), Lineker (England), Rummenigge (Germany), Butrague # o (Spain ), Socrates (Brazil) and Sanchez (Mexico). <br /> <br /> This movie is not a collection of the best Mexican football moves of 1986, although most of them are well covered. Throughout the film there is stress associated with presenting several aspects of the game and the competition itself based on the progress of these players and teams, even at the expense of skipping the appropriate games themselves. It makes this movie so interesting and unique. <br /> <br /> Because of what happened to the referees in Mexico in 1986, many comments on this film and the World Cup are very biased for Maradona. Many of these comments do not take into account the fact that there is a judge and two liners that they are just as human as players and that all the above-mentioned mistakes make mistakes in one way or another. Football regulations do not allow judges to use TV repetitions to make decisions, so most judges must decide what they perceive. As a result, the judges play an active role in the development of the game. Their influence can be seen in several parts of this film. <br /> <br /> The film continuing the world championships in 1990, compared to that, is only a source of bitter disappointment. Much of this is due to the fact that he became too involved in the game, while the film tells things from a more distant, unbiased point of view.
