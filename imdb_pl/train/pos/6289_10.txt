This movie took a lot of the stick. Critics insisted on him when he appeared and was accused of ruining Nicolas Cage's career. I do not think people have to deal with an epic, Oscar-winning film candidate. It's just a great action "Bruck-buster" at its best. Fast cars, fast editing and a great soundtrack - it does exactly what it says on the can. Also for everyone who likes cars, it's pure pleasure. It has everything: Ferraris, Mercs, Hummer and do not forget about Eleanor! I think it would be difficult for you to find a better action movie and personally a better movie at all !! Then again it can only be me!
