The movie was fine, quite funny. The cast was pretty good, and I'll give you what he mentioned earlier - Glenn Quinn was outstanding and he's enough to see this movie. He played the selfish "evil" friend and team manager! <br /> <br /> In this movie there are many songs made by "Beyond Gravity", but this is not a surprise, considering the film is a VH1 production. However, if soft rock / pop music is not liked for someone, you can send these scenes as well. <br /> <br /> The storyline of the band trying to reach the top in Los Angeles, but has to overcome many obstacles on the road is not very original, but quite entertaining, with some surprising twists and turns of action here and there.
