First of all, it is NOT possible for the remake to be so good, because the Japanese society is completely different from ours and plays such an important role in this film, as explained in the opening narrative. It adds humor and warmth to this movie. There are a lot of different supporting characters / personalities. Everyone has their part in creating this movie. This movie is full of comedy, which is not vulgar, like most of today's "comedy with the rough." Still, you can still laugh. The reality is that in real life you have no choice, who you work with, do you go to school, etc. This film really emphasizes and shows that the natural good of people can overcome small differences. Not to mention that it creates a great sub-thread and a lot of humor. It's a dance story that has a story and is good at it. There are several stories in the back that are not out of place, but actually support the main storyline. A really well-written movie. The dance is great too. In this aspect, I happen to be a fan of every movie with dancing. However, this movie goes beyond the dance with the fact that it is a first story and simply written about dancing in Japanese society. I would highly recommend. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10.
