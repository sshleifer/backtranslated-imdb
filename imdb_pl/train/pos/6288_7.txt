GONE IN 60 SECONDS / (2000) *** (out of four) <br /> <br /> "Gone in 60 Seconds" is an energetic, elegant, stylish action image with a high octane number of stars and lots of amazing looking cars. If you are a car spectator, then the production of producer Jerry Bruckheimer ("Con Air", "The Rock") is worth seeing only to enjoy the shiny vehicles. Although the film emits a stench of weakness in many areas, its precise sense of action and emotions makes it a moderately successful summer ride. <br /> <br /> Movie stars Giovanni Ribisi ("The Mod Squad") as a young cheater named Kip Raines, who at the opening of the movie does not provide a long list of expensive cars for the powerful criminal Raymond Calitri (Christopher Eccleston). When Kip's life is threatened, his older brother, Randall "Memphis" Raines (Nicolas Cage), a retired but clever car thief, is called to do the job in exchange for his brother's survival: steel fifty cars determined by model, color, year and makeup only four days. <br /> <br /> Memphis pays the first three days recruiting a team of bandits to help him retreat. The team includes Sara "Sway" Wayland (Angelina Jolie), a sexy, but damn retired car scam who knows Memphis through a previous activity, a colleague named Mirror Man (TJ Cross), an aging and wise Otto Halliwell (Robert DuVall), and Tumbler (Scott Caan), Atley Jackson (Will Patton), Toby (William Lee Scott) and Donna Astricky (Chi McBrde). <br /> <br /> Contributing to the drive and tension in the film, there is a thread involving two police detectives, Roland Castlebeck (Delroy Lindo) and Drycoff (Timothy Olyphant), who suspect from previous experience that Memphis and his crew they are not able to watch them carefully and carefully. <br /> <br /> There is not much time for character development; the audience meets these people through their difficult lifestyle and adopts hard personalities thanks to the hard, stylish atmosphere of the films. To further aggravate the situation of the film, the dialogue does not define heroes with a sharp cultural tone. I am not saying that I believe that profanity and profanity are necessary for the thrillers to thrive; I honestly honor the director's decision to stay out of an extremely vulgar language in a film that would easily score R. However, I believe in a film such as "Gone in 60 Seconds" to strongly develop the hero's enlightenment, dialogue must be credible and authentic. <br /> <br /> Despite the problems, the characters are effective thanks to the highest class, perfectly dedicated performers. The melodramatic performance of Nicolas Cage is intense and convincing. Angelina Jolie's mad appearance is perfectly suitable here. Delroy Lindo is deliciously reliable and reliable. Giovanni Ribisi, Scott Caan, Robert Duvall, Will Patton and Christopher Eccleston provide convincing supporting roles. <br /> <br /> The film contains a standard structure, with a satisfactory first act that develops the style of the story and motifs of the characters, creates a quick action motif, but lacks depth and a strong character introduction. In the second act, we will come across a few more problems: history wastes time for a significant part of this segment, never really building on the third act. While the middle of the movie takes a lot of time, and the sex scene provides a solid plot, there is not much going on. The third act is almost a simple adrenaline rush containing furious emotions from wall to wall and one of the most intense sequences of car chases that have ever been filmed. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack for the movie "Gone in 60 Seconds" is a great deal of inspiring action scenes. These are scenes such as car chases that make this movie work despite several destructive errors. Dominic Sena, whose career consisted mainly of advertising management, has an attractive style and strong attitude in "Gone in 60 Seconds", which will give viewers two hours of confusion, emotions and emotions, but not much more. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
