Kenneth Branagh's "Hamlet" gets all the characters. Acting is great, 70mm cinematography is great, Oscar-nominated costumes and sets are stunning, and the result of Patrick Doyle (also nominated for an Oscar) is sensitive and moving. Oh yes - a script written by a guy named Will S. is not that bad either. The film critics took Branagh as the fourth Oscar for "adaptation" of the script, but his decision to use the full text was quite bold. I can not think of many better ways to fly over four hours. <br /> <br /> Nearly every Branagh's decision makes the work great: using the English Blenheim Palace outside, Edwardian costume and staging "To be or not to be" in the room of mirrors, just to name a few. A cast of Hollywood luminaries, such as Robin Williams, Billy Crystal and Jack Lemmon in smaller parts, can be distracting, but it's noise. The main cast stands out: Derek Jacobi reflects the contradictory nature of Claudius; Kate Winslet sharply depicts Ophelia's descent into madness; Julie Christie brings passion to the role of Gertrude; Richard Briers is perfect as deceiving Polonius; and Nicholas Farrell raises the potentially ungrateful role of Horatio in the apotheosis of true friendship. Every speech, every line, every word is passed with passion and conviction; there is no wasted moment in the whole movie. The final scenes enlarge the scale of Shakespeare's tragedy in a way impossible to accomplish with theatrical adaptations. <br /> <br /> Branagh's "Hamlet" is a bold, ambitious and ultimately successful attempt to match the size and poetry of Shakespeare's language with equally eloquent images. This is probably the greatest adaptation of Shakespeare in history? strong praise, but deserved.
