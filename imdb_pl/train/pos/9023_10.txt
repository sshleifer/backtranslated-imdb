A very rough, bold portrait of a part of the history of World War II, which most of us in the US did not have / had no idea. I would like to have it on video. It was shown only on t.v. once, as far as I know, in 89 or 90. I asked about this film, and most video stores do not even know it. Big actresses around, I wish I could see it again. Top-class series.
