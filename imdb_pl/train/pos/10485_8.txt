I saw it on TV yesterday and I was delighted. <br /> <br /> This is a kind of movie that makes you feel nice and warm around your heart and you believe that there is still some goodness in the world (all the neighbors pretend they do not see what grace is doing to help her and protect her - my old policeman is my favorite), although you know that this story is not quite realistic. <br /> <br /> I loved to play (everyone seemed ordinary, ordinary people, living in a small picturesque English city on the coast), but the biggest thing in the movie was humor and humor! Just remember the scene in the store with two old ladies after they had their "tea" !! <br /> <br /> Perhaps the ending was a bit confusing, but it did not stop me from really, really enjoying the whole story!
