"Rock 'n' Roll High School" will probably go down in history as the ultimate rebellious game. Presenting a group of high school students who use Ramones music as an inspiration to rise up against their despotic director (Mary Woronov, the celebrity of "Eating Raoul"), the whole movie is a nice per minute. It's basically a great excuse to have fun and I'm sure you will. Persecuted first graders? Check. Music teacher of dorky (Paul Bartel, also from "Eating Raoul" *)? Check. Exploding mice? Checkmate. <br /> <br /> In any case, it is something that makes it worth living. Even for someone like me who does not know Ramones music, it's pure pleasure. In connection with executive production of Roger Corman and co-production of Joe Dante, how can we expect something smaller? It is a pity that director Allan Arkush later turned into a fare like "Caddyshack II". <br /> <br /> They starred PJ Soles, Vincent Van Patten, Clint Howard, Dey Young, Dick Miller (who starred in each of the films by Joe Dante and many of Roger Corman), Don Steele and of course Ramones. A real feast. <br /> <br /> * It looks like Bartel and Woronov have always performed together. They also starred in Joe Dante's Hollywood Boulevard and the Chopping Mall (in which Dick Miller also played) ... in which they again played roles in Eating Raoul.
