A beautiful new imprint "Zabriskie Point" plays in Paris and seems to be doing well in the Latin Quarter. It's time for a full review of the movie. Let's hope that the new print means that the DVD with a few insightful additions will appear in the near future. <br /> <br /> I remember watching ZP when he appeared, and I thought it was a fall. This time I was absolutely delighted and would qualify him as a masterpiece "close to miss". The first part of the film is a time capsule from Los Angeles from the late 1960s. I lived there then, and Antonioni did a masterful job of capturing the essence of this place. Kudos for the set designer Dean Tavoularis, who found amazing places and did a great job. <br /> <br /> The printout I saw takes 1 hour 50 minutes. Persons under 16 (or 18 years old, I do not remember) are prohibited. I suspect that there are a lot of restored materials in this printout. SPOILER - I wonder what part of the desert sex scene was originally cut out. What seems to be today seems quite tame according to current standards. <br /> <br /> There is no music to the soundtrack for almost 1 hour of film. Before we hear foreign noise, such as radio broadcasts, etc. Antonioni dared to do it. I remember how much was done during the lack of acting skills of non-actors Mark Frechette and Daria Halprin. This time Frechette did not bother me. Halprin is weaker, but gradually improves with the continuation of the film. <br /> <br /> Much of the student rape recordings look like a movie material for me. One image has a different aspect ratio and is distorted by the wide screen. Of course, there is real stage material, but not so much. <br /> <br /> I'm still trying to figure out how Antonioni took some pictures of Frechette flying by plane. It looks like he really did a bit of flying - in some pictures there is no blue screen or double screen. <br /> <br /> I hope to come back to watch the movie a second time. Recommended to all fans of Antonioni.
