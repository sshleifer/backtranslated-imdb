I know about Bettie Page for many years. Porn images from her soft core from the 1950s have become iconographic and still have a strong feature. The appearance of "Bettie Page" is still very popular in the hetero fetish world and remains as characteristic today as it was then. I watched this movie with quite a lot of knowledge. The result did not disappoint. <br /> <br /> Among other things, it was very fun to see playing movies with characters like Irving Klaw, John Willie and Bunny Yeager ?? everyone is pioneers today. Mary Harron did a great job creating the desired atmosphere of sexual repression and hypocrisy in the 1950s with sexuality, which according to today's standards was extremely innocent. I especially liked the use of monochrome versus color as a visual shortcut for the emotional and spiritual climate in which Bettie found herself. <br /> <br /> I think Gretchen Mol did a great job presenting Bettie in all innocent sexuality and all her naivety. Bettie loved to look nice, she loved her attention, she did not see anything wrong with nakedness and she liked to dress up in "stupid outfits" for the camera. The underlying sexuality and deeply fetishizing desires that they caused were completely lost to her. To this day, she still does not understand "what's going on in this confusion" when it comes to her photos or S & M content. <br /> <br /> It does not mean that it is uneducated or too simple to understand that it simply "does not understand" fetishism and will never do it. Does not matter. Bettie Page is just who she is. The film captured this very nicely. <br /> <br /> The social atmosphere of the 1950s presented by Mrs. Harron and written by her together with Guinevere Turner makes me really happy that I live in the times in which I find myself. Hypocrisy and repression combined with great ignorance about our sexuality combined with a terrifyingly stifling world. The film captures it well and brings cheering because Bettie endures it with his unwavering faith and unchanging naivety. <br /> <br /> This movie was sometimes slow, but it hit all the points she tried and hit Mrs. Harron them well. I recommend this movie even to people who do not know much about who Bettie Page was and how it influenced American culture. For those who have such interests, this movie is a must.
