You've never seen anything like it. When the coup d'Ã©tat starts, it is the most stunning thriller you will ever see - even if you know the result. And all this is true because it is a documentary - amazing. <br /> <br /> Before it ended, it was on my list of the top 10 films of all time. <br /> <br /> I will disregard the lousy right-wing fanatics. Everyone I know who has seen this movie gives it a 4-star rating. Even if you do not care about Venezuelan politics or politics, you will feel nervous and - believe it - on the edge of your seat. <br /> <br /> It's roller-skating.
