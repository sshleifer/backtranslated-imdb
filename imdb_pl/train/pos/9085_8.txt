I see many really negative posts of people who wrote in August, although the film was not released in the US, at least until mid-September. Maybe it is unhappy emigrants living in South Korea, who saw it early. I'm in the USA and that's what I saw today. I thought that the special effects were perfect, better than the trailer. The story was non-Western, but I think we're all used to it from many other movies. It was not difficult to follow. The conduct of the leaders was weak, but others were quite good. There was humor all the time. I rated it on 8 because I had a good time watching what I just went for.
