Cuban blood is one of those sleeping movies that have a lot to say about living in a very traditional way. I watched him while cruising Cuba during a cruise in the western Caribbean. He describes the life of an 11-year-old boy in a small town in Cuba in 1958 and 1959 during the revolution. Little time is spent on the revolution until the very end, when the socialist regime came and took over the property of the boy's father. Most of the film is the boy's maturation and relationships that appear in a small town where everyone knows others. There are several powerful scenes that everyone can relate to. Class A film with great acting and direction. It's a movie that tells a story without special effects or great patterns or real twists. It is a film about people and their lives, their mistakes and triumphs. A good movie that is worth watching several times a year.
