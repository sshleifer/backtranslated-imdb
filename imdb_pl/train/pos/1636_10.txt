This is one of the biggest films of the 80s !!! It sticks out like "turd in a punchbowl" !! I can not believe that Mad Magazine condemned it or anything else. And yet they proudly place their name in the "Stuart", "I-speak-a-no-enlish Chinese lady" and "UPS on speed" programs. What is going on? And, I LOVE Ron Leibman - he is foxy !! I wonder why his name was removed from loans? It was his funniest role I know. Of course, it is not as stingy as in Norma Rae. But in my opinion, this movie is just there with National Lampoon's Vacation. If you liked movies like Porky's, Fast Times, Last American Virgin or any of the other 80's teen-oriented movies, you'll love this movie !! Rent it and you'll see what I mean !!
