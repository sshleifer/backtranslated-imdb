It was only when I saw Napoleon Dynamite that I remembered seeing Cracker Bag. Just a beautiful sentiment, yet never bending over being a soppy. There are some great photos and the main girl is great. It captures more than longing for time. He has a real heart in it. It is an Achilles wound from childhood, which is excellent and painful. A simple story is always effective when it's done well. This Glendyn Ivin has a great future and I'm looking for one, I'm looking for his next project. Continuation is always the most difficult. It's like the second album of blues for most people. <br /> <br /> I just hope that his next movie is not something bad like a shark movie. I greet everyone. Enjoy your cinema.
