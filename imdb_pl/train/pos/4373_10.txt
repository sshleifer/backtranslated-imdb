I'm asking everyone who says I do not care about the movie. Some reviewers have said that there is not enough action, some have said it is too long, etc. Do not listen to them !!! If you like Shawshank Redemption and / or Braveheart, you'll love this movie! <br /> <br /> Actors are great! Tim Roth, John Hurt and Jessica Lang are wonderful, and Liam Neeson does a good job and is a very impressive character because of his size. The cinematography was great and breathtaking. This is one of the few films I've seen in my life (along with Shawshank), which was virtually flawless in cast, direction, writing, acting etc. in the best 50 or 100 peer-reviewed films. I felt so passionate that I had just registered with IMDB so that I could let everyone know the real scoop. I saw this movie about 10 times (each time with another person) and everyone liked it! You have to be vigilant and watch closely for the first 30 minutes, because they introduce quite a lot of characters at the beginning. If you have more attention than most of the kids who write reviews on this site, you'll love this movie! Come on ... all movies with 3 Lord of the Rings in top 9 and Matrix on # 32?!?! This should show the age range of most reviewers here! <br /> <br /> This is the top 50 movies !!!
