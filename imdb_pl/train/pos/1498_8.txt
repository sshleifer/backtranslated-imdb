It is a very funny and sometimes quite frightening anthology, which in the script section is a bit shorter than it makes up for the lack of acting, of working on the spot and of general excitement. The best episodes are the first with Denholm Elliot playing a horror writer persecuted by a character from his novel in the works (a perfect example of the action of taking it out of the pedestrian); third with Christopher Lee as a man terrified of his own daughter and the last episode of the late great Jon Pertwee as a pompous horror star who gets more than just a new role in his latest project. The dialogue between Pertwee and Ingrid Pitt is full of brilliance and inspiration, both clearly enjoying the possibility of really hardening! Cushing is usually good in the weakest segment, which is certainly not helped by the fact that the waxed figure of a woman who is obsessed with the local wax museum is not "beautiful" as we were told it is! Someone with shocking beauty was needed and instead we got a woman with a turtle jaw. Apart from this movie, little things, and the wonderful surroundings of a country house, you can catch whenever you can.
