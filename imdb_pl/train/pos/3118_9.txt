Not seeing the two previous ones in the trilogy of Bourne's films, I was a little reluctant to watch the Bourne Ultimatum. <br /> <br /> However, it was a very exciting experience and I had no problem with misunderstanding what happened because I did not see the first two films. Every part of the story was easy to understand and I fell in love with the Bourne Ultimatum before it came to a break! I do not think I've ever watched such a well-made and thrilling movie, especially an action movie. Because action and thriller films are usually avoided, it was such a great news for me. Ultimatum is one of the most fascinating movies that draws your attention from the first second to the last minute before the role of subtitles. <br /> <br /> Matt Damon was simply fantastic as his role as Jason Bourne. I've heard a lot about his great performances at Bourne 1 + 2, and now this great actor has one more to add to his list. I am looking forward to seeing more of his films in the future. <br /> <br /> Stunts were treated with style - each of them was made brilliant, and I was just shocked by the impressive effect of this film. Good job.
