Before the regular comments, my main curiosity about this topic is NOT SONG OF LOVE is that while IMDb has a duration of 94 minutes, the DVD from Wellspring Media in the United States lasts 88 minutes. Any comments on this subject are welcome! <br /> <br /> Two friends with a very difficult life are making an adventure. What they will end up is that one accidentally shoots a girl and two of them flee to the countryside on foot. The movie is not just a great pursuit, but it is complicated by a stupid and rather childish Spike, who behaves inappropriately and squeezes his boom box like a teddy bear. Some viewers may not like history based solely on Spike, but without the bit of frustration added to the story, the video would be too easy. You will notice the way in which the more stable character of Heaton refers to Spike as a "big man", in contrast to Spike's attitude and behavior "under control". Honestly, I was upset by Spike's ridiculous actions, especially the spray can smell, but in a desperate situation it is obvious that someone from his mentality would choose a temporary escape. But Heaton was there to control things until things got over his head. <br /> <br /> Kenny Glenaan as Heaton is a miracle and after a while I stopped wondering why the hell you want to choose Spike from prison and continue your friendship thanks to Glenaan's great performances. After all, there are many reasons why Heaton should just throw Spike and try to save himself. I suppose that Heaton felt like the protective brother of Spike, and the loyalty between them is difficult to break - until the situation becomes too desperate. <br /> <br /> While some of the pictures are actually artistic, they offer more flavor to the story, not just the shots of men running through the desert. Beautiful landscapes, rain and vast gray sky offer a gloomy tone that increases the feeling of tragic circumstances. The score is also unusual, and the use of Public Image Ltd.'s song "This Is Not A Love Song" and as the title of the movie is quite clever. <br /> <br /> Generally, it's understandable if you do not care THIS IS NOT A SONG OF LOVE, because it focuses on two contrasting personalities fleeing from another man determined to hunt them (played by cool, calm David Bradley) . This is not a big budget for entertainment. For the rest of us who like to look for something minimal and dramatic, it's worth taking the time, and it offers extremely tight moments in which you hold your breath a little. <br /> <br /> I really like it Recently, movies from Scotland appeared, with characters like Dog Soldiers and The Devil's Tattoo. I am also a little grateful for the subtitles offered on this DVD, because the accents are sometimes quick and difficult to understand for some viewers. <br /> <br /> Frustrating, dark and often strained, THIS IS NOT A SONG OF LOVE is a very tragic, but addictive story. <br /> <br />
