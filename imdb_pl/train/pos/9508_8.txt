In a poor village in Mexico, the colonel (Fernando Luján) lives with his wife, asthmatic Lola (Marisa Paredes) in an old house. Lola still regrets the death of his son Augustin some time ago. The colonel had expected a retirement pensioner in a war with the Catholic Church for almost twenty-seven years. However, for political reasons, the current government wants to forget about this old fight. Without possessing or possessing money, but valuable armor, they fight for survival, expecting a confirmation letter from the government recognizing the law and paying for a retarded pension. This slow and moving film reflects the social and financial situation of most older retirees in third world countries. In Brazil, most pensioners have to survive about USD 80.00 per month. The colonel's debt in the story was intended to pay for the cemetery for his son, otherwise he would be buried as poor. Excellent cast performance in a very sad story that is a reality in poor countries. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): (`Não se Escreve ao Coronel ') (Do not write to the colonel) <br /> <br />
