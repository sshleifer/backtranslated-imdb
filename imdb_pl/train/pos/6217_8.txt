Follow Fleet, produce RKO in 1936, play Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers in a complex romantic comedy. Although Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers had many similar romantic movies together, RKO helped them once again to create an interesting story that contains important situations for society at the time of its creation. The Follow the Fleet narration is based largely on the use of layered feature lines between two sets of main characters to create a satisfying romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> The overall story is about Bake Baker, and Sailor in the US Navy played by Fred Astaire and Sherry Martin, Bake's former partner for love and dance, who is now a singer and dancer by Ginger Rogers. Their story begins when Bake is on the ship, and his colleague Bilge Smith finds a photo of two of them, and Bake reveals that the last time he saw her, he asked her to marry him, so Bilge suggests they try to meet her when they are on land, hoping to have a friend. <br /> <br /> The next serious scene begins the second story of the movie, when Connie Martin, Sherry's sister, refused to enter Paradise, where her sister works, unless she is escorted by a gentleman. He turns to find Bilge behind with a bag full of drinks, so the game is like waiting for him and buying his entrance to Paradise. Connie finds Sherry and tells her that she is depressed because she can not be happy with Sherry for men, so Sherry suggests that she will change the make-up of her friends during performances on stage. Connie is taken over and re-enters the ballroom and again approaches Bilge, who is impressed by her view. The second romantic story begins between Bilge and Connie. <br /> <br /> Throughout the rest of the movie, the story and the emerging actions pass between the changes of the comedy relief of the two pairs, which cause several mini-ups and downs within the entire plot. Bake and Sherry broke away from their first moments, competing in a dance competition and winning, reminding them of the success and pleasure they both have when they are together. Similarly, Bilge is able to faint Connie by his romantic attempts to please her, and they leave for their home. <br /> <br /> After this series of happy events, there will soon be disturbing measures that will cause the growing share to fall. Bake left Sherry the previous night to go to the ship before midnight and told her she would come for her in the morning. Unfortunately, the ship runs when colleagues return, annoying Sherry and leaving her thinking that Bake is still a typical sailor looking for a good time when he is on land. <br /> <br /> The mood is changed again, because another story is introduced to the film when the "big shot party" takes a trip around the ship. This alternative story is used to create a buffer between the stories of the two main film relationships, and also helps build confidence and love for the general good intentions of Bake. The party is interrupted by the unconscious music game from Bake and his companions when they missed the sound to report onboard for the company. Ladies are intrigued and ask to hear their game, and Bake is happy to start playing with them, which ultimately helps to brighten up the mood of the film and bring luck to the sailors. <br /> <br /> After returning to the pair's related stories, Sherry tries to prove that Bake does not need his help with landing. Unfortunately, Bake does not realize he's being interviewed, and he manages to write good words for Sherry when he overhears his friend in a studio talking about an unusual interrogation of the lady. Bake takes Sherry's help, manipulating her water, preventing her from singing properly and destroying the interrogation. In addition to Bake's mistake, Connie spent all her money on repairing the ship, who hoped Bilge would take over his captain's position. She also planned an unusual date for him when he was supposed to come, but Bilge was aware of her intentions and hope that she would soon be married and no longer interested, so he stood up. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is continued in the same mini format of ascending and falling actions, until it reaches the climax point between the two pairs, ending the film with the happiness of both couples. Using changing stories helps to build interest and emotions in each pair, because they cope with both happiness and pain in every fight. Interlacing stories are also able to relate to each other, and include other unrelated themes to help bring the narrative to the final scene. <br /> <br /> Although Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers have innumerable films that contain romance, comedy, song and dance, Follow the Fleet is a unique movie for two actors who successfully use the technique of helpful stories narration between the two main heroes.
