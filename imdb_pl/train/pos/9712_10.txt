Another review compared this group to the intersection of Monty Python and Twin Peaks, also aptly. Another review describing the differences between the comedy we like and the non-critic and black comedy, also worth considering. <br /> <br /> View the whole, all three series. At the end, all characters are connected and the puzzles are the same as Douglas Adams' novel. The details and complexities are stunning. Exactly postmodern. Angry funny and surprisingly tragic. Not for children. Not for those with thin skin or those lacking objectivity. Provoking thought. Immediately literal, figurative and surreal in a disturbing way. The darkest comedy I can recall. <br /> <br /> And maybe the most wonderful thing I will ever see.
