For years I have been an admirer of Edward Burtynsky's work and with great pleasure I was able to see a man at work thanks to the documentary film by Jennifer Baichwal. The harsh beauty of the ship-breaking shipyard in Bangladesh, the Vermont quarry, the huge assembly plant in China, the besieged old districts in Shanghai that are waiting to be demolished: these landscapes are so well captured by the filmmaker. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I thought about old television documents about abandoned coal mines and plastics factories; things I grew up watching. Burtynsky's work is of great value when it comes to identifying how industrial activity has only moved to Asia, and has not stopped. The most bizarre scene for me was computer scrap somewhere in China - the waste had dangerous air, while the workers were very jovial.
