It was the first movie I saw Ashley Judd and the first Victor Nunez movie I ever said, and I'm glad I did it. His "quiet tone," relaxed pace, realistic representation of a young woman just starting his life, her beautiful presentation of the struggles he must go through to make his mark in life, decisions made on the basis of real things, people he meets - there is nothing wrong in this movie. It's as close to film magic as I've ever seen outside of Star Wars movies, and considering what these films are, it means that this movie really deserves a high rating. The actress of Ashley Judd, the Nunez'writing magazine and its wonderful, simple, valuable story make it a great story about growing up and a great movie.
