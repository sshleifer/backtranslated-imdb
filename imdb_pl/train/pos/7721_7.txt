The flying saucer planted (literally) by the crew of about 20 male space explorers travels hundreds of millions of light years from Earth to check the colony founded 25 years ago on the "forbidden planet." What they found is a more advanced robot than anything you can imagine on earth, a beautiful and completely inept young woman, and her father, a philistine-philologist haunted by more than the demons of the ancient civilization into which he dipped. <br /> <br /> At first glance, this story is the secret of scifi murder. Some compare it to Shakespeare's Storm, but it is a stretch and, in a sense, an insult to the scifi genre. Deprived of what makes it a sci fi film, of course, The Tempest, but how many hundreds of movies can you say something similar? <br /> <br /> Below is a warning story about the progress and technology and social evolution necessary for its proper and safe use. Nevertheless, the film still hopes for our future, which we expect from concerts such as Star Trek. <br /> <br /> Anne Francis is not the only reason why this film is best described as beautiful. The special effects and even aesthetics of the backgrounds are strong enough to be unnoticeable by unheard of directing and uneven action. If not for the foolish retro-art-deco-rivets of science-fiction props from the 1950s, one would think that you are watching a song from the 1960s. <br /> <br /> This is the classic of this very special sci-fi sub genre I like to call science fiction of the 1950s, and although it is not in my opinion the best, you certainly have to see it for everyone interested in science-fiction movie and special effects. A clever conspiracy, now trivial by re-use in six or seven episodes of Star Trek, Lost in Space, and even Farscape, is worth attention and sustains the interest of most sciFi fans. Trekkers will be particularly interested in various aspects of the movie, which seem to inspire topics from the original Star Trek series issued about 12 years later, although they may be disappointed with the sexism of the fifties and the lack of any kind of racial integration. Although I have no intention of convincing anyone, the lack of manifestation of social progress in this film was one of the main problems I had with it. <br /> <br /> Some will probably see this movie to see one of the young, handsome Leslie Nielsen in one of his first major roles. Unfortunately, Nielsen's performance is only medium and sometimes weak (especially at the climax of the movie). Walter Pigeon, although excellent in other films, also abuses his role. Mrs. Francis, Earl Holliman and the amazing Robby the Robot are the prominent actors in this crowd, but in general the actors filling the band do a good job. I think that the problems with the performances are largely the fault of the director and the editor, like everything. Although most of the movie was certainly right.
