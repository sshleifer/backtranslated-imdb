In the shadow of "Braveheart" released in the same year, two costume dramas ask for a comparison. I admit to my attitude towards Mel Gibson, but I maintain a rational preference for Rob Roy. Both "Braveheart" and "Rob Roy" convincingly depict the history of the Scots in a bloody, romantic way. "Braveheart" is an epic pean for individual honor and courage and a fantastic fantasy of revenge. It is also melodramatic, anachronistic and maudlin. Pay attention to the use of cornball in movies in slow motion. His violence is both ugly and glorious. This is the second quality that makes it more attractive for young people. While "Braveheart" exceeds "Rob Roy" in terms of the level of slaughter (not to mention the indulgent time), the latter film is ultimately more mature and satisfying. His action is more discreet but more surprising and clever. His sex is less effective, but more erotic. "Rob Roy" also has a better romantic interest. His dialogue tries to bring closer the poetry of this period. The broken teeth in the mouth of the actors are trying to get closer to the dentistry of the era. And Tim Roth is a superlative villain. Also recommended: "The Last of the Mohicans" and "The Patriot". You may think that the latter is more similar to "Braveheart" with an emphasis on bloodlust, and the first is more like "Rob Roy" in tone. All of these films deserve an R rating for violence.
