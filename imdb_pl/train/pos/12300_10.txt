This version of Anna Christie is in German. Greta Garbo again plays Anna Christie, but all other characters have different actors from the English version. Both were filmed back to back because Garbo had such observations in Germany. Sam Garbo allegedly favored Anna Christie in this version over the English version. It's a good story and a must-have for Garbo fans.
