I can not agree with any of the comments. For the first time I saw a movie on a British TV channel, it was presented as an independent film and if you take a movie in this aspect, I think it's a different matter. I could not believe what I saw and immediately got sucked in. The plot may be as bad as the JS show (ie There is no plot), but the acting is wicked and fun, and it's all an amazing movie of garbage. <br /> <br /> He talks about America the same as Bully or Ken Park without the perspective of drama, but it gives a look at American society, and more specifically at the afternoon television viewers in America (and I believe there are many!) are interested. After all, the neighbors we're talking about, right? <br /> <br /> 100% fun!
