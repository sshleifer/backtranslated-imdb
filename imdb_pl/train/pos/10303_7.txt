Bruce Almighty is the story of Bruce Nolan, an average man who feels that God harms his life. God confronts him and shows Bruce the error of his ways. Of course, giving God's power to somebody can turn into a worse one. Bruce Almighty is a good comedy, Jim Carrey is good, as always Morgan Freeman is first-rate and seems to be at home like God, and the cast combines the story well. Jokes are almost always on target, although sometimes they resort to Carrey's facial expressions. I liked the fact that the film did indeed represent God, not only this but also as a black man. I thought about it quite well, especially with the brilliant Freeman. There are some funny scenes, for example a scene with opening cookies, others miss the goal, but still a good movie. 6/7 out of 10
