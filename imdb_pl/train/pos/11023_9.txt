The choice of Sylvester Stallone to perform the main character by Renny Harlin is praiseworthy, because Stallone is such a hard and rocky man who previously gave the boldly versatile aura of the heroes Rocky Balbao and Rambo. But comparing the Die Hard series with Cliffhanger is a very far-fetched concept. <br /> <br /> A perfectly made opening scene introduces the audience into the thrill of emotion, tension and intrigue that will consume them in a bloody and dangerous encounter with outlaws. The robbery and transfer of heavy cash in suitcases from one plane to another is something that has not been filmed before. <br /> <br /> The biting cold of the snow has covered the Alps and the developing deception and betrayal between force antagonists cause one thrill of anxiety. The forces of incredible adventure and ruthless murder throw the drama at the end. <br /> <br /> Good movies are not produced every year, and people do not have a feast for their eyes to watch from time to time. In addition to the dirty language / jargon that evokes cheeky emotions during certain scenes, the film can be considered as one that will not disappear from its captivating charm, even watching it after all these years.
