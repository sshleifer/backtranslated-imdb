The movie was not so great. The book is better. But the movie was not so bad either. It was interesting, at least. The plot was quite strained to see me, although I would not say that I'm really interested in the film itself. Janine Turner and Antonio Sabato Jr. are so great that they can watch you :) They have some lovely scenes that should appeal to romantics. Generally, I would give a movie 7 or 8. It was not bad, I just missed the plot.
