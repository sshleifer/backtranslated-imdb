If there were two lovely performers than Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith appearing together in a more charming movie in 1968, I do not know who they were. For the first time I saw this wonderful little satirical gem 25 years ago at the age of 16 and consider every year in which I failed to sit down to watch him again as wasted. He is intelligent, quirky, neat, longing, sweet, gently subversive and completely charming. The romance of these two social maladjustments is both comically and awfully moving - never more than in the desperate attempt of Maggie Smith to get the right card out of the deck, a scene that is both plaintively funny and an ideal portrait of painful loneliness. And the last frozen picture of the restless, disturbed, loving face of Ustinow, who asks: "Is everything alright?" - has anyone ever made such a look and sound of devotion so perfectly and naked sincerely? I would never like to know anyone who would not love this movie.
