Another remake of "Fistful of Dollars", a remake of Sergio Leone "Yojimbo" Kurosawa (suggested by the novel "Red Harvest"). <br /> <br /> This one is exclusively a B-Movie movie; taking this into account, it is rather pleasant. the direction is sharp, acting spirited, limiting his photography "directly to the video" well served. <br /> <br /> The film's weakness lies in the catastrophic decision to marry a "handful" of Fabula "/ yojimbo" to the sub-story "Once Upon a Time in the West" by Leone. Although Leone directed both "Fistful" and "West", his motivations behind the two films could no longer be different. "Man without a Name" (Eastwood) is a border social path with a gentle place for broken families. Harmonica (Chaeles Bronson) is obsessed with his broken family and is obsessed with revenge. These two characters would not have much in common. To connect them together, "Gun Crazy" has to turn the story and complicate it until we lose sight of the story we are currently following. <br /> <br /> But this is B-Movie, and full of action and stupidity; it's fun at this level, just do not expect anything more.
