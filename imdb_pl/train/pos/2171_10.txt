A real classic, ten out of ten! Every actor is perfect, the script is a frightening sequence of tense scenes. Scenes in the car and scenes in the mountains are breathtaking. I wonder if this movie is already on DVD, because it must be visible in the panoramic version. I saw this movie in the late fifties, maybe three or four times, and I never forgot it. I remember that it was one of Warner's first movie films, a process called Warnercope, which gave very neat pictures. Shelley Winters and Jack Palance deserved an Oscar for their performances. The only thing I could criticize was not to be directed by someone like Nicholas Ray to increase his rhythm and tension.
