Japanese indie film with humor and philosophy, in which the three main characters run literally throughout the film, racing due to strange circumstances and a comical coincidence. When they run, we see what is happening in their minds and how they are there. The act of running is a metaphor for those who live by fate. In a sense, what they are really looking for is not what they originally chased, but the meaning in their lives and the escape from personal problems and broken dreams. Running makes everyone feel really alive. A great, life-changing adventure comes to an end when they accidentally fall into the middle of something big, violent and so absurd that it's fun in a clever way. One of my favorite movies of all time by the brilliant director Sabu.
