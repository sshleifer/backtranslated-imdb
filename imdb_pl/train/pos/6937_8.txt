This thrilling Western turns the story of the famous early-west rifle that everyone wanted. James Stewart is a cowboy who wins the Winchester award in the shooting, but loses her in a robbery. The story describes Stewart's pursuit with a rifle and a man through a movie. The rifle changes hands every time, as if the owner was doomed to lose him by violence. The image has a lot of action and tension when Stewart closes in his quarry. A great cast supports Stewart here, namely Stephen McNally, Dan Duryea, Millard Mitchell, John McIntire and Jay C. Flippen. Shelley Winters seems ill-treated here, and her role is rather unclear. Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson, teenagers in later years, have short but good roles.
