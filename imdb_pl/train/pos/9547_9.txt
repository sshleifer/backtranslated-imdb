This movie is the first movie for several people in the cast. They are all experienced actors and played on several television series and plays. Sahan Gokbakar is a well-known comedian in Turkey. It's strange to see him in the thriller while he is at the peak of his comedy career in Turkey. This film is the first long shot of Togan Gokbakar and almost the first experience as a director. But everyone did a good job. We are happy to see such an enthusiastic young cast. They seem very promising for the future of the Turkish film industry. Doga Rutkay has long been beloved Sahan Gokbakar, she is also a talented actress who is known for her recent theatrical play "Number 27" and several television series.
