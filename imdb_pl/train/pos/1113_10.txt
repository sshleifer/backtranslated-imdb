Sandra Bernhard is a pretty known character, and certainly one of the funniest women in the world. She began as a stand-up comedian in the 1970s, but her breakthrough came in 1983 when she starred opposite Jerry Lewis and Robert De Niro in the underestimated Scorsese masterpiece The King of Comedy. However, her film career never began. She made some strange but fun pictures, such as "Dallas Doll" (1994) or "Dinner Rush" (2000), but the most amazing ones were those she created for herself. <br /> <br /> "Without you nothing is" is undoubtedly her best effort. Is this an adaptation of her hit show off Broadway, who made her a star? and Madonna's best friend for about four years. In ten perfectly directed and staged scenes, Sandra turns away from Nina Simone to Diana Ross, tells about her childhood, Andy Warhol and San Francisco, and performs songs made famous by Burt Bacharach, Prince or Sylwester. Director John Boskovich forced Sandra to perform a 90-minute tour-de-force performance, which is both sexy and extremely fun. If you're a Bernhard fan, you can not miss this movie; it is also a tribute to her (strange) beauty, as well as her unconventional comedy talent. And this influenced the filmmakers in their work? For example, "Hedwig and the Angry Inch" would look completely different if "Without You I'm Nothing" did not exist.
