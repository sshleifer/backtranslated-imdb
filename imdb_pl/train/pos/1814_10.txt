All Dogs Go to Heaven is in my opinion the best animated film ever made. I'm not a big fan of animated films, but there's something about it that makes it better than any other animated movie I've seen. The music is great, as are the performances of Burt Reynolds, Dom Deluise, and especially Ken Page as King Gator. "Let's Make Music Together" is probably one of my favorite songs from every movie musical I've seen. This is definitely mandatory for people of all ages.
