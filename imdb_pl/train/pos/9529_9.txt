This is one of the best-made films from 2002. Maybe it's not the best movie, but it looks best, has great acting and is perfectly directed by Sam Mendes, who made his American Beauty debut. <br /> <br /> Tells the story of a gangster named Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks), whom his son (Tyler Hoechlin) sees in one of his works. Michael's boss, John Rooney (Paul Newman), thinks everything will be fine, but his jealous son Connor Rooney (Daniel Craig) sets up both his father and Michael, which leads to the death of Michael's wife (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and second son. Michael thinks Rooney is responsible, and Rooney must choose for himself and send Harlan Maguire (Jude Law) hockey to finish the job. Because Michael is a respected man in the organization, he tries to get some friends who can help him, including the mafia boss Frank Nitti (Stanley Tucci). <br /> <br /> In a sense, "The Road to Perdition" is a standard gangster movie, but it's so good you can hardly see it. This film is good in terms of production design, art, sound, music, and above all cinematography. All these elements are able to surprise and create tension, although the result is quite certain. That Hoechlin is not an annoying kid, and Hanks, Law and Newman know how to act, of course, help. <br /> <br /> Based on the comic, this movie is much better than you would expect and, although it has disadvantages, it belongs to better movies in this genre. Sometimes there are events in which you realize that you have seen it many times, but for some reason it is also a feeling of freshness. Scenes between adult Hanks and children's Hoechlin help in this area. See this video, which will look familiar sometimes, but it is completely new in many areas.
