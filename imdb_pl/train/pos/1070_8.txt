The original Cindy Jessica Alby Max and Valerie Rae Miller shines in this action series. Wonderfully politically incorrect. The quality varies greatly from episode to episode, but overall the standard is high, and when it is not, Jessica is always worth looking at. Urban jivetalking Valerie in Afroamerica almost from time to time drags Dark Angel into the sitcom territory.
