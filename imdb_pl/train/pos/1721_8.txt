If this movie was made a few years later, I would give it a lower score. However, in 1909 it was a small movie, which today is quite good. Just do not try to compare this silent film with later silence - the industry has changed so dramatically that shorts of the first decade of the twentieth century do not look like films from the 1910s. <br /> This film has 11 minutes (average for most films then) and is a variation of the story of Edgar Allen Poe, THE CASK OF AMONTILLADO. While many people know the story, I will not develop further because I do not want to ruin the movie. Suffice it to say that it is very scary !!
