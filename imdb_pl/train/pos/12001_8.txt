I do not know what movie some of these other people were watching, but they had to see another "Joseph Smith: the Prophet of the Restoration" than the one I saw. <br /> <br /> I think both films were well done and inspiring. I think it is definitely worth a look. From the very beginning you can see that a lot of attention was devoted to the creation of this film. The scenery in the background is beautiful. <br /> <br /> I think the film looks great presenting Joseph Smith as both a man and a prophet. Joseph's spiritual experiences are presented with taste and respect. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend watching this movie.
