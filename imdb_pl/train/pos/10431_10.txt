I'm not even sure what to say about this film. it's one of the few movies ever made that I think is romantic. an attempt to talk about the story or performance or the technical details of the film would be the words of sincere zappa "like a dance about architecture". it absolutely hits the heart in the way it captures those fleeting moments in life that move us, and then flee from us to never experience again. it looks like the movie in the version of charlie kaufman in the movie adaptation wanted to write. the ending is open and ambiguous, there is no happy ending, only a secret. no deep life lessons, just a few horny and intelligent children studying the ability to feel the most irrational and unrealistic feelings ...... romantic love. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 watch this special lady and I recommend her to a stranger ................
