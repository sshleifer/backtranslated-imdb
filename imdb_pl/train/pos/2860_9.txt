It lasted from 1959-1973. It's more than longevity, which says a lot about this series. It is also that he survived the changes in fashion and taste from the 1950s, the psychedelic 60s and remained popular in the 1970s. <br /> <br /> I remember the replays in this series. It was a successful combination of all its elements from stories, cast and production that made it unique. Lorne Green had its iconic character in this series. Its attractiveness was in generations. All family members could enjoy it. He balanced morality with violence, sense of humor with seriousness. The animated series was created due to its influence. It is a pity that this series is not repeated and many will not know its meaning.
