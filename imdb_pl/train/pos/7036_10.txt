I had to be one of the best political satires I've seen so far, with a great performance for Cusak, Tomea and all supporting actors. <br /> <br /> A great plot, very well placed and a very good surprise turn at the end. The action scenes have been well shot and choreographed. Very funny. <br /> <br /> All in all, I give this film a big thumbs up. He is very critical of American military intervention in the Middle East and as such may receive bad reviews from people who do not share the same political view, or who are simply too politically ignorant to appreciate dark and dramatic humor. Indeed, in some places the comedy was so close to the truth that the boundaries between funny and tragic.
