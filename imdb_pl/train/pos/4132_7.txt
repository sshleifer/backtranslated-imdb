The comedy that worked amazingly well was the small British effort "The Divorce Of Lady X (1938)". This is the first combination of Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon, before this small film about an uncontrolled passion on 19th-century English moors. And although Olivier and Oberon are not particularly well adapted to the comedy, everything goes well. Oberon is Leslie, a young woman who goes to priggish attorney lawyer Logan (Olivier) in a hotel in a nasty English mist that makes traveling impossible. He does everything in his power to irritate him - but in crazy movies he follows her. And he falls in love with him. But a serious case of wrong identity appears when "Lady X" Oberon (that's all he leaves Oliver in the note) thinks Olivier is married. Worse, and more fun, Lord Mere (Ralph Richardson) goes to Olivier, wanting to divorce his wife, who Larry thinks is Oberon! There is a nice dialogue about sex and a fun exploration of sexual politics. You can see that Olivier is not too sure of the comedy, but at the real Olivier is a seasoned professional and delivers. And he deals with turns and corners, maybe not with ease, but with taste. Oberon was not a great shake as an actress, but she was usually competent enough and despite her infamous dislike of her, she collaborated with Olivier. The film was shot in the early Technicolor, which today looks very primitive (everyone looks even more wholesome than Michael Jackson), but perhaps the printing needs cleaning.
