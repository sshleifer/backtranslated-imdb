This is the best Emma in my opinion. After seeing the second version (1996), which is also good and reading the book, I think I can confidently say that this is a real interpretation and is the most faithful of Jane Austen's masterpiece. The 1996 film with G. Paltrow is also good, it's just a different story. It is very light and fluffy, you can not see the darker edges of the characters, and if you just want a nice movie, it will be fine, but the intricacies of some feature points, such as Churchill / Fairfax's entanglement, are so much transparent to be virtually nonexistent. But if you want the characters to develop a bit more realistically and multidimensionally, the TV version from 1996 is better. Emma is an amazing person, but she is flawed. Kate Beckinsale is a master in showing small characters' idiosyncrasies. You see how indifferent she looked at some of Harriet Smith's simpler conversations, but she does not repent that she has ruined Harriet's proposal until that action has ruined her marital happiness at the end. You see her narcissism and it reflects that Frank Churchill harms others to achieve their own goals. For Emma, ​​she played a matchmaker and had a new friend who spent time after he lost the governess for a marriage. For Frank Churchill, this is to ensure the promise of the woman she loves, treating her and others in a disgusting way to keep the secret. In the book, she realizes all this in a devastating awakening to all the mistakes she made. Both Kate Beckinsale and Gyneth Paltrow convince in their remorse, but Paltrow is more childish and stagnant, while Beckinsale's revival is rather real and serious, and you see a transition from childish, selfish behavior to a polite and caring adult. Both versions are very good, but I prefer this one.
