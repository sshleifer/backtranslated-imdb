I got a free pass to view this movie last night and did not know what to expect. The assumption seemed stupid and I assumed it would be a lot of shallow humor. What a great surprise. I was laughing so much that I was crying over some jokes. This film is a must for anyone who has an open mind and a bit of a twisted sense of humor. OK ..... this is not a movie to watch with grandma (Jack Palance?) Or young children. The language is dirty, the jokes are (very) primitive, and the sexual conversation is almost as graphical as you can find anywhere. It is amazing, however, that the film is still a sweet love story. My girlfriend and I loved it. Steve Carell is great, but (like the Office) the cast really makes the movie work. All characters have their flaws, but they also have depth and sympathy. Everyone is pulling their weight, and chemistry is perfect. I can not wait to get a DVD. I'm sure it will be there with Office Space for replays and quoted lines.
