"Written on the Wind" is a melodrama by Douglas Sirk. Douglas Sirk was rediscovered by the "Cahiers du Cinema", Fassbinder, etc., who was hailed as the director's master - I think it's because of the sophistication of his pictures - "Written on the Wind" offers juicy colorful paintings and stunning decors. But I ask myself: is it enough to wear a movie? Acting in "Written on the Wind" varies from weak to fair (except for Robert Stack - he is convincing as a weak and broken playboy). Lauren Bacall, usually a strong presence on the screen, is unsuccessful in this movie. Dorothy Malone as a seductive, carefree "femme fatale" is OK, but she lacks strength for the role. Rock Hudson is efficient but boring. <br /> <br /> The plot has very interesting ingredients. The main characters are: <br /> <br /> Sztywny patriarcha <br /> <br /> his son, an alcoholic Kyle (Robert Stack) (never loved by a disappointed father) <br /> <br /> his frustrated and nymphomaniac Marylee (Dorothy Malone) <br /> <br /> Lucy (Lauren Bacall) - a female girl, formerly a secretary, and now Kyle's wife <br /> <br /> Mitch (Rock Hudson) - brought along with Kyle ' em and loved by the patriarch. <br /> <br /> Secrets behind the door, love triangle, frustration, fistfights, laughter, death, etc. - Well, when I read a summary of the story on the back cover of the DVD, I thought I was on cure. My mistake! Why? I will try to explain: "Written on the Wind" treats herself seriously and tries to tell a dramatic story. As I said before, acting is not good enough at all - it lacks intensity. There are many strong scenes in the story, but the actors simply do the work. I think that perhaps with the Italian or Spanish actors, these scenes would be fully explored - the explosion of laughter or tears would be over (for us). <br /> <br /> We still have the beautiful cinematography of Douglas Sirk. For me it is not enough. If you want to enjoy a good melodrama, see "Aventurera".
