This is one of the best specializations in history, with Adam West and Burt Ward parodying and having fun during this one. It's amazing how much effort has been put into detail, in particular regaining the sense of the 60s, the set of Batcave, Wayne Manor, costumes and actors chosen to play in younger versions of West, Ward, Burgess Meredith, Cesar Romero and Frank Gorshin! This 90 minutes is worth your time and is a joy to all fans of the classic Batman TV series from the 1960s. I note that the clips from "Batman" come from the movie, not from the series itself, probably due to legal restrictions. Let's hope that three seasons of the series will appear on DVD.
