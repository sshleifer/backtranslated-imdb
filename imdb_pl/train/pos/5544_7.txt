The PRC, which was the lowest of the lowest, actually hit gold with this moody little thriller. They did the same thing a year earlier with "Detour," which is probably one of the best low-budget movies ever made. <br /> <br /> "Strangler" is basically one film, filled with fog and shadows, a technique used by most of the study of poverty poems to hide or lack of sets. But it works well here. The ghost of Charles Middleton (better known as Ming the Merciless) lies around the swamp, killing people involved in his unlawful execution for murder and generating sympathy from the viewer. His last victim is being a daughter of a carrier ... he concentrates his anger not only on people directly involved in his fate, but also on their relatives. <br /> <br /> Rosemary LaPlanche imitates someone in a coma that's going through her playing style. He surrenders to the strangler to put an end to the killing, but as an ashes for the audience, the strangler sees the goodness of her gesture as a sign that his mission is finished and returns to the next life, slightly chastened. If Ulmer (who directed the "Detour") directed the "Strangler", it would hang from the nearest tree, and the strangler's work would be done. But who is complaining? It is not history that is the main attraction, but shielded sets, lighting and general moodiness of the song. It stands just behind the "Detour" as the best time of the PRC
