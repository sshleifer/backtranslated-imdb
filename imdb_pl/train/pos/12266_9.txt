Imagine that yesterday evening I had to miss this wonderful cultural event on Swedish television and only because my girlfriend insisted on having the TV turned on (to make it easier for her to fall asleep!), I came across this (yes, I had seen the ad before, but of course I forgot about it and I could not wait for "early night" ...). <br /> <br /> In any case - it must certainly be quite an unusual idea - to base a film documentary about an interview with sound from over 30 years ago. But thanks to animated and other documentary film materials, he creates a really good and insightful portrait of one of the most respected literary artists of the 20th century - Georges Remy aka Hergé. <br /> <br /> I will definitely read my Tintin albums with a different eye after watching this video, which makes it easier to combine different styles and content with different periods in Hergé's life (and I can say that I will get some of them soon, which I do not have ). Of course, my perception of albums has changed over the past 25 years, which I have already read, just like my view of which albums are my favorites, but this adds (at least) one more dimension.
