I love this anime! I was laughing at all jokes and violence (mainly from Akane Ranmy's reluctant but short "fianc√©e), but Ranma deserves it, but tries to fix it somehow ... awkwardly. The main character Ranma goes to China to train only to fall into the cursed spring of Jusenkkyo and turns into a girl when she is sprayed with cold water. From here it is pure chaos one by one. Among the honored are the duo brothers and sisters Kuno and Kodachi, the sexy Shampoo, the perverted Happosai, who trouble our hero / heroine. However, this is the selfish father of Ranma, Genma, who most of the time becomes the perpetrator of the mess. If someone wants anime that is fun, then this is one. It's nicer and better with the Japanese dub.
