***** Spojlery here ***** <br /> <br /> What's really scaring you? Sharks of killers, or maybe ghosts trying to restore the message? Maybe a chainsaw with a psychopath? <br /> <br /> Maybe. But these fears do not even compare to a horror story about which people do not even dare to speak or consider - and this is the death of their own child. "Pet Sematary" uses this basic, primary fear of adults, and then moves it to places that most could not stand. <br /> <br /> I have read comments about this movie that include poor acting, characters making stupid decisions, etc. I disagree. Acting is really the first movie for such a movie. Maybe many people can not imagine the desperation resulting from such a scenario. But film events are not only logical, but they can be absolutely unavoidable if such a scenario were possible. This is the real horror of "Pet Sematary": the point is not that animals and people return from the dead as evil killers who hunt for knives and scalpels, but anyone who has lost a child can become so desperate to commit crimes that Louis Creed is doing. Despite the warning or even the story. <br /> <br /> The film takes those who want to go with it into the depths of a desperate human heart. A guardian's heart trying to make up for the lack of protection. And the results are terrifying. In fact, when the movie dives at the end, it's almost a suspension, although I believe it's completely logical how it came about. <br /> <br /> I am a real fan of horror movies and I'm saying that this is one of the scariest horror movies ever made. If you do not think so, see it again when you have children.
