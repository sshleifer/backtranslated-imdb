In addition to the awkward scene, this refreshing fairytale fantasy has a funny and delightful whisper of an adult cynical joke that enchants the audience as well as the soundtrack that moves this fairy. With the exception of one of the scenes of Robert DeNiro, which does not appear smoothly and is not synchronized with the tone of the rest of the movie, this juicy romantic fairy tail has a wonderful climate of storytelling and strong magic and a perfect balance between serious adventure scenes and lighter spiritual humor are well done. In the updated tradition of THE PRINCESS BRIDE, this contemporary presentation of magic and love is enchanting. Eight out of ten stars.
