The stock exchange failure of 1929 and the depression almost ruined the American Musical Theater, in fact it was the last blow of death in vaudeville. Those behind the curtains were hit as bad as those in front of you. <br /> <br /> In order to stimulate the economy of show business and personal economy, the theater director James Cagney invented a brilliant idea. Live live prologues for films that are shown in various cinemas that grow up at night from old theaters. Other competitors are starting to believe and competition is continuing. <br /> <br /> Footlight Parade is my favorite Busby Berkeley movie. This gives James Cagney a chance to show his versatility as both a dancer and a tough guy. In his retirement, Cagney said that although he often showed his few musical musicals, he could hardly handle his simple dramatic films. He wished he had done some musicals in his career and I would like him to do it. <br /> <br /> Of course, the staging of Busby Berkeley's extravagance on the scene of the movie palace escapes all logic and reason. But he is so creative and pleasant to watch. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell singing three songs in Footlight Parade, Ah the Moon is Here, Honeymoon Hotel and By a Waterfall, the last two of Ruby Keeler are even more cementing this screen band. Ruby sings and dances with Powell in the last two years, and she is James Cagney's partner in my favorite issue with Shanghai's Footlight Parade in Shanghai. <br /> <br /> Joan Blondell is a pointless Cagney girl on Friday at the theater. Just like in Blonde Crazy, she has real brains in this duet and it's her quick thinking, which leads him out of home problems that he has on his mind. One of the best Blondell screen roles. <br /> <br /> Look for Dorothy Lamour and Ann Sothern in the chorus on IMDb pages for both. John Garfield is briefly visible in the Shanghai Lil issue. And on the stage at the beginning of the movie producer Guy Kibbee takes Cagney to the cinema, where he shows B western with John Wayne. The prince's voice is unmistakable. But even more remarkable is that the short clip shows him in the scene with Frank McHugh, who plays another Cagney assistant in the Light Parade. I think the Warner brothers played a small joke there. I have to believe that this clip was intentional. <br /> <br /> The parade of lights is Busby Berkeley in his surrealistic best.
