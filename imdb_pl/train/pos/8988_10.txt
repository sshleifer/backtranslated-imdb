The suggestion that Anton Newcombe of Brian Jonestown Massacre may also benefit from therapy is mild. In Dig! who won the Grand Jury Award at Sundance, we watch him and his team sabotage for seven years, while former friends and contemporary Dandy Warhols rise to a relative size (mobile advertisement, anyway). <br /> <br /> What raises Dig! a huge, almost biblical tragedy takes place over his contemporaneity: a depressingly honest treatise on art and trade and compromise. Despite all his attitude "look at me, I'm a goddamn genius", Newcombe turns out to be an exceptionally talented, though extremely troubled musician - much more talented than his rival, Courtney Taylor of Dandy, who tells this picture. If Newcombe is Dennis Hopper, Peter Fonda Taylor. <br /> <br /> Even more sadly, it seems that Taylor is aware of this, which is proved by his tired, self-hatting reader: he knows that his team won the battle - but what is the cost? To tell the truth, they sold themselves, recorded indie-Lite records, kept nice and clean teeth and probably brushed their hair twice before sleeping - thus earning record contracts and a big tourist bus. And rejecting all credibility in this process. On the other hand, Newcombe lives in dirt, is constantly destroyed, beats other members of the band on the stage, kicks in the head - and recently appears in Dig! by police officers who have lost the right to see their child. <br /> <br /> Two of the best films about the rock subculture were directed by women: The Decline Of Western Civilization Penelope Spheeris and this one? immediate classic when it was released.
