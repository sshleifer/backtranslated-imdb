It's an amazing movie, both because of the incredible energy caused by the crazy flamenco dance, and the unique way filmmakers intertwine the history of stage production with the lives of heroes preparing for it. Framing is the only word that I can use to describe this experience. This is not "Carmen Bizet" according to the usual standard. This is not an ordinary movie in any standard. Every nuance look, every blow of the foot, every piece of music intertwines so captivatingly that you can not take your eyes off the screen. You do not have to love opera or flamenco (not) to be caught, delighted, charmed by this movie. Subtle and direct; loud and quiet; One of them, if not the best, of this type, because there are so few of them.
