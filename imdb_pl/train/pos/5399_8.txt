The last great Goshy movie from the sixties. Gosha, a determined stylist with a great sense of his films, joined forces with Shintaro Katsu (from fame Zatoichi) to produce this virulent accusation of thoughtless nationalist loyalty. <br /> <br /> "Tenchu" (heavenly judgment) is a word that the loyalists give to the emperor yelling, killing enemies or "traitors". Katsu plays the character's simple loyalty to the manipulative politician in the name of patriotic pride. Anyone who questions politics is called a "traitor" and becomes the target of murder. <br /> <br /> One of the best photographed movies in history, many photos are amazing compositions of form, color and light. Combat scenes are frequent and very bloody and violent. The blood becomes part of the color palette that Gosha uses for her paintings. Wonderful and disturbing. Although personal history is easy to understand, the historical background is complicated and although the basic history lesson in Japan at that time would be very helpful, you can struggle with the film without it. A few drawbacks of this film are the music, length and occasional chewing of the Katsu scenery. He has a drunken scene that exceeds the top of the movie, but in reality he is a very accurate representation of a drunkard. <br /> <br /> Downbeat, but one of the best chambara movies.
