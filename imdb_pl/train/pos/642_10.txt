I was drawn into this movie about four years ago by my French friend. <br /> <br /> For the first half hour I was sitting in my uncomfortable armchair at the New Beverly Theater in Hollywood, hating the movie, hating myself, and even hating the French actress. And then ... <br /> <br /> I do not know what happened, but I have been drawn into the movie in a way I have not been for years. And this despite the fact that one of the projectors burst and they had to make each change manually. I was in the theater almost four hours, but it was worth it. <br /> <br /> I believe great movies are pulling you into the world, making you part of it, and then tossing a conversation with friends over coffee or a drink. This movie did it. It was one of the best movies I've ever had. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
