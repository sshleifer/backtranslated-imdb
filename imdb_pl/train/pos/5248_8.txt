Okay, like many other such films, it was born from the SNL skit. But Tim Meadows does a rather fantastic job, creating a three-minute one-dimensional character in a moderately viable comedic character. He throws fun consistently-treated one-liners at a fair frequency, Billy Dee Williams is in it, although his days in Lando have long since passed, and the whole thing is quite good. It is true that this is not a great art, but if you went to Wayne's World, looking for Gone with the Wind, you did something wrong. Pleasant for what it is .......
