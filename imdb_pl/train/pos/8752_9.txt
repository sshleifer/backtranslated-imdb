I have been waiting for such an original painting like this for some time. Brokedown Palace has this "difficult to believe" aspect, but thanks to the ingenious director and the scenario "Palace" is big. <br /> <br /> I really never liked to watch Claire Danes in any of her films, but let me tell you what, she really changed my mind about it. Kate Beckinsale joins the Danes during a vacation in Thailand, where they meet with a young man who persuades them to go with him to Hong Kong. However, he neglected to inform them that they would have an indecent amount of drugs. Well, they're finally caught and sent to jail in Thailand. I know, I know, how could you not know that you have 18 pounds of drugs? Well, if you can get one little help, you'll find a very well written and played story. Recently, I found myself in the story of films that I watch and develop personal feelings about the characters I watch. This movie is not different. At the end of the movie, it turned out that I care more about her than any other character in the film. <br /> <br /> Bill Pullman plays Hanka Green, an attorney who lives in Thailand and specializes in international relations. As always, Pullman provides excellent performance and beautifully combines a movie. <br /> <br /> There are a few twists and turns that will lead you to tears at the end of the movie. This is one of those movies that you most likely went through while searching for this movie to watch at home. I believe that next time in the video store we will not go through this store again.
