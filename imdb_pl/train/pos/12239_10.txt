Excellent farce! This is, of course, everything that is to be. Fortunately, there is no social or political message, nor is there any slightest attempt in this direction. Could the plot actually take place or take place at a specific time or place? It is unlikely, because it's just a movie, and the movies come from the imagination, not from reality. The only purpose of this movie is to play, certainly not to educate and to entertain, with the reality deliciously and carelessly tossed to the wind. I think most will agree that we expect enlightenment and authenticity from documentaries. But for entertainment, I want what is now called "thoughtless", which The Mating Game is in every respect. For a few chuckles and immediately laughter is a fantastic fantasy.
