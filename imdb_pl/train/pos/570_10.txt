Embarrassingly, I just watched the movie for the first time, 13 years after its release. This is a story that every father or brother can relate to ... one brother is a bit "wild", the other brother is a typical older child. Craig Sheffer is a little too dispassionate like my oldest brother, but Pitt is amazing, and Skerritt is perfectly manned as a father. Fishing scenes shot in Montana are breathtaking ... I had no idea that fly fishing could be so attractive. The video closely follows the book, introducing only a few modifications to suit the video format. Unlike most books on stories about movies, this book is measured. It's the perfect movie for anyone who wants a quiet night with a strong and somewhat emotional movie.
