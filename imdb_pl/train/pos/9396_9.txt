In many films, you can find Nicholas Cage as a strong, silent hero, Dennis Hopper as a deadly maniac, Lara Flynn Boyle as a vampire / tramp, and a late, desperate J.T. Walsh as heavy. These are the types of roles that these four people can play while sleeping, and they have done so often that to reproduce them, he once again borders on platitudes. What a relief that John Dahl, the master in getting the mood out of a small action, directed this nuanced thriller. Hopper manages to stop him from crossing the threshold, Cage shows a bit more depth than his usually superficial action heroes, Boyle is alternately stuffy, innocent and intriguing, and one has the sense of heavy soul iron that is central to his character, Wayne. Dahl's direction gives a sense of emptiness to the land of the Great Heaven in which history takes place, and at the same time is intimate enough to show how a wrinkled forehead can indicate a radical change in the plot. The plot returns are at the highest level, and one of the other great turns in this movie is that some of the supporting characters act as if they had brains. It is often not the case that small characters, such as deputy sheriffs, have more brains than their superiors. But with a director as smart as Dahl you should not be surprised by the intelligence of anything related to this film. An excellent movie.
