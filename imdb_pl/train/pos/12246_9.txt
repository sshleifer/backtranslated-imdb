The moment I started watching it, I realized that I was watching high-quality production, so I was not surprised that the script was written by Andrew Davis and was produced by Sue Birtwhistle. My only caveat is that Emma did not reach 3 or 4 or even six episodes, such as Pride and Prejudice. Acting was great, I think Prunella is great as Miss Bates, but I loved Kate Beckinsale and Mark Strong the same way. Language is a pleasure in listening, can you imagine that on this day and age you have the right to go to someone without pronouncing a curse? Samantha Morton was excellent as Miss Smith, in fact the casting was in place as in the case of Pride and Prejudice. I liked it so much that I watched it twice in two days !! So again, thank you BBC for another high quality piece of television. I saw the Paltrow version and it's okay, but I think the BBC version is much better. Excellent production, from which I am very happy on DVD !!!
