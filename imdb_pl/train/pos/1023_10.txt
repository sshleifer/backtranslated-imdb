This program has been my escape from reality for the last ten years. I will unfortunately miss you. Although Atlantis filled the hole a little. <br /> <br /> The last episode of SG1 (and so on television) was beautifully done. Robert wrote something that was close to reality. As if he tried to explain how it was on the set of the show. (Everyone who works closely for such a long time is associated with falls, but they have transformed into a family for years). I thought it was a great way to end despite the criticism of others. <br /> <br /> SG1 was something special and it moved me over and over again through the thresholds of disbelief and amazement. Great characters, stories, directors, writers. From the first episode I was addicted. The combination of action, science, drama, and especially comedy worked so well that it made me still want more. <br /> <br /> There are no real words to express completely what this program meant to me. I can only thank those who have kept the program fresh and fun for so many years. It inspired me to do many things that I thought impossible. <br /> <br /> I'm waiting for movies next year and I really hope there will be many of them. I never want the show to die. <br /> <br /> Stargate SG1 - 1997 - 2007?
