ANTWONE FISHER is a story of a young, emotionally tiring sailor from the US Navy. His problems lead him to Jerome Davenport, a psychiatrist who helps him understand that his problems stem from his childhood upbringing. <br /> <br /> Prepare to shed tears or two. The film could defrost the coldest heart. I loved the story that turns away from something so terrible to meet anyone in a positive ending. ANTWONE FISHER is a powerful movie, first of all about forgiveness. Other important issues that make you think about the use of children, adoption and foster care. <br /> <br /> Oscar winner, Denzel Washington performs impressive work in his directorial debut. There were many scenes that I liked to watch. They included the beginning (dreams of a small boy - check the gigantic size of pancakes!) And ending (dreams turned into reality) that beautifully tied the story. <br /> <br /> Another great scene took place when the doctor encouraged Antwone to look for a family to find answers to his questions about the family who abandoned him. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene happened when the young man finally confronted his mother and her reaction to him. Priceless. <br /> <br /> All the actors represented their parts well. <br /> <br /> In addition to the director's duties, Mr. Washington continues to show why he won an Academy Award and is successful in all of his acting roles. He had a strong presence in this film. <br /> <br /> Actor Derek Luke demonstrated why he was good at the role of Antwone Fisher. He presented a very real and heart-breaking job. <br /> <br /> Joy Bryant, who played the role of Cheryl, interest in Antwone's love, resembled a ray of sunlight on the screen. Chemistry flowed well between romantic characters. <br /> <br /> Novella Nelson, who played the role of Mrs. Tate, a villainous figure, deserves special attention. <br /> <br /> Although we only see her in a few minutes, the actress who played Fisher's mother gave an excellent performance. <br /> <br /> Everyone should see ANTWONE FISHER.
