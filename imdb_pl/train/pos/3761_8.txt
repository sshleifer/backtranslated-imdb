Bogus Journey Bill and Ted is a continuation of the great adventure of Bill and Ted. Their fictional traveler goes almost directly after the first film and does just as good a job if it's not better to entertain the viewer. <br /> <br /> Plot is a bad man from the future trying to kill Bill and Ted uses bad robots that look exactly like Bill and Ted. When robots kill Bill and Ted, they must compete with the grim reaper (death) and bring their lives back to normal. <br /> <br /> Acting in the film is at the highest level, and even considered to be a bit strange sometimes, especially the conversations of Bill and Ted, is a great movie. The would-be rockers certainly did another great movie. Pick it up next time on the hit!
