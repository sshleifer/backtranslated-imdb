Tiempo de Valientes fits perfectly into the action movie genre, but it goes beyond its roots thanks to the excellent casting, incredible contact between the leading and outstanding photography. Diego Peretti plays the role of Dr Silverstein, a psychiatrist assigned to conduct a shotgun with Detective Diaz (Luis Luque), who was assigned to investigate the murder of two minor hoods, which apparently took part in the conspiracy of arms smuggling. Diaz has been suspended in service, but he is the best man to work and must have professional psychiatric help to be restored. Silverstein and Diaz are soon involved in a conspiracy involving the Argentinian intelligence community and some uranium, and the film separates them at a key point that allows Silverstein to develop his own impressive sleep skills. Peretti and Luque are great and remind me of the screen band Terence Hill and Bud Spencer, although Peretti is not as handsome as Hill. Interestingly, even after almost two hours Tiempo de Valientes hates welcoming, and writer-director Damian Szifron creates a potential continuation of the charming code of the film. In summary, a great and very fun action comedy that does not go to the lowest common denominator nor does it offend your intelligence.
