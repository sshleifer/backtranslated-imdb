This perfect drama kept me busy all the time. I could not take my eyes off the screen for one second, because each word combined elements with this mysterious murder. This movie really moved me because it showed how sad and difficult life can be. In the end, I really cried (which I do not want to give away!). It also allowed me to understand how cruel and disgusting people can be when it comes to murder. <br /> <br /> The cast was also very good. The only bad member of the cast was the actress who played Anne Marie. The actress did a great job, but the director did not. I say this because he found someone who did not look the same as Anne Marie Fahey herself.
