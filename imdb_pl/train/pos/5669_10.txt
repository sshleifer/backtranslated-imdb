In her first undemanding role Esther Williams plays a teacher who is a victim of sexual assault. It gives a great performance, proving that it can be very effective outside the pool. As a detective who wants to solve the case, George Nader probably gives the best results. And he is so handsome that it hurts! John Saxon is a suspect student, and although he makes impressive bills, Edward Andrews is his overly protective father who is outstanding. <br /> <br /> Bathed in glorious Technicolor, an unguarded moment is an irresistible hokum and sometimes thrilling drama.
