I'm not too picky about horror movies, and I'm willing to watch almost every one of them. This does not mean that I am willing to see many of them again, or that I will not criticize them. This movie is frightening and very well done. In fact, I think this movie would be a great double bill with Session 9. <br /> <br /> I should determine before I go to my comments that I watched it myself. I started watching him before going to bed and I got about 15 minutes before I realized he was too effective, so I saved the rest for the morning. Even while watching him in broad daylight it was still awful. However, I can not vouch for how effective it would be to watch in a larger group. <br /> <br /> After the death of their daughter, the couple moves to a distant cabin to try to reach the conditions with this death. Let me pay attention to this death - it is one of the rare films that is not afraid of the death of a child. This is much more important because it both sets the tone and explains the many activities that penetrate the film. <br /> <br /> The couple are not feeling well. The wife distances herself from the relationship, and her husband does what he can to bring her back. While some of the comments complained about their actions - one said that they behave more like a father and daughter than a husband and wife, and that is justified. He's trying to give her more hints. This is the role that men sometimes take. <br /> <br /> There are many horrors in the film, and most of them are quite peaceful, although in a sense grotesque. The story itself seems very simple for most films and is strange at the end. While the turn is not absurd, it certainly is not what you expected from what things were doing. <br /> <br /> Moody, climatic and very well made for something that seems to be shot on video.
