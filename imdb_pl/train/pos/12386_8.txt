"The Sentinel" is one of the best horror films ever made in the film industry! I think it is very scary because there are very few movies in reality. Alison Parker is a model with some fame. Become a lawyer with Michael Lerman and have another model named Jennifer as your best friend. In her life everything was great until she decided to live alone for some time and rent a beautiful and old apartment. <br /> <br /> The problem is the neighbors who are very, very strange. Suddenly, Alison begins to have health problems and faints with frequency; She also remembers the painful facts about her past that make her have nightmares or illusions. But everything has a reason and is related to the new home in which he lives ... <br /> <br /> Personally, I think "The Sentinel" is a very scary movie and together with "The Exorcist" "" are the two most terrifying films that I have already watched. When we find out that Alison's home is only occupied by the priest, and she herself, my blood froze! It's terrible that it must be blind at the end of the movie to be a new guard who keeps monsters out of our world.
