When I learned about the death of Sir Alec Guinness, it was the first of his many films about which I thought about seeing again. What a wonderful, cheerful comment the film provides even after all these years. And Guinness helps you to charm in every frame. His eyes and face are as glowing as the white suit he wears. Both he and the film must be considered a favorite for a lifetime.
