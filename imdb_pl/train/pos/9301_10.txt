Initially, I saw this very dark comedy around 2000 in cable TV. What a surprise and joy! Everyone is secretly armed with this movie! Dreyfuss plays the "mental" don (remember the New York report, which was supposed to be a schizophrenic? Art imitates life or vice versa?). Diane Lane and Ellen Barkin are the most beautiful and can not play with them! Thus proving that beauty and endurance go hand in hand! Then there is the big scene of "Nonsense" between Barkin and Jeff Goldblum (Rita and Mickey), where they play verbally "nonsense" all over the world. This film is subtle and bald. For all pictures it can be a very quiet movie. And you have the opportunity to see several actors in their final or close final roles. Joey Bishop. Richard Pryor. Henry Silva. This is not a movie for everyone. But if you like a movie that has a lot of fun with words and moves without blowing everything up, it's a movie for you. Roger Ebert throws himself on this movie. He is wrong. THIS is great, great movie! Maybe not for Ebert. I consider this to be 10 because of how well it is done and how fun the script can be, and at the same time it is not an ordinary comedy film. I like it so well that I bought it on DVD because it just does not show much on cable TV. Now everything is mine!
