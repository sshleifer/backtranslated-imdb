CRY IN THE DARK. <br /> <br /> CRY IN THE DARK is a movie that, in my opinion, would have a phenomenal performance by Meryl Streep and a solid but not very noticeable film. This assumption resulted from the fact that in addition to nominations for best actress Streep, the film has not gained much attention to the main groups of awards. <br /> <br /> I did not expect that A CRY IN THE DARK will be so thrilling drama, well -konstruowany at every level. If you ask me, it's underrated classic. <br /> <br /> The movie starts quite slowly, allowing the audience to settle in Chamberlain's at a relaxed pace and really notice that they are actually an incredibly loving, simple family. Fred Schepisi (director) chooses random moments to capture the family on holiday, which gives the approaching sense of the upcoming tragedy, while showing the intimate pleasure with which Lindy (Streep) and Michael (Sam Neill) Chamberlain are caring for their children. <br /> <br /> During the famous line "A dingo took my baby!" became a punch line in a sense, the film is never even close to the ridiculous. The actual death of Azaria is frighteningly caught. It is subtle and realistic, leaving a terrified audience and asking the questions. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie takes place in courtrooms and focuses on Chamberlain's constant struggle to prove his innocence to the press and the court that Lindy suspects of murder. <br /> <br /> The fact that from the beginning is clear to us that they are innocent, makes the strained attempts to become even more engaging. As an audience member, I fully invested in Chamberlain's difficult situation ... and I was really angry and hurt and saddened when the media looked so horrible. But while the media / public opinion are understandable. I loved the way the media were anything but sympathetic, but always had important reasons to maintain their views. <br /> <br /> The last line of the film is very deep and perfectly captures the central element that makes this movie so different from other legal dramas. <br /> <br /> As for the performances, the only ones that really matter in this film, Streep and Neill are ... and deliver them in every respect. For me, this is one of the best (if not # 1) Meryl Streep performances. In spite of all their mastery of different accents (which of course in themselves are impressive), Streep never lose the central heart and soul of his characters. I believe that this is one of the more subtle performances Streep, and she goes out of the park. And Neill, an actor who never made an impression on me than charismatic and attractive in the JURA PARK, is a perfect counterpoint to Streep's performance. From what I've seen, there is undoubtedly Neil's best work so far. It is a pity that he has not been recognized by the Academy with the appointment of the Main Actor for the Streep match ... b / c they both play great together. <br /> <br /> More emotionally than most movies, and extremely uncertain ... CRY IN THE DARK far exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend to people who know this film only as a movie in which Meryl screams: "Dingo took my child!". Watch the video and see how much more is in CRY IN THE DARK, and then in this one line. <br /> <br /> ... And ...
