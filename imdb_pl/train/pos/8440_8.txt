This is the last episode we deserve. At the end of last season, the "life goes on" is still in the mood, which was not the summary that the realistic series deserved. Although it is not a happy program, this series has always made you think (which is rare on TV) and this is not an exception. "Is death justified by reasoning?" Is morality reflected in society, or is society shaped by morality chosen by the few in power? " "What is a just death and can it exist?" All these questions and more are presented by the authors of this series every week, and this is their final thesis. Great action, great writing, great work with the camera, brilliant editing, clean direction. If you saw the series and missed it when it first started, catch some copy. If you've never watched the show when it was launched, it will be the same, but it can be hard trying to keep up with who all characters are and what they relate to in their diverse past. For those of us who have been keen viewers of the series in the last two seasons, this is a very satisfying viewing experience.
