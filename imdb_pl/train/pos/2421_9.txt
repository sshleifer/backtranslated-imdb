You should not underestimate what I am going to say. I have seen many, many films and I have reviewed many of them in print. So when I tell you that this movie has the funniest scene I've ever seen in a movie, you can listen to me. There are many different opinions about what makes this AMAZING stupid movie so funny as it is. And for those who just did not get it, I can not blame them. The scene I'm talking about appears around 30 minutes and means the dead convict chained to John Candy. Until then, the film was stupid, confused and began to lose me. When this scene appeared, I laughed so much, I peed in my pants. I've never seen a movie before. After the project "Going Berserk" was to be a SCTV movie. I remember that it was announced. As time passed, the cast was reduced to John Candy, Joe Flaherty and Eugene Levy. During filming in Universal, there had to be a regime, because after the release it was shown in the ZERO law. Watching it a second time, I listened to a song with a leitmotif (which really reveals how incomprehensible the story is in the lyrics), I loosened my logical nerve and understood what was going on. In addition to the routine mentioned above, "Going Berserk" has many other funny scenes that are worth recommending. It is almost a three-part move, except that it is much more fun. Director David Steinberg has a hard time and he had to laugh through it all. As for Candy, who is basically responsible here, NEVER was more fun. From all the plot devices and explanatory scenes thrown out of the window, he is absolutely wild. Flaherty and Levy follow him effortlessly. There is a conspiracy, but this is a story like "Animal House" had a story and yes, the script is uneven and a little slow starts. However, once you know it, you can appreciate the full SISV style frenzy. He's stupid, but he's deliberately stupid and you have to remember when you see him. DO IT and discover for yourself if it has the funniest scene of all time.
