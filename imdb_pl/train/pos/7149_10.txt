Holes are a great movie to see. He has good news, such as: be a good friend, never give up etc. I highly recommend it to everyone. I still say that the book is better than the movie, but the movie gives the book a chance for money. In addition, Khleo Thomas plays Zero. It really adds to that !!!! Lol !!!
