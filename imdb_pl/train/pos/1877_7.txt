Arthur Bach is definitely unhappy in his life as a multimillionaire and attracts people "under him" in a social position - he pays for a prostitute in the early stages, and then is extremely attracted by a thief. <br /> <br /> He also drinks quite a few, and sometimes he also rides while drinking, which of course is not fun. <br /> <br /> The film is great, but the reality is behind the comedy. John Gielgud wipes the floor with others on the screen and creates a character for ever. Talk about earning an Oscar. Moore and Minnelli have their moments, but Gielgud is "Hobson", which you will remember the most.
