The story of Cinderella is one of my favorite characters of Charles Perrault, the Sleeping Beauty, which was also made in the Disney movie in 1959; this movie is a sweet, charming Disney masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The movie has a great soundtrack; this is what I like in the movie, it's a very good soundtrack and I also love songs; my favorite song is the romantic "So This is Love". I also love mice from the movie, they are cute. My favorite scene is a narrative scene, little birds tried to wake Cinderella morning; I also love when the animal friends Cinderella (mice and birds) repair the dress of the mother of the birth of Cinderella, so she can go to the ball ... until Drizella and Anastasia tear it to pieces, b **** es!
