Two sailors are on vacation - Mr. Joseph Brady (Gene Kelly) and a shy innocent Clarence Doolittle (Frank Sinatra). They meet a beautiful Susan Abbott (Kathryn Grayson) and they both fall in love with her. There are more, but you probably guess. <br /> <br /> The story (even for a musical from the 1940s) is funny and everything is so nice and healthy - quickly irritating. Also, this movie is much too long. It's 140 minutes and it's too much for such a stupid story. There are also boring numbers of Jose Iturbi and his orchestra. It's still worth catching. <br /> <br /> When Kelly dances, and Sinatra or Grayson sing, it becomes magical. None of the songs is particularly memorable, but Sinatra had such a beautiful voice that you would not care. It's shot in rich Technicolor with all the gloss that MGM possessed. Acting is okay - Kelly is doing well (although seeing him as a female man pushes him), and Sinatra is just great (although seeing HIM as a shy guy also pushed it!). Grayson has nothing to do, but he is incredibly beautiful. Some of her photos literally took my breath away! There are many attractions here: a large number of dancing and singing Sinatra and Kelly; Sinatra sings anything; Two Grayson songs and the famous animated sequence in which Kelly dances with Jerry - animated mouse! Tom also has a funny scene. There's also a small Dean Stockwell who steals every scene he's in. <br /> <br /> So it's too long and the plot just can not stand it, but it's still worth catching. It was a huge hit in those days.
