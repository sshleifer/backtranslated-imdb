Did such ambient production fail its main goal, which was the correct adaptation of the Allende novel? Certainly yes. Bille Augustowi managed to create a shallow, shallow film in which the basic elements of the South American mentality are presented simply as side events, which causes total inconsistency. I can not believe that there was a whole production team that could not understand the book! In this film, of course, there is technical quality and I think that the actors did everything they could, but something is missing. And this was the most important part.
