This movie is amazing. If you take it too seriously, of course you will hate it; however, the amount of "guys" and "righteous" brings laughter and faint memories from about 15 years ago. I like his ability to make me laugh about obvious jokes and stupidity, and the ability to make me want to see his precursor Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure (1989). If you're looking for a movie full of multi-faceted jokes and completely mature humor, do not watch it; however, if you want a movie that is humorous and stupid, yet intelligent and addictive, you'll like it. Actually, I would like more of these kinds of pictures to appear in today's theaters. And hey, it's Keanu Reeves who behaves in a way that everyone parody him, playing ... right ... there's nothing better than this :)
