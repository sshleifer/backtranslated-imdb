Very sweet pilot. The performance reeks with Tim Burton's better movies ... Edward Sissorhands, Big Fish, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Cinematography, narration, music, external sets are all shouted by Tim Burton. There must be a combination or impact of STRONG, I just have not examined enough to know where it is. <br /> <br /> As I saw on the forums, Anna Friel plays the poor Zooey Deschanel. Every time I see her on the screen, I see Zooey. Do not get me wrong, Anna Friel does a great job. Her character is very sweet and lovely, and you are easily attached to her. It's more of a distraction that I still think, "Why did not they get Zooey Deschanel." <br /> <br /> Lee Pace is also doing a great job. I tried to remember where I knew him and just checked him. Miracles !!! A great, short-lived series from 2004. If you like Pushing Daisies, you MUST hire Wonderfalls, which is another work of Brian Fuller. (Little Shop of Horrors) again. Two unappreciated actresses of characters who have never failed in their performances.
