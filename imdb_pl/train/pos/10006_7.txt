In this critically acclaimed psychological thriller based on real events, Gabriel (Robin Williams), a well-known writer and host of a night talk show, is captivated by the shocking story of a young listener and his adopted mother (Toni Collette). questions arise about the boy's story (history), but Gabriel is drawn into an expanding mystery that hides a deadly secret? according to the official summary of the film. <br /> <br /> You really should stop reading these comments and watch the movie NOW ... <br /> <br /> "How did you lose your leg?" ending when Mrs. Collette is planning her new life, she should be cut off and sent to "deleted scenes". It's an exaggeration. The real nature of her physical and mental ailments should be obvious before Mr. Williams returns to New York. Perhaps her blindness could be questioned - but the revelation could be certain in the "highway" or "video tape" scenes. The film would gain on the re-edition - and what about the "cut of the director"? <br /> <br /> Williams and Bobby Cannavale (as Jess) do not seem initially credible as a couple. A scene or two related relationships could help in the preparation of the scene. Otherwise, the cast is exemplary. Williams offers exceptionally strong characteristics, not "impersonating gays." Sandra Oh (as Anna), Joe Morton (as Ashe) and Rory Culkin (Pete Logand) are perfect. <br /> <br /> Most importantly, Donna Collette belongs to the terrifying fame. Mrs. Oh is right saying Collette can be "you know, like this guy from" Psycho ". For several years, the organizations awarding acting awards seem to reach women due to the smaller dispersion of roles; they would certainly have seen Collette with some reward. She is so good. And director Patrick Stettner definitely summons Hitchcock - he even gets a sandwich from the machine in suspense. <br /> <br /> Finally, writers Stettner, Armistead Maupin and Terry Anderson deserve the gratitude of flight attendants everywhere. > <br /> ******* The Night Listener (1/21/06) Patrick Stettner ~ Robin Williams, Toni Collette, Sandra Oh, Rory Culkin
