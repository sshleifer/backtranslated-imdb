Ayone, who is whining about how this movie was bullshit or that he did not have any conspiracy, was looking for "Jean de Florrette". HELLO! this film was an accidental comedic act and in no way associated with the plot in any way in shape or form. I would also like to remind these marmots that if you are going to extort the nonsense from this movie, it seems that they lack a point. This film is made for people who do not appreciate the so-called "American humor", which seems to me just a pile of dirty nonsense. The point is that everyone has an opinion and you should be a little more grateful that the sense of humor of some people may not agree with the sense of humor before shooting the mouth. <br /> <br /> Thank you
