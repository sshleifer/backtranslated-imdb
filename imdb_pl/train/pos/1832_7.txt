I saw two films over the weekend, one was "kaal" and the other was "waqt." Both films are made in Bollywood, but they are different. The main difference is history and director. Vipul Shaw has made his indelible mark in "Ankhen", one of the best comedy movies in Hindi. His throwing Charecteres is perfect. The story apparently taken from Gujerati Play is amazing, the treatment is wonderful with some exceptions. In Bollywood, when the film is shooting, the first thing that the director of Bollywood is willing to do is sign up for a musical director, and this guy (the average Malik in this case) is required to record six songs to fill the contract. So even a good director like Vipul Shah has to use them to calm Finafta, and grandma who just does not have enough of those numbers. The director of No Music can constantly create good songs, which is clearly visible in this film. None of the songs have any melody and they are clearly interfering in the story narration, with the exception of background music and the Western version of Bharat-Natyam. Duel and role play Father and son are good, they play Bachachan and Akshay Kumar. His stunt scenes are clearly outstanding. A good director surrounds himself with good actors and is ready to wait until a good story appears, as in this cool movie. Then we have a cheap classless tasteless producer, such as Sharukh Khan, who will bend low to shamelessly connect and promote garbage such as "Kaal" to get rich at the expense of art improvement, and surround themselves with border talent, and regain investment before the word becomes will spread. This Bollywood locust feeds on an unexpected audience to win the Bollywood Chamcha film rewards, and most of them are in the media.
