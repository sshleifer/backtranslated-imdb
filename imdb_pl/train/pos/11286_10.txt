I recommend watching this movie with your significant person if you are planning a romantic evening with him. The chemistry between Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan as Tarzan and Jane is so steamy that it can fog your screen. <br /> <br /> After the original movie, we start to see how Tarzan and Jane have adapted to the jungle and to each other. The tiny Jungle Jane and Tarzan's protest, when Jane covers her guests, illuminates that they are not just romantically but also sexually in love. <br /> <br /> Imagination can complement the constant movement and love between Tarzan and Jane to show how much Jane teaches Tarzan about emotional, romantic and sexual love. And Jane's student not only embraces, but also develops thanks to his previously unused sexuality. <br /> <br /> The skin show in this movie is excluded from the charts. In addition to the two-piece sexy belly, legs and hips suit, Jane also has an underwater naked bath with Tarzan. (although it is not O'Sullivan, but Olympian Josephine McKim, who doubles for her in this scene) Weissmuller, also reveals a huge body and perfect breasts in his loincloth. Ladies will be delighted when Weissmuller emerges from the water after a long fight with the giant crocodile and his scream will sound - with a water-flushed patch of loins practically falling from his hips. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the excessively protective censors have subdued the adult nature of Tarzan's films after this post. Although Tarzan Weissmuller's films will continue to grow well in the coming years, they seldom reach for the sex appeal of this film.
