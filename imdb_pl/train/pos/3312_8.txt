After losing Emma for the role of Rose's mother in the television version of GYPSY, Bette won Emma next year for BETTE MIDLER: DIVA LAS VEGAS, a special live concert filmed for HBO from Las Vegas. Midler, who has been performing on stage since the '70s, proves that he is still one of the most electric live performers in the industry. From her opening number, her classic "Friends", where she descends from the wings on a beautiful cloud, Bette controls the scene with style and charisma from the "I Look Good" rap style, and then proves that she has a way of joking, like a few other performers in this business, how it will go through various musical selections. Part of the series in which he greets the burlesque, takes a bit too long, but she manages to add her old jokes to Sophie Tucker here, for the benefit of her (although she actually forgets about one joke during the story, but about her ad-libbing until she remembers that is hysterical). Bette also treats us as "Rose's Turn" with GYPSY and the title melody from her hit movie THE ROSE, as well as the shameless plug-in for her hit movie THE FIRST WIVES CLUB. He brings home at the end of the song "Stay with Me, Baby" with THE ROSE and her only hit number "Wind Beneath My Wings" with BEACHES. It's a dazzling evening of entertainment comedy, and for fans of Midler it's a must.
