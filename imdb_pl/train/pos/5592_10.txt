Famous for introducing the world to Hedy Lamarr and full of nakedness, but much more. In fact, it is one of the tops of cinema poetry, including some of the groundbreaking works of art cinema from the 1930s, in the same prestigious group as Under the Roofs of Paris, Tabu, Olympia and even L'Atalante. It is almost silence, consisting mainly of wonderful images, as well as Giuseppe Becce's fantastic, symphonic sound. It is a masterpiece of cinematography and music, yes, as well as editing, directing, writing and acting. A good 90% of the film moves perfectly. Machat√Ω seems to be an expert in using motifs. Perhaps it is not as subtle as it could be, and perhaps a little overused, but the appearance of objects such as insects, lights and horses beautifully presents the story. Small fragments of dialogue are fortunately innocent. You can not hear as much as you can imagine. The last bit is at least strange. Reminds Russian silence, we have assembly workers. It does not make sense during the narrative, but it is so wonderfully done that I refuse to harp too much for this disadvantage. Ecstasy is a movie that desperately needs rediscovery. It belongs to the best films in history.
