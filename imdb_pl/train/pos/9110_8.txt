You know? Our spirit is based on this revolution, sleeping ... I can explain, I think! Well ... Until what happened on April 25, 1974, Our freedom was limited, we had no freedom of speech, but when we got it during the revolution, it seems that the Portuguese have lost their opinion, we do not use our freedom of speech! This is all a consequence of the revolution! I think it's clear! ... About the film ... I think she has a few mistakes in the acting game, but by the way I watch Portuguese movies, it's pretty good !! I like it very much!
