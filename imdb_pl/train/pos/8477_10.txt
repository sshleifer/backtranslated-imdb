in the not so conventional sense of the word. <br /> <br /> This movie was one of my favorites as a small child, and I recently remembered it and thought to watch it. Although many details are not obvious to me anymore, the overall impression that the film has given me has stuck in my memory over the years. <br /> <br /> If parents feel that their children can deal with mature and sometimes violent themes, I highly recommend this film. It taught me a lot about life and death and it caused me a lot of emotions. To this day, it remains one of my favorite films.
