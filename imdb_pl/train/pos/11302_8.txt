Oh, those tricky Italians. This is not the first time that they base the film on the source material without the consent or knowledge, in this case, the author of the novel. Of course, this is not something typically Italian, but it was done quite a lot in the first days of the cinema, mainly because they often thought that they would manage to escape. James M. Cain's publishers managed to keep this movie outside of American screens until 1976, but the movie itself has become a bit of a classic. <br /> <br /> The movie is not as great to watch as the 1946 movie version, but it is still a great movie. This, of course, is not the least due to the fact that the film is a great story, it is intriguing and provides the film with great characters and realism. He follows the novel quite accurately and that is why it is mostly the same as other film versions of its history, of course with the difference that it was set in an Italian environment. <br /> <br /> Leave it to Italy to make a film about life and real people in it. These early dramas always have very realistic feelings and are therefore quite addictive to watch them. Unfortunately, the movie lost some of its power at the end, when the film began to slightly lengthen and drag parts. The movie could easily end 15 minutes earlier. <br /> <br /> However, I do not have much to say about this movie. It is simply well made, based on equally good and strong source material. Pretty impressive directorial debut of Luchino Visconti, who continued directing many wonderful and unforgettable Italian dramatic films. <br /> <br /> 8/10
