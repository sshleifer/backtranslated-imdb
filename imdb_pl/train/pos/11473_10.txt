Zero Day is a movie that very few people have seen, and what a shame. <br /> <br /> When I saw the end in which the two main characters descend into the room and mercilessly kill people, then commit suicide and make me grab my belly. I was shaking, this movie is so strong. <br /> <br /> The movie is amazing. It's unbelievable not to get the perfect ten. It is sad that so few people understand the true beauty of this film. It's not the budget that makes the movie good, it's the amount of feeling that the creators put in it, which makes it good. <br /> <br /> It leaves a lasting impression in your mind that you simply can not get out. This makes you aware of the real horror of the shootings - especially if you were to meet that person, and this movie makes you feel that you know these people. <br /> <br /> I recommend Zero Hour to those who feel mature enough to watch it. I'm fourteen and I feel that this movie is too amazing to be expressed in words. It looks like you are watching something that has actually happened.
