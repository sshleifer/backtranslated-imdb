I'm 14 years old, so you'd probably think that I've never heard of George Burns, Walter Matthau or anyone else. You're wrong. I heard that George Burns was in this movie and that he won an Oscar for it. I've been a fan of George Burns for ten years. I saw the movie Oh, God lately and I loved it. This one was amazing. George Burns did a great job. Like Walter Matthau (this is the first time I've seen him). And although they had really small roles, Phyllis Diller and Steve Allen did a good job. The specialty they shot would be amazing if it really was done. I will say this if you're a fan of George Burns or Walter Matthau, you should see this movie right away!
