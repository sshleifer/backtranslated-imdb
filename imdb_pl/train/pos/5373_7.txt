Perhaps this is not the biggest entry in the Hammer House of Horror series, but it certainly wins the prize for the most ingenious episode! "A house that bled to death"? I could scream all this title throughout the day without getting tired of it! Besides this wonderful title, this short film also benefits from a solidly written script and a handful of really tight moments. This may require additional viewing before you fully understand the peculiar end result, but it is definitely an original idea for a short horror movie. The story begins with the images of an older couple drinking tea in a middle-class home. The husband sadistically kills his wife, and a few years later the "cursed" house is still for sale. A young couple and their cherubic daughter move in and start to restore her, but there are mysterious events that affect especially young Zofia. Her beloved cat is killed, and even her birthday party is ruined when one of the pipes of the house suddenly splashes blood on the guests (especially the chilling sequence!). Is the old house really haunted? And maybe seemingly helpful neighbors cause the whole horror? The answers to these questions are in the original and quite unpredictable climax, and at the very end there is even room for a real shock. The tension is masterfully expanded, and the title house is filled with amazing scenery, like a pair of rusty machetes used by her husband to kill her wife. A small warning, a sequence with a cat is difficult to watch when you are an animal lover. In conclusion, another winner of the short television series Hammer!
