It seems that even the director does not like this film, but for me I think that it is a bit harsh for himself. <br /> <br /> Of course it's not perfect, but there are some atmospheric shots, and the story is good enough to interest you. <br /> <br /> It's shot in a pretty village that adds atmosphere. <br /> <br /> If you like horror movies in England, give me a break. <br /> <br /> I just saw the trailer of the director's latest movie, The Devil's Chair, which looks quite amazing. <br /> <br /> There are not enough English horror movies for me, so everyone who comes, deserves our attention, and this one is not as bad as it might seem
