9/11 is a classic example of verite cinema, a kind of realistic documentary, in this case New York firefighters fighting against one of the most amazing events in world history. These are all small, discreet, hand-held video cameras, often betrayed by the poor quality of most photos (and by the director, Naudet's hand often wiping the screen). <br /> <br /> In this movie, you get to know the majority of firefighters - Tony Benatatos, a rookie (or "cat" in a New York firefighter), fire chief Joseph Pfeiffer (who later lost his brother) and a few others. Throughout the film, interviews are conducted with most of these people to emphasize the personal, reflective nature of events. The development is quite dramatic and well made, especially the parting ceremony in the Fire Department, with a few useful scoops and some kind of dialectical edition of quite limited film work (as Rob Reiner has a few good men). Tony looks proud. <br /> <br /> Point of view and camera angle usually come from firefighters, which is interesting and there are some excellent materials from the WTC1 lobby, while Pfeiffer and his team are planning what to do next - this is a classic verite cinema. There is also a strange, haunted sound from time to time of a human body hitting a portico outside. That's when the more and more deserted head of the fire brigade Pfeiffer realizes that his task is desperate and probably hopeless - before WTC2 collapses. We must admit Naudet for knowing which faces are filmed and at what moment. <br /> <br /> The sound of the neighboring WTC2 collapse is so terribly sad, overwhelming and frightening that you realize how hard this firefighters try. From the lobby it looks, feels and sounds like the end of the world, and the poor firefighters look so completely stunned and terrified. You hear a huge rumble, a trembling vortex - like a gigantic monolithic beast slowly falling to the ground after a fatal wounding - the neighboring tower has collapsed, but the firemen remaining in WTC1 are unaware of this event. Where is communication? <br /> <br /> This video is captivating, but the narrative is amateurish and should have been avoided - tips like "it really was like no other day" or often banal Naudet statements like "you can see the fear in everyone's eyes" and "I knew Tony was crazy"! The film is really one long video diary. There are no photos from the upper building where the firefighters are. Imagine that this video mixes with CCTV footage from some of the rooms above or some of the news from that day. The effect would be bigger. You can even combine this story with the story of Mayor Giuliani and, perhaps, the famous Cornish Rick Riscorl, who was literally on many floors, playing the hero. <br /> <br /> I do not see much of the film propaganda element in it, as suggested by some reviewers. This film is not the Triumph of Riefenstahl's will. Some time later, firefighters stack an American flag over a nearby surviving building with a view of what has become the Zero Zone. So what? <br /> <br /> There are also moments of doubtful cameras; for example, who is holding the camera when the two Naudet brothers are reunited in the fire station? Is it staged? <br /> <br /> A perfect finish, very well in the tradition of the great French director Alain Resnais (Hiroshima mon amour), with two stripes of light reflected in the water, shimmering.
