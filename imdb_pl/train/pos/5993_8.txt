The Cure uses the voice to create an intense mood. Although VO is responsible for all movie lines, he does not take off from visual history. The use of many film materials adds texture to the story. Choosing a combination of color and color worked well to increase jumps over time. The ending will make you jump, even though you will be able to predict the result. I especially liked the thrill of film tension. Close-ups for the love scene are also beautiful and reflect a tasteful eye. The song is quite short, but very much. A powerful edition really helps to show what a short film can do. It's worth watching more than once!
