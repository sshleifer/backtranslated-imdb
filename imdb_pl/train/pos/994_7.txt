I watched the movie once and I can watch it again, but although Jamie Foxx is good in the movie, I feel that they could have used the "less fun" character as Alvin Sanders. Foxx scenes, for example, in the prison where Edgar Clenteen meets (David Morse), are too funny. David Morse is again a great portraitist of a policeman. Its hard, but mostly quiet functions are perfect for its role. Once again, Morse meets Doug Hutchinson (Bristol) in the theater. Morse ends hard at Hutchinson. Both are perfect for this scenario in every movie. Personally, I love the quality of the movie, in which the actors get into the same situation as the previous movie, as they did in The Green Mile. Overall, it was a pretty good movie.
