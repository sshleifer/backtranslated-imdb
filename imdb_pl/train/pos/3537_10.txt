This James Bond game is the best bond game I've played in my life. This is my favorite James Bond game because: <br /> <br /> The missions in this game are really fun, can be really hard, which makes more fun while playing missions has many actions, the weapons of which is really good. The cars in this game are amazing, the car missions have lots of action and are really fun. The voice over the actors is really good and good that Sean Connery makes a voice to James Bond, and the way the bonds look like is really cool because it looks like Sean Connery when he played James Bond in movies and the other looks pretty not bad. just like in the movie. The graphics are pretty good in this James Bond game. Also, the game follows the movie in principle, but not entirely, but in most cases it is fun. <br /> <br /> overall score ********** with ***** *****
