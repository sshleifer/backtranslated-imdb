This film was rather a transition to masculinity for one gay and how he must deal with everyone. His mother is depressed, his younger sister is in pain, his older sister accepts a little. The relationship looks good with his boyfriend / exhooker and leaves the family to try and live with the first guy. Unfortunately, the new guy revolves around him and says that it really meant nothing. Our young homosexual hides and ends up in a looney bin to finally leave, throwing out her new lover and starting again. We stay with him, starting and watching, not participating in happiness. So maybe in the future it will be better for him. The ending was a bit lower, but the whole movie was completely realistic, so I will let this real end with a high rating.
