Fido is a story about well-behaved zombies who have been trained to serve the human race. Everything, however, falls apart when Fido's young zombie Timmy eats his neighbor's family. From that moment there is a disaster (well, maybe not a catastrophe, but to some extent chaos). Most people treat their zombies with integrity, and one such character sleeps with their zombies (a very funny part of the movie, if not also very disturbing). And we find a loving Fido, whatever he does. It's a very funny and unique movie, especially for the zombie genre. It is probably also one of the least brutal zombie movies (no negativity in this statement). I highly recommend it to people who are looking for something funny and different. I rate it 8/10. Rated R for zombie-related violence
