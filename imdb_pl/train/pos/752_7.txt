Four teenage girls in the suburbs of Los Angeles fall into all kinds of trouble: parties, drugs, cops, mixed parents, older boys. Jodie Foster, the kind of herd's mother, tries to keep everyone together like a "family" (like a family unit she never had), and the thrilling thing about the movie is that she can not. Slowly, everyone grows up and leaves. This precise feature point, though underlined throughout the text, is unfortunately manipulated. Did we really need a long sequence with Scott Baio, who was ahead of the car full of thugs on his skateboard? Or even a longer sequence - also from Baio - where Foster has a strange monologue about the "pain of illusion". Some dialogues are actually crazy, and I did not care too late for a movie that clumsily moves from death to marriage. But these are tricks in a very sensitive tale of losing a close bond. And Jodie's face speaks loudly at the end. If viewers choke at the end, the movie deserves it. He does not spill in tears or ask for compassion. He shows us an example of friendship and hope that we understand. *** with ****
