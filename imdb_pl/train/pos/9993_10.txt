The most fun and funny Brooks movie I've ever seen. I can watch and re-watch the tape 100 times. I was laughing and I was crying a little. It's a really good and fun movie, and if you like Brooks - that's a must! In a nutshell - Brooks (billionaire) goes out on the streets as a homeless person for 30 days to win the entire poor district with the whole competitor. Reality bites, but finally - it's about warm relationships between people ... I highly recommend!
