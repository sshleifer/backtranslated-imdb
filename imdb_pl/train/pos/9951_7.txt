If you've ever wondered why they do not make story-like porn, watch Dream Quest. On the one hand, you must give credit to Armstrong both for the effort put into using this idea and for using such a strong adult cast to put a strong name in it. On the other hand, it's fast to see why most porn movies never have more than 15 or 20 seconds of dialogue between sex scenes. These people simply can not act (and the story unfortunately is bad in a funny way). <br /> <br /> I still gave her 7, because it was a nice test and it did not seem like a lot of effort to shorten the corners. I would also like to see more such attempts. Maybe one day I'll see the perfect combination of porn and story.
