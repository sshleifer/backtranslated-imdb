Born Again the Limerick: <br /> <br /> If the man could get back from the dead <br /> <br /> I live in the little girl's head <br /> <br /> Zemsta on br /> <br /> For the murder he met. <br /> <br /> By the guy who is now in his wife's bed. <br /> <br /> For me, Born Again is a very underrated, classic episode, which is part of what I defined for X Files before I started watching them. I saw several segments before, when the show first appeared and I was too young to watch it, eg. In The Jersey Devil, but I remember very well watching this episode as an 11-year-old and absolutely terrified of the scene where the guy is choked by the bus and then the scene of hypnosis with a little girl. I'm telling you that I could not sleep for weeks! For this reason, the episode now has a special aura with a creep factor that has been enjoying me ever since. All I need to do is look at some of the obvious drawbacks of the story, such as why the girl had to wait until she was nine years old before her previous spirit of life really began to take revenge. Or what she did, accidentally sitting on the bus in the middle of the night. You'd think her parents would be upset. Or maybe they just do not see this part of the story. Was it with telekinesis? In addition to adding a really nice Carrie factor to a terrifying story, there really was not a good explanation. But even with his small flaws, in my opinion this is a classic episode and I do not have too many reasons to dislike it. 10 out of 10.
