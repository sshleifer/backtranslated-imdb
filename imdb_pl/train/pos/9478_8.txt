It is a nice little movie with a nice story that plays the most important role in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> This is quite an intriguing dramatic story in which romance is also present. The story is told slowly, but it works too well for its expansion. The characters are nice and nicely presented by the actors. Usually I'm not a big fan of Asian acting, but the acting in this movie was just good. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film differs in approach and style from other genre films produced in the west. In a sense, this film is already more advanced when it comes to approach than Western films made in the same age. <br /> <br /> I only regretted that the film would not be a bit better. In the case of a film that is considered a kind of movie from the house of art, this movie is definitely missing in good-looking sequences. It was obviously a fairly cheap movie, which was made quite generally. This does not mean that it is a bad thing, it just makes it impossible to distinguish this movie from the genre itself. <br /> <br /> Well, this movie is about a well-constructed story and characters that are. In this respect, this movie certainly does not disappoint. <br /> <br /> 8/10
