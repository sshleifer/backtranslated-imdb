Rock Star: INXS is the best TV show I've ever watched! He had some of the best rock'n'roll songs ever written by 15 very talented singers / performers. He also had (in my opinion) the most felt, well-being, surprises in the whole reality TV. It really caused me to pour tears of happiness for the winner !!! For 13 weeks of this TV competition, the audience became acquainted with all participants. After 30 episodes, the remaining players seemed to be more friends than just a few aliens competing in a reality show. And the fact that INXS was and is one of the biggest rock'n'roll bands, EVER just added to the emotional tension created by this amazing reality series. If you do not have a recorded series, ROCK STAR: INXS DVD is a great alternative.
