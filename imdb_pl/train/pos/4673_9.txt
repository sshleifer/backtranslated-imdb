One of the things that interested me the most in this movie is the way the characters and related stories are developed in flight. I suppose the writers wanted us to become interested in the characters, not forcing them to feed their characters. The premise for the use of art and craft in the design and construction of furniture was a unique theme and / or analogy to what families / siblings go through in their lives. The complexity of having a twin serves as a substitute father, and even the husband adds great tension to make this film emotionally interesting. In addition, although history was not the one that could directly relate to (eg, Jewish / twin / family), the themes are quite universal, because every family has a black sheep inside. It made it very engaging.
