I've shown this movie a few times here in college and every time I show it, the number of people watching me is growing exponentially ... except virgins, everyone I've already shown, NEEDS to see it again! It takes some time to get there, but at the end the whole room screams, screams, yells, scrolls through the scenes repeatedly, repeats the dialogue and is completely and completely absorbed by the film experience of Pia Zadora in "The Lonely Lady"! The scene after the scene of the most ineptly filmed, badly written, horribly played TRASH is thrown at you in an attack, which is among the most severe things I have (no words, friends). For me nothing compares 2 U, Pia ... and I do not think I'm the only one who ever felt that way!
