This is one of the top five animated Disney features. Cinderella was a perfect return to full-length animated film (as opposed to compilation movies from the 1940s), and the expensive depth with a multi-faceted camera returns to the film in no other way. Although Disney adapts the story slightly more freely, you collect the idea of ​​the era through a dress and stylizations of sets --- a clear period of time in which history takes place. <br /> <br /> Cinderella is more mature than Snow White and multidimensional character. Actually, all the characters are a bit well developed, except for the prince - the most flat - we know that he has a sense of humor and a great smile, but that's all. Like Snow White, Disney has some lasting influence on the history of popular culture --- in most versions of Cinderella, half-sisters are attractive, just not as nice as Cinderella, and their character deprives them of their nice appearance. > <br /> Disney's favorite additions: mice! I also appreciate the continuity - Cinderella always loses shoes throughout the film. The addition of a home dress, as well as the following half-sister robbery, has always been terrifying as a child - I remember seeing the Master showing it with a black background and a big red light on it! A broken slipper shows the unwillingness of the evil Lady Tremaine to give up her authority over Cinderella and admit defeat --- Audley will go on to characterize the most wicked of all Disney villains, the evil sorcerer Maleficent, in The Sleeping Beauty.
