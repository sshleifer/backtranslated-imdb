While the "special effects" and technical features of this film may be funny to some people, I have never been able to erase the images that this film engraved on my young and sensitive mind when I first saw him about 8 years old. The story of the survival of this girl and the trials she survived has remained with me all these years, and I have repeatedly thought about how the girl escaped from situations far beyond anything I had seen. <br /> <br /> The fact that this is a real story, and the fact that I was the first child when I first saw it, may be the reason for my high evaluation of this film. Every time this movie was broadcast on television in the '70s and' 80s, I would be attached to television, drinking in every scene with interest that I can not explain. I suppose I see it for the first time as an adult (and with a weary view of the world) it may not be as pleasant for some. Actually, I did everything to get a copy, so I could show this movie to my son. <br /> <br /> This, like many other movies, is not for everyone. If you are impressed by the amazing stories of people's lives, you are biased towards Peru / Macchu Picchu and / or Amazons, I believe that you may like this movie the same as it has been for the last 30 years.
