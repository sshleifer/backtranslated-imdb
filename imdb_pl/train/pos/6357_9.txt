I found this very funny movie for young children, who is more oriented towards adults with lots of jokes and humor that only they will understand. A few things are unsuitable for kids, but only a few. Othewise "The Grinch" (Jim Carrey) breaks down so many jokes that you can not keep up with them all, from sex to culture and insider-Hollywood to racial. looks great on DVD. The little girl here, "Cindy Lou Who" (Taylor Momsen) is really cute, and the costumes and hairstyles of little people here are fun. The voice of Anthony Hopkins is also pleasant, so having his narrative further raises the film. His rhymes are pleasant to listen to. <br /> <br /> I saw it in the theater, although it was "fair", but the DVD was much better. I saw it three times and it was better every time.
