What's really sad, programs like Six Degree's and Brothers & Sisters are real television reality, not junk, which are nothing more than glorified quiz shows. It seems to me that dissatisfaction from scratch has existed for several years with very premature cancellation of numerous concerts with worship. But thanks to the more loud reactions of Jericho fans (which I also like) and other performances, networks can start to reverse this trend. I am like the others, I will not support any new concerts until they get the second season. Then we'll decide to watch and catch up on the DVD and watch online. Until then, ABC has lost me as a viewer of EVERY new program.
