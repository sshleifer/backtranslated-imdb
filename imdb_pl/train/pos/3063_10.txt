The first director (Bromell) collected a small but powerful cast to look at the world of middle age, middle class, depressed man and his struggle with relationships with his father. This film in less than 90 minutes presents a very interesting contrast in human nature. David Dorfman as the 6-year-old son of William H. Macy is the most refreshing little actor I've seen in a while. Macy's genius in the part that seems to be written for him as a lonely torture trying to break the father's and company's reins. It is always great to see Donald Sutherland and here he is wonderful as Macy's soulless father. The alternative soundtrack of movies is worth hearing as the director explains how he chose the cast, locations and made the movie. The basic sound of the dolby 2 channel is suitable for this movie and well recorded. Pictures create a mood along with a very subtle musical background. Any film lover or observer of human nature will be happy about it, especially if it is a fan of contradictions.
