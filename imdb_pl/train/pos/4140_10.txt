What an amazingly funny and original performance. The cast that starts with the hysterical Julie Brown (Homecoming Queen's Got A Gun) is just perfect. Add Amy Hill (All American Girl-Grandma Kim), who plays a lesbian who always argues with her partner and business partner (Asian restaurant-WOK-DON "T RUN"). I used to laugh more during this concert than any other, ever I've seen (including Newhart - one of my favorite shows) If you like movies like Naked Gun and Airplane - you'll love this series! One of the best moments of the series is the game itself Cindy Williams. cleaning lady, Tammy finds a photo of Cindy Williams in her coat. The picture shows Cindy Williams doing an unspoken act with a bowling upside down. It's amazing to see an actress like Cindy Williams, who is able to play that way. opera as with many unexpected twists in a short run. I can only hope that one day it will be released on a DVD with special bonus features. The funniest series I have ever seen !!!!
