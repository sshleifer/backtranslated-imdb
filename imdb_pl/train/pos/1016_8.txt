I would give this otherwise awesome series a full 10 votes if Claudia Black did not continue! Her inclusion as a stupid "Vela" lowered the series. Bringing her to regularity at the same time as joining Ben Browder to replace the RDA was a mistake. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we just lost control over "Jack" and we really did not need this amazing series turned into new episodes of "Farscape". <br /> <br /> I was a big fan of the movie "Stargate," and when the series was first announced, I had reservations that it could meet the film, but after watching the first episode I have to admit that I was addicted. I always eagerly awaited new episodes
