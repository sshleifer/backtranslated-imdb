What was around 1939, which helped produce so many excellent Hollywood movies? Whatever it was, the magic can also be found in this Columbia photo. It's a long-forgotten comedy of a screwdriver that Turner Classic Movies started showing. (Maltin's movie book does not contain it.) In almost every section of the Amazing Mr. Williams is a jewel. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a first-rate police detective who will never find time to marry the intended. When the wedding bells are to ring, he is called to the place of murder. This woman must learn on her own, not only to enjoy the pursuit of criminals, but also to belong to the police. There is a lot of laughter in this process. <br /> <br /> Melvyn Douglas once again proved that he has very few peers in a light comedy. Joan Blondell was at the peak of her career and is a joy. Edward Brophy and Donald McBride are funny. <br /> <br /> The movie takes a bit too long, but who cares? Screw comedies are always able to entertain, and this movie belongs to the best.
