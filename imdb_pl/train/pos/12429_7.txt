David Duchovny plays the lead role in this film. Now many people are discovering that this fact does not bother even in watching this. Very unfair, to say the least. Dr. Eugene Sands (Duchovny) is a drug addict who has been convicted for misconduct. By an ordinary accident, he becomes a private doctor of the criminal millionaire Raymond Blossom. Angelina Jolie is cast as a supporting minor clare gangster. Timothy Hutton playing Blossom is wonderful and immersed deeply in his character. Duchovny himself is not as bad as many people would think, and in the end I would evaluate his performance as credible. His familiar monotonous sound and simple face are present, but they do not underestimate the film
