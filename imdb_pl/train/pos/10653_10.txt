I know it's fashionable now to hate this movie. I've seen hundreds of movies, including the original Haunting from 1963, and most of Hammer movies. This film is not restrained and does not stop it at all, probably because many contemporary viewers did not like it. However, many viewers can accept uncontrolled movies, such as Scream, because for most people it is easier to believe killer knives than demons and ghosts. In fact, this movie had many great scenes, and the special and special effects were great. I've seen it 15 times and it gets better every time. The director of this film made many interesting and stylish films and did not try to realize the sixth sense. Haunting lets go and it's certainly not boring. Maybe this movie will appeal to John Carpenter fans, but more traditional plot structure. Stary Haunting was also a great film from 1963. He was even more frightening. See both the House of the Innocents and the Legend of Hell with Pamela Franklin.
