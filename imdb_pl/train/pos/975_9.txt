Also known as the War of the Great Creature. The Great Yokai War is Miike's rehearsal in a family movie and a damned good job. The problem is that I can not imagine many parents who would like to submit their children to this film. The best films for children are those that are scary or have a slightly disturbing image, "Neverending Story" and "Return to Oz" come to mind, but in the case of Great Yokai War, Miike probably takes a bit too far. In fact, at the show I was at the person who presented the film repeated there to two families that probably was not appropriate. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the young character of the song, who presents himself and explains his current family problems. This brief moment of mundaneness is rapidly broken, because the cow gives birth to a calf with the face of a man who screams that something terrible is coming before it is dead as an abomination (it is quite possible that the abomination of creation itself is some quaint tribute to Quato). <br /> <br /> After an amazing introduction for the main baddad Kato and his protege, Aga (surprisingly attractive Chiaki Kuriyami), by way of apocalyptic raising of the army. History returns to normal for a while, but it does not last long before all logic flows down and young boys will join with the group rejected by Miyazaki to remove the evil wizard. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is quite simple and sometimes surprisingly well-worn, the entire selected film seems completely out of place in a film that regularly breaks stereotypes, but is supported by a simple, inspiring vision of the magical world. This is really Miyazaki's film shot in a live action movie, albeit much more exaggerated and more mischievous than Miyazaki's usual film. <br /> <br /> The film is just a joy to look at Yokai projects is colorful, and largely practical, while evil monstrous robots, not displaying the best CGI in the world, have practicality and danger for them, which gives them much more a tangible threat than one would have imagined. <br /> <br /> The cast is evenly perfect, it just makes their characters seem completely natural, which is commendable if you take into account that most of them are in makeup for the whole body or in latex suits . Even Aga with an absurd beehive turns out to be stifling and deadly thanks to the surprisingly excellent Kuriyami game. <br /> <br /> While the movie has many elements that write it strongly in the area of ​​the family movie; cute creatures, younger heroes, a completely evil villain, a sense of mischief and adventures, and an eloquent lack of violence. There are elements that make you wonder if Miike should have directed such a movie. <br /> <br /> The robot army is a truly terrifying threat to everyday objects in monstrous beasts that look like T-101 skinless and with added chainsaws. These beasts are tearing figures into pieces; suck the creatures into their bloodstained mouths and kidnap children from their homes, moving them straight from the parent's nose before giving up to the little patrician. <br /> <br /> Creation is equally onerous for young minds. The Yokai, basically heroes, are fed by a gigantic stove full of a fluidized form of hatred that destroys the body of Yokai and forces their rabid souls to possess metal lumps. If the kids seemed to think Anakin was angry, wait until they saw a hedgehog the size of a man burning to death in a vat of molten hate for a minute before he became an abomination of a motorcycle. There is also cutting the limbs, in one case the severed hand trembles in front of the camera dripping blood, a large amount of sexual energy (Aga wears one dress designed specifically for the fans' service and it seems that she has only sleeping with Kato as a motivation, while Princess of the Rivers wears almost nothing and grabs her thighs groping the young hero in a few scenes), and the general humor that will go over the heads of those for whom this technology marvel was clearly intended. <br /> <br /> Spoilers The example of this is that the Yokai are only interested in the final battle when they think it is a big party. Another battle more festival than anything else, along with beer, surfing in the crowd and a match. Also the scene in which Aga beats a tar from a beautiful furry creature seems to be meant for masses tired of pokemon. <br /> <br /> End of Spoilers At the end of the day, the Great War of Yokai is easier. Stronger the latest Miike movies. Although he lacks the perverse charm of Gozu's or Ichi's novel, it simply constantly pushes the audience through the general madness. In fact, this is undoubtedly the most insane movie Miike, because it so overwhelmingly embraces the magic of the subject. <br /> <br /> It's worth to watch it only for Gogo's occasional flash.
