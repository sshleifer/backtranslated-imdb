Although at some point I thought it would turn into a Graduate, I must say that Mother does a great job explaining the sexual desires of an older woman. <br /> <br /> I'm glad it's a British movie, because Hollywood would never do it, and even if it did, it would ruin it without spending time developing characters. <br /> <br /> The story reveals itself slowly and realistically. Acting is great, characters are trustworthy and dialogue is sensitive. I've tried many times to predict what's going to happen, and I've always been wrong, so I was very intrigued by history. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. And I must admit that I will look at my mother forever in a different light!
