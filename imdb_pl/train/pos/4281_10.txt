One of my favorite "home movies". I do not know if there is a person in our country who has not seen this movie! It's funny and sad at some moments ... I do not know how people around the world (who have had the opportunity to see it) accept this film because you need to know a few moments in our Serbian history and the Serbs in the first half of the twentieth century to be able to understand! But as I can see, there's someone from Canada who saw him ... and he liked it. <br /> <br /> I think I will try to put all the good quotes from the movie on this page, but first to find out how to do it ... <br /> <br /> Regards.
