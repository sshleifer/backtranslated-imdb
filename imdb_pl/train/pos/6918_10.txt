A very nice movie in which characters appear that do bad things and which pass emotions like anger and the desire for revenge. The cast is very good, there are lots of action, and Stewart finally gets a girlfriend and revenge (with a surprise). I've seen this movie several times and always watch when it's on AMC or cable. Highly recommended ...
