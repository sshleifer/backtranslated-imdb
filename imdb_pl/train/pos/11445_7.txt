The new way of enjoying Goldsworthy's work, Rivers and Tides, allows fans to see his work moving. Watching how Goldsworthy builds his pieces, recognition for every stone, leaf and thorn he uses. Goldsworthy describes how the flow of life, rivers and tides inspires and influences his work. Although I was happy that the film covered most of Goldsworthy's songs (without snowballs), I feel that it was a bit long. The creators of the film did a great job, restoring Goldsworthy to life, and created a beautiful movie that was a joy to watch.
