Peter Bogdonavich made a handful of really great movies, and EVERYTHING is all one of his best. The cast could not have been better prepared for playing this light, but slightly sweet-bitter comedy. Interestingly, the witty, light touch that Bogdonavich uses so easily gives the film a rather disarming emotional core. A fresh and immediate movie starts without any explanation. There is no music to the soundtrack that would point us out. We meet the heroes in action, and when Bogdonavich glided through the streets of New York, the film develops effortlessly. Robby Muller's camera captures all of this with restrained simplicity that seems random, but it certainly is not. The cast is great. A classic in every respect.
