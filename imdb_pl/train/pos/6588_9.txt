After watching several episodes of this series, I came to the conclusion that TV producers are completely devoid of any form of originality. This is an old science fiction standby mode, ingeniously packed in a truly original idea - and they can still - almost - make it work. <br /> <br /> The dialog is good! Male actors are quite proficient in their competitions. Most of the characters are well drawn, with particular respect for the hero and his more than a nice kick from the side. And most episodes of the episodes seem to be tasty. So what could be wrong? And what about female characters and cosmetically perfect actresses that are chosen to present them. <br /> <br /> Manufacturers insist on presenting female characters in this - almost good - series, in a way that makes the final product appear to be a badly placed cheerleader. Why, I ask why? <br /> <br /> All episodes are flat when a feminine guest star or a returning character appears on the screen. All these actresses are completely unreliable in their roles, and you do not have to see them to know that they are not able to do their job. A blind person could say that. Just listen to their conversation. They provide their dialogue with all the drama and the effect of the 16-year-old at the gymnasium ball. Who would have believed that these women are PhD students, senators, corporate directors and doctors? <br /> <br /> In shells, if the producers have a choice of Stockard Channing or Morgan Fairchild, guess who they will choose - every time? Of course, the series suffers from this. Detriment!
