It's great, but it's hard to find a trippy spy thriller from World War I in a unique 60's style. From the psychedelic introductory graphics and the great score of Ennio Morricone to the lesbian love scene with Capucine and intricately produced apocalyptic scenes of land battles with poisonous gas and German cavalry in a full gas assault equipment that can not be missed. It is a film that captures the horror and cruelty of war and the ruthlessness of players on the battlefield and beyond. In addition to battle scenes, part of the production and special effects are primitive, apparently because most of the budget for this movie has been saved on the battle scenes, but for lovers of cinema in the 60s this should not be a problem. I saw this movie on TV for the first time many years ago and I had foresight to record it on VHS. I still have the tape and I like to watch it from time to time.
