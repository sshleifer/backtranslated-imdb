Usually it was the advice of producer Alexander Korda regarding the set for many of his subordinates; the film is attributed to three directors, but in fact Alex, Zoltan Korda and William Cameron Menzies helped, pushing him to six. <br /> <br /> For the 1987 book by John Kobal, "The Top 100 Movies", his survey of 81 film critics saw the Thief from Baghdad in the 55th place. Closer examination reveals that Jose Luis Guarner himself, John Russell Taylor and the Cobal himself actually voted for the photo, but their high places were enough to get closer to the middle of the road. <br /> <br /> The outbreak of the Second World War caused the film production to shift after England and America, eventually ending in 1940 and winning three technical Oscars. Like Citizen Kane, it is in a sense a movie that you can admire and not love. <br /> <br /> The special effects, great for now, are still sensible and can withstand if you squint your eyes. But it's not so much their effectiveness as the boldness of inventions. Among them is a funny horse, constructed from a set model, which, after inserting the key to the rear end, begins to fly. There is also a killer toy of the six-armed goddess Kali (perhaps of course one woman with two women sitting behind her) and a pretty terrifying giant spider. The climax with a great flying carpet is also impressive. But the most memorable must be the performance of Rex Ingrama as a wonderful moment of cinematic conceit, gin (gin) with a height of almost a thousand feet! Ingram depicts a genie as a dangerous creature and adds an element of danger to the proceedings. And pay attention to the moment in which he was deceived into his bottle! <br /> <br /> John Justin is doing well as an Arabian who, for some strange reason, has an English accent and a stiff upper lip. Sabu, a surprisingly muscular 15-year-old, is almost the name of Abu, a supposedly conceited thief. After they cross with the evil Jaffer (Conrad Veidt), Justin becomes blind and Abu is turned into a dog. When it seems that the rest of the film will be told in a retrospective through the blind perspective of Ahmed (Justin), it turns out that in the middle of the movie we play out the present and the adventure continues. The truth is that the other half is somehow better, full of bigger incidents and more fantastic nature. <br /> <br /> Three small songs are fucking a song, but because the movie lasts 100 minutes, it seems more of a mild aroma, not a real ingredient; I would not classify it as a musical. It's great fun; Justin and June Duprez are interested in love for mothers and fathers, Veidt is a villain and Abu is a young, unrestrained thief. It may take some time before we get into the somewhat outdated way of thinking and the exaggerated melodrama of English films from the 1940s, but once you sit for the first half hour, this movie will really draw you in. Quite praiseworthy.
