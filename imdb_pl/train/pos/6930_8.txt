It is quite unusual and unique small western, which is mostly original because of its history, which revolves around the unique and excellent Winchester 1873 rifle and all those who can put it in one place or another in the film. > <br /> It's a very funny movie to watch, but it's not a real western either. The film was made in the style of the 1940's / 50's typical for the western film genre, so fans of this genre should not be excluded by its somewhat unusual main premise. <br /> <br /> Since the rifle is actually the main plot of the film, it allows the stories to follow many characters throughout the film, who are of course connected, and the story finally staggers. Without this, this movie would be quite messy to watch, because history often jumps from one dangerous occasion to another, with still various characters. It's amazing how even they managed to put Wyatt Earp in it all. But this is not really a criticism. I liked the fact that the film and its history were original and how the film seemed to move from one event to another. This gave the film a little adventure and entertainment. <br /> <br /> It's also a really great-looking movie. I liked the settings used in the movie and it seems quite amazing that it was the first western western director Anthony Mann. Fortunately, he will later direct more westerns, which often meant James Stewart on the lead role. <br /> <br /> It was quite a bold choice to choose James Stewart as the lead leader. He is one of the gentlest and most polite actors, so throwing him as a tough gunsman seems a bit strange. But Stewart is surprisingly convincing as a tough guy and shows how versatile and really capable an actor was. <br /> <br /> There are also some surprising actors in the film who are often not associated with this genre. Shelley Winters plays the lead female role, and later renowned actors Rock Hudson and Tony Curtis appear in small roles. <br /> <br /> A real western with lots of action and entertainment. <br /> <br /> 8/10
