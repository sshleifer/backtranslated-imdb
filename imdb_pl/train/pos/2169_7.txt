OK, first and foremost ignore the last person's review. They admit that they fell asleep, so it's no wonder they did not understand what was going on !!! Because thriller / horror are coming, this movie is not so bad, it is certainly very visible. Beginning with the initial scenes, you have a general idea of ​​what will be the cause of all the madness that will happen, and in the end it turns out that you are right, everything is clear. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie was sometimes very strange, and because old movies were spinning, it was pretty good. Great to watch late at night! I give him generous 7 out of 10.
