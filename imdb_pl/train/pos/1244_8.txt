I saw this movie on TV for the first time a few years ago and I honestly loved it. Charles Dance makes one of the most terrifying villains imaginable. His sophistication is such a perfect contrast with a primitively good hero. I've never been too fan of Eddie Murphy, but his annoying portrait here is the winner: a bit "Axel Foley Through the Looking Glass." Charlotte Lewis is to use a sophisticated phrase, but the only one possible to apply, brightly wonderful. Some scenes are wonderfully created: a sequence of dreams, a bird, stupid fight scenes and a climactic confrontation. Through it all, Murphy is a modern man who suddenly fell into the oriental myth, a stunned and quieter version of Kurt Russell in his oriental fantasy. Just like in this film, we have James Hong, an incomparable actor whose scenes, though short, raise the quality of even Derek. From 1955, Hong defines an excellent supporting actor, a "class act" of his profession. The "golden child" is stupid; it is not perfect; but it has so many functions of redemption that it is a pleasant and fun fantasy, worth watching. After four years, I saw "Golden Child" again; I liked it even more! It's really great fun.
