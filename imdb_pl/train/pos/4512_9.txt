I saw this movie today and I have to say that it was much better than I expected it would be a few hours before watching it. Personally, I had some prejudices about language, but that completely changed my idea. The film was in most cases surprisingly good in the case of large acting and acting performances. It was a story about a boy who had a dream and did everything to achieve it. It really moved me and as a film based on a real story convinced me. A new school, a psychologist, a director and a young boy, known to a new teacher, a little different than others and fighting for things, even if they do not seem to work. He showed how few things can cause huge changes in many things and how the difference can sometimes lead to difficult situations. I also think that the selection of actors has been successful. I really felt like you were someone watching episodes as an outsider when it happened. Before I spoil the film with praise, I must admit that there were certain things and situations that did not look realistic and were not realistic ... as when the headmaster defeated Frits alias. Martin in front of the class, at the end of the movie. She was really seriously beaten, but the only thing that caused him was nasal blood when comparing it with the first hit at the beginning, when Frits got a few stitches ... or if every movie has its flaws ... I have to say that if ever Somewhere I find this DVD from the store, I will definitely take it with me.
