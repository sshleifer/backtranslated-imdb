Sarah Silverman's program is very similar to Sarah's own position; It's exaggerated with prejudices that you can not take it to heart. The fact is, though most people will "get it", it does not mean that everyone will appreciate it. It's a very polarizing and one-dimensional program, so if you do not like it after 10 minutes, you might as well give up. If you like it after 10 minutes, stay tuned because every previous episode was as good as the previous one. <br /> <br /> However, like all shows, it's not perfect. Personally, I love this program, but there are huge bugs in it. Racist songs are fun, but they age much more quickly than Silverman seems to realize - a problem I had with "Jesus is Magic". It seems that Silverman has given himself a limit for songs for an episode that does not have to exist. Not to mention that although the lyrics of the songs he writes are good, music, well, it is not. <br /> <br /> Keep in mind that although this program will, for some reason, please Monty Python fans, Upright Citizens' Brigades, etc., it's not like these shows. I can watch Monty Python all day, but how much I like this program, I can not watch more than half an hour at a time. It gets flat quickly. The value of the repetition of this program is also low - the second time around the episode is quite funny, and for the third time, in my opinion, it is boring. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the first time is very, very funny. Try it.
