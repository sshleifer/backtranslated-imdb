let me say that I love Adam Sandler, watching his control over me, I paid close attention to his acting <br /> <br /> when he raises his voice, I can not help but think about a happy gilmore shouting at a golf ball, then I come back when Adam Sandler pulls me in <br /> <br /> Reign over Me is a great movie, a movie that starts slowly with anticipation of emotions in every scene <br /> <br /> Don Cheadle always does a great job and it is no exception with some really great lines and deserves an Oscar in every movie that makes <br /> <br /> adam sandler was amazing in so many ways, not only was it his most dramatic / best movie of his career. but I remember the loud laugh in many parts of this movie <br /> <br /> The cast was great also with Saffron Burroughs and Jada Pinkett Smith <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. wonderful acting beautiful shots of a great comedy from New York a great drama and a new respect for Adam Sandler if you ever doubted him or assured you that he was great Don Cheadle
