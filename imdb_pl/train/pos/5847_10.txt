Although this series lasted only one season, she stayed with me for 20 years. It was definitely my favorite cartoon. I would give almost anything to have it on DVD or in whatever format I can get. If you find any ways to view this series, I suggest that you take full advantage of it. This series was the first (in my opinion) that had a really coherent story that included many episodes. It made me really care about the heroes and what happened to them. Heck, that the character of Goose really scared me. At the time, he was just so strange. Also, the group leader reminds me of the combination of Clint Eastwood / Tommy Lee Jones. If anyone has any way to contact the creator / rights holder of the series and can get them on DVD, please, let him do it !!!
