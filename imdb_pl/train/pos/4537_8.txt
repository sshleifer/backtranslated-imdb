I saw the BBC movie for the first time on July 27, 2005. For me it was a good interpretation of the person of Conan Doyle and I really wonder what the slocker fan thinks about it. I also think it is a movie for these fans, whether they agree or not, what was mentioned. You may ask yourself if A. Doyle is a strong person or has he questioned you. He was, however, the creator of the famous Holmes, but how much of it was a kind of semi-biography? No less seriously, I moved this adaptation forward, it is a movie that you have to see - even if you are not interested in Sherlock Holmes' movies or books - look, have fun and have your own opinion about it.
