I think that every time I see one of those old films from the 80's, I bring it back to me for a simpler time, no matter how bizarre it may seem today. This movie is good. I remember seeing it as a small child and I think it's the best movie ever. He has all the heroic characters the young cowboy wants to be. Now, as an adult, I can look back and laugh and still feel sad, but this time I really know what's going on. I found one strange thing. How many people can move to Houston and connect with Sissy, get married, move to a trailer, fall, cheat, die an uncle, then come back together, all within a month? Only in America.
