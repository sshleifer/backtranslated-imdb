The radio that I grew up in England in the thirties was not a 24-hour 7-day week, so the Hour for Children was a feast for me when we had batteries and a battery to save. A few programs I heard have made a great impression on my young mind, and the three I remember are "Toytown", one about all the animals in the Zoo and --- Gray Owl, talking about animals he knew who he called "brothers". Only recently did I learn that Gray Owl is not a real "Indian", but the tribute made by the head of Sioux makes sense to me, "Man becomes what he dreams about." Could we all dream of a changing and beneficial world like Archie Gray Owl Belaney. Can the new Gray Owl influence global leaders to clean the environment.
