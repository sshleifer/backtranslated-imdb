Eva (Hedy Lamarr) just married an elderly man and, during the honeymoon, realizes that her husband does not want her. Her disappointment with marriage and the lack of love makes Eva go back to her father's house on the farm, leaving her husband behind. One afternoon, while swimming in the lake, her horse escapes with clothes, and a young worker recovers and gives them to Eva. They fall in love and become lovers. Later her husband longs for her and tries to make Eva come home. Eva refuses, and happiness leads the trio in the same place, ending the romance in a tragic way. For the first time I watched the film "Extase" and the first note I have, relates to the horrible quality of VHS released in Brazil by the Brazilian distributor Video Network: the film has only 75 minutes of action time used different rolls of film. Some parts are completely damaged and others are very damaged. Therefore, the beauty of the photos was not achieved by the Brazilian viewer if he has a chance to find this rare VHS in a rental or for sale. The film is practically a silent movie, the story is very outdated and contains only a few lines. As a consequence, the characters are poorly developed. However, this film is also very bold, with the exposure of Hedy Lamarr's beautiful breasts and naked fat body for the current standards of beauty. Another fantastic point is the poetic and metaphorical use of flowers, symbolizing the relationship between Eva and her lover. The way the director runs the scenes to show Eva's needs and deprivation is very clear. The inconclusive end is also very unusual for the 1933 film. I liked the movie, but I hope one day you can see the restored version of 87 minutes. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Â¶xtase" ("Ecstasy")
