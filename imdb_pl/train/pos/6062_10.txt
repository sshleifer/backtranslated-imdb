Only the chosen ones will appreciate the quality of the story and the character of this film. Higher ancients who live in the lands of knowledge far beyond the minds of the average human creation. This film draws the adventure genre into a unique centrifugal magical power of fantasy to the mystical crystals of the goblet. Stories come and go, but the idea for a good story is positive thinking, not negative thinking. To create a good and bad fight like never before. Embracing a frightening, shiny process that keeps the imagination in one dimension and the other. A blow to a quick flash of energy that takes a person to another world.
