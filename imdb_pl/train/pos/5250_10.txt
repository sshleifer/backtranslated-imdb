The world consists of two different types of film-lovers ... There are types of "English patient" that can not get bored, to enjoy something that is not high enough to be shown on PBS, and there are "Types of Happy Gilmore, for which one and a half hour of genital games are definitely worth $ 7. <br /> <br /> There are certainly a lot of gray areas, but you know which side you are leaning on. If you're an English patient, save time, save money and save us all "Oh, this movie is so childish and stupid". I know that you like to minimize every movie you do not like and every person who likes it, but maybe you could refrain from doing it only once. <br /> <br /> But if you're the type of Happy Gilmore. .. go see this ... You'll find it's fun. Tim Meadows has created a funny character, and Will Farrell is still fun in almost everything he does. Go check it out. You'll be glad you did it. And that's fine.
