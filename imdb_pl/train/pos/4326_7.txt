I can not tell you exactly how a movie follows a novel, never reading a book, but because these clocks last about six and a half hours, it's good to assume that most of the base is covered, or at least we can say with certainty that it's not condensed Reader's Digest version. <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are high, to the standards of other classic BBC series, such as Inspector Morse and Sherlock Holmes. We can believe that London Dickens looked, sounded and thought so much. From time to time there are minor accidents - an athlete shooting a pistol with a drum cap in 1840 or 1820 or whenever it happened. <br /> <br /> Acting should also be praised. Suzanne Burden is a polite and honest heroine who quietly does well. She is also adorable, in a mature way, her beauty in her compassionate nature is not in any flirtation. Denholm Elliott is her guardian (and what's more, as it turns out). Burden and Elliott are two of the few characters who are good in undisturbed ways. Another is a former sergeant forced to do evil by bad people. Another is a poor and helpless young boy. <br /> <br /> I do not think anyone else can write it. He has all the characters of Dickens - poverty, tragic deaths, capitalism raw, generous rich guy in a closed house, hidden origin, dark motives, impotence or even the malice of the justice system. Well, not the justice system as a whole, but the law office, which apparently was the court that decided about matters related to the distribution of property. (So ​​I am collecting from Wikipedia.) It became so stiff and dilatation that it was thoroughly rebuilt in England in 1973. Twice, the character of Elliott describes it as a "curse". The most impressive scene is a money-consuming creditor pursuing a retired soldier in his junior high school during a fencing lesson. The sergeant is more masculine in the traditional sense than any other masculine character I remember from Dickens. An apoplexy lender and tenant screams from his threats, and the sergeant turns to him and performs a gentle saber exercise on the other, and every progress brings him closer to the tormentor, while the old scarlet-face creditor shrinks back. <br /> <br /> There are a few things missing. Often Dickens will stick to at least one or two funny dialogue lines. ("Humbug!" Or "The law is a ass.") Not here. "Bleak" house is the right title. Secondly, there are practically no Weberian "ideal types" - no lords of Micawbers, Artful Dodgers or Scroogs. Third, the atmosphere, the whole ethos is inexorably gloomy. One oppression accompanies the other, usually dealing with money or some shameful peccadillo from the past. <br /> <br /> My God, it's depressing. It's as if the author releases his spleen from everything he hated in a world he knew. Poverty, good. KNOW HIS. But you may wonder what the office did to Dickens to deserve this kind of treatment. <br /> <br /> Maybe I should add that I just watched the first episode of the 2005 series - and is better in two ways. There are more sliders in the direction, so the pace is a bit faster. And the case Jarndyce vs. Jarndyce is explained with satisfaction at the very beginning, instead of lurking in the shadow as a mysterious "curse", so the plot is easier to follow.
