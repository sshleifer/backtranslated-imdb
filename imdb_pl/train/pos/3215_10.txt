It was perfect. Touching, action-packed and perfect for Kurt Russell. I loved this movie, it deserves more than 5.3 stars. This film is a story about an outdated soldier who learns that life is more than a soldier, and people who learn that there is a time to fight, the need for defense. I cried, I laughed and I was sitting with admiration for this story. Good job writing action, and the story was right and quite solid. The ending was not winding, but it was still perfect. If you like to run away from New York or cheer on the weaker, this movie is for you. It was not an excessive amount of blood or violence, it was not difficult to observe in this regard. Something for everyone.
