WHEN I saw this movie in London for the first time in 1958, I was enchanted. I've never seen such a movie before. He had a strange, hypnotic effect, quite different from the films I had seen before and left a lasting impact. <br /> <br /> I believe that Odile Versios and Marina Vlady are sisters, if not twins. Surely, interaction is amazing when it comes to influencing the viewer. <br /> <br /> If it has been converted to DVD - in Region 2 format - and in the original French language, I would like to hear about it and where it can be bought.
