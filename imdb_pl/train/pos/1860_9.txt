I went to see Antone Fisher, not knowing what to expect and was most pleasantly surprised. Derek Luke's acting career was excellent and the plot was perfect. Of course, Denzel Washington did his usual good job, both as an actor and director. It makes you realize that people with mental problems CAN HELP and this movie is a perfect example. Do not miss it.
