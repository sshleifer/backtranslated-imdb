The film was actually a romantic drama based on three sisters who wanted to become a famous girl. In her efforts, the oldest sister meets a drug dealer and a street trader called Satin, whose sister goes on because she believes she is a "big time" that will give her everything she thought she wanted from life. Although you can be accused of killing her, she really only kills her spirit and the will to live, then she becomes addicted to drugs and eventually dies from overdose. The story is not about street life or an Italian gangster trying to buy Stix, and then threatens him about how love can overcome even the worst tragedies in life, like in song and style, and a figure that was a life in times for young women, which then tried to "discover".
