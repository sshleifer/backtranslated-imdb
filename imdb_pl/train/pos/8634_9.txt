LOVE AT THE TOP - a completely mistaken American title of the great French film "Le Mouton Enrage" (which I think, The Rabid Sheep) - is such an original film that its history dates back to 1974. more amazing. This movie has been much ahead of its time; even according to today's highest standards, he does things that seem rich and new. Filmed by the very underestimated director Michel Deville, he rather contrasts the description in the way in which he combines social criticism, comedy, mystery, love, sex and satire into one completely original blend - leaving behind a great but subtle surprise to make it everything was suddenly sad and more understandable. The cast is great, just like writing and subject. But this is Deville's delicious tone, keeping you in balance, but delightful, which pushes this "lost" movie to a very high level. (A written interview with the director in the "Special Features" section on DVD is definitely worth reading if you have time.)
