I just love Malle documentaries. They are so easy and simple, but still fascinating. I have no idea why this document works. It's about Glencoe, Minnesota. 5,000 people live there and nothing really happens. But Malle can still make him fascinating and interesting. His love for humanity, even racist or homophobic, is so overwhelming that you simply can not help but fall in love with them. <br /> <br /> Most of Malle's films were recorded in 1979. He returned 6 years later to see what has changed. It would be a good movie without material 6 years later, but this little addition makes it perfect. It may seem that Malle just did what was done in the Up series, but it really is not. The Up series is about people. Malle insists not on what happened to each person, but on what happened to this community. And the change is great. 1985 is the Reagan era, and farmers suffer. Once a proud community, no one can see the future at all, and parents hope their children will learn and do something other than agriculture. <br /> <br /> This document is quite current today. Our financial crises started today because of what happened then. Just look at the last words in the movie, spoken by a senior lawyer from the city (in 1985): <br /> <br /> "Well, I have high hopes for this country, because things that are going well now in my mind can be characterized only as an obsession with greed. And the nation does not live long with this obsession. And especially democracy, which ... Is good - it's good - a lot of good in this country and many good people, and they do not intend - they will not sign up for the philosophy of greed that is happening now. It's terrible. "<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it took over 20 years and a hell of a headache before it happened.
