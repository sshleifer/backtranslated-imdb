I have not seen much of German comedy, but if this movie has something to say, I need to see more! A simple but effective plot takes two very different people on a trip from Germany to Italy after Eva, the unemployed mother of two children, discovers that her husband-artist is having an affair with the wife of a wealthy lawyer. I will not reveal anything more, but what are the results of a very fun series of events with a perfect conclusion. My interest in international cinema has grown since I saw this movie for the first time. I recommend it to everyone (every adult ... do not let the inclusion of young children deceive you in thinking that it is a family movie) who love comedy - even those who do not speak the language.
