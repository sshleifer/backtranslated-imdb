John Water's ("Pink Flamingos" ...) "Pecker" is the best movie I've seen in a while. It gives the viewer a surreal picture of life in Baltimore (I live in nearby Washington), using Warhol's color, exaggerated movements and emotions. Pecker gets bigger than his city can handle, and he is separated from his relatives (including sexy Ricci) by his loving man's art manager. The image left a refreshing taste in his mouth - something like fresh strawberry ice on a hot summer day - and although this taste was rather flat and simplified, it only made the whole thing deeper and more critical. It is a celebration of life, freedom and the right to bear arms ... and everything that the country represents. -Juan Pieczanski (jookanski@sidwell.edu)
