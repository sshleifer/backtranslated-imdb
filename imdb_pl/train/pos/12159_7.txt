- After their sons were sentenced to live in prison, Adelle (Debbie Reynolds) and Helen (Shirley Winters) are starting to receive dangerous calls, because somebody falls for their sons. The couple decides to move to California to avoid publicity and start a new life. They start a dance school that will soon be very successful. One of the students has a rich unmarried father with whom Adelle falls in love quickly. In the meantime, Helen is busy breeding rabbits and becomes a little too enchanted by the evangelist on the radio. It's only a matter of time before everything falls apart and women enter the world of madness and murder. <br /> <br /> - I can not help myself with the comparison What is the matter with Helen? to Whoever Slew Auntie Roo ?, also from Shelly Winters. Where this film seemed almost restrained in depicting Aunt Roo's madness, nothing prevents Helen in this film. It may take a long time, but when it pops up, Helen is one of Bad Mad Mutha. You do not want to mix with her. Winters is so delightfully demented that I could not not enjoy her performance. I'm not going to mess up the movie, but the things that Helen is capable of are completely exaggerated. <br /> <br /> - Like Winters, Reynolds is totally unreasonable in his role of gold - the brace of a tap dancer. I got the impression that she thought she was in a movie that would give her the nomination for the prize. This is not Citizen Kane! Stop acting so seriously. Hey, Debbie, do not you realize that your main goal is to be a victim of Winters madness. <br /> <br /> - I love these old woman stars in the twilight of the horrors of my career. What's the matter with Helen? it's as funny as everyone.
