I'm not saying that I'm a fan of Ralph Bakshi because I'm not. So far, I have watched only 5 of his animated films: Coonskin, Wizards, Fritz the Cat and Lord of the Rings, and finally "Fire and Ice". In my opinion, I can say that "Fire and ice" is the most pleasant of all this. It is a simple fantasy story about swords and sorcery similar to Conan the Barbarian, but beautiful graphics, realistic animation and vivid movie score effectively give this film a very classic charm. <br /> <br /> Deserves the first mention if the animation itself. I do not care what people say about rotoscopy, but in my opinion Ralph Bakshi has used this technique very effectively. I was amazed at how realistic the movements of the heroes were. Directing style and photorealistic character designs have made Fire and Ice feel more like a big budget fantasy hit than cartoon. Unfortunately, the level of detail in art becomes a bit inconsistent, especially towards the end of the film. Some scenes look really flat, with little or no details of the contour of the body or the folds and shadows of the fabrics on the characters. <br /> <br /> Realistic moving figures would naturally be a realistic action. The action was not only well choreographed, but it was really brutal. I would be so brave to compare the brutality of the action for playing live in action movies such as Zack Snyder's 300. I noticed, however, that although blood was shed, the blood splatter was kept to a minimum. Again, a great selection of a creative band that only enhances your viewing experience without taking over too much. <br /> <br /> Although I do not recognize any "big names" in the cast, the voice of the actors manages to provide satisfying results; maintaining a realistic delivery of each line and only braking in the case of bad guys. <br /> <br /> Did I say bad people? Yes. Because this is what this story is about, a standard story about good and evil. Nothing really original in this story, which seems to be just a mixture of earlier stereotypes from a fantasy movie that includes scantily clad warriors and virgins. Anyone looking for "depths" would be very disappointed. Characters are not well developed, and some of them, like Nekron and Darkwolf, are one-dimensional at best (I've heard rumors of deleted scenes explaining Darkwolf's obsession to kill Nekron and his mother.) Such scenes deserve full restoration have been included in the final cutting to add depth to the show). Actually, I would not be surprised when I found out that the whole movie was just a "technical demonstration" that was supposed to show amazing animation and art, and the story was combined and cast as a reflection to convey it as the right "movie". <br /> <br /> The real classic of the bygone era "Fire and Ice" really captures the burning spirit of adventure and mysticism with beautiful effects of fantastic creatures and charming characters. It is a unique vision of the world created by Ralph Bakshi and the artist Frank Frazetta with a good measure of action and tension. <br /> <br /> Will he stand up to today's standards of animated film? Absolutely not. But I encourage animation fans to "get off the high horse" and give this simple but beautiful film a chance for you. It's really a gem of the 80's worth checking.
