I love this movie and have seen it several times over the years. Watching gets better with every watching. I agree with all positive reviews here. Yes, it is rough and brutally realistic because life on the prairie was in those days. I made a comment when I watched it. Somebody here said Rip Torn was not successful. I could not disagree any more. He is brilliant as stupid, stingy Clyde Stewart, who does not speak much and works like a slave / working horse. Conchatta Farrell is fantastic as a widowed Elinor, whom Clyde employs as a housewife / cook (along with her 7-year-old daughter). Lilia Skala is excellent as a distant neighbor called grandma. The harsh Montana prairie is also a star. It is a beautiful and brutal country to settle. There are several scenes that are both repulsive and necessary. No special effects here, what you see is real! He even has an excellent musical score and a great script. When you see Heartland, you will never forget it. He deserves all the tens he gets here.
