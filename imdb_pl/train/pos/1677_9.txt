La Coda Dello Scorpione (a.k.a. Case of the Scorpion's Tail) was the continuation of the director Sergio Martino after the wonderful giallo Strano vizio della Signora Wardh. This is the quintessential giallo, which contains all the aspects that fans of the genre have known and loved. The winding plot, beautiful girls, black gloves, sharp blades and a little bit of all together make up one piece of Italian exploitation. <br /> <br /> A group of gialli favorites, both before and behind the camera, work to become one of the best gialli not Argento. It is mentioned Martino, who adds his accents as a director, great giallo Ernesto Gastaldi as a writer, Bruno Nicolai creating music, as well as plenty of giallo stars and stars, such as George Hilton, character actor Luigi Pistilli and appealing Anita Strindberg. br /> <br /> Does Scorpione provide this thanks to this talent? You bet. The film works on many different levels. It's an exciting murder mystery, tense and brutal horror and thriller. In all one of the best gialli around. <br /> <br /> Martino definitely knows what fans want when it comes to gialli. At some moments in the film, it almost seems that he gives Argento his approach. For example, there is a direct stripping of the Bird With the Crystal Plumage scene in which the killer tries to break through the door, which actually surpasses the Argento flick. <br /> <br /> Are there any traffic problems? Hmmm ... only minor. First of all, any scenes that do not follow the murders or budding romance between these two tracks, start to get bored. But just before falling asleep, the killer will jump out of nowhere and you will come back to action. <br /> <br /> Also at the end the turns become a bit too strange. I mean, what were the scorpion pins for? If you do not pay attention to dialogue, you can easily get lost in the spinning story. <br /> <br /> But these little lies aside, La Coda Dello Scorpione is tense, tense, classic and all around the entertainment movie for giallo fans. Seek this!
