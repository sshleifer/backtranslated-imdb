At the beginning of the film one of the commentators says that he was told that he has two hits against him: he is black and male. But he also has a third hit: he is gay. "You will have to be stronger than you ever imagined," he says. "Paris is Burning" is a documentary about homosexual black and latin men who are transvestites or transsexuals. <br /> <br /> The miracle of "Paris is Burning" is that the director Jennie Livingston takes a topic that could very easily freak the show and allow people in it to be human. We learn about their views on homosexuality, men, women, their hopes, disappointments and dreams. Some of these dreams are so unattainable that they are tragic. Many people seriously deny; <br /> <br /> This is not a movie for everyone. There are shots in this film of nude transsexuals. If you have a problem with homosexuality, this movie is not for you. But if you see this movie, you will realize that "Paris is Burning" is not really about men wearing women's clothing, but about a group of people who are routinely marginalized and posed by society in general, and what they do to get a sense of togetherness in their life. <br /> <br /> I've watched this movie four times since its release in 1991 because it says so many things: it's a commentary about materialism in our culture, about gender roles, about rich and poor people, about the media and that what is celebrating, about fame and adoration. "Paris is Burning" is one of the most humane and saddest movies I've ever seen.
