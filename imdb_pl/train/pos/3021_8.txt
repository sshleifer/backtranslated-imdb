but it's worth seeing Boyer, Lorre and Paxinou. Greene's games that were filmed during the war required either transplanting to the American coasts, as in This Gun for Hire, or using American actors in roles that they did not fit. Bacall matches this part here. I waited for her whistle and enlivened God; her tone of voice is just bad for an Englishwoman from a higher class. But listen to the dialogue! No, people do not speak in this way except books, but Greene sent a message about England, which needed to wake up to the dangers of the world. One more positive remark: the scope of Greene's character was preserved in its entirety. While Mr. Mukerjee was more like Brahman, at least his nationality was preserved, and his final conversation with Paxinou is priceless.
