Woah! One thing I can say about this film. Personally, I'm one of those people who love cats, so it would be a big disadvantage of this movie, but I loved how the cats all got their revenge at the end. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie, but I must admit that because Brian Krause, who played Charles Brady, was very irresistible, I suppose that lust exceeded me while watching this movie. <br /> <br /> There was one thing I was disappointed with. I've watched Charmed before, and Brian Krause is married to Holly Marie Combs, his kisses scene was O.K. in Sleepwalkers, but really bad compared to his kissing scenes with Holly Marie Combs, I do not know if that's because Krause and Combs have great chemistry, maybe more, it was the only disappointment in the movie, but I guess it was invented with Brian Krause in those tight jeans he wore in the movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to see Brian Krause as Holly Marie Combs, the heavenly husband and father of her son, the big surprise in this movie was nothing like a boy from the corner. Although now, when I think about it, it would be great if Krause on Charmed were taken over by evil, making him like him in Sleepwalkers. <br /> <br /> I must also say that the music was GREAT in this movie too!
