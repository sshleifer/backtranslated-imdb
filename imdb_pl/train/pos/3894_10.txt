I would like to be able to laugh again as much as when I saw this concert for the first time. I have not done this since then. <br /> <br /> It is strange that I am laughing almost as hard after watching the program again and again. <br /> <br /> Eddie Izzard is cultivated, is moving, he is a man of the world. He deftly speaks about politics, but there is no need to "engage" in political discussions. He is above it. I would contrast with George Carlin, who uses his comedy to convince people of his ideas and does not enjoy the fact that he is trying to entertain. <br /> <br /> The funniest guy on Earth
