The most concise way of describing Ride With The Devil is just one word: authenticity. I will not change what has already been said about this wonderful film, but I would like to say how much the historians have appreciated it and the meticulous attention to detail that the crew undoubtedly passed. <br /> <br /> As a history student familiar with the period and scenery of this film, I must say that this production is one of the most accurate fictional films about "bleeding Kansas". Yes, on real events freedoms have been accepted, as all fiction does. But the overall atmosphere of the film is real. Authentic costumes, authentic attitudes (no PC here), even the actors look authentic. Even Jewel Kilcher (who has a small role in the film) looked as if she had stepped in from the mid-nineteenth century. <br /> <br /> And the few viewers I talked to expressed disbelief in the stylized dialog. They can not believe that nineteenth-century farmers "talk like poets". <br /> <br /> They do not realize that in this age of verbal understatement, the American public audience of the nineteenth century was surprisingly skilful and eloquent. These people were brought up on Shakespeare and the King James Bible. Screenwriters have reconstructed the most likely verbal styles of these people, judging by the time documentation. The stylized dialog box simply adds the magical atmosphere of the movie. <br /> <br /> But in addition to the historical document, this film also works at the internal level. Beautifully photographed and made, it refers to the times of great Western epics. The expedition to Lawrence in Kansas, already done many times in so many other, smaller films, is presented with a sense of urgency that puts the viewer in the middle of the action. <br /> <br /> Romance, adventure, moral and ethical conflict. This movie has everything a finicky movie fan could want. <br /> <br /> During the year, which was dominated by overgrown garbage, such as American Beauty, this great artwork was buried by an inert studio system. But I'm sure that Ride With The Devil will receive the payment in the coming years. Please, rent this movie. You will not be disappointed.
