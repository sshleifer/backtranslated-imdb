Despite the patronage of George Lucas, this captivating and completely original fantasy in "Lumage" (a combination of animation through live cutouts) is so far removed from the usual children's tariff as everything Ralph Bakshi did in his glory days. Superbly thought out characters such as the shapeshifter dog Ralph (one of the inept duets, rejected heroes), Synonamess Botch (fun nasty villain) and Rod Rescueman (pompous novice), breathe life into an extremely ingenious concept of Frivoli. Murkwood, or eternal fight between dreams and nightmares. In this context, songs with MOR music on the soundtrack should not work, but in some way. It is really a pity that I had to watch it through a really bad look (torn from a TV projection) of a version without censorship? is also a milder variant that has suppressed the language for the VHS release? because the movie is not available on DVD. Interestingly, both Henry Selick and David Fincher worked on this image in subordinate abilities.
