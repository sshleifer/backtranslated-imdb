The fourth movie of Pokemon made me cringe when Celebi died. Do not you dare say that Pokemon sucks! I do not like it when people say that ... I liked Pokemon for 5 or 6 years, so everyone should enjoy Pokemon, including this movie and other Pokemon movies. So, without further ado, say that Pokemon is great and should be liked by people of all ages. And also, why do pokemon hate give low ratings for all or most Pokemon movies? I do not understand .... They should not do this ... There is absolutely no reason why people should just vote without proving that Pokemon sucks except that: 1) Pokemon is ONLY for small children. 2) Pokemon is stupid. and 3) People should not like Pokemon. I think that's why people do not like Pokemon.
