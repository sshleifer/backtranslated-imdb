I can not say that this movie deserves any amount of vitriol, which some reviewers put on it. Yes, you have stuck in excessively padded time, editing hamfisted and over-reliance on the effects of special cheeseball. He lacks the energy that the average audience needs so that he can go through it without checking the watch. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it also has some fun lines of laughter, talented and serious actors, as well as a classic underestimated message. Macy, Stiller and Azaria are brilliant as the "core", and Garofalo and Studi are doing great, adding conflict and diversity to the team. I can not say that Reubens or Mitchell have contributed much to the film, although everyone had a few chance to shine. <br /> <br /> The plot, as I said above, is your classic thing "underdog-make-good". There are no surprises because you know they will triumph. What makes it worth is not absurd, flashy heroes and villains, but dialogue and game between heroes. Under all these people are children in the heart who just want to do the right thing. The best scenes in the film give this film an emotional foundation. Look at Azaria's relationship with his long-suffering mother; Macy is an engaging innocence in his unwillingness to accept the Hat. An amazing mysterious identity; Raider's fury (not like this strange, spazzy kid you once knew, who always fell into a tremor, powerless craze in the playground); Garofalo's desire to avenge his father. This children's belief that a sense of justice and goodness will always make the world a better place is the real charm of the superhero comics; and under his parody facade, "Mystery Men" shows us why these dazzling comic tricks matter to so many. <br /> <br /> It is never really suitable for a satisfying whole because of the huge number of half-baked plot lines (romance, family life, team conflicts, etc.), but the main theme is so funny that it makes up for it. The fact that it's supposed to be a good, meaningless game seems to be lost on some reviewers here, so I'll issue a caveat: if you're the type of viewer who finds the joy of Itchy and Scratchy cartoon destroyed by unexplained and illogical ("Should I believe it's somehow kind ... * snorts * ... _magic_ xylophone? "), so you are too literal and devoid of humor for this film. Go rent a Sandler movie. <br /> <br /> (7/10)
