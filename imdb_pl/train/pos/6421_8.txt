"Men of Honor" - a true story of a proud and persistent black naval diver (fantastic Cuba Gooding Jr.) is definitely a great movie that both touches and entertains, and is part of the absolute cream of the new millennium cinema. Great acting is the main reason to make this movie really special and pleasant, a great experience. Charismatic Robert De Niro is wonderful as a rough, sharp and ruthless boss Billy Sunday - the role is practically written for him. This film, along with the fantastic "15 minutes" (2001), are two of the latest proofs that he is still one of the best actors of our time. On the other hand, "People of Honor" is a great performance by Cuba Gooding Jr., one of the most promising young black actors since "Boyz n the hood". "Men of honor" go straight to the company "Jerry Maguire", "As good as it gets" and "Instinct". Cuba Gooding Jr. he's a clever and fantastic actor, and I'm ready to get a lot of great movies from him. "Men of Honor" also has a great storyline and probably the most exciting dive in film history. It's a wonderful, fascinating movie and I can only recommend it.
