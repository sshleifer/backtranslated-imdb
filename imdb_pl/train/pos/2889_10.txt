*** Maybe I do not think it's a spoiler, but I'd rather be careful than careless *** I've never seen this movie when I was little. I fell in love with him for the first time when I saw him with my three-year-old daughter. I can watch him over and over again. <br /> <br /> For the little actress Ilene Woods she did during her lifetime, she was a wonderful voice for Cinderella; Very attractive; very reliable. Music really suits the movie perfectly. Acting was great; I loved mice !! You really "hated" Lady Tremain and the half-sisters; they were just awful. The printers presented the broken behavior very well. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie, especially if you like love stories. My daughter saw the movie about 25 times and in the end is still excited.
