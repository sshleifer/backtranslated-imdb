If the answer to this question is "yes", then you should enjoy this great movie. I just saw it a few hours ago here, in Paris (where the movie takes place) and I still feel the huge trauma I received in my eyes ... What a visual shock! I have never seen such a beautiful black and white photography and such a drastic change in the way of making animated films. I strongly believe that it will be before and after the "Renaissance", just like what we saw in Pixar movies or in the Akira and GhostInTheShell experiments. This is a real breakthrough in the small world of animated films and I hope that this French initiative (a small unknown French studio with a few young people who dreamed of the name "Renaissance" ...) will receive the success and recognition it deserves. Long live France !
