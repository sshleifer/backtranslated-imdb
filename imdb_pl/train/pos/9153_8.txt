In the end, I managed to see it after hearing about this wonderful things. In fact, it exceeded my expectations. Taking into account the budget, it was a surprisingly competent and well-made film. Lack of finances has actually helped this film in several ways, especially considering the story. Like the Blair Witch Project, this movie was even better because it was filmed instead of a movie. Another bonus: while most low-budget horror movies (even the best of the best) suffer from mediocre or unintentional hysterical acting, this movie really had a talented cast (except one or two heroes), especially the two. Only the original story was missing. It borrows a lot from the more well-known films, such as "Deliverance" and "Wrong Turn", but if you're like me, these kinds of movies never stop being frightening. In addition, the director is curious. I would be very interested to see what the director will do with a bigger budget and I have a feeling that it's only a matter of time before we find out ...
