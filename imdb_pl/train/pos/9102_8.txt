I saw this movie at the 18th film festival in Haifa and this is one of the best I've seen this year. Watching it on a big screen (and I mean BIG, not one of those TV screens that has most of the theaters) with a perfect sound system always enhances the cinema experience, because the movie takes over your eyes and ears and draws you into a story of the picture. <br /> <br /> The video shows a set of characters that are loosely connected. Their stories intersect at certain moments, and the multiplicity of the stories reminds me of the very magnificent Robert Altman and his wonderful films. But the real hero of the movie is of course Madrid, which is the background for the whole film. It houses heroes, contains sidewalks and roads that they follow, and sets the atmosphere of the background for all events, all in beautifully filmed scenes. <br /> <br /> The movie returns again to certain topics (shoes, for example) and indeed Salazar makes his metaphors become more and more understandable to the viewer as the film progresses. It combines views of the city with the shots of the characters and elegantly matches the impression of the scene to the background. A set of talented actors helps him in portraying many different characters. A perfect example is the scene in which Juaquin takes Anita for the first time across the street. It may not work on a small screen, but it easily gave me goose bumps on the big screen. <br /> <br /> The message is very positive and the movie is sometimes light and funny. The music in the film is usually pop, with a few instrumental songs (I hope one day it will put a hand on the soundtrack, although I seriously doubt that it will be so). <br /> <br /> Together, I came out with this sensational feeling and I'm not impressed (you have to take my word for it). I give this film a solid version of 8/10 to this and more.
