For most people watching this movie, it will be of little interest, but from many hundreds of films about magic and occult in one form or another, this one is probably the best in many ways. <br /> <br /> From Golem to The Craft, the subject seems to be interested in the film industry. Most of the films that refer to it in any way, do it childishly (for example, "Witchboard", a real piece of complete trash in every respect), or take transcendental elements as cheap excuses for bad special effects or cardboard clippings from villian (Wizard) More often the subject appears in a hysterical religious context (in different films oriented to Revelation, the antichrist is inevitably an advocate of some kind of practice in the new age.) It is rarely seen that the film shows at least some magic experience as practiced in real life, but the presentation of occultism in such films may at best be described as allegorical, not literal, symbolic or ... just not really good. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie after many years tonight. I saw it earlier on VHS; this is a dark, moody song and after watching it on DVD after I would know if you're going to watch this movie, watch it on DVD, do not watch it on VHS. <br /> <br /> darkness and moods are overwhelming in VHS, but the DVD takes on a completely different tone. I think Weir deliberately moved the dark aspects of the style, but when the movie is converted to a lower VHS color carrier, it goes beyond the boundaries. The DVD brings the movie back to life and I saw it differently. <br /> <br /> In any case, seeing it the way I first did, I realized that treating magic is exceptionally good in this movie. It is difficult to enter all the reasons why I do not want to spend time. <br /> <br /> For anyone who is curious, if you want to see how it is in real life, this movie is very suitable on countless levels. <br /> <br /> And for everyone who is not, you've really wasted a lot of time reading to this point.
