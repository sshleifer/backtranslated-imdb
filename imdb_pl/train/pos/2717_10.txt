I do not remember many details about the concert, but I remember how passionate I was and how I was determined not to miss any episodes. Unfortunately, at the time we did not have a VCR, so I never saw the series again. However, I remember very much how I felt while watching and how I was delighted every time it appeared. Waterstone himself was my favorite actor these days (I think I was almost in love) and he remains one of my favorite actors to this day, mainly because of his performance on the show. I would gladly buy / steal / download this series, I think I would do anything to see it again and go back to my long gone childhood ... Any ideas? Does anyone know about the site dedicated to the series or have episodes on tape from their first issue?
