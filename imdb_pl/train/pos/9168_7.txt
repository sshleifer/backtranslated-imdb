it was a fantastic adaptation of Jane Eyre. The only problem I had with this was that I did not like Zelah Clarke. I thought she was too old and made Jane seem very shy. in the book, Jane seemed a much stronger character. I was very irritated by her performance. the part where in the morning Rochester asks her to marry him, and she runs up to him and hugs him, always makes me laugh. I think they made the wrong choice by throwing it. but Dalton was absolutely wonderful as Rochester. it's worth seeing this version of Jane Eyre. Another thing that made this version not 100% was the quality of the movie. I know that it was produced in the eighties for television. if it was a feature film and better quality, it would be perfect. My main complaint, however, is that Zelah Clarke was definitely too old.
