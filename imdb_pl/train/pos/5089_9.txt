It is true that he does not follow the book very carefully, but it is still a very funny story. Swayze was much better in this role than I expected. And Doody avoided the "stupid woman from deep in the wilderness" that most of us probably expected (see Kate Capshaw in "Indiana Jones & Temple of Doom"). is unbelievably better than the terrible pair of Quatermain Richard Chamberlain's films. <br /> <br /> In many respects it is very similar to the western one. The only thing I did not care about was all mysticism, but I think it is an inseparable part of the genre. How "do you have an African adventure story without the doctrines of witches and unnatural wise nomadic tribes?" Heh.
