There are many police dramas performing rounds. I do not know why. Probably it has to do with the old, basic motif of good and evil. <br /> <br /> This film has a documentary style, because we follow the difficult initiation of Anna, a strict recruit, to a police unit stationed in the Baltic region. There is no attempt to improve the police. They are really on the ground, sometimes harsh and merciless, on the other hand Anne has a soft heart, maybe a little more understanding of the human condition. Against all rules, he sometimes stops the incriminating information found during her search and other investigations. <br /> <br /> This is not a nice movie. Not to relax you. There is not much optimism in this. The police seem to be involved in a lost battle. Tomorrow there will be more fights, more murders, more family breakdowns and more children in a difficult situation. Let's face it. This is the world in which we live. <br /> <br /> As the days go by, Anne increasingly integrates herself with the police and families she researches. The only real warmth in the film is Benny, a 12-year-old from a broken family. Anne has her own way of patching things. She turns a blind eye to Benny's shoplifting and tries to help him as best she can. I was surprised that she had gone so far as to seduce Benny's father. I wondered if it was because of my father or his own needs. In the end, the film clearly shows that she desperately needed a partner and loving children. <br /> <br /> Great, but not my idea for evening entertainment,
