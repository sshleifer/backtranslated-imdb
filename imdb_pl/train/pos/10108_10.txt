An absolute classic !! The direction is impeccable, the acting is just great. The words do not match this wonderful work. The most definitive movie about Mumbai police. This movie has survived the test of times. <br /> <br /> Om Puri gives a great performance, no less than Smita Patil. All the actors have done everything they can, and the movie races are exciting at all times. This film badly shakes your whole body and forces you to rethink the many problems that our society is struggling with. <br /> <br /> Here is the story of a policeman (Om Puri), who begins his career as an honest man, eventually turns into a killer. First trial behind the scenes of Bollywood and revealing the depressing truth about Mumies cops. Kudos to Nihalani !! <br /> <br /> After this film, a lot of Bollywood movies were released that revealed the relationship of criminals with the police. So this movie was really a determinant of trends. This trend has dominated the Indian movie scene for over ten years. <br /> <br /> This movie was a moderate box office hit. <br /> <br /> An obligatory item for demanding movie fans.
