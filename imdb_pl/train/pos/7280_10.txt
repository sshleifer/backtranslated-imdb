watch it as a child. Although I'm probably going to be horribly awful now, it was terrible because I was only seven years old. I also remember that during the watching I was working on the puzzle on Saturday afternoon, so I did not pay much attention. However, the scene with rolling boulders has been burnt in my head since then. I asked many people if they saw this movie, but to no avail. 12 years ago one person mentioned that he probably saw her, but he thought it was only a dream; fancy piffle like the wind. It's not a dream, my friend. Do not dream now. Again, I have not seen him since then, but I can not wait to find a copy and put it in my VCR. Everything that can stay in the eye of my mind for 23 years deserves "10".
