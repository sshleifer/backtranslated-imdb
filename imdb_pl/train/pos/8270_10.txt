This is an extraordinary movie that constantly cheats you. It seems that at several points it is heading towards the banality, and then something amazing will happen which will really surprise. He would give too much to say a lot more, but stick to the film and you'll be rewarded with a lot of money. William Haines is absolutely amazing - he is certainly a star who deserves to be rediscovered. The subtext of gays in his relationship with Jack Pickford is amazing - there is even a scene where Haines rubs Pickford's breast (Pickford has a cold). Both actors reproduce this subtext subtly and with great depth of emotion, thanks to which there are very moving moments. And I never thought that I would be able to get involved in a football match like in this movie - and I do not even understand the rules! Also the son of Francis X. Bushman Ralph is great as Haines' rival for the girl (yes, this is not a completely gay movie). A wonderful quiet classic - a great example of Twenties commercial cinema with the advantage.
