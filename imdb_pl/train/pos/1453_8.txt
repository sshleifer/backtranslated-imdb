Well, there are many ways to ruin a political thriller. They are usually derivative or too ambitious, often contain a conspiracy that is completely paranoid and unreliable. But the City Hall does not do any of the above. The plot is cleverly made, the story is credible. As for the characters, I would say that this movie is a solid medium. No character seems out of place, and Al Pacino is always brilliant. His character of the charismatic mayor of New York is outstanding and proves that Al Pacino is today one of the leading American actors.
