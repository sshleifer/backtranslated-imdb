I was lucky to see it on yesterday's projection (October 20) and I was incredibly surprised by the great story and the authentic heart. <br /> <br /> Although the plot is not particularly complicated or exceptionally new, the story develops in a fresh, unique and clearly "indy" style. This is not something that can be easily compared to movies from the past, it is a unique look at the classic love story in middle-aged depression. <br /> <br /> I was particularly struck by the casting of the film. Until the last addition in the family it was a beautiful and talented cast. Three daughters did a great job, the talent was evenly distributed between them, and none of them "shone" the other two. <br /> <br /> It was really a great movie, suitable for all ages and laughing aloud funny, and at the same time really moving and warming the heart. It was a great break from sexual jokes and the nudity of recent films.
