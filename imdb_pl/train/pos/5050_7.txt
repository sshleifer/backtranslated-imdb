We really liked Gray Owl: a simple story told in the classic fashion of Attenborough: a bit over-romantic, with archetypes, humor and stress of dignity and value. <br /> <br /> Beautifully filmed and told in a nice pace is the true story of Archie, an Englishman who became a native Indian, and went to live in Canada. <br /> <br /> Solid performances of all make this movie with the message easy to watch. <br /> <br /> The two movie stars are without a doubt the sweetest we've ever seen - and the message is good with its ecological. It must have been great to meet or read Gray Owl in 1930, a unique character and it is an appropriate tribute to the film.
