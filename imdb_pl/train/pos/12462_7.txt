The performance of Noni Hazlehurst (who won her AFI award) is at least on par with her effort at FRAN three years later. Colin Friels is also good, and for those interested, Alice Garner appears as a child of Noni, and Michael Caton (best known from ZAMKU) is a bearded painter. (Interestingly, Hazlehurst is currently hosting the "BETTER HOUSES AND GARDENS" program, and Caton hosts real estate programs, including HOT PROPERTY, HOT AUCTION, etc.). This film confirms the widespread belief that Noni is probably the best Australian actress in the early eighties. Rating: 79/100.
