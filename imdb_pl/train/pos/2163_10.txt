I just love this movie. This is a perfect example of surprising, surprising stories that come from Asian cinema. Recently, a remake of the movie in Hollywood, with Richard Gere and simply horrible Jennifer Lopez was made. Please, do not confuse two films. The original Japanese film is touching, subtle and wonderfully preserved. The Hollywood version is exactly the opposite. I was terrified when I saw for the first time the trailer of the revised American version and who played in it. This is the worst typical Hollywood crime commercialism. Remake cites the argument that some foreign films can never be improved. The only reason why the original movie has not become more widespread is the reluctance of the American audience to subtitles. <br /> <br /> One of the main reasons why this movie would never work in an American story is that the reserved, ultra socially conservative character of the public Japanese persona is in this film. Surely the main character comes to a fuller understanding of living life through dance, but half the tension of the film comes from stereotypes and funny dancers from the ballroom in Japan. <br /> <br /> Try to see this movie in its original form, not a scary full screen. And please, skip the remake in the US ... it's a shallow parody compared to the original Japanese movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know that the "original" movie is much older, and this is just Japanese to take care of this story, but only two people will probably see this new remake in the US soon. <br /> <br /> Speaking of foreign films, I will present a few short recommendations: 1. Monsoon Wedding-I mention it first because of, an outstanding movie! 2.Johnny Stechino - Very funny Italian flic flic identity! 3. Shiri-Korean action movie that combines the Asian flare and storyline in American style 4.Run Lola Run-German movie that integrates its techno score genuinely. <br /> <br /> Well, just a short list: -)
