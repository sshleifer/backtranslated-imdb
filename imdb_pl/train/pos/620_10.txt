Neil Gaiman (the MirrorMask writer) wrote a beautiful story of Star dust and this is a really good story. I think that it will appeal to every Labyrinth, Princess of the Bride or fan of the 10th Kingdom, yet it is completely unique and stands out by itself. And I think that the adaptation of this story has a much better ending than what was presented in the original novel by Neil Gaiman. I will not ruin this. <br /> <br /> The main character, Tristan (Tristran in the novel), is the son of a mortal and faerie slave held by a witch in the kingdom of faerie. The story begins in a city near the wall that separates the magical world from the human world. When the shooting star falls, Tristan promises to get her back for the girl with whom he is infatuated. He does not realize that the star took the form of a girl from a fairy-tale world and that others are after it. Three older witches who want to use their heart to become young, and some quarrelsome princes. <br /> <br /> It's a really good story. He has humor and magic and beautiful, surreal scenes and visualizations. It is adorable and I feel that it can be seen by children and adults of all ages. It's just magical. This is a real classic tale that I have not seen in the cinema since the 80's.
