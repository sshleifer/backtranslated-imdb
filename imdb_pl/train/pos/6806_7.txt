Ernst Marischka, one of the most respected Austrian directors of the time, made films full of beautiful scenes, gentle love and everything that is valuable in life. <br /> <br /> Nowadays, if people should hear about it, they associate the name of Marischka with the SISSI trilogy (1955,1956,1957). He did, however, other excellent films, such as DAS DREIMADERLHAUS (1958), EMBEZZLED HEAVEN (1958) and definitely MADCHENJAHRE EINER KONIGIN showing the young years of Queen Victoria. Although it deals with a slightly different theme than SISSI films, I do not see much difference between this film and SISSI. They are strikingly similar. <br /> <br /> The movie is almost identical. Style, music, photography. In fact, the crew is almost the same. Anton Profes, Bruno Mondi! <br /> <br /> Cast ... Romy Schneider is one of the first major roles. It was a charming introduction to her role as Sissi, because this film was made a year before the first part of the trilogy about the Austrian Empress. It is also a movie in which Roma plays with his mother Magda Schneider. But Ernst Marischka was not the first director who cast Romy to play with her mother. Roma debut, WENN DER WEISSE FLIEDER WIEDER BLUHN (1953), was also her performance with her mother. In connection with this, there were voices that Roma started her Austrian career based on her mother's fame. Indeed, there is some truth in it. <br /> <br /> Again, just like in SISSI, this movie shows love very gently. Victoria meets Prince Albert in a small inn in Dover. Their compassion is based on pure exaltation in dance and gentle smiles. And now...? How would it be shown? Only sex ... But is this the only thing that love is based on? <br /> <br /> I am grateful to Ernst Marischka for these films. They had a soul and a message. Some people may call them kitsch, but I will never give up watching these movies. They are IMPRESIVE !!! UNUSUAL, HIGH SUMMARY!
