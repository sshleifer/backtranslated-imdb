to communicate in the film the essential things in life - how is what is life, does it matter? - is impossible. Of course, the possible answers to these questions are shown in every film (history), but communication requires a direct appeal to consciousness. This happens if the contribution of the senses refutes the "contribution" from our mind, ie our thoughts. Few directors know how to communicate important things. Tarkowski is one. His "Stalker" shows the images of existence, communicates life as it is shown, and at the same time defies the mind. I think De Zee and De Graaff are doing the same.
