The Three Stooges has always been one of the many actors I loved. I love almost all the shorts they have created. I love all six Stoogs (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe and Curly Joe)! All shorts are fun and also play many other great actors and actresses, many of which were in many shorts! In my opinion, The Three Stooges is one of the greatest actors in history and is the funniest comedy band! <br /> <br /> One of my favorite Stooges shorts from Shemp is none other than Husbands. Attention! This film features beautiful Christine McIntyre, Dee Green, Doris Houck, Alyn Lockwood, Johnny Kascier, Nancy Saunders, Lu Leonard, Maxine Gates and Emil Sitka. Green and McIntyre provide great performances here! There are so many fun parts here. This is a very funny shortcut. There is another similar Three Stooges, like the one called Brideless Groom, and I recommend both!
