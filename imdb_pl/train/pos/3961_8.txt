This is the magnum opus of the Swedish king of shit, Mats-Helge Olsson. It is rare that film on this scale was made in Sweden and really stands out as one of the most amazing achievements in the Swedish film. Who pays for these things? <br /> <br /> Russian nuclear scientist Markov wants to flee to Sweden. But his plans are ruined by the Russian army, which kidnaps him and says he came to Sweden. This trick is that Markov continues his work in the field of nuclear physics, which will revolutionize energy supply for the entire planet. The CIA, however, is trying to bring Markov to the west and send his ninjas to free him. <br /> <br /> The practice of speaking English by Swedish actors is something that Mats-Helge has perfected in his later works. What makes a cheap b-movie is probably unparalleled in performance. But other than that? Well, the action is a standard direct-to-video style. Machine guns firing huge clouds of smoke. Thousands of Russians dying. People are running in black ninja suits, trying to hide in the snow. <br /> <br /> However, what really stands out is a terribly bad way of putting up battle scenes. When they say "Ninja" in the title, I expect martial arts, I expect melee combat. But in this movie there are maybe two or three scenes of real martial arts. And they are fun. It's so bad that I lack words to describe it. If the ninjas moved more slowly, their hearts stopped. And of course, the whole movie ends with a bang that points to a special effects budget consisting of four food stamps and a McDonald's coupon. <br /> <br /> So what's the verdict? Instant classic of course. Never before has a movie been made that would obviously be consumed with a lot of alcohol. This is the best party movie. Put in a video and laugh. You just have to realize that there are no such films anymore. This is the story of the film. <br /> <br /> That's why the rating is 8/10 for entertainment, 1/10 for quality and 10/10 for accents.
