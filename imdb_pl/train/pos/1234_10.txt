I grew up watching this movie and I still love it the same as today when I was a child. Do not listen to critics' opinions. They are not accurate in this movie. Eddie Murphy really shines on her roll. You can sit with the whole family and everyone will like it. I recommend this film to everyone. It is a comedy with a bit of fantasy. With demons, dragons and a small bald kid with God like power. beautiful view! So do yourself a favor and pick it up! You will not regret!
