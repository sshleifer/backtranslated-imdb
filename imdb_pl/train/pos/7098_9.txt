"Twelve monkeys" has all the elements to become Terry Gilliam's masterpiece. Excellent scenario, lasting rhythm, clever and sometimes ironic dialogues. What's more, he had a good nose about the cast. "Twelve monkeys" is also the first movie in which Bruce Willis gives way to the character he played in his previous films. Here, the blas√© and hopeless hero, whom you can call a prisoner, took over from the fearless and invincible hero (as was the case with "Hard"). No matter how he tries, he is a prisoner of those times. The film also contains a very emotional end. It has real dramatic power. But this great movie is also a reflection on a man, the dangers he is afraid of (especially those that can cause the end of the world and here are viruses that can create disease). No matter how long it lasts, "twelve monkeys" will be estimated at their true value: one of the masterpieces from the nineties.
