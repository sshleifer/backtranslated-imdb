I saw this movie at the Nashville Film Festival. It was beautifully made, from cinematography to acting. It's the story of the father and son and how they appreciate each other during the family crisis. Beautifully written with a dialogue that is never false, the film presents the acting talents of Paul Reiser and Peter Falk, among others in this outstanding cast. The film begins with an aging father (Peter Falk), who is trying to understand why his wife (Olympia Dukakis) left him. The father introduces himself unannounced on the threshold of his son and daughter-in-law. Father and son take off the next day to look at some property and finish their classic journey. They fish, play billiards, watch a baseball game, get drunk, engage in a barroom fight and dance with strange women. But more importantly, each of them faces unspeakable tensions that can affect every family. It is a kind of film that touches the heart and makes those closest to it appreciate.
