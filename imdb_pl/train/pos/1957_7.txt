Yes, I will say, before I start to comment, this film is extremely underestimated. <br /> <br /> Sharon Stone is great in the role of Catherine Trammell, like Morrissey as Dr Glass. She is an analyst sent to evaluate her after the death of a sports star. Glass is drawn into the seductive game Trammel uses to manipulate his mind. <br /> <br /> Acting was good (except Thewlis) <br /> <br /> Stone really has a talent for this role. She is slippery, naughty and seductive and does not look like a day older than the first. She really impressed me (like in a casino). Morrisey was good too. He showed great freedom in the role that needed it. Thewlis, however, was lame. He ruined his character and was on the top all the way. He really sucked. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is not as good as the first one, but Stone is a roar to watch. Just ignore Thewlis.
