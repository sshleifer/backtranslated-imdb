I saw this movie when I was little - it was called "Fox Glacier". I was totally shocked! He follows a charming little family of foxes. The beginning was great and I remember how much I attached myself to small foxes. I also remember how my mother led me out of the theater when I was in hysteria. I will not tell you what happened, but let's say it does not end well for all foxes. I was used to Disney movies in which animals do not REALLY die. Oh, old man. This movie told me to cry for hours. It was a good movie ... I think - I was really small and I was told the truth - I just remember that I was happy for the foxes, and then I see one of them dying. Rent, if you can, but do not show children!
