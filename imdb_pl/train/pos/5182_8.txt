A quiet, sweet and beautifully nostalgic movie about how to be confronted with old friends and the surroundings of your youth, with all the memories and problems and sorrows of the present. A movie that makes you feel good. All ingredients are here: old jelly, competition, friendship and loyalty. Pranks, night raids on the fridge and all other funny things that we all remember from our summer camps. All heroes have the opportunity to experience it again for a week, because the old camp leader retires and wants to meet children from the golden years of the camp. All of them are now in their thirties and are in the middle of their careers.
