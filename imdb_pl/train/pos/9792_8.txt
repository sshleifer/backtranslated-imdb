Once a year, "such a movie" comes and makes everything easy. You do not try to think that it is good, it just is. You like it while watching and you take home with you. I can not say it is completely spotless, but it is close. Acting - great, storytelling - interesting and with elements of tension. This is a small family story, quite predictable, but the secret itself does not count. it's the way a blind girl has to achieve it. I was impressed by the way the director presented their deep relationship (a blind girl and her cousin). The only thing I did not like was the actress who played the mother, she was too hard and without it. Keren
