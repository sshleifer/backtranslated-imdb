So I consider myself quite good on the anime scene, I just do not look at it with very few performances. <br /> <br /> however, I recommend this program to everyone. <br /> <br /> Quite possibly the most original series so far, it has almost everything I could ask for. A side story, so to speak, of an unconditional love that will NOT be admitted, a very blatant comedy and a very well composed voice (both Japanese and American translation). <br /> <br /> If not for this awfully entertaining aspect, it would be another anime. <br /> <br /> More or less, as I have noticed, "I love it or hate it", very few people have seen introduced to this series will end up disliking it. <br /> <br /> The original to the core, with everything you can ask for in the afternoon, bet on this series. I am ready to make sure that you like it.
