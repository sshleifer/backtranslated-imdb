An unconventional historical drama with beautiful battle scenes. Tobey Maguire provides excellent performance and receives quite good support. The script is literary and quite original, and the film is fortunately free of heroes. He said it was a bit long and the last roll is too similar to a mini TV series. Nevertheless, the work of Frederick Elmes makes someone interested in boring bits (and from time to time you see a shot that reminds you that he worked for David Lynch). Worth seeing.
