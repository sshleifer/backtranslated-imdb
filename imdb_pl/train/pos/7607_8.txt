It is not well filmed, well written or played well, but it must be the most addictive program I've seen since the Twin Peaks. Every single revelation is so well planned that you have to see the next episode to get any closure. They even slowed the pace of the show, revealing only a small amount of information on the episode, but it seems that they just told you everything you wanted to know. However, some of the acting is just awful, and some duologies are simply brutal. Some characters are very two-dimensional. More experienced actors, such as Locke and Ecko, really stand out from the actors playing Jack, Kate, Sayid and so on. The development of the series can also be very frustrating because the next episode may not show what the previous episode has led to. Annoying side threads have become part of a story that says nothing to you. However, the second season has developed to the point where the stories in the back reveal more about the island than before. All in all a great performance, but not perfect.
