I've seen this movie more than once. It was on par with the many terrible things that were then shown in television movies. The only problem I had with the title for obvious reasons ... Immediately thinking about the famous Drake cookie snack! Leaving the first part of "Hound of Hell" would be enough. <br /> <br /> Richard Crenna always manages to bring seriousness to everything he does, regardless of whether the plot is good or bad. But it was a nice Halloween tariff offered by the CBS network. I loved the part where Crenna takes a flight to some unknown country to find a mystic who would help him defeat the beast. He asks a taxi driver how to find this guy. A great dialogue between the native taxi driver and Crenna in terms of a cabin that rejects the ethnic beliefs of its own people. "Aw, Mr. Barry, I left it behind me when I got off the mountain ..." - referring to a mystic who rarely sees or advises people, and no one knows how to contact him. <br /> <br /> When it comes to the supernatural price, this movie is still pleasant.
