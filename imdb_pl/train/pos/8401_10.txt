The love trap is an independent "must see" movie. When I sat down to watch the movie, I came with low expectations, but left it with a blessing. History is poetic, substantive and creative. The writer draws you further and further away from every scene, allowing you to refer to realistic characters with whom everyone can identify. The film allowed me to reflect on my life and what I consider to be love. The film showed what love and action really are, not emotions. I was also impressed by the quality of the photos and the soundtrack of the film. The whole presentation exceeded my expectations. I give the film two big thumbs and I recommend it to everyone of all ages and all environments.
