It's sad that this movie is the top, which should be at least in the 250 best films here. This is still the best action movie ever made. Today's action films are badly made. Actors and action directors do not mind doing just that, fighting and acrobating. only some can not do it mainly from Hong Kong, like Jackie Chan. The stunts are so clever and wild that I do not think we will see something like that. The beginning, in which Chan and his team are going down the hill, is amazing. The final stunts are for me the best feats in the fight ever made. The final stunt slipping down the pole hitting Jackie's window was seriously wounded.
