I caught this film by accident on the cable in the middle and I had to rent it to see its whole and I'm glad I did it. I was immediately attracted by this story and concerned about the girls involved. Naive secondary school graduates, the best friends from childhood, go on a trip to high school and are picked up by a cheater named Nick, who causes them serious trouble. They are used as sacrificial mules in the heroin smuggling ring. The girls arrested are learning to deal with imprisonment, trying to find a way out of their troubles. Everything that they are trying to help is not enough when the Thai criminal justice system shows shortcomings and the girls have more trouble and lose the confidence of the American lawyer "Yankee Hank". Hank tries to defend them after he feels betrayed by Alice (Claire Dane). However, the local wife of Hanka in Thailand smacks the rat on this matter and performs further foot tests and learns that the girls really were victims. The end of the movie, when Alice does a disinterested act to save Darlene (Beckinsale), he was in tears. I really liked this movie and I recommend it.
