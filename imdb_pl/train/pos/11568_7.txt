One of the many Merrie Melodies cartoons that entertained American moviegoers during World War II, "An Itch in Time" by Bob Clampett depicts a hobo flea settling on Elmer Fudd's dog. The little guy turns into a real sadist, making a house on the back of a dog, but Elmer warns the dog: "One more observer, and I will give you a bath!" Meanwhile, the flea sets the dog on dynamite! * And that's not the end! I noticed that in one scene Elmer reads a comic book with Rabbit Bugs and Porky Pig. Of course, Elmer and Bugs often performed together, but Elmer never played with Porky (unless you count the very short "Any Bonds Today?"). But for me, thinking about Elmer reading about these other famous characters from the same genre underlines the metaphysical nature of his world, as if he knew about their existence in his universe, even if they do not appear in this cartoon. > <br /> Of course, I probably went too far in my analysis. I am sure that this cartoon was meant to be pure entertainment and it certainly amuses. When it comes to the "I'm allowed to like" line, it sounds as if the censors did not let you, but somehow missed it; First of all, I do not really know how to sound. Was this something sexual? As for the end, if I thought that I had seen everything, I would be tempted to look for more and not do what the cat did (although it was a fun trick). <br /> <br /> * The guys behind these stories had something to do with TNT, right?
