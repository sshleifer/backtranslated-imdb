This story never belonged to my favorites in Christie's works, so I was pleasantly surprised that I really liked this adaptation. The mouse motif was effective, if a little exaggerated, the bones of history are there, although more emphasis is put on the "crime in the past" thread. The students were almost as I imagined them, although it is a shame they were not a more cosmopolitan group - perhaps the changed setting from the thirties did not allow it! I thought that very daring risks were taken during filming; maybe because I have not read the book for a long time, but it seemed pretty obvious to me who the killer was from appearing in some revealing pictures quite early. <br /> <br /> early Poirots. Sometimes it works, but in this episode I found a lot of this quite heavy (although I smiled to the line "Lemon sole"). All in all, however, a solid entry in the series, although not one of the best.
