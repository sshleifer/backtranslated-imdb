I'm a Star Trek fan for as long as I remember. When I announced the plan and the premiere of the fifth series, I was very excited. <br /> <br /> The Enterprise premiere was worth waiting for. It was well done thanks to the perfect frame and great acting work done by all the characters. NX-01, Enterprise is the perfect vessel to show the beginnings of what many people have come to love. <br /> <br /> Scott Bakula was simply better than Captain Jonathan Archer. Jolene Blalock gave the provincial performance as Subcommander T'Pol. That only two people from this wonderful new team boldly bring us into the great story of Starfleet. <br /> <br /> The Enterprise looks like it will be a good series worth watching and recommend. Watch it.
