I saw ZP when it was released for the first time and I found it a big disappointment. His script seemed forced and arched and too false in the 1960s. It's a policy too upfront and ridiculous. Let's face it, I was still influenced by a love spell known as BLOWUP: and I still have not shaken him completely. Now "love" is twisted by all sorts of nostalgia that it evokes and, well. . . Happiness to me! <br /> <br /> But time marches and time were nice for ZP and time was a teacher for me. I visit this film again roughly every ten years and it gets better with age. And ZP is his own "experience" and is really connected to BLOWUP through his creator, the late great Antonioni. <br /> <br /> Twelve years ago I was very fortunate to see absolutely pristine printed, displayed in the right size (huge), restored by the Italian cultural agency of the government, who knows a good work of art when he sees it, and knows how important it is keeping this kind of beauty in good shape. To this day, I remember the audience's sigh when the first shot of Death Valley appeared. It was like a visual shock of a thousand volts that Antonioni deliberately provided to awaken us to a new level of consciousness. And indeed, what follows from this point is a completely different kind of "place". <br /> <br /> It's amazing how this movie has its own. <br /> <br /> I remember the second time - in the early 80s - I began to feel sympathy for the film as a whole, and in particular for Daria and Marek. While the two of these seemed to be an intelligent, shadowy version of Olivia and Leonard Zefferelli (read: Romeo and Juliet), they now engaged me - especially the Girl in her insistent slo-movement-alita. She took her time. . . Live. Everything, EVERYTHING dies around her. <br /> <br /> After an exciting theater, the light of Reality quickly began to erase my newly discovered "pleasure". Furious, padded arms, big hair from the 80s whispered "But that's hippisowska fantazja - let it go" <br /> <br /> The strength of Antonioni's vision, as I realized, was already in my FIRST time, so I replied "80s "" Uh-Huh "and guarded my" love "secretly, possessively and jealously. <br /> <br /> But this is what good art is in you, and if you want, it has its own way and "loves" you back: secretly, jealously and possessively. And "you changed." <br /> <br /> He was happy to see that Turner Classic Movies decided to show ZP in March. Undoubtedly, ZP must be seen on a giant screen so that he can really move you into his constructed environment. But, hey, sometimes even the gaze of the beloved in the photo from the newspaper is not better than any look. <br /> <br /> Today's reality hit, ZP was mysteriously withdrawn and replaced by the bizarre antics of the ALICE RESTAURANT. <br /> <br /> So it is still too "difficult", too "disturbing", too "what"? <br /> <br /> Maybe as with all good art, it's alive when everything around him dies. <br /> <br /> Room.
