"Midnight Cowboy" was classified as X with the original edition in 1969. There are several scenes where you can understand it, just a little bit. The film about Joe Buck (Jon Voight) coming from Texas to New York to be a hustler is sometimes a bit worrying. Disguised as a cowboy, he tries to live as a hustler, earning money through the act of love. It does not work as planned. After a guy named Rico "Ratso" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) first lunged at him and stole money, they become friends. They live in an empty and very dirty apartment. Then Ratso gets sick and Joe has to try and earn some money. <br /> <br /> The movie has probably been rated as X for the main theme, but we see weird things along the way. The editing in this movie is great. We see dream sequences Joe and Ratso interrupted by the real world in a nice and sometimes funny way. Dustin Hoffman, Jon Voight and support actors give great performances. Hoffman especially provides some great known lines. The score was made by John Barry and sounds great. All this makes it a great movie that won a good Oscar for the best film.
