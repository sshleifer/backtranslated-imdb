Do you think it's difficult? You should check this movie. Carl Brashear is the epitome of courage and determination. What this man had to go through to become a navy diver should be an inspiration for us. And significantly, after watching this movie, I learned that what is shown is not even half of it! Cuba Gooding, Jr. he does his best job as Brashear. De Niro, as always, is good, like a southern corner that trains him. George Tillman in his second main film (after "Soul Food") made a huge leap as a filmmaker. If you want to be moved and inspired, you definitely have to check it out.
