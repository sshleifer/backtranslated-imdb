Wow, this movie has had a huge impact on me, it moved me. This is an amazing story about a Cambodian girl who is sold to sexual commerce. I can not stop thinking about the fate of a little girl named Holly. The film setting is realistic. The movie was an eye opener, I can not imagine anyone leaving him, not wanting to help change this terrifying problem that exists. <br /> <br /> The content of the film was very moving. It was one of the best movies I saw this year. <br /> <br /> the girl who plays Holly performs a fantastic job with her character. Ron Livinston gives a fantastic performance. The film moved me to tears, tells an important message that must be heard all over the world. Everyone should see this movie. I think this movie will make a difference, I loved it!
