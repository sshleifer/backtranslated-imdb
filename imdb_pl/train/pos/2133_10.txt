I lost count how many times I saw this movie - I probably know the whole dialogue backwards - but it still attracts me. <br /> <br /> In Hungary, young Jimmy Stewart plays an eligible bachelor "Kralik", who becomes a secret admirer of the innocent "Klara" Ma≈Çgorzata Sullavan. Kralik secretly becomes a friend of Klara's pen, and Klara, at work, entrusts Kralik with the content of letters (Kralik). Apparently, Kralik is infatuated with Klara - but he is unable to reveal his feelings when he competes with "a friend of a pen." Confused? Well, you will not - this story has a sweet, almost sweet end - but we all know that this is the end we all want. <br /> <br /> Other characters worth mentioning are Frank Morgan, who plays his usual role, this time as the owner of the store "Hugo Matuschek", Felix Bressart as "Pirovitch", the trustee of Kralik. Joseph Schildkraut as a female arrogant "Vadas" - so well played that you can not help him, but hate him from the very beginning. <br /> <br /> Finally, William Tracy, who manages to tie all of us to his overly-confident junior shop "Pepi Katona". <br /> <br /> Recently reworked as "You Got Got Mail" with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan for me is not as good as the original - although I suspect a younger audience would not agree. <br /> <br /> If this movie is in your area during Christmas, I suggest you pour a glass of good wine, put a fire in the fire and have a Kleenex box at hand.
