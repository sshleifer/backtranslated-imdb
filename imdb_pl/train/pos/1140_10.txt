I am a fan of this film for years and years. Due to the fact that the Teri Hatchers move at the head, I had to take the film off the shelf and watch it. Why did people in 1991 not see how great this film is except me? Sally Field and Kevin Kline are fantastic. Although I have never seen soap operas during the day, this movie kills me every time I watch it. Acting is second to none in comedy, and writing is so clever. I highly recommend watching this if you have not already done so. You'll see Elizabeth Shue, Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher and Carrie Fisher ... just to name a few ... they all give great performances.
