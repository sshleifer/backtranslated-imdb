My main problem with the movie is that it lasts too long. Besides, it's pretty good. Paul Muni plays a poor Chinese farmer who is going to marry an arranged marriage. Luise Rainer is a maid who marries Muni. They live with Munie's father on the farm and they do badly. When he finally gets some money to buy more land, he dries and nothing grows. All the stars that Muni are heading north are initially left behind. When they leave and come to the city, it turns out that they have no job and are worse than before. They even think about selling their youngest daughter as slaves for money, but they are not deciding about it. When a group of people begins to plunder the city, the army appears and begins to execute people. Paul Muni does a good job and Luise Rainer won the second Oscar for this film.
