While the movie sometimes seems a bit long, it's worth it. Gordon manages a style reminiscent of Vonneguts writing style. Ruthless, thoughtful, ironic, bizarre and dark, it's a movie that will stay with you for a long time, begging for answers to impossible questions. Nolte, Goodman and Arkin are amazing. Sheryl Lee is also great, in a role that reminds us of Lynch fans about her days of Laury / Maddy. Do not miss it!
