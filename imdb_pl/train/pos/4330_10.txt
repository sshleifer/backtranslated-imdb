<br /> <br /> "Bleak House" is the best adaptation of Charles Dickens' novel that has ever appeared on the screen. Being one of my favorite novels, I was extremely happy with this Mini television series. Late, great Denholm Elliot was perfectly manned as a noble John Jardica, and Diana Rigg was pure perfection as doomed to the failure of Ladty Dedlock. The film captures the essence of the Dickens era and is extremely faithful to the book, which allows making small plot cuts that do not affect the story. above all, a brilliant, moving and atmospheric movie.
