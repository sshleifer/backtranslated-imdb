This is my favorite movie by Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. The dialogue between them is so sweet and funny and very clever. Not to mention this movie featuring some of the best songs recorded by these two; how do I put all my balls in one basket and let's face music and dance. If I remember correctly, it was a movie that introduced me to Fred Astaire, so I suppose that for this reason it will always be a special place in my heart (sorry for sentimental cr * p, but I am a woman, so give it a rest) in this whole movie is 8/10 from me. The choreography was great, and the fact that Lucille Ball is in it makes her even more amazing.
