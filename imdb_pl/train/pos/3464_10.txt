* WARNING * Attackers in front of you ... The authors of this story knew these people very well. The actors also presented them very well. As a result, at the end of the movie, you feel that you are actually watching John Lennon and Paul McCartney. The expected tensions exist, especially in awkward first moments. But when they both begin to relax, the old companionship that has made the Beatles work so well begins to manifest. Bitterness is still present and sometimes bothers you, but before John comes up with the idea of ​​taking Lorne Michaels to his proposal to pay the Beatles a sum of $ 3,000 for appearing in "Saturday Night Live", they can both be the same boy jokes that terrorized Liverpool together as teens, and survived playing in the hottest nightclubs in Hamburg to form Superstards. But finally this wonderful fantasy is based on us gently. We are reminded of why the Beatles' convention was probably never possible, not even before Lennon's murder: the two driving forces of the group have outgrown each other.
