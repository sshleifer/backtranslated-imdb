Now all children and teenagers from Springwood, Ohio are dead, because one teenager (Shon Greenblatt) is still alive. Freddy (Robert Englund) lets him go, and the teenager does not have much memory when he comes to the new city. When a tough woman psychologist (Lisa Zane) tries to break a new patient. He learns where he comes from. He brings him to Springwood, to mention a few memories, but three teenagers (Lezlie Deane, Breckin Meyer and Ricky Dean Logan) who unexpectedly came for a ride. After arriving in Springwood, the psychologist has some memory that she lived in this city earlier as a child. While Freddy knows the real secret of her true identity. <br /> <br /> Director: Rachel Talalay (Ghost in the Machine, Tank Girl) made a gloomy, but slightly strange sequel with a certain visual style and fun moments for this horroru / fantasy / thriller. Yaphet Kotto (Alien) has an auxiliary role as an expert in the field of psychology in dreams. It has some brilliant visual effects (not everyone will love the culmination, especially in the 3-D) and some good style in telling stories. This movie included some of the movie series at the box office. <br /> <br /> The DVD has a strong anamorphic panoramic transfer (1.85: 1) (also in Pan & Scan mode) and a powerful Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The DVD has an original theater trailer, the Jump to a Nightmare review and Cast & Crew information. "Box Elm Street" Set Box, the eighth CD contains interviews with the cast and crew of this sixth film. The sixth film is also in 3-D for the movie's culmination, but it can also be viewed in 2D. This is the last of Elm Street, in which Wes Craven resurrected Freddy into a darker style in New Nightmare and stupid but surprisingly pleasant spin-off horror Freddy Vs Jason. See Robert Shaye (co-owner and co-general director of New Line Cinema), Roseanne Barr, Tom Arnold, Johnny Depp and Alice Cooper in fun scenes. Written by Michael De Luc (John Carpenter's In the Mouth of Madness). From the director's history. (*** Â½ / *****).
