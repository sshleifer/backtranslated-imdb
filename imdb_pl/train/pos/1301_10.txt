I loved the whole Cream job, even if there is such a small and valuable work directory that you can take into consideration. Even when they go as long as twenty minutes with some of their songs (Spoonful and Toad off of Wheels of Fire are prime examples), they still turn up their socks by more than half of every current rock act today. This gel power on stage is one of the most-anticipated rock bands ever to have been at the Royal Albert Hall concerts last year. Perhaps they have grown old, just like their fans, but energy still exists thanks to the great arrangements of classic blues songs and their own. White Room, Badge, Politician, Spoonful, Sunshine of Your Love editions, no one seems to lose their rhythm. Clapton solos have a formation that sometimes is not on stage with a solo band. Ginger Baker, just say. Jack Bruce is strong enough that his vocals still have the power that Clapton would never be able to get. Ultimately, if you want to see what were the best programs you wanted to see last year (well, some people could see them), that's all on this DVD, with cool special features.
