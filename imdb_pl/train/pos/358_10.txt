The purple color tells of the struggles of life and love, which helps those people who are strongly affected by the struggles of life. Each character had a purple element in it. The film touches love, confusion, hope, hatred and triumph. if it was Celie who survived the hell and lost her sister, and Shug entered her life to show her love again, Albert was not a man who corrected his mistake against Celie, Shug avoided his father and confesses him at last, Sofia and her stubbornness good and bad, and even Nettie, had their emptiness and difficulties in the film, but they were finally defeated and this is a sign of a good movie. Good job for all cast and crew.
