Ten years after the first film, James Belushi, one of the most talented and light-looking comedians of the last twenty years, returns as Detective Dooley to the film. <br /> <br /> If you're expecting more from the first movie, you'll be disappointed, but it's still a good movie. Realizing that all battles of Dog vs Man were probably used in the first movie, this turns out to be somewhat more psychological in its approach because it focuses on the criminal with the fixation of the recently deceased wife Dooley after she rejected his book and blames Dooley for her death. <br /> <br /> The script may not be the best, but the film allows both Belushi and Christine Tucci to show their good acting skills, while maintaining a fairly light humor the first movie to make it work, and the chemistry between the two stars is available for everyone. <br /> <br /> An easy, light movie that, though it may not be worth buying, unless you're a real fan of either the first movie or Belushi, definitely worth a look when it comes on TV. <br /> <br />
