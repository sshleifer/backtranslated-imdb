Recently, my friend and I discussed educational and ethical influences as we grew up in the fifties compared to today's. She mentioned Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who in 1798 wrote The Rime of The Ancient Mariner. We both had to recite excerpts from an epic poem in high school and in English literature courses at college. My friend said: "His messages can even be called metaphysical in today's context." <br /> <br /> We tried to recite it and we only remembered the pieces. (I have a problem remembering Dr. Seuss.) I said I would get two copies of the poem so that everyone could read it. It was quite easy, but I was very surprised when I saw that a movie was made of it. We waited impatiently to watch the movie to see how it was interpreted. In the end, the Rime of Ancient Mariner is not exactly a light reading. After reading each poem, we watched the film together. <br /> <br /> We considered the film an extraordinary achievement, especially considering that it was created in the 1970s, in front of computers, before the so-called , "And before the special effects began to compensate for the lack of substance too often. Particularly noteworthy are illustrations from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, derived from "lesser-known artists," such as Willy Pogany, an early Hollywood designer. <br /> <br /> The film is told by the narrator Sir Michael Redgrave, who taught the poem when he was a teacher, adding a tone of authority and credibility, remaining true to the poem. <br /> <br /> Its mastery lies in the layers of subtle messages, transmitted without "instructing", or becomes an oppressive and obvious tale of morality. We decided that it is such a refreshing change from today's mentality "in your face" and "humming over your head". Most of today's moral messages in the movie are two-dimensional: extreme violence, murder and chaos mean bad. The bad ones are really, really bad and they are great heroes. It's as if the human figure had no nuances. Rime of the Ancient Mariner is a celebration of individuality, character, and appreciation for the celebration of all the riches that life has to offer, in the broader context of humanity, i.e. Man's ability to give to others. <br /> <br /> Proud of ourselves that we found this "unknown" gem, we learned that he won the main prize in his fifth category at six international film festivals. Another surprise, which was learned by the film's director, Raul daSilva, is the recognized authority in the field of early animation and the author of six award-winning books about the film. <br /> <br /> The message of this film is just as important today, if not more so than when Coleridge wrote the original epic poem and when Raul daSilva translated it into a movie. If I continued to teach high school, what I did for five years, I would take it and show it to all my students. There is a level of wealth here that naturally leads to a discussion of the great and important issues that we all have to deal with, be it in 1798, 1978 or today - in fact, as long as humanity has a spiritual component. /> Highly recommended.
