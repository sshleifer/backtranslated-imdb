Wow. Uhm ... well ... wow! I think I'll start with the story. The fianc√©e (Lucy) arrives at the family home to be a husband (Mathurin) in France, where they are waiting for the arrival of a bishop or cardinal or someone in the Catholic Church to marry them (to satisfy the will). waiting, young Lucy learns about the legend of the Beast, who wandered around the places from centuries ago. That night in bed, he begins to fantasize about the Beast and his rape, which became a consensual meeting with a former lady of the house. That's where it gets interesting! The plot is really quite thin (and seems to be pulling for some time in the middle of the movement), but the filmmaker rewards (?) Those who stick out with a shocking and funny finale. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for everyone. If you're looking for a great cinema, look somewhere else. If you're looking for a long-range movie about bestiality (which almost looks at the subject), this movie is for you! (If you have a weak stomach, do not be afraid of it. Apart from the beginning of the horse action, the "acts" are quite cartoonish, IMO)
