I saw this film in the avant-premiere at the Imagina Festival in Monaco. <br /> <br /> I saw the first trailer four years ago and from that moment I was waiting for the final result. I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> This is a full 3d movie with high contrast black and white rendering. Clearly inspired by some comics, such as those from F. Miller. In this optics goes a step further than the perfect adaptation of "Sin City" by R. Rodriguez. This time (almost) there is no gray or any middle color, but a graphic style never before seen in a realistic animated film. a lot of life and credibility for the heroes, and we quickly forget about the technical aspect to focus on more classic elements, such as direction or plot. The direction remains sober and controlled despite the infinite possibilities of the medium, and this is a really good surprise. <br /> <br /> The futuristic story (Paris 2053) makes it a classic science fiction film and keeps the viewer interested until the end. Despite the classic plot (an investigation that goes far beyond the initial expectations), the atmosphere and some interesting recurring themes (genetics, the absolute strength of some companies ...) give this film a great deal of interest. <br /> <br /> Despite being an animated film, this is obviously not intended for children. You will not find here any funny pet or any stupid family, only a cold reality. It's far to a good noir movie. <br /> <br /> I discovered that this is one of the best aspects of the movie: we still feel well-known Paris, but the subtle accent of futurism changes. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I regret a few mistakes. The editing is sometimes a bit flat, one or two very slow effects in slow motion and bad dialogs. Although the technical is perfect, it shows its limitations in some romantic sequences (as in the case of "final fantasy"). These little things make it 7/10. <br /> <br /> In summary, this is a successful artistic challenge that you must see if you can. The director, Christian Volckman, knows how not to fall into potential pitfalls (fortunately, they did not ask John Woo to do his job!). <br /> <br /> In summary, it is a film with explosive images, intelligent history and a great art direction. See if you can! <br /> <br /> I apologize for spelling mistakes.
