A skilful little episode played mainly for laughter, but with a clever pile of tension. Somehow Martian jumped on a broken bus on the way to nowhere, but who is a passenger (talk about illegal immigrants!). Supporting the star cast, from the wild-looking Jack Elam (shamelessly), to the sexy Jean Willes (if he's a Martian, then I say: let's open the limits!), To cruel John Hoyt (the most obvious suspect), as well as familiar faces John Archer and Barney Phillips (and a nice return from Bill Kendis as a bus driver). It makes the game last a long time, even if the action is limited to one set.
