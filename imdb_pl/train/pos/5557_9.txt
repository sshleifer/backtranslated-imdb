"A Mouse in the House" is a very classic cartoon of Tom and Jerry, faithful to its tradition, but with its own jokes. He is hysterical, funny, very funny and quite funny. The graphics are also of good quality. <br /> <br /> This shortcut is not just Tom who is trying to catch Jerry. Butch lives in the same house and also tries to catch the mouse because "there will only be one cat in the house in the morning - and this is the cat that catches the mouse". <br /> <br /> If you ask me, there are many funny gags in this cartoon. The funniest for me are, for example, when Mammy Two Shoes sees two lazy sleeping cats and says sarcastically: "I'm glad you enjoy the siesta," and he hopes they are happy because it is not, making the two cats sapiÄ…. Another funny gag is that Tom dresses up for Mammy Two Shoes and hits Butch with a pan, and then Butch does the same with Tom. Of course, even more funny than when the real Mammy Two Shoes appears and both (stupid!) Cats think they see themselves dressed as Mammy, and then they both attack her on the "back" - lol. Of course he's mad, and when he gets mad, he's not someone he was afraid of. But even Jerry does not win this time because he is also expelled by her.
