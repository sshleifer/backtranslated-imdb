Tonight I saw an advanced screening of this film. I liked it very much. The film kept me on the edge of my seat all night. Cillian Murphy is incredibly terrifying as a villain. For those who saw Batman Begins, his character was very scary in this movie. He played his character very well. The most terrible "bad guy" I've seen for some time. Rachel McAdams was great. Everyone in the audience laughed, panting and cheering at the same time as if we were on call. The tension lasts throughout the entire movie. It is amazing that the end was not anti-climatic. In the end, I was not disappointed. I felt satisfied. The trailer does not do film justice. The film is much better than the trailer indicated. Do not wait until this movie comes out on the video. Go see it. Although I did not have to pay to watch this movie, I would gladly give 10.75 to see it. Enjoy!
