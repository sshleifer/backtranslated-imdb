This film is not only a great movie for basic cinematography (script, acting, set design, etc.), but also for its realism. This film can take place on any farm or rural farm. It does not matter if the film takes place in Louisiana or would it be in Kansas. The history and messages contained in it will remain the same. This film shows family values ​​and connections for an older audience, and at the same time shows youthful behavior for younger viewers. Everyone who watches this will go away with something that touched them personally, I know that it will. The end strikes too close to the house, so that I will not burst into tears every time I watch her. The ending emphasizes the importance of farm security, and anyone who has ever worked on a farm must see this film. Not paying attention and negligence leads to dangerous situations. <br /> <br />
