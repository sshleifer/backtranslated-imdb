This was another message for World War II and Allied soldiers to watch out for rumors. They were called "instructional" cartoons, because they were a mix of serious messages along with a funny-looking main character "Pvt. Snafu. " <br /> <br /> We all have an imagination, along with fears and whether or not you, and this is what happens here as Pvt. Snafu incorrectly adds two and two to what he hears and invents the "five". You can start panic and all sorts of disasters if you spread enough gossip and enough people will not believe it. This includes the loss of trust in your country and your case, as indicated here in this figure. A good way to lose a war is to demoralize the enemy. It still continues today. <br /> <br /> "We lost the war", declares one big baloney at the end of this cartoon. Incredible, as some Americans have not yet learned. This cartoon can be 65 years old, but today it matters. When I write this, two terrorist attacks took place in Europe, and some people still think that "War On Terror" is just a bumper slogan. Incredible. <br /> <br /> The writer, the famous "Dr. Suess", uses here the analogy of "hot balloon juice" to present the above message. With Theodore Geisel (his real name), you know that rhymes will be clever. <br /> <br /> Nothing here is fun, but it was not meant to be. You must understand the climate of 1943 and the legitimate paranoia that took place during World War II. People forget that the war could easily win after winning the other side. It was a tight time
