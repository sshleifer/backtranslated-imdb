Scene adaptations often have a serious error. They often come out looking like a movie camera was simply placed on stage (eg "Night Mother"). Sidney Lumet's direction keeps the film alive, which is especially difficult because the picture did not give him a real challenge. Still, it's nice to look at what it is. Chemistry between Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve is quite brilliant. The dynamics of their relationship is surprising. Caine is fantastic as usual, and Reeve has one of the few opportunities to really act. <br /> <br /> I admit that I have never seen the art of Ira Levin, but I hear that the adaptation of Jay Presson Allen is faithful. The script is incredibly intricate and lets you guess. "Deathtrap" is an extremely funny movie, recommended to all fans of the stage and screen. <br /> <br /> 7.4 out of 10
