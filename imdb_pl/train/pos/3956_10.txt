HUSBANDS BEWARE is a remake of Shemp classic BRIDELESS GROOM. The new culinary scene of the film at the beginning of the film is great. The guards are always funny when they cook. However, after the first few minutes of the culinary recording, we cut the original BRIDELESS GROOM material. One of the things I noticed in these adaptations from 1953-1956 is that they fit the new story. They take pictures if the old story does not fit. <br/> <br /> BEWARE MEN have a new ending, but I will not give them back to those who want to be surprised. > <br /> **** with 4 stars.
