Note that everyone who did not like this movie and did not like it, commented that it is not as good as the book or that it is different from the book. <br /> <br /> I do not understand this type of criticism. Books and movies are various media. While books have hours and hours to develop characters and storylines, movies have about 120 minutes. The film, however, has the advantage of stimulating several senses: visual, auditory, and imagination. I do not care if the movie is so good, or in fact it is similar to the book on which it is based. Who cares? I judge what it is. <br /> <br /> This TV movie was charming. Old and often encountered history, prone to stereotypes, could easily be embarrassing. However, Riffen and Reeves do it. One reviewer said Riffen is very old. I would never guess that she was 40 when she made the film. It's her merit as an actress who played amazingly well from 23 to 24 years old. I also think it's the best thing Reeves ever did. The story could have been stronger and I agree that the game on the screen could have used "tightening". Nevertheless, it is worth to watch it; clearly this is not a powerful love story, but rather a charming affair that will make you happy that love is a strong emotion and good defeats evil. And it's nice to see a "love story" without the obligatory word f # $%, bare buttocks or hours of kissing with a plus. <br /> <br /> Finally, the musical result is perfect.
