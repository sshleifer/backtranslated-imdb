I did not think that this movie was as smart as it seemed, but still enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> It is original, although it reminded me of two other French films, Vidocq and City of Lost Children, mainly due to the color scheme, but also because of the sharp quality of the character's close-ups. /> <br /> Placed in a prison cell, but do not let it put you off, this movie seems to be more than many hit hits. <br /> <br /> Always interesting, with many years of "Black art" in the foreground and very good characteristics, which makes some too credible! <br /> <br /> Horrible with some gore it's worth a look.
