The Best of Times is one of the best sleeping all time. Configuration does not burden your patience, development is constant, many interrelated relationships are established with love, gags and pieces work, and everything is fun. There are many sentiments. Kurt Russell playing Reno Hightower puts one of his best performances, and Robin Williams playing Jack Dundee is as confident as ever. There are also many great supporters in the cast. Jack's wife is played by Jack Palance's daughter, who is adorable, as is Reno's wife, who is a great comedian. I can not tell you how many times I watched the movie, how many times I liked it and how often I would like more people to see it.
