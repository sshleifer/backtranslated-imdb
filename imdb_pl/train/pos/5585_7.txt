It was a very brave movie for the day. It can even be described as a soft porn core in the silent era. It was talkie, but the dialogue was very limited and in German. We did not need it anyway. <br /> <br /> Młodzi (19) Hedy Lamarr is imprisoned in a marriage without love with an obsessive (stereotype) German and after a short time in a marriage that apparently has never been consummated, he returns home to his father. <br /> <br /> In a famous and entertaining scene, he decides to take a thin draft one morning when her horse is distracted by another. Then she is forced to run around the field chasing after him, leaving her clothes on the horse. The engineer regains his horse and returns her clothes - after it is revealed. <br /> <br /> They sit for a moment, and at the moment of zen he presents her with a flower with a bee sitting on top. At this point, she returns her thoughts to the honeymoon and the actions of her husband and insect. He knows that this man is different. <br /> <br /> He returns home and ultimately looks for our young man and finds ecstasy, which was refused. You can use your imagination here, but his head disappears from view and we see it winding with pleasure. Since you've never undressed, you can imagine ... Certainly a tribute to women made by director Gustav Machatý and shock to the viewers of 1933. <br /> <br /> The only thing that covers this beautifully filmed movie, excessive wine and a strange ending.
