Chris Gerolmo made sure not to give us a list of murdered people like "Jack-the-stripper": he delved into the psychological characteristics with convincing results. Perhaps mainly due to the excellent performance of Stephen Rei, who plays against Donald Sutherland with good empathy. Was it the game of these two parts? above all ?? which made the film something more than the morbid history of Rostov's butcher. Supporting actors, especially Max von Sydow, did their parts well. Good management. Photography was also good. Needless to say, the fact that the film was shot in Hungary had to trigger some aberrations, but to be honest, given the depth of the story and interpretation, we can completely forget these little trivialities. <br /> <br /> Once, the film made for HBO television appeared as an asset. Recommended, especially if you want to analyze the characteristics and forget about some morbid scenes? what, I will add quickly, it is never exaggerated.
