HOLES is not the usual Disney material - it is very, very funny, even for adults who usually cringe on the cutesy, focusing "family entertainment" designed by Uncle Walt as a live action. Perhaps the secret of the success of this film is its loyalty to the original book, which is a bit darker than in the case of the average child. The action begins when Stanley Yelnats is sent to a boys' camp, where all prisoners are forced to dig holes under the desert sun as a form of restoration. But as the story unfolds, Stanley's story is intertwined with the story of the legendary treasure, and this adventure becomes ten times more fun than any Disney movie about a prisoner-of-war camp for boys. Jon Voight is particularly nasty and colorful, and Sigourney Weaver is beautiful, as always.
