This one has a lot to do - Sinatra, Styne, Cahn, Pamela Britten - and a smaller amount of dross - Iturbi, Grayson - plus some noise - Kelly. This was the first real Sinatra movie, in which the producer spent PLN 1 and could be seen on the screen (previously appeared in two low-budget, Higher And Higher and Step Lively), but if only they relied on the Sinatra tubes and deep sixth places Grayson and Iturbi ' egos that stumble over the ego, we would be left with a much more tense film and a better showcase for Sinatra. As she plays very hard in all her songs from two Kelly duos - We Hate To Leave, I Begged Her - for my own solos, What Makes The Sunset, The Charm Of You and I Fall In Love Too Easily. Despite this step, Lively remains the best Sinatra musical of the forties in one-tenth of the budget.
