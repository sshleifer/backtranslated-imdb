I did not think about it that way at all, but my friend said the first thing he thought about when he heard the title "Midnight Cowboy," which was gay porn. At that moment, I knew only about this in the episode "Seinfeld", in which Jerry tried to take Kramer to Florida on this bus, and Kramer was sick and had nosebleeds. <br /> <br /> The film was great and surprisingly optimistic, not all annoying, pretentious pessimistic, like some movies that I do not even remember, because they are all nonsense. <br /> <br /> The story essentially consisted of the naive young cowboy Joe Buck to New York, trying to be a hustler (basically a male prostitute), thinking that it would be an easy gathering, just to hit the brick hard the wall when the woman ends with him, ordering him for their sexual encounter. <br /> Then he meets Enrico Salvatore Rizzo, called "Ratso" by all and cute gays who make fun of him all the time. You consider him a scoundrel, but sympathetic (like Han Solo or Lando Calrissian) and surprisingly he and Joe become friends, and the movie is so sweet and cordial, watching how friendly they are and so and so. Rizzo reveals that he is really a sad, pathetic man who is very sick, very depressed and self-conscious, he hates to be called "Ratso" and wants to go to Florida, where he thinks that life will be much better and all his problems will be solved, and he will learn to be a chef and be famous there. <br /> <br /> It's warming to see Joe do his best to both land in Florida, along with lots of funny moments (like Ratso trying to steal food at this hippie party and getting caught by a woman who says "Oh dear, you know, it's free, you do not have to steal it" and he says: "If it's free, I do not steal it, this classic moment is completely uncripted and unplanned, where Hoffman almost gets hit through Taxi and shouting, "Hey, I'm here! I'm going here!"), and acting is so trustworthy, you never believed that Joe Buck would have grown up to be an outstanding and respected actor Jon Voight, and Ratso Rizzo would have grown into legendary and beloved Dustin Hoffman. This is not the first time they have worked together in major roles, but chemistry is so dense and intense. <br /> <br /> Then there is a sad part, which in my opinion is an exaggeration to call it "depressing". Ratso Rizzo breaks down the whole movie, can barely walk, barely eat, coughs a lot, is sick and reaches the bus on his way to Florida. It hurts a lot, and only a few miles from Miami finally dies on the bus. The bus driver assures everyone that nothing is going on, and he continues. Sad, but not in a way that would make you go home, cry and mourn in your mourning, like losing a dog for 13 years. <br /> <br /> In all, a great movie. The soundtrack to a large extent consists of only "Everybody's Talking", played throughout the film at the right moments. Strange move, but great, because the song is good and perfectly matches the tone of the movie. Go, look, that's great, go buy it
