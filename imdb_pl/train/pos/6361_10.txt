I've been waiting impatiently for the opening of this movie for several months. Being a huge fan of Jim Carrey, I could easily see how he could turn into Grinch Seuss and make his own. I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> This movie was pure magic. Carrey is a master in his industry and no one could play this role to perfection as he did. There was a lot to offer for both adults and children, and this film will surely become a timeless classic that everyone can use in the years to come. I already have visions of my young daughter sitting year after year to watch this remake on video, and I will undoubtedly watch and laugh with her, as I did for the first time when I saw it. Jim Carrey wrote the whole movie on it and I do not believe he met without it. However, the supporting cast was lovely and fun in itself, especially the lovely Taylor Momsen, which was the perfect foil for Carrey's antics. The set, musical score and costumes put their hands on a magical, fabulous ready-made product and I believe that everyone involved can be proud. <br /> <br /> It's not easy to turn a 22-minute cartoon classic into a full-length live action movie, but Howard has been successful in flying colors. For those critics who disagree, maybe your hearts are two sizes too small.
