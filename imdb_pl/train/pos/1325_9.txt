I saw this movie at the Adelaide Film Festival '07 and I was intrigued by all 106 minutes. I like documentaries, but often dragging them takes about 25 minutes. Forbidden Lie $ driven, never losing my interests. <br /> <br /> The theme of the film is Norma Khoury, a Jordanian woman who gained fame and happiness in 2001, publishing the book Forbidden Love, a biographical story about a Muslim friend who was murdered by a family for a relationship with a Christian. However, several years later, several journalists began to wonder in this story, which led the public opinion that it was a scam. The film covers it quickly but precisely at the beginning, and from there we spend most of our time in the company of Norma, who tries to convince us that her novel is more than just fiction. <br /> <br /> Anna Broinowski has found a truly fascinating woman to learn and leads endless interviews with Khoury, who is looking for the truth. As always in life, the truth is not easy to find. Norma is afraid for her life, worrying about the violent opposition to the distasteful portrait of her novels painted by Jordanian Muslims. He refuses to return to Jordan and shows us the facts. Broinowski is not discouraged and slowly puts pieces in front of him. <br /> <br /> The result is an amazing look of the artist's mind. Of course, what we find there does not make sense and is extremely difficult to follow, and ultimately we do not know whether to believe Norma or not. She is either an unjust woman trying to survive or a fantastic maiden. The network of lies, truths and half-truths that turns in the film is genius. <br /> <br /> The film uses many recordings from interviews, as well as dramatisations telling its story, and Broinowski uses these dramas to show us why people like Norma are able to exist: we want to be deceived. We go to the cinema every day and let us believe that what is happening on the screen is real. It may just be a bit too much, but it did not appear in Q & A with Brionowski after the film, but that's what I picked up. <br /> <br /> This is a great Australian movie and must receive an international premiere, as well as payment for prizes, if you ask for it. Certainly the best movie I saw in AFF07. <br /> <br /> See if you have a chance.
