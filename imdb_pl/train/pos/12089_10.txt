<br /> <br /> A movie dominated by the raven-black Barbara Steele, it was evident when I was seven or eight years old and created permanent images of pale vampiric men and women persecuting the castle, looking for blood. Steele is an icon of horrors and unearthly beauty, and the views of the deceased pedestrians precede Romero's DEATH LIFE, joining them in my mind. <br /> <br /> I do not see the relationship between this film and THE HAUNTING, which is clever but ambiguous in relation to the current forces. LA DANZA MACABRE is a film without pretensions that dares to fall in love with Barbara Steele and face the consequences. There is no tie like terrified Claire Bloom from HAUNTING. Comparisons with HAUNTING are superficial. <br /> <br /> And no, this movie does NOT have to be rewritten. Not only is this a product from the sixties, but a large percentage of talented morons in Hollywood can not understand MACABRE's formula for terror. This formula is based on one overriding factor: GOOD WRITING. Low classics, such as CASTLE and Corman's Poe with R. Matheson and Tourneur OUT OF THE PAST, share a strong position. It's easy. Get a real writer like Richard Matheson or Steve McQuarrie and let them enter today's movie mess. In addition, let Hollywood try to change some original material and stop using apparently a better product from the past.
