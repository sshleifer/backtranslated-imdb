Dark Angel is the intersection of Brave New World Huxley and Love in the Ruins of Percy - depicting a not-too-distant future as a disturbing mixture of chaos and order, both in the worst sense of the word. Once we assume that all modern technology can be stopped by "Pulse", it provides a fun landscape to explore the personality and relationship between the two main characters - Max (Dark Angel / bike messenger) and Logan (rich rebel). It seems uneven, perhaps due to the diversity of authors, but it is joined by the energetic, beautiful and charming Jessica Alba, which seems both strong and horny, but sensitive and sensitive. I think Fox did it again.
