NB: Spoilers in the middle. This great movie is "about" many things, all successfully: travels in sci-fi, unstable psychologies, dystopian society, the "what is real" syndrome, gradual undermining belief systems, global bioterrorism and the emerging love story. <br /> <br /> The consequences of the twisted timeline trigger a lot of heated debate - they are the witnesses of the discussion on this page; or, extremely, check the hearing at www.mjyoung.net/time/monkeys.html. Whew! Such temporal accents speak mainly for the genius story, coming from the wonderful work of writers David and Janet Peoples, not to mention the inspiration of Chris Marker "La Jetee". Undoubtedly, this is one of the most successful, fascinating films traveling in time. But here are many other levels. <br /> <br /> The real genius of the film is to focus on the nasty side effects of time travel in the mind of James Cole (Bruce Willis, doing the best job in his career) here). His journey proceeds from a warrior catching a gung-ho vaccine to a gradually blown victim? and back. The second broad story increasingly emphasizes the personal story between James and Dr. Kathryn Railly (wonderful Madeleine Stowe). I love the simultaneous movement / opposing points of view of these two characters. For me, everything appears in the hotel room scene. At the moment, James? once mastered by unwavering determination? now he is completely in doubt about his own reality; while Dr. Railly ?? cool and rational scientist? in the end, he became extremely convinced, after absorbing James' evidence, of his terrifying prophecies. Her desperation to get to James and stick to the mission shows how far she has come. <br /> <br /> Gilliam makes us take care of these characters, especially through the crescendo of tension that threads their lives. The balance between the emotional roller-coaster and the assembly of the sci-fi puzzle / thriller is outstanding. And the solution at the airport is extremely intense, because we see it so clearly in James's dreams. It's here, just after James decided to quit the whole mess? and struggles with his madness more than ever? that he returns to the plate and does what is necessary for humanity. See Jose and the gun? (Just before that, references to Hitchcock's "Vertigo" and identity change / confusion are brilliant.) This is a movie that needs to be mixed up between thinking people; not only supports repeated observations, but requires them. "Twelve Monkeys" are intelligent, provocative, bizarre, funny and full of tension songs. <br /> <br /> Supporting cast is great, especially Brad Pitt steals all of his scenes and shows great flexibility as Jeffery Goines, mad and spoiled but always survivor. And there is David Morse as Dr Peters (curious how the film just leaves the viewer his wicked motivation) and Christopher Plummer as Dr. Goines. But the greatest praise belongs to Terry Gilliam, surpassing here - barely - his outstanding "Brazil". (Many similarities, of course, especially lonely combatants, trying to escape from the disintegrating environment: insanity inside, lunacy without.) Each frame of this film has its own unique stamp and tone. The soundtrack is also great. <br /> <br /> This is one of the greatest achievements of the 90s, my favorite and will definitely last for a long time.
