I've never seen this when I was a kid, so it was seen with fresh eyes. I never heard of it and I hired for my 5-year old daughter. Besides, Christopher Walken's idea of ​​singing and dancing is interesting to me. The special fx is bad, and the singing and dancing are mediocre. But the story is great. My daughter was delighted. I loved to watch Walken in the role, thinking about what the future would bring him. It's very funny to see him dancing! And if the songs were not great, at least not excessively sweets produced by Disney. The ogre scene at the beginning was a bit frightening to her and she was a bit nervous when we saw him again at the end, but it was mostly gentle. Interestingly, recently we read "Puss in Boots" and wondered about the unreliability of the story. But fidelity to almost every aspect, acting Walken made him credible. Great fun. I would watch it again with my daughter.
