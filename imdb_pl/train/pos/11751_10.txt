Kurt Russell is at its best a man who lives from his former glory, Reno Hightower. Robin Williams is his polar opposite in a rare performance as Jack Dundee. He gave up the Big Pass in more than one way. <br /> <br /> You'll see some of the most-cited scenes that have ever been put in one movie, like Jack hisses at the rat, Reno poses and caribou's cries coming out. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this classic, which is not afraid to show football in the mud as it should be played.
