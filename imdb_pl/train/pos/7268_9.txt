With everything that happens in the world, sometimes we need to escape. Curly Sue is just that. It is not a complex plot or a deep meaning; however, he is not deprived of substance. There is more to it than a furious action or a dramatic heartbeat. There are cute little shows that you can watch with your children and have enough substance to enjoy your date. Try it, you may like it more than you think. The little girl is really smart and adorable. "Dad" and the girl are going through some slapstick procedures. When a jealous boy appears, trouble arises for Curly, and her known life can be broken. Fred Thompson and Kelly Lynch play good roles, and Alison Porter and James Belushi are an interesting tale, like a duo depicting homeless vagabonds. Their worlds collide and a comedy arises.
