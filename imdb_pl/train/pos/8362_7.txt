An updated version of the story, which was transformed into a movie from England in 1938 (Return of the frog), about a pursuit led by the police criminal master known as the Frog because of a frog, such as getting up (bulging eyes, etc.). <br /> <br /> One of the good Wallace movies from the 1960s is a solid little entertainment. Clearly influenced (or affected) by the re-launch of Dr Mabuse's films, Frog appears to be a more villainous character than a master thief. Although it is not the best Wallace movie, it's worth watching. It would be an interesting double element with a great previous movie. <br /> <br /> Between 6 and 7 by 10.
