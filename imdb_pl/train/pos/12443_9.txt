I liked the movie. It was a joy to see a version so close to Peter O'Donnell's vision. <br /> <br /> Many people did not like the movie, but it must be seen in the context of the history of origin that it is. The film uses a flashback to show young Modesty and the events that shaped her into the woman she became. In front of the network. Before Willie Garvin. <br /> <br /> The pace is a bit slow, and for my taste there is not enough tension in today's scenes. However, this is only allowed to get such a faithful version. <br /> <br /> If you like Modesty Blaise, you'll even like its flaws if you just need action with car chases - forget about it. br /> <br /> He has the feeling that he is the first franchise, but because I have never seen her promoted anywhere, I suspect that he will no longer be able to follow. Unfortunately
