It's a story about the Winchester Model 1873 rifle "Gun that won the West." For a cowboy, outlaw, peace officer or soldier, Winchester 73 was a valuable treasure. The Indian would sell his soul to have it ... <br /> <br /> Winchester 73 is the first collaboration of director Anthony Mann with actor James Stewart, a duo who will create a series of excellent westerns that added a new psychological depth of the genre. The story tells Stewart how Lin McAdam is chasing a man who killed his father. Coming to Dodge City with his trusted friend, Johnny Williams (Millard Mitchell), Lin hits the Dutchman Henry Brown (Stephen McNally), the man he wants. But when Wyatt Earp {Will Geer} took all the guns from those who entered the city, both men are unable to shoot at which they are ready. Instead, men take part in the competition to win the Winchester 73 rifle, the competition that Lin ultimately wins. But before he can leave the city with a great prize, the Dutchman will attack him, steal the rifle and leave the city quickly. When Lin sets out in pursuit of the hatred of both man and rifle, the rifle will change hands several times, each time adding another dimension as the settlement day for all approaches. <br /> <br /> A very benchmark for the so-called "psychological West", Winchester 73 is basically a story about a decent man brought to the limit of madness by an event from his past. Black and white pictures {the only western duets that were} landscapes are still breathtaking feast for the eyes. The tone begins with the opening scene, like Lin and Johnny on a horse, and a silhouette that changes on the hillside when they go to Dodge City. This is just the starting point in which Mann will use her perspectives as a way to run in parallel with heroes' emotional states. <br /> <br /> Stewart gives one of his best and most intense performances as McAdam, proving once and for all that he was one of the best and most versatile actors in America. Support staff is not so bad either. Shelley Winters is excellent as the only woman among machismo, while Mitchell, McNally, Geer and always great Dan Duryea add another class to the proceedings. There are even some fragments for Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson, although the latter playing the brave Indian is too far away. <br /> <br /> Originally the film was a project for Fritz Lang, who even prepared a script to run. But Lang went away from what turned out to be a blessing for Western fans. For such a great director as Lang, directed by Mann {and with the new screenplay from Borden Chase and Robert Richards in his hands}, he set the wheels in motion to change the course of the genre. Not only thanks to the continued efforts of Mann & Stewart, but also because of who they were influenced by. People like Budd Boetticher, Nicholas Ray and Sam Fuller took notes, and with joy for the Western purists followed their lead and continued carrying a psychological torch. <br /> <br /> Big hit at the box office at the time of the release Winchester 73 is a great movie that still hits modern times. 9.5 / 10
