This is an absolutely charming movie, one of my favorite romantic comedies. It is extremely funny and the cast is great. Although Laurence Olivier is associated mainly with his work of Shakespeare, he shows in this film that he is not limited to playing only in classical theater. He manages the transition from a cynical divorce attorney who tries to avoid women and their treacherous behavior, to a loving puppy who falls on Lady X, played by Merle Oberon effortlessly. The dialogue is wonderfully witty and refreshing, and the atmosphere is charming. Ralph Richardson was also delighted. I would highly recommend.
