Bell Book and Candle was released in December 1958 and includes James Stewart, Kim Novak, Jack Lemmon. and Ernie Kovaks. This film had James Stewart and Kim Novak in their second pairing on the screen (after the classic Vertigo by Alfred Hitchcock, released earlier that year). It was Stewart's last film as a romantic film, because at the age of 50 he was considered too old to play that way. The film tells the story of a witch played by Kim Novak, which is attracted by the mortal played by James Stewart. He casts a spell on him and falls in love with her. I liked the movie and its cast. This movie at the time was a moderate success, nominated for the Golden Globe for the best film comedy. GimmeClassics
