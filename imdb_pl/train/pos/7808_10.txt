It's a movie everyone should watch. Regardless of picking up extremely important points (while South Africa is on the right path to recovery, there are still many countries in similar situations), it is superbly directed, while Denzel Washington gives in my opinion the best results in its current career. Kline also gives a good performance, though maybe not as stunning as Washington. John Thaw also turns in the role of a police chief. <br /> <br /> There are so many possible areas in which the movie about apartheid can fall, but all of them have been avoided. It would be easy to just introduce white people as bad and black as good, but Attenborough did not do it. Sure, there were a few white figures who seemed inherently evil, such as the captain in the Soweto uprising, but adding extra dimensions to all characters would make the movie unbearably long. Some people complain about the length of the movie, as it is, but I think you need the whole two and a half hours to tell the whole story because it really is amazing. <br /> <br /> The best scene in the film is the funeral of Steve Biko. When the whole crowd begins to sing the national anthem of South Africa, this is probably one of the most moving scenes I've seen. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie: watch it. It may not be convenient to watch, but it is certainly worth it.
