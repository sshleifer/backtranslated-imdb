me and my sister rent it every time we have movies, and our parents got so mad (but they let us in) and I love it ... I can not find anyone who lives nearby, who knows what I'm talking about. .. I'm glad I'm not the only one who loved this movie ... It's a pity I can not find it somewhere on DVD !! I would love to watch it now, but I love it as much as a small child ... and now I am 15 years old !!! I remember that much ... where I got a song with a little bunny fufu and all my friends know the song, but not the movie !! I think a little girl got there, slipping down the slide on her little playground
