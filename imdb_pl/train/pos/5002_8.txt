I had the honor to see excerpts from Aardman's original course in Britain. It has always been fun and always fun. None of the charms have been lost in translation - it's as fresh as the people you talked to - no matter if some of them are scripted or not. It is always fun. <br /> <br /> Aardman Animations shows the great imagination in characters used for each voice, the only aspect that I like the most in the series and its concept (hostility between pandas, porcupines discussing the fear of needles, monkey painting). The regulars really grow on you, such as teenagers and donkeys from Maryland, most of the spouses (parrots, insects and cats, just to name a few) and a character with a child's voice, and I really came to the ferret mole! Monday finally becomes the day you can expect.
