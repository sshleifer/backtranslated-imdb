A nice short Shirely Temple. Children actors shouting about their lines seemed the norm for this day and hour. Perhaps "to see and not hear" had to be made up. Besides, it's great. Given the era of movies, there are some aspects of this thing, from a social point of view, that seem to me both very progressive and liberal. I will not go to those here, I'd rather not spoil it for you, but I will let you see it for yourself and see if you will notice these elements. As early as it was easy to see on the basis of this abbreviation the fascination that was already developing in the temple. This makes it worth watching if you are a temple fan. For others it is a fun way to kill ten minutes while you wait for your night glass of milk to warm up on the stove.
