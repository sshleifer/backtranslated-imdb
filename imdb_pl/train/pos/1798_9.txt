I saw this Saturday night at the Provincetown Film Festival and it's a stick-to-your-bones movie - it really stays with me. Adapted very elegantly from what is probably a great novel, it is a drama with full rounded figures, thoughtful consideration of life choices and I am not exaggerating. one of the greatest casts ever made in over 100 years of filming. A great job from everyone, led by the great Vanessa Redgrave as the dying, cheated mother of Newport, and Claire Danes as her much younger self. Mamie Gummer, daughter of Meryl Streep, is, like her mother, a real arrangement; Patrick Wilson looks like Paul Newman around 1958 and is not overwhelming; and what a pleasure to see such great stage actors as Barry Bostwick and Eileen Atkins bringing sharp, detailed scenes. Hugh Dancy, also from the stage, does not add much importance to the somewhat clich√© role of an unfortunate rich wastrel, and family problems can be solved more efficiently than would allow real life. But it's a deliberately thought-out, visually wonderful meditation on real problems and you can cry on it and not feel recklessly manipulated. What a great car parade from the 1940s and 1950s.
