Filming is pleasant and the environment is realistic. I liked that he boldly restores the concepts of many difficult moral and social moray in the Chinese continental village of the 1930s, as well as more basic human questions - I felt that I could get a real sense of time, recreated even in great pictures of traditional Chinese theater and purist presentations of street life. It was worth experiencing. The interwoven role played by Buddhism is probably the most faithful form - both in the linguistic and philosophical aspects, perhaps the most effective one I have seen in the Chinese film. Casting is great. The paintings are unforgettable. The operation is solid enough. Theatrical childish, but still rich enough to praise the vehicle of his expression.
