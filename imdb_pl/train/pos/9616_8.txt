It is worth watching twice because of quick causal changes between several fascinating stories. "Bug" appears as a completely satisfying work of art, which always plays an optimistic love against countless examples of frustrating reality. <br /> <br /> My favorite heroes are Wallace (John Carroll Lynch), whose overriding concern for life - from cockroach to airline passengers for which he is partly responsible - is framed by the film; Olive (Christina Kirk), who spends a lot of time creating surreal, but tasty meals for her impossible husband Ernie (Chris Bauer); and Mitchell, a cable television technician with unlimited confidence in the news about fortune cookies: "You will meet the girl of your dreams." <br /> <br /> Against this optimism are the forces of bizarre reality, all the characters generated by the action: parking tickets, clogged outflow in a Chinese food / donut shop, television interference, crushed car fender, faded dinner reserve, which ultimately results in the cancellation of Hawaiian holidays. <br /> <br /> The movie is funny: Olive gets drunk on Chippendale, Johnston (Michael Hitchcock) as a customer service representative, trying to deal with an annoyed customer, an obsessive Cyr (Brian Cox) in front of the restaurant inspector, Dwight (Jamie Kennedy) reacting to his girlfriend's refusal to have children by writing a hostile fortune of Chinese cookies: "Your girl lies to you" and a guy who falls asleep while maneuvering with a pneumatic hammer because he spent the night looking for his girl's missing cat. <br /> <br /> And a small story with public cable Host access (Darryl Theirse) and local acting teacher from "The Boy in the Bubble" expresses the main theme: love comes from the heart. <br /> <br /> "Bug" is playing at the same level as "trains, planes and cars", but with a lower budget and fresher eye.
