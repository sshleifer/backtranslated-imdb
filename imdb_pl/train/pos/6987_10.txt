Putting away the "things" of UFOs. It was the best document I saw. Actual reports of Neil and Buzz ... must be seen. Interviews and relationships are a revelation, because most of the information was stamped in secret in 1969 and released in 2006. Until now, no document has details or accuracy ... will be delighted with the risk that appeared first on the moon ... Neil and Buzz are probably the greatest hero of our time. Have you ever seen a man saving his life? Do not put up. Neil saves his life as soon as a mile-second separated him from death. Amazing to watch. It is travesty, which people did not know all the details of landing on the moon and the courage that these people had when they faced a certain death, a falling computer ... 10 stars!
