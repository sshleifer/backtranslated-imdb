"Pecker" proves that Waters has no intention of changing his sticky ways to old age. Many things have changed since Waters started making movies in the 1960s, but 40 years later he still does what he wants. For years, the budget of Waters movies has increased significantly. This is one of his newest productions, but I was amazed to see that Waters still has this "trailer-park". Edward Furlong plays Pecker, a kid who is obsessed with photography. He lives in Baltimore, MD, with friends and family. But Pecker attracts the attention of a New York art agent (always watched by Lili Taylor), and his life changes into the worst. Once again, Waters jokes about art, fame and heterosexuality. He is not one of his best films, but there are big laughs ("Memama" has the best lines in the movie!). He is consistently smart and funny, and has a very "strange" sensitivity that I have come to love in Warters' films.
