The plot was quite interesting, but the characters were rather flat and sometimes too extreme in their thoughts / behaviors. More extreme than necessary. I also think that something went wrong in the casting. John Turtorro did not satisfy me playing half-autistic chess, let alone an Italian player. The motifs were not too drawn too. <br /> <br />
