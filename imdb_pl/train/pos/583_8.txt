Two brothers grow up in a small town in Montana. One of them is Norman (Craig Sheffer), the other is Paul (Brad Pitt). Their father is the Reverend Maclean and they grow up in the lessons related to religion and fly fishing lessons. In this film, fly fishing represents life, a bit. <br /> <br /> History is good and keeps your attention, although there are times when you need some action. Probably the movie has such moments, because it's not really about the events that happen, but about the message. Some things happen, however. Norman is going to Dartmouth to study. After six years he returns and engages in a nice girl named Jessie (Emily Lloyd) and is invited to teach in Chicago. Paul became a reporter and is known as a "fishing reporter". He is famous and looks like he has a nice life, but he drinks too much and risks too much. <br /> <br /> The film is very well directed, has a nice result and all actors are good. The cinematography is the most beautiful thing in this film. Mountains, forests and the river look very beautiful. If the movie was created only for these things, it was good enough to watch. Fortunately, there are more.
