I must agree with everyone who has published. <br /> <br /> I watched it some time ago, but I will tell you when I hear a certain music from this anime, I remember the story, the beautiful animation, the characters and the feeling I get while watching, and makes me cry ( such a happy but sad feeling). However, I think that the love story in it seemed a bit quick and did not explain it properly, but it did not spoil any part of watching. <br /> <br /> I was in this anime so much that after the end I just had to do some research (and watch the end a few more times) and found all my answers and much more. I love how they set up historical legends to fit this anime, it was amazing and it just made me want to explore a lot more (I was always very interested in some historical characters related to this anime) <br /> <br /> I think it should be a longer series, but if all that they had to work with, they pulled it out nicely. I recommend it to anyone who likes emotional anime with perfect history, well-built characters (a bit mysterious) and a bit of fantasy. <br /> <br /> Also, although it was based on the game H there is not any of these things in it and I really prefer it this way (I have no problem with mature anime, in most cases I prefer)
