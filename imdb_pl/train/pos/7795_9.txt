This will be a different type of review. I saw this movie twice on TV and would like to have a copy because it talks about Panama and the beach in winter, which is my favorite time. It was the first movie I saw Ashley Judd and it was great, and I enjoyed everything I saw. Sundance's reaction also impressed me, as did director Victor Nunez, who has directed and wrote several films about Florida. This film appeals to me and I have not seen anything to compare it. The plot tells me less than the surroundings. I told you that it will be a different type of review.
