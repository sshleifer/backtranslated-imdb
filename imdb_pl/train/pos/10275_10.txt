Get ready for it: it's one of my favorite movies of all time. I am relatively oblivious to other works by David Mamet (scriptwriter and director), but after watching this movie a dozen times (it's always a joy to watch) I can say without hesitation that he is a genius. This film is very well written and quickly attracts you to the environment of deception, craftsmanship and bustle. The film is very similar to The Sting (1973) and is also a tribute to the film noir. <br /> <br /> This is quite a psychologically complicated movie and will certainly make you think about different twists and motifs of suspicious characters. Sometimes it's a bit predictable, but the shocking climax is always exciting to watch. <br /> <br /> Generally, acting is great - especially Joe Mantegna - but someone with whom I watched the movie noticed that it was not a good idea to have a heroine (Lindsay Crouse) who is not only a gambler, smoker and thief , but also has bad hairstyles from the 80's. I agree, but I think she is outstanding in this role. <br /> <br /> The less you know about the plot of this film, the better, like the latest Mamet movie, the Spanish prisoner, because the ending will be even more impressive. Just sit back and get ready for a movie ride that is dangerously close to brightness.
