A fascinating summary of a would-be male hustler in New York forced to live in a condemned building with a crippled confrere. Extremely grim test of contemporary moral and social collapse, extremely well directed by John Schlesinger (who has never been at the top of his work) and Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman. Quite a lot of holes, but the scenes "fancy" - some of them are played to giggle - are slightly obtrusive, as well as "drugs". The relationships that develop between two men are sentimental, but the filmmakers try not to make a mush, and this gives the image an advantage it may not have with a smaller director than Schlesinger. Originally X-rating in 1969 and Oscar winner for the best picture; screenwriter Waldo Salt (who adapted the book by James Leo Herilhy) and Schlesinger also won the statuettes. *** 1/2 from ****
