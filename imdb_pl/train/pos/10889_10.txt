What does all the negative comments contain? After watching this movie for the first time tonight I can only say that it is a good holiday comedy that will surely brighten up every day of a lonely person. When I saw that Drew (Ben Affleck) could spend his holidays alone, I wanted to cry. You must see the movie if you want to know why. Besides, even though I liked Tom (James Gandolfini) and Alicia (Christina Applegate) after some time, if you asked me, they were real snobs. However, this movie has made me smile and feel good inside. Before I sum it up, I would like to say that Mike Mitchell won a pure holiday hit. In summary, I highly recommend this good summer comedy, which will surely brighten up every lonely day to every fan of Ben Affleck or Christina Applegate who has not seen it.
