DOUBLE EXPOSURE was a huge surprise. It contains outstanding acting (especially from the underestimated Callan), great photos and a fascinating story. In other words, it is one of the best efforts of horror, which emerged in the 80s. <br /> <br /> Callan is a fashion photographer who dreams of murdering his models while he meets his mentally unstable brother (whom lacks arm and leg). When the Callan models dream of killing, they turn dead, the photographer begins to doubt his own mental health ... but the picture is more than he sees. <br /> <br /> This movie never received the praise it deserves. Most critics and filmmakers are pushing it into a horde of smaller films released at the same time, but it stands above the mass of this pathetic fate. It is clever and unique, which is not something that can be said about most films of this genre, but it is also passionately made and made. DOUBLE EXPOSURE is a gem of this kind.
