We recorded it on television in 1995 and we have been waiting for it all these years because it quickly became one of our favorite families. Children are now teenagers and have to see it for tens of millions, and yet they still watch it with their friends. Its timeless charm reaches all age groups - similarly to "Grease". <br /> <br /> Vanessa Williams is spectacular. Jason Alexander is delicious and wonderfully light on his feet. I noticed that other commentators on this page are quite strict for him, but our family gives him the highest marks. (We loved his "Giant Step" number). Marc Kudisch (as Conrad) provides us with a comedy relief and great musical numbers. And Brigitta Dau (as Ursula) just steals the show. Probably our favorite character in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The only disappointment was the performance of Kim with Chynna Philip. Part of this is related to writing. Kim's role is completely one-dimensional. Complicating this, Philip's delivery is flat, unimaginable, unbelievable and just awful. The director should have seen it and improved it. Or never throw it to the beginning. <br /> <br /> In general, the picture is delightful and I highly recommend it for families of all ages.
