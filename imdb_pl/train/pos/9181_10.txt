I had no idea what Jane Eyre was before I saw this miniseries. I have read and watched many classics before and believed that most classics are boring, over-formulated and overrated stories with moderately interesting plots. This Jane Eyre miniseries completely changed my ideas. <br /> <br /> Zelah Clarke is a great actress and she gives a wonderful portrait of Jane Eyre. Her accent is delightful, and her silent but firm nature exactly matches the character of the young governess. Timothy Dalton is an amazing Rochester. His passion and energy in the movie makes me believe that he was born to play in the meditated master of Thornfield Hall. I could not sleep all night after watching this miniseries. The story is both haunting and inspiring. The characters are masterfully performed, and the story is amazing. This is the best version of Jane Eyre ever to appear in the movie. <br /> <br /> I read the book later and was amazed at how much this miniseries followed the text of Charolette Bronte. Jane Eyre is now my favorite movie and book. If you want to see a masterpiece that will change your life, take a look at the 1983 Jane Eyre BBC version.
