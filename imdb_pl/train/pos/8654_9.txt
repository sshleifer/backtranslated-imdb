it's amazing that so many people I know have not seen this little gem. everyone to whom I turned, they came back with the same reaction: WHAT A GREAT MOVIE !! <br /> <br /> I never cared for Brad Pitt (although his turnover in 12 monkeys and Fight Club show improvement) but his performance in this film as a psycho is disturbing, dark and right. <br /> <br /> everyone else in the movie gives great performances, and the slow and purposeful stimulation of the film significantly improves the course. the sense of fear of heroes is constantly growing when they realize what is really going on. <br /> <br /> the only thing that keeps it from the 10 in my book is that compared to what was in front of it, the ending is a little too long and exaggerated. but this is the only drawback I could find in this iconic classic. <br /> <br /> if you watch this movie, make sure that the unclassified director's cut in the mailbox is the best option to display. <br /> <br /> rating: 9
