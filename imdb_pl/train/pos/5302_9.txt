This movie kept me entertained. Comparing it to the Mom Series, Mr. Waters returned to his grim side. It is not so polished. <br /> <br /> Here is the dark side. A message about how success and fame change a person - but more importantly, how it changes people around you. <br /> <br /> There is no false moment in this movie. <br /> <br /> the characters are a bit cartoon ... but I want to believe that it is Mr. Waters who is trying to achieve. <br /> <br /> It is fascinating to observe Mr. Waters' evolution ... This is really his best job.
