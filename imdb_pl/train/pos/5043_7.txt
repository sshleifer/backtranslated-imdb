A very promising directorial debut of Bill Paxton. A very dark thriller / who-really-did-it was recommended by Stephen King. It is a powerful, well-thought-out tale of a horror about a devout but insane man from Thurman, Texas, who is crazy after receiving orders from God to eliminate demons trying to control humanity. A few twists and amazing finale make your money worth it. Most of the violence you do not really see, but still enough to double your stomach. <br /> <br /> Director Paxton plays a twisted man who is known as God's Hand Slayer. Matthew McConaughey is as impressive as the oldest son of a mad man who ends his story with an FBI agent from Dallas (Powers Boothe). Boothe, as always, is solid and immaculate. Swish white button! Highly recommended.
