I liked the movie, mainly because it was telling an interesting story, but the story told in the film was condensed from a much longer story. Because the book has more than 400 pages, it makes sense. It covers the period from the 20's to 70's in the fictional country of South America, and much to match the time available. I think it would be much better as a six-hour mini-series than it turned out in a 140-minute film. <br /> <br /> Even if it's hurried, history does not jump so much that it gets confusing. What has been said is told fairly well. One fault is that Klara's supernatural powers seem incoherent; or should appear more evenly throughout the movie, or should be omitted. Two more defects (which may be spoilers): Esteban's possible return to goodness happens too suddenly, and Ferula's curse seems to disappear, although the tone of the story suggests that it should last forever. <br /> <br /> Acting is perfect. Glenn Close, as a tormented Ferula tigress, is unique. Jeremy Irons, as a brutal, rich man, is also perfect. Meryl Streep, as the main character of Clara, is great, although it is often even better than in this film. There were also many well-made smaller roles. The biggest mistake is that the film lacked a dialect coach; every actor seemed to be speaking with a different accent.
