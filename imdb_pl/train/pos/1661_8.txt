(spoilers?) <br /> <br />, while historical accuracy may be questionable ... (and with the mass appeal of inaccurate LOTR .. such things are now easier to pronounce) I liked his art. Although this is not a movie about the house of art. It provides occasionally some emotion-charged scenes. <br /> <br /> I have two complaints. 1. It's too short. and 2. The voice you hear whispering from time to time is not explained. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 10/10 Entertainment: 7/10 Possibility to play: 5/10
