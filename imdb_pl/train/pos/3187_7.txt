A few years ago I bought several DVDs worth $ 1, which contained two films each. One of them had Three Broadway Girls (an alternative title for the Greeks had a Word for them) and the one, Happy Go Lovely. It's basically a backstage musical comedy that takes place in Scotland and concerns the mistaken identity of one of the dancers who comes from a millionaire limousine. Vera-Ellen is the i-wow dancer, what legs! Ceasar Romero is the producer who risked her after the original lady left because she thinks she's meeting a millionaire whose car I just mentioned. And David Niven is a rich guy who's looking for Vera-Ellen, he's confused with a reporter who should interview her, but he's stuck in blind spot Romero. What I just mentioned may be misleading, but (mainly) it makes sense if you want to check your brain while watching this charmingly crazy comedy with wonderful music numbers performed by excellent lady Vera-Ellen. Romero can be a little crazy here, but Niven becomes stunned all the time. The print I saw was pretty good considering his age and the fact that he is in the public domain. And Vera-Ellen does well with her lines because she is not really an actress. Therefore, I highly recommend Happy Go Lovely to movie lovers who love old-fashioned music comedies.
