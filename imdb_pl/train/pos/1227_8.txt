I caught this movie on my local movie channel and I liked the movie rather. He has all the elements of a good movie for teenagers and not only - this film, in addition to dealing with boys 'and girls' relations and sex, etc., He also deals with the use of steroids by young people. <br /> <br /> The movie has something of a real life - no loud music, no special effects and no scandalous scenes - what was right about this movie. This feeling makes it easy to refer to the heroes of the movie - some of which we probably know where we live. <br /> <br /> In general, a good movie, cool to watch. <br /> <br /> 8/10
