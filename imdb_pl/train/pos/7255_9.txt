This is not a movie that you watch for entertainment, at least most people I know would not. <br /> <br /> These portraits of the cruelty of both the body and the mind, which happen quite well in the war, the characters seem credible, especially because "you read in their minds", something more often found in books and rarely in movies but very well in this song. I would place it next to "All quiet on the western front" and "Die Br√ºcke" in terms of leaving a lasting impression. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that I can not display it at school, along with the other two films - but finding a copy of it turned out to be quite difficult - which is a shame.
