<br /> <br /> I suppose this is not the best movie ever made, but I voted for 10 stars. Mainly because of my feelings at the end. Me and all the people around me were simply touched. This is something you often do not feel. We are all a bit cynical and bored with sentimentality, lazy manipulation or preaching in modern movies. The story of the film focuses on Jane, a young woman in the last stages of MND and friendship, which grows between her and Richard, a man on the verge of collapse. It could have been such a boring and valuable work, but it is so funny, humane and devoid of sentimentality that it wins with you completely and against adversities is a good movie. <br /> <br /> Acting with Branagh and Bonham-Carter is great, especially the latter, which are always credible and strong in their role. Chemistry also raises the film between them. <br /> <br /> The title comes from Richards's masterpiece, an airplane from rubbish and his old paintings. Flying here is a symbol of both Richards 'and Janes' life, which allows living a full life and the other can face the end. <br /> <br /> A beautiful and fun movie that I recommend to everyone. do not let the topic discourage you.
