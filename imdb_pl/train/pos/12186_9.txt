The movie is not as great as many people believe (including my late aunt who said it was her favorite movie). But because of the better part of the movie noir, especially this famous fun house finale, THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI gained an important position beyond the real value as the key to the saga of Orson Welles's failure to win Hollywood. <br /> <br /> In 1946 the position of Welles in Hollywood was mixed. CITIZEN KANE was not considered a great movie that has been seen since then because of the way it was attacked by the Hearst press and the Hollywood insiders themselves. Welles's attempt to completely control (directing and producing and acting) of his films seemed to threaten the whole system. His best work at this time was Edward Rochester at JANE EYRE, allegedly shot by Robert Stevenson, but actually filmed largely (with Stevenson's blessing) by Welles. But the loan went to Stevenson. Only THE STRANGER, a film that benefits from the post-war interest in escaping from Nazi war criminals, brought profit. For five years in Hollywood, it was barely a great recording. <br /> <br /> Welles returned to Broadway in 1946, hoping to regain his critical powers through the production of AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS. But despite the help of Mike Todd and Cole Porter, the musical was a failure in composing the score. His defeat occurred at the same time when his wife, Rita Hayworth, grew with GILDA's performance. So the marriage was also on the rocks. <br /> <br /> Welles had to make money - his production on Broadway led to his personal bankruptcy. He sold his interest in the possible rights to the film AROUND THE WORLD Todd (which finally rue), and also sold the idea of ​​the film about Henri Desire Landru's career to Charlie Chaplin, who was to be directed at it (and who turned it into MONSIEUR VERDOUX). <br /> <br /> The story says that Welles, with a tax bill worth $ 10,000.00, which you need to worry about, was called Cohn and suggested making a film with Rita for advance payment. Cohn was willing to do it, but naturally he asked what the movie was. That was a wise question. Welles was on a payphone in New York in a pharmacy that had a department of books. He grabbed a book with the title "The Lady of Shanghai" and was delighted that it was a great thriller. Somehow Welles persuaded Normally Cool Cohen that Welles knew what he was talking about. Cohn said he would get the rights and sent Welles an advance of $ 10,000.00. After Cohn hung up, Welles bought the book and read it - and found it really bad. He spent time prescribing the treatment and a scenario that would strengthen the character of Elita Bannister Rita. <br /> <br /> Certainly has an interesting story development. Michael O'Hara is a sailor / longshoreman. He saves Elsa Bannister when apparently she was attacked by gangsters in a park in San Francisco. Elsa is the wife of Arthur Bannister (Everett Sloane), a crippled criminal lawyer with a great reputation. He convinces him to hire Michael as the captain of his yacht. The cruise also includes the bitter partner of Bannister, George Grisby (Glenn Anders) and one Sidney Broome (Ted De Corsia), who turns out to be a detective hired by Bannister to watch Elsa. When they can, Michael and Elsa try to find time together, but Broome or Grisby are still appearing. <br /> <br /> Grisby offers Michael an offer - he wants (for reasons related to his so-called fatalistic view of modern society) to get out of it, pretending to be dead. According to Grisby (the story becomes dark here) he can still take his life insurance (though dead?) And use it to escape to the South Sea. He'll pay Michael $ 10,000 if he manages to shoot Grisby. This includes actually signing the document allowing the murder (Michael does not realize that such an award would destroy the need to produce the body if all other evidence suggested that Grisby is probably dead). <br /> <br /> Of course Grisby is killed and Michael is arrested for the murder of Broome (shot dead with Michael's weapon). Michael is being tried with the Bannister defending him and discovers that the latter is doing the second job because he wants Michael to be convicted. Michael is convinced that Bannister is a real murderer and manages to escape just before the verdict of the jury. He is knocked out and deposited in a deserted carnival, which leads to the famous sequence of "funny home" and the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> It's a terribly misleading movie (just like I commented). It does not mean that it is not worth watching - it is visually striking. Follow Michael's fight with the police in the courthouse headquarters, where the bailiff collapses into the judge's bookshelf, smashing the glass. Or the clever use of photography to capture Hayworth's dive from the rock, reflected in Grisby's binoculars. <br /> <br /> Acting is pretty good, especially Sloane (probably the best actor's role). Glenn Anders was a top performer on Broadway. He rarely did films before THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI, and his slimy Grisby is unforgettable. Also, Ted De Corsia deals very well with Broome - a detective who really looks for his own interests at his own expense. <br /> <br /> As for Hayworth, she points out a performance that was different than most I've done before (BLOOD AND SANDS, STORIES FROM MANHATTAN and STRAWBERRY BLOND are exceptions) and is an unforgettable mermaid. Welles' O'Hara is a very unusual character for an actor - a nice but naïve man who learns a difficult way not to believe in what he secretly wants to believe. It's not KANE, AMBERSOMS, OTHELLO, TOUCH OF EVIL or CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT, but it's a good movie for it all.
