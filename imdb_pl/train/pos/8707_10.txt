"Mechenosets" is one of the most beautiful romantic films I have ever seen. The movie name can be translated into English as "wearing a sword". The main character (Sasha) was born with one unique skill: he can protect himself with an extremely sharp sword that emerges from the skin in his hand. On the first page, he may seem like one more stupid superhero from a senseless movie about unreal events and feelings. But this is not about Mechenosets. It's hard to even call him an antihero. I think she is only a person who has lost her meaning in her life and faith in goodness, justice and love. He never met someone in his life who could understand and love him (except his mother). Every step of his step is stained with blood; he will take revenge on all for his gift, which has become a condemnation for him. And suddenly he meets her. I do not need idle talks and explanations. He loves him for who he is. He does not care what he did. The fact that she is next to her is more important than anything else. Soon, however, he discovers his secret: he kills two people (her ex-boyfriend and his bodyguard) to protect her from her eyes. Even after that, she could not escape her feelings. They try to run, but it's hidden. In the end, they have a serious car accident. He is in a cage; she is in a psychiatric hospital. They know nothing about each other, but they believe that he will save her. He overcomes many obstacles, but eventually he finds her. They run again, but they are not indestructible. She is injured, needs rest, but the police almost catch them. He does not know what to do, they run into the corner, and then his sword begins to cut trees, a helicopter around them, but there is no need, because he is already dead in his arms, and he is again a lonely person around the world.
