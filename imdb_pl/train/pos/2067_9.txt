Although it is widely accepted that the Fearful Symmetry episode was influenced by the episode of Kolchak They Have Been, They Are, They Will Be, regardless of whether it makes a rip off or a tribute, it is a more controversial point. As a big fan of both series, I agree with this second faith, although less charitable can not do it. James Whitmore bravely took on the management of such a difficult episode, invisible elephants and gorilla suits sound like a recipe for disaster, but he pushes it away with style, and the teaser is an absolute jewel. Lance Guest does a great job, making a credible hero from Kyle Lang and Jack Rader with a booming threat like Ed Meecham. Forget the dubious originality of Fearful Symmetry and enjoy it as a deeply satisfying X File.
