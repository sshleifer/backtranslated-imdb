The Sopranos is probably the biggest show in the history of Dramatic Television. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to think of another series that can boast such a large intelligence, sublime writing or first-class performances. <br /> <br /> epic range produces fresh and iconic characters and a consistent level of high quality. At the center of the life of one Tony Soprano, a man who lives in two families. One of them is a conventional wife and two children from a nuclear family, the other a large mafia group from New Jersey, of which he is the head of both. He played James Gandolfini, True Romance and The Mexican Fame, Tony is a fascinating, scary but nice guy. Gandolfini must fully praise the creation of a female and frightening aggressive brutal, a truly recognizable and perfect leading man. The contemporary American drama has never had such a shocking and cult character as Tony. <br /> <br /> The cast of hundreds can never boast a flat performance, and such prominent characters as Paulie Walnuts and Ralph Cifaretto will remain in your memory forever. <br /> <br /> The real genius of this story, however, is the courage of the creator and writer and the revolutionary approach to the conventional drama series. Twenty minutes of long sequences of dreams, powerful and original use of symbolism and metaphorical images, and really shocking scenes of violence. However, all this style meets with real touching themes of love, honor and respect for the family. The series never becomes cold or unreasonable. <br /> <br /> With TV now competitive and often poor Sopranos stands high above the rest as the most original and fascinating drama of America. Forget about Redifined Family. This is television again defined.
