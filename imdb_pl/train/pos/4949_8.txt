10 ELEMENTS OR LESS are one of those photos "under the radar", which is steeped in the simplicity of most independent films: fair, temporary performances of two leaders - Morgan Freeman and Paza Vega, who create a rather complementary, though unlikely duo. The great thing is that the whole movie looks incredible despite the roots of the "road movie". How the unnamed figure of Morgan Freeman mentally (not physically) comes to the place where he meets this jaded girl from the cash register, who has an unhealthy relationship with her current supervisor (which also happens with her husband playing in the film, played by Bobby Cannavale in a small role) is something more than a witness to us, and their witty banter - two people on opposite sides of the society's medal - is deceptively simple. In short, while there is no roar! moments of shocking revelations, this movie is a bizarre, small piece of mood that probably disappeared in shuffling indies, which appeared in 2006, but deserves to be seen, if only because of its sincerity.
