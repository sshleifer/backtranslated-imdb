I consider this film the best movie about Mike Hammer, with the performance of Biff Elliott, who is the final Mike Hammer. Harry Essex's screenplay is perfect and contains many improvements in Mickey Spillane's novel. His direction is strong and ingenious, and he uses light and shadow greatly. Working with the camera of John Alton is at the highest level, just like Franz Waxman's score. The cast included many veterans, as well as Peggie Castle in her unforgettable performance as Charlotte Manning. In summary, this is one of the best private eye films ever made. Biff Elliott and Haar Essex should have more options. I have always appreciated this film.
