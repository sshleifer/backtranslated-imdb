This movie is a great example of the state of erotic B movies: bad porn videos without hardcore sex. The plot in this is not so bad as it happens; concerns a lawyer who tries to prove that her lover is innocent by killing his wife. The rest of the film, however, leaves much to be desired. Bad acting, bad direction, bad woman, bad sets, bad pictures, bad sound and bad sex scenes. The creators of the film should learn the difference between lewd and erotic. They do not even have common sense that Gabriella Hall is naked or on the love stage. <br /> <br /> How silly is that?
