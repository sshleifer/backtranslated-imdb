It's a great series. You will laugh, you will cry, these wonderful people will be part of your family. The way this family takes care of each other and helps each other through the crisis is a perfect example of how we should live. There are many good things that they do, and many bad choices, but they never turn away from the family, they work with problems. Michelle, the youngest daughter, is the sweetest thing I've ever seen. Stephanie, the middle daughter, suffers from a medium-sized team and thanks to the help of EVERYTHING in the family is better. DJ, the eldest daughter, grows up, whether her dad wants it to happen or not. One thing everyone shares is that they miss their mother. Danny (Dad), Joey and Uncle Jesse love these children so much, as you can see in every episode.
