This is a movie that I decided to see and see because I am a big fan of adult animation. I often say that when a film does not evolve around a famous actor or actress, but rather a story or style, it allows the perception of a film rather as a work of art than to show the actors' ability to differentiate its styles. <br /> <br /> This film is certainly more of a style than history. Although I find this story interesting (a thriller that borrows history and atmosphere from films such as Blade Runner and many anime movies), it was sometimes difficult to track it and I did not want it to happen together. he could have. It definitely had a mixed sense of French animation and Japanese anime. Whether it's good or not depends on the viewer. Visually, this film is a feast for the eyes and in this sense a work of art. <br /> <br /> If you like adult animation, or would like to see a movie that differs from most currently available movies. I would recommend it. I can only say that I liked the movie experience, but I was a bit disappointed because it could have been better
