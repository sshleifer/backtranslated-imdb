This is a good example of a film that is worth more than watching despite its low rating. The story is addictive and it does not take long before the chemistry between Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin draws your attention. Acting is first class and characters are well represented. Sometimes it seems that the director could not decide for a drama and a romantic comedy himself. Presentation of Ben Chiller observing the law and the shy Englishman S.M. warehouses hidden in the bedroom create a lot of laughter moments! As in the eyes of Nicole Kidman, who has long been offering John the first taste of intimacy ... At other times the actors, especially Nicole Kidman, give this comedy a fairly professional character.
