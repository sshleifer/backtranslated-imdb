I am sad to say that I do not agree with other people in this episode of Columbo. Death Lends and Hand is a really boring Columbo for me. After a few moments, I get bored and change the channel. I still love Robert Culp and Patricia Crowley and Ray Milland in their roles, but the story was weaker in this episode than in others. First of all, Robert Culp plays the researcher for the character of Ray Milland. He hires him to examine his young beautiful wife played by Patricia Crowley to see if he has an affair. In return, Culpa blackmail the wife of a cheater, who plans to put his plan to her husband, who will ruin his career. Out of anger, Culp kills her, hitting her face and setting her body in a different place. I do not know. Maybe I did not care. Of course, Columbo finally gets it. It's just a question, how.
