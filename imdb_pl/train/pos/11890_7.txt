It's quite a boring movie. Well shot with realistic performances, especially very good from Depardieu as a cad and bad boy with realistic location mood and art-house connotations around the world, it fails because the director does not take a position, position or critical commentary on the subject he defines. One of the respected and permanent partners in France on the films from Depardie - I believe that they did 7 together - Pialat does not get involved. It seems to be a treatise on why women fall into a bad boy who will hurt when they have a caring boyfriend and a good husband ready. Isabelle Hupert, who plays a filanderer with a nonchalant distinction, offers answers to criticism, such as "I do not know"; "I like his arms"; "I like the way she loves" to her inquisitive husband who is trying to get her out of the house, but he soothes and reconsiders because ... I assume he loves her. So he accepts and hopes for what? That one day he would wake up and come back. There is no such thing in Pialat's condescending style with long speeches and even longer scenes that do not add up. I know that the answers do not add up, but please take care. Jules et Jim, it is not. The last shot as cold as the movie we just watched is heartache and a headache only for the most forgiving.
