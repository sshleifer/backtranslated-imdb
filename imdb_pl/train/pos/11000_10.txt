If you came to the film with expectations, throw it now, because no noise will do this movie of justice. <br /> <br /> Classifying this movie into one genre would be criminal. It is a spy thriller, has noir elements, action fragments, science fiction and cyberpunk connected with a brilliant narrative, feature bends and great photos. <br /> <br /> Much of the comments here are centered around the fact that they are derivatives of other films in both good and bad directions. But, as they say, every Shakespeare story is a crib, so once you're able to avoid it, you're in a crazy ride. <br /> <br /> You will have to suspend your disbelief at some points while the set never becomes unbelievable, there are portions (read: elevator) that have a low budget and a slightly bad look. However, do not confuse what means that it is on the same level as bad Sci-Fi movies, because it is at a much higher level. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for an action, you should turn away. It's pure psychology. But if you want to sit down and devote a good 90 minutes of your life to an innovative movie experience, do it NOW! Watch this movie before you see it cool!
