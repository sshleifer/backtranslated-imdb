Full House is a great program. I'm still growing up on it. I started watching him when I was 8 years old, and now I am 12 years old and I am still watching him. I fell in love with all the characters, especially Stephanie. she is my favorite. she had such a sense of humor. in case there are people in this view who are barely watching the program, you should, because you will be addicted to it. I started to do it after the first concert I saw, which turned out to be the first episode in 2002. it's a really good show. I really think that this program should be designed for many generations in families. and it's great too, because it's the right program for all ages. and for all parents teaches children how to live. nothing terrible happens, like violence or curses. it's just a great sit-com. I give it 5 out of 5 stars. what do you think? OH and the best time to watch when you are home sick from school and even from an old office. It will make you feel much better. Trust me that I am not sick, but I still know that you will feel better. and for anyone who thinks the show is stupid, it's too bad for you because you will not get that far in life, even if you're happy with your life. you really should watch it, and you'll be hooked on it. I'm just telling you what happened to me and everyone else who started watching this amazing program. Well, I have to go to lunch. remember that you have to start watching full house soon!
