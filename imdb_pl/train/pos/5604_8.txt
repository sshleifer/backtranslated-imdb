If you liked Roman Polanski's "Repulsion", you should check out "The Tenant" because it's a similar concept, simply by entering and playing schizophrenic wacko. This is actually one of my favorite films - secondly, of course, after Rosemary's Baby - and it is a simple journey into the mental decline of a man who moves to the former apartment of a victim of suicide. The other inhabitants of the building are scaly and sticky to reduce the noise level - even the smallest "titter" becomes a big issue, and Polanski, who plays in the stars, is becoming more and more paranoid and more and more surrenders to his bizarre hallucinations when the movie brings on. It comes to the point where he dresses and behaves like the previous tenant and you realize that it's only a matter of time before he decides to recreate his fatal jump out the window ... The movie is a bit slow and dreams for but if you've ever seen a Roman movie Polanski, you should know that it will end with a bang and this movie will not let you down. It is also best if you do not question the intricacies of the premise and simply treat it as going crazy, because sometimes it is quite monstrously surreal. Polanski is very good as a timid, demented resident who somehow attracts the famous Isabelle Adjani. We also see how it runs through, which is disturbing and fun at the same time! Shit, he's doing one ugly chick! So fans of Polanski - who can look beyond their thirty-year accusations of pedophilia - should enjoy "The Tenant" as a funny psychological head-trip ...
