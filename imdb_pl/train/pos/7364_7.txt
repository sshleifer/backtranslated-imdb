It's not always easy to explain what a movie looks like, but this time I think I found it. It reminded me of two films: Trainspotting (small criminals firing some drugs and doing stupid things at Schotland) and The Blair Witch Project (due to the style of filming). <br /> <br /> It's about loyalty between two friends, one of them goes out of jail, the other one has not been caught yet. In a stolen vehicle, they drive through the Scottish countryside, but there is no gasoline. When they try to find some fuel, they find a farm in the middle of nothing. The farmer thinks they want to rob him and aim him at one of them. Than everything will go wrong. One of the friends accidentally shoots the farmer's daughter and they have to run away. Below is a man hunting through Schotland fields and forests. Two friends literally have to run away for their lives. <br /> <br /> Apparently this movie was shot in just 12 days. OK, it's not entirely unbelievable, because the biggest part is always in the same place: Scottish village, but I still think it's amazing. Especially that this is not a bad movie. It may not be the best movie ever, but they can still be proud of what they've achieved. I spent a nice time watching the movie and I liked the movie in general. I give him 7/10.
