It is a pity that children's films have not yet been made; dark and deep. He appeared (get) character development (and Charlie is the embodiment of a dynamic character), story development, great animation, emotional engagement and a rational, relative and consistent theme. If it were not for a handful of song and dance roles, you would never have thought it was a movie for children and that's why I give it such a high score. This movie is a great movie, not to mention a film for children. This leads me to the second point: it must be the darkest movie for children I have seen for a long time, coming from the 22-year-old. I would be shocked to see that every child under the age of 8 is not completely frightened by most of the second half and part of the first half of the movie, and it all ends with one of the saddest endings you can come across (ala "Jurassic Bark", for those who are fans of "Futurama") and that's what makes this movie so good. Just because the film evokes emotions that we normally do not like to feel and assume that they are bad does not make the movie bad; in fact, it means that it has succeeded. Good funny videos make us laugh; good horror movies are to be scared of us; good sad movies make us sad. I mean, good movies should MESSAGE you, not just play; this movie moved me. <br /> <br /> Also this movie is incredibly violent by today's standards for children's film and includes topics that by today's standards may not be suitable for some children. Parents, I would say, look at it first. I usually do not say anything about these kinds of things, but I saw it yesterday and even for me it was a surprise.
