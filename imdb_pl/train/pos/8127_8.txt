Although it is a light preaching about progress as the salvific grace of humanity, it is still a stunning movie that promises fantastic science-fiction special effects that would take another 40 years to reach the silver screen. Anticipates the global chaos of World War II, but it expands to the assumption that the conflict lasts 30 years and then tells an epic story of a struggle of a man from under rubble and wild space. Acting seems to be wooden and strangely sterile, but it's probably the result of his contrast with the visuals, which must have been absolutely breathtaking at the time of the film's premiere, and which are still impressive today. This is a film that can not be missed by anyone interested in the SF genre.
