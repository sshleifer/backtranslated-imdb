This movie is one of those that I definitely recommend. It's about a boy, Stanley Yelnats (Shia LeBeouf), who was wrongly convicted of a crime and sent to Camp Green Lake, a detention center for boys. There he is forced to dig holes with a depth of 5 feet and a diameter of 5 feet. There he meets other boys from the camp (Zero, Magnes, Armpit, Squid, X-Ray and ZigZag). Everyone is kicking, not "building a charactor," but they are looking for the illegal treasure of Kate Barlow. Throughout the film (and the book), Stanley learns more about the past, more about himself and more about digging holes. I give this film 9.5, because I am very picky about books for movies (I want the movie to follow the book EXACTLY). But still good.
