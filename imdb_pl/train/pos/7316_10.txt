This movie is one of the best in history, certainly in the genre of horror movies. The claustrophobic atmosphere is excellent, the music is as good as the movie, and the killer is as frightening as possible! The actors are fantastic, RIP Donald Pleasance was fantastic as Dr. Loomis, he made the movie even better. Without it, there would be no essential ingredient in the film. Jamie Lee Curtis is also great as our beloved queen of screams! Her innocence makes her unaware of the real evil that is after her until she finds her friends grossly murdered at home, which of course is one of the best scenes in the movies. It gives amazing performance. I loved this movie because it scared the hell out of it when I saw it in the early 80's and I'm still watching it today because it's a great movie that just introduces you to this world if you could be gutted like a fish at every corner ! The fact that it is a simple format of a crazy man in a mask who escaped from mental asylum and is ready to kill everyone in sight, having no idea that he is there, is just shockingly frightening and gives you even more movie as events although fiction could easily be fulfilled. We all know that, unfortunately, there is evil in this world, and a crazy man with a knife is certainly not uncommon, a very worrying deep fear of all this. Death in every turn. Halloween, of course, shows it in the most frightening way. Horror should be credible and it makes the movie enjoyable. It is simply a simple story that creates a wonderful and frightening atmosphere. In addition to the great psycho story that I love, I believe that the formats are the best that horror offers. For me, Halloween and Psycho are the best movies I've ever seen and I will watch them my whole life and never get tired of them. Halloween is undoubtedly one of the best films of all time.
