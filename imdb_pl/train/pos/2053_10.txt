First of all, I would like to say that this film was more severe than any of the last nonsense that Hollywood dishes prepared from its guts. McBain is a real action movie with more violence than most viewers. It has all the classic elements of the action movie from the late 80s and early 90s ... accidental unjustified acts of violence (ie. When Walken and the team enter into a confrontation with drug dealers to get money, they simply appear and kill instead of letting them live and just take the money), slamming the neck, burning men, the guys who are blown away from the buildings, and of course the guys who are on fire, who are being blown out of the buildings. Walken is the best in this picture, giving unforgettable lines, such as "let's go sit .......... on board". and others that make this movie the best redemption in the rack at your local video store. if you have blood lust for unnecessary accidental acts of violence, rent this movie today and satisfy your thirst.
