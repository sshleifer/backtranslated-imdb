Family and friends tease me all the time for tears after the movies and they were not disappointed when I watched the movie. I cried many times, but believe me it was not over happiness. I was hurting for my family and I was hurt for this man when he tried to buy back in the only way he knew. Denzel was fantastic as always, like Chris Walkin. Mickey Rourke, I did not even recognize it; the years were not nice to him. My husband is not the one who re-watches movies if they are not historically accurate war movies (snoring !!!!). He has watched the movie 5 times and will have to watch it again because he was wearing a tape and he was jumping all the time.
