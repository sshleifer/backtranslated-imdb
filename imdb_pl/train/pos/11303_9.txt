Visconti's first film has a distinctive visual talent and impeccable technique, accompanied by impressive performances by Massimo Girotti as a handsome tramp, and above all Clary Calamai as a fantastic, crazy Giovanna. Rebuilt several times as "The Postman Rings Twice", but it has never been improved. I can not believe it was the first movie of this man! It shows the trust of someone at the zenith of a career.
