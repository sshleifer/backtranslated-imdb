In the hands of a more qualified director, this film would be considered a masterpiece of horror. Despite the fact that Michael "Death Wish" Winner is just a passable direction, the film is interesting, original and not only a bit scary. <br /> <br /> The scenario carries more than one stereotype of horror (some of them can not shake), including Chris Sarandon as a heroine boyfriend who actually listens to her because she insists strange things are falling down. Burgess Meredith is delightful like a crazy neighbor. Eva Gardner persecutes young Beverly D'Angelo as her silent and anxious lesbian lover. John Carradine does a piece of work sitting on a chair. And watch out for the short episode of Chris Walken, unknown at the moment! This film is frightening and creative. The plot returns are beautiful, if only a little predictable. The climax I will not give you is worrying and impressive. Again, a better director could do more with him, but it is quite satisfying - at least for those with the sensitivity of the horror of the seventies. <br /> <br /> If you like modern overproduced fantasies about body counting, you won it like this. There is almost no blood. The direction is quite spartan. The effects are few, but at the end there is some wonderful make-up - most of them are not really make-up ... but maybe I've already said too much. <br /> <br /> I rated it a little higher than its quality may justify it, but I liked it like any "8" movie that I saw.
