Watching Hundstage is not a brilliant idea if you are not 100% sure about your mental stability, because it will be seriously tested with this movie, no matter how healthy you are. I must say that Hundstage is an artistic film, not an entertainment film, so most viewers would not have the "maturity" level to reach its charming side. Such as Tarkovsky's films, but in a different way. I can not say I was having a good time watching it. But it is a unique and very interesting experience for those who are bothered by the stereotype that Hollywood offers. Hundstage sticks your finger in the brain and scratches your mind. You can not just sit down and watch it, you will use shouts or look with wide eyes throughout the movie. A film similar to this style is Nachtgestalten, but it was much better and less brutal. This, for example, is not intended for children or those who are mentally sensitive or have a bad mood. Most viewers would most likely give the film a 10 or 1. I give it to 9 because I saw the phenomenon of a movie with many stories in one film in another movie and it was better. But this one is unique in itself. It is worth to watch, but be prepared for something disturbing.
