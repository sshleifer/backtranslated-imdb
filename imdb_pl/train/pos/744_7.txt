"Lisa" is one movie that I remember when presenting teenagers in the late seventies. Since I am exactly the age of Jodie Foster, I referred to this film. He deals with frustrations, temptations, relationships and youth rebellion. The soundtrack is great with inspirational rock, such as "More Than a Feeling" by Boston and sad numbers such as Donna Summer's On the Radio. Music of my late teens. Yes, I will always remember this, even if it was not huge.
