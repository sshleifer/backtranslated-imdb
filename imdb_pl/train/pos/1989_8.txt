I admit I do not like Oliver! as a small child - it is long and the story is a bit slow because of all the music numbers. As a teenager, I discovered that the fun of this movie is the same experience. Instead of thinking of him as the adaptation of Oliver Twist, think of it as celebrating classic history. Adaptation is loose at best, but really, if you're watching a musical, you're not on this story. <br /> <br /> Music is the core of this movie and the overwhelming majority are stellar and very catchy. Most or the entire cast was involved in the stage version of the musical, and it shows their performances - and I consider it a plus. The performances are in the more "scenic" style of the game typical of much older films and are very fun. The exception is the kid playing Oliver, whose work seemed to look cute and stay away from real performers. <br /> <br /> Fagin and Dodger are real stars of this movie. Oliver Reed also does a fantastic job, keeping an alarming presence on the screen as a dangerous Bill Sykes. Even Sykes Bullseye's dog puts on a good performance. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for everyone. People who hate musicals will despise them, just like those who take musicals too seriously. Overwriting erroneous historical data or mistakenly exaggerating the stage action due to poor performance will ruin someone's pleasure. Just sit back and enjoy the entertainment - much better if you remember that as a musical is a fantasy loosely organized around the book, not a close adaptation.
