It is a movie that has many things that only Japanese can understand. Even some things are translated well, which are obviously private jokes or regional symbols. I guess he tried to send a message, but it just wasted me. <br /> <br /> I felt that this is basically an average movie with nice special effects. Some children become "ones" and in the end have almost no meaning for the war in jokai, which does not make sense anyway. It would be nice to understand what the hell they were talking about, but between the yokai to wash the Azumi beans and the one that looks like a big umbrella with the tongue (Rihanna eats your heart!) I could not really see the plot. br /> <br /> The bottom line: nice visuals, the kid screams a lot, the princess river is terrible sweet, and the rest is nonsense.
