I was not sure when I heard about this exit. I thought how stupid is Disney. I was wrong. It turned out that it is very good. I mean, it's not the Lion King, but it's great to see a different side from a certain point. It was very funny. It was not one of those cunning continuations of Disney, when the animation sucked, it was like an animation of the Lion King. The only thing that killed me was the whole movie throughout the whole movie. Do not give anything, but you'll know what I'm talking about. I am also happy that it was great to cast most of the cast from the original. It was a very good movie over everything.
