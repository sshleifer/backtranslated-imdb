This is a pretty good movie. I like both Johns-Stamos ("Full House") and Stockwell ("Christine", "Top Gun"). Both give strong results. Interest in love is OK, but it's more a movie for a guy than a good movie with a date. I love Harleys and I hated seeing them painting "14 hand-mapped varnish coats" with a good old Olive Army Drab. There is a small history lesson here that Harley-Davidson motorcycles played a key role in the Second World War. I do not know if the training was quite similar to this bouquet! The film kept my interest all the time, without releasing anywhere, with good sequences of action. I love to look at the demography of voting history - one 18-year-old man gave the film to 10 (true bike lover, I think). I would not give him 10, but I gave him 8. I do not weigh every film on the same scale. There are films with a large budget, with big actors you expect well, so when they fail, they fail. (Star Wars - Episode I is my best example) I loved the first three SW films, but I thought that episode I was weak in comparison. I receive a lower rating than the film. I expect more from George Lucas.
