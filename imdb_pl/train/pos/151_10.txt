The film aims to influence the audience, and this movie did not give me peace. The film, greatly photographed and well-preserved thanks to the dialogue approaching poetry, includes lust, hatred, murder, rape, theft and deception. I have an intense network that does not allow me to tear my eyes from the screen to the end points. History is changing. It moves spectators from the cruelty of the Spanish Civil War to abandoned human wrecks. Roger Casamajor and Bruno Bertanzoni are two young actors who command the screen. Supporting players are perfectly staffed and give a real sense of authenticity. Sets, lighting, decorations and photos are great. I love photography.
