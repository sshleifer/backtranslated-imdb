Pretty average movie, but a brave movie from Mrs. Hawn, who promoted this vehicle as Exec Producer and as a vehicle in the lead role. Although it ends with confirmation, it is ready to present itself as a stunning bimbo. How many other actresses from list A have given up on this movie? Little. Does this mean that a woman's butt can not be funny? Goldie surpasses other actresses because she maintained screen personality and ventures in other projects. Sandra Bullock stays there from time to time, like Miss Congeniality, but Nicole Kidman will never like pratfall. A great performer. It's great to see some of my favorite actors, Chris Sarandon and Cliff DeYoung.
