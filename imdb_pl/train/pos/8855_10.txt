Sydney Lumet, though he is one of the oldest active directors, still has a game! A few years ago, he made "Find me guilty," proof to everyone that Vin Diesel can actually work if he gets the chance and the right director. If he withdrew from this film (a real masterpiece in my eyes), no one could blame him. But he is still strong, his next movie has already been announced for 2009. <br /> <br /> But let's stay with this movie right here. The cast list is amazing, their performance is top notch. The small nuances in their performances, "real" dialogue and / or situations that evolve throughout the film are simply amazing. The (time) structure of the film that keeps your fingers at all times, combining timelines so smoothly that editing seems natural / flawless. The story is all the more strengthened, although even in the "normal" time structure it would be at least a good movie (Drama / Thriller). I can only highly recommend, the rest is up to you! : about)
