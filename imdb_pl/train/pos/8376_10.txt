One of the best films. Yes, maybe the pictures were not the best, but a great plot and concept. Great for time, genius and creative ideas. Something other than ordinary movies and great fun. One of my favorites and I recommend it to anyone who likes creative and imaginative films. After the third world war and fighting in gigantic robots, the actors gave a great performance and made it worth it. The sets are not amazing, but simple and worked on the overall look of the film. This movie is very difficult to find on DVD, but also on VHS. Check it out because I love it since it came out. This is not a mainstream movie and it does not resemble anything you've ever seen. Look and think like a child. It's a great view and very good fun.
