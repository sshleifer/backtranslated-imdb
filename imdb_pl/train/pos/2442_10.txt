This film is about the side of Ireland, which Americans usually do not see, about the narrowly religious thinking of the "most friendly race in the world". The film, thanks to the Fethard residents, who are old enough to remember the events, is quite accurate (though they insist that the creators of the film come up with some of the more violent scenes, just to spice up the action). > <br /> The film was very unpopular in Ireland because it presented the Catholic church in a bad light, but the simple fact is that the representatives of the Catholic church * organized a veto of the minority (before the Protestants they were Jews). <br /> <br /> The film is a fascinating insight into the whole issue of religion in Ireland
