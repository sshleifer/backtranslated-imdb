Whoopi was the only reason I watched the Oscars this year. She is funny. Of course the performance was serious. She was great not only because she was funny, but because she said a few things that had to be said in public. White people should be reminded that Hollywood awards, employment and representation are not racially balanced. There should be no need to show "black" prizes. White-bread, nomadic donors and judges must bring their heads into the sunshine and see that great material is not limited to "white" directors, producers, actors, etc. The admission of Woody Allen to the flight was a depth of bad taste. He did not mind. The fact is that this is the first Oscar presentation that I have seen since "The Purple Color" appeared for awards. This misunderstanding of the vote discouraged me from watching shows until 2002. This does not mean denigrating other presenters. Billy Crystal is going to live.
