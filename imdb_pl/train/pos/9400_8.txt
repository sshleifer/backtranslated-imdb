If The Man in the White Suit was made in America, do not you see neither Danny Kaye nor Jerry Lewis trying Sidney Stratton Alec Guinness to size? <br /> <br /> This is one of the best Alecs Guinness Movies and certainly one of the best Ealing Studios in the UK has ever done. It fits perfectly with the timeframe of the new Labor government and the society that it has been trying to build. It's amazing how capital and work can agree in times of crisis. <br /> <br /> Alec Guinness is a meek little eyebrow man who is obsessed with the idea that he can come up with a clothing that will never require cleaning, which in fact repels all kinds of foreign bodies when the clothes are touched. <br /> <br /> He is a persistent supporter and he succeeds. Of course, the implications have not really been thought out about this type of clothing that will affect society. In the end, everyone is chasing him, like fugitives, almost like Peter Lorre from M or Orson Welles in Stranger, and even Robert Newton in Oliver Twist. <br /> <br /> This is a sign of a great comedy movie that a potentially serious situation, such as the pursuit described in some of the major films I mentioned, can be played for laughter. Poor Guinness suit is not only white and repulsive stains, but shines like neon. <br /> <br /> Apart from Guinness, the best performances are Cecil Parker as another pompous oaf, Joan Greenwood as his daughter's mermaid and Ernest Thesiger, the largest clothing producer in the UK> <br /> <br /> Think about it Paramount borrowed this suit from Ealing and handed it over to John Travolta for the Saturday Night Fever?
