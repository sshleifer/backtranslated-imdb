Usually, I do not watch action movies due to the fact that usually all are quite similar. This film had many stereotypical action scenes, but the characters and originality of the film's premise significantly facilitated the viewing. David Duchovny bent over his normal approach to the game, which was great. Angelina Jolie, of course, was beautiful and had a great time. Well thrown together. Must see for people bored with the same old action movie.
