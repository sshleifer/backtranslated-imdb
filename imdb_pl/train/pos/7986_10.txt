It's a perfect, moving movie. This is by far the best movie I've seen, showing the current reality in Latin America ... abductions, corruption, ruthless and greedy police officers and soulless chaos of innocent victims. In my opinion, Denzel Washinton gives the most moving performance in his career. Dakota Fanning is an amazing young actress. The relations between Washington and Fanning are wonderfully written and presented, I believed every minute. The cast is brilliant, Christopher Walken and Mickey Rourke are great as always. Walken illuminates my screen like no other actor. I would like to see more of them. Authentic places are amazing. The camera's work is interesting and different. There are many famous Latin actors in the cast, which makes it more interesting for people who know Latin American cinema. I highly recommend this movie.
