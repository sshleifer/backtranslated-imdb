A reportage based on real historical events, this disturbingly violent, bloody and shocking epic period that sustains the viewer's interest, creating a lack of credibility in most films embedded in a distant era. The presentation of the rebel nun by Mrs. Bolkan is the driving force. Her gradual transformation of character in an obedient, if unwillingly complicator in social injustices in her time, is well demonstrated by telling sequences: her witness of an accidental rapist of the hated local prince, her forbidden romance with a Jew, her criminal escape from the invasion Muslim sensual force of prince Ahmed (Anthony Corlan) In this film there are painfully realistic bloody sequences (human flaying), which are not for the sensitive, but viewers with strong stomachs and interest in medieval history should find a lot of interest. It deserves to be seen, even as an antidote to the Hollywood shows of the medieval world.
