I am 14 years old and I love this cartoon. Burt Reynolds and Dom Deluise create a great pair. This movie is really funny and I love songs. My favorite songs are "You can not keep a good dog" and this song about sharing, I think it's called "What's mine is yours". This was the last movie from Judith Barsi who played the voice of Anne-Marie. My favorite character is Charlie, but I think Itchy's voice is so cool to listen to. Although some of the scenes I actually found were terrifying, I still have trouble watching the scene with Charlie's dream, and Carface frightens me. Other characters, such as King Gator, I find really fun. The ending was cute and really sad, it made me cry a little. I give this movie 7/10.
