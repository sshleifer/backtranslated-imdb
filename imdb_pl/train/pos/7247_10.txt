Robert Jannuci, Luca Venantini, Venantino Venantini, Alicia Moro (two stars come from CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD (I wonder what Luca is doing these days, probably a lawyer or something like Bela Lugosi Jr. or David Hennessey there kid from dark shadows) who wants to forget about the existence of dark shadows.In any case, the film Thorn EMI has no music over the initial subtitles ... but the music is great when it comes ... with Italian films are not as good movies as music .. my favorite scene is with a boy with a robot arm following a lone-alien through the desert Alien tells you why you're following me Tommy responds because I feel so ... The alien answers where you are, Tommy says West, and Alien says Okay, I'm going to the east, so after a moment of walking about the subject Alien looks up and sees Tommy sitting on the rock, stroking a hamster ... tommy looks up and says to Alien, which took you so long ... I love t en film ... It touches my heart, a robot with a robot arm needs a daddy, and the Alien is incarnated in Tommy's daddy in the desert. . . oh yes, they also need water. . . not THE ROAD WARRIOR (MAD MAX 2) in any way, but stupid movie western / post nuke with boy with robot arm and Alien and Trash and a few other good guys with a malicious rod with an iron claw and CRAZY BULL who looks like Wez in a warrior on the way. . After Sunday afternoons on channel 57 (Philadelphia, PA) after church I came home and found it. . . often . . . too often. I love it. 10/10
