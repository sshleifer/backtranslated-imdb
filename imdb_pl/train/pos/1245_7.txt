Whenever I see most of the reviews, it's called the "misfires of Eddie Murphy." These critics want to take a look at some of the things that they are currently doing, and maybe ease their position in retrospect ... "Golden Child" is not entertainment, but thanks to the cast some of them cast a new life into old cliches and give Murphy one of his the best roles. I do not understand the pervasive lack of "love" for his efforts at all. Perhaps it was released at a time when the establishment was tired of being knocked out, the thrillings lasted for minutes? Steven Spielberg started it with Indiana Jones; it is unfair to make it a scapegoat when what is probably its greatest sin is also completely harmless. There is nothing wrong with trying to use trends. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's stupid, but even an occasional observer should be able to understand that "funny" is the place where the Hollywood idea of ​​mysticism begins and ends. What is more important than credibility in such a story is the fact that the audience has fun guides at their disposal that show them the mysterious views. Michael Ritchie and Eddie Murphy fit the bill for that capacity. My advice is for you to buy a ticket and drive around.
