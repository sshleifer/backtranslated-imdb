Othello, Shakespearena's classic story of love, betrayal, lies and tragedy. I remember studying this story in high school. In fact, I thought Othello was probably my favorite Shakespeare story because of how fascinating it was that Shakespeare captured perfectly the feeling of friendship, love and racism. I mean, when you really study this story, you can go to so many philosophies, why Othello went mad with jealousies in the blink of an eye. But later on to my report I also watched this version of Othello and I must say that she was absolutely brilliant. Lawerance and Kenneth have captured this story so well and understood its darkness. <br /> <br /> Othello is a great soldier in his city, he is loved by everyone, including the king. But when the king learns that Othello has descended with his daughter Desdemona, the king is furious, but otherwise. Othello is welcome in the city and creates his best friend, Cassio, his side man instead of Iago, who stood next to Othello. Because of his mad jealousy is revenge. Still pretending to be the best friend Othello, he simply murmurs at Othello that Desdemona is cheating on him with Cassio, he never says they are, he just makes Othello think it's happening. Othello is crazy and there are no nice plans for Desdemona or Cassio and Iago is more than happy to help him. <br /> <br /> Othello is an amazing story, I highly recommend that you read it. It's an amazing story that lets you think after reading. Othello film is also great and once again I recommend it, it perfectly captures the story and has a great sense of shoulder blades, or you can be shocked at what is happening between Othello and Desdemona, how quickly he believes that his truth love would betray him. It's a great movie, great acting, good sets and a good direction, that's what Shakespeare meant when he wrote this story. <br /> <br /> 10/10
