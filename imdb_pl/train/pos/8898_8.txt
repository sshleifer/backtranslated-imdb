The 1960s is a great movie (I saw it all in one night) about the hippie movement in the late 1960s. Although the title would suggest that otherwise the first 5 years of the 1960s are not really important in this film. <br /> <br /> The main character of the movie is Michael, a political activist who sets out on the road against the US War in Vietnam. There he meets his girlfriend, brother Sarah. Michael, Brian, goes to Vietnam to fight (what a surprise!) Returns from the war and turns into "Tom Cruise Born on July 4" to look like and then His dad is a type of guy from war Vietnamese (what a surprise!) Sister Michael, Kate, gets pregnant with the artist Rock and Roll and runs away from home and goes to San Francisco in the summer. The ending is very weak (my father becomes a liberal and everyone is happy), but I let this disappear from my vote (the rest of the movie is very good!). <br /> <br /> The performances of the actors are quite good, and the soundtrack of the film is absolutely brilliant. All the major events of the sixties are in the film, like the murders of JFK and Martin Luther King, as well as great hippie protests, the summer of love and Woodstock! Look carefully at the wavy sauces "Woodstock Speaker" (we mean breakfast in bed for 400,000!) As a first aid worker at the Woodstock Festival! <br /> <br /> In the late 1960s, there is a beautiful film about a beautiful decade! 10/10
