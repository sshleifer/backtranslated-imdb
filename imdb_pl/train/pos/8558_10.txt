Holly begins to do many strange things and tries to find a brother in a psychiatric hospital after he killed her father. If you look closely enough, you'll see that mother Drew Barrymore actually looks like her mother in this picture. If it were not good for Drew Barrymore and George Newbern, this movie should only be watched on Halloween night! However, it certainly has surprises in END !!!!
