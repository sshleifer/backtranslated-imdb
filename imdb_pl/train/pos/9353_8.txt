REIGN OVER ME (2007) *** Adam Sandler, Don Cheadle, Jada Pinkett-Smith, Liv Tyler, Saffron Burrows, Donald Sutherland, Robert Klein, Melinda Dillon, Mike Binder, Jonathan Banks, Rae Allen, Paul Newsome. Sometimes it affects the dramaturgy of a depressed man who lost his family on September 11 (Sandler in his best role since "Punch-Drunk Love"), who reunites with his old friend from college and friend (Cheadle, continuing impressive work with every hitherto role), a well-placed dentist who seems to have it all? family, wealth, happiness? but he really sees the ally in freedom with the personal victims of his restless friend. Written and directed by Binder (who is the star of former best friend Sandler and the acting accountant) with an equal sense of humor and real heartache, the movie works best when two stars share the screen, until the last act does not fall into the movie almost a week's melody to sort out the current solution make it happen.
