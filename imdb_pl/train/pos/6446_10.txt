"SÃ¥ som in himmelen" was probably one of the 3 most beautiful films I've ever seen in my life. That he did not win an Oscar, I will not shed tears. This movie is a class in itself that winning an Oscar could discourage him !!! My dearest friend Anders (Nyberg), you've done real splendor here! Kay Pollak, with your creation and all who contribute, have all given our Love the gift of Love. Between the entry points into this our world and then the exit - you can really say that you made him better! Special personal thanks from my soul for all of you that you have brought back some precious memories from the second decade of my life. I grew up in Sweden, and my young mind and current being formed and shaped many beautiful Swedish influences, individuals, traditions, music and nature. My blessings with gratitude to all of you. With love and light, George-Gabriel Berkovits Soulhealer, Johannesburg, South Africa
