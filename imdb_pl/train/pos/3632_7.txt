As predictable as the Hallmark card, but not without merit, The Rookie makes the game solid. Dennis Quaid, the most sensible actor who works today, is absolutely perfect as a science teacher, baseball player Jimmy Morris. The film is never muffled for children, as might be expected after the movie with the rating of G. As a sports movie, The Rookie is one of the best I've seen from Any Given Sunday.
