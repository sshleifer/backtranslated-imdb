This wonderful series, told by Laurence Olivier, is brilliantly to be said, shows the beginning of the Second World War. The beginnings are not fully explored due to the fall of Germany from the Treaty of Versailles, which helped fuel Hitler's demonic rise, but as one of the reviewers says, it must be difficult to do, in a 26-part series with so many inclusions. <br /> <br /> In addition to the expected photography / combat action, there are many personal, emotional and human tragedies that give the viewer an amazing insight, especially if you're not necessarily a fan of World War 2. Episodes showing "testimonies" and what it looked like life on the main front of the main allies / opponents, Great Britain, Germany, Japan, Russia and the USA, was quite open. Showing the extreme savagery of war on the front lines and of course the suffering of civilians, death camps, etc. They were treated very well and exposed. I would fully recommend it in any history lesson for the younger generation (about which I can say that I am one at the age of 47!). <br /> <br /> Some things are quite strangely overlooked, like the arrival of a new era of jets, with the experimental Glove Frank Whittle and the debut of Gloster Meteor, and with the German Messerschmitt Me 262 - especially that the V-1 he was a debut and surprisingly less was about V2. It is probably a small oversight, not referring to the more sensational mysterious and fantastic weapons that World War II brought from a more barren old science. But a great series that left its mark and she did it since then, when it was happily repeated. <br /> <br /> Series owned as a box set in historical categories, on DVD for anyone who is a military fan. Jeremy Isaacs and Thames TV should be proud.
