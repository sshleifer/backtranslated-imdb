Summary: This is business as usual at the Louche casino in Tangier. The casino will close soon and prepare for a big transaction the next day. The owner Louche and some employees leave for the night, leaving behind Modesty. Suddenly a gang of armed gangsters storms the casino, firing wildly. Unknown Modesty, Louche has already killed, and now they are behind the money hidden in the treasury. But none of the present and still living in the casino knows the code to open the vault. The crypt itself is a heavy fool trapped in explosives, so attackers can not blow up the door as planned. Suddenly Modesty is face to face with the Miklos gang leader in the roulette game of their life in danger. <br /> <br /> Comments: This is a review written in no relation to other publications on the subject of Modesty Blaise because I have neither seen nor read. The first thing I like about it is that it is slightly incorrectly classified. First of all, I thought it was a thriller with a battle of mind between Modesty and Miklos as the main story. Of course, there are some series of actions, but they are not really an integral or important part of the story. <br /> <br /> As mentioned above, the main plot and the main stage filled with tension is the game between Modesty and Miklos. This is an innovative and intriguing way of revealing the background of the characters, and while doing so much, the story happens outside the casino much earlier. Someone said it's almost like a TV series pilot, and the feeling is that it can actually be used as such. But I felt that it was a much better way to introduce characters than many others. I was not disappointed with the lack of action, instead I liked this game, a story much more than a simple action movie. <br /> <br /> I think the two main stars, Alexandra Staden and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau did very well. Staden shows Modesty particularly well and carries this confident and talented character. <br /> <br /> 7/10
