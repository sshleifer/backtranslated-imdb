The film is simply funny ... maybe more fun for those of us who were young and fans of "The Ramones" at the time of the film's creation. I watched the movie over and over again, alone and with friends, and it's still fresh and funny. Risking being too serious, the concept of being a big fan of a certain team is timeless, and high school students bored with the drudgery of certain activities are equally timeless. <br /> <br /> And the movie has some lines / scenes with jewels ... references to how our "permanent documentation" in high school will follow us throughout life. (I assure you that I did not go to high school, uhhh, a few years and do not follow me) ..... the famous "static" line ("I get a little static" ..... "Not as much as you get" as Principal Togar approaches) ... a member of the school council who is so sick that he attended nurses ... The Nazi room monitors the love of "searching the body" ...... Principal Togar announcing: "I give you a final solution" and recording the records Ramones (note: CDs were what came before CDs) .... and of course Joey Ramone notes: "Things have changed since we were expelled from high school," and then Togar asked: "Do your parents know you are Ramones? "<br /> <br /> Only one advice ... do not look up, where the stars are now ... Joey Ramone, unfortunately, died young. Dey Young, who was the main hottie in the movie, today reminds us that we are all ... PJ Soles career has never been as advanced as we would expect ......... Marla Rosenfield, as one of the other students , apparently only appeared in this film (one of my male friends dies over her every time we watch a movie), although I present her performance was more than enough and he should have brought her more film roles. And does anyone know what happened to DJ Don Steele? <br /> <br /> So, look and enjoy ..... do not think ... just FUN!
