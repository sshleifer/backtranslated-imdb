Unfortunately, many consumers who write reviews for IMDb identify a low budget with a bad one. Regardless of what this movie may need, a bigger budget is not really part of the movie. Big sets and many special effects would turn it into another Lara Croft movie. What we have here is a step or two better than this. <br /> <br /> Almost unknown Alexandra Staden is captivating as mysterious Modesty, and this is central to this film. Her wise, small smiles and seeming glances are dangerous, and you want the camera to not wipe her face. This makes the angry colleague Nikolai, played by the little-known (at least in the US) Nikolai Coaster-Waldau, may be interested in her exceptionally, which can use Modesty. He is able to reverse his raping with just one thrust and spit out "stop wasting my time!" Then they set off between heavily armed but suddenly unsteady supporters. Making a scene like it probably does not happen by accident. <br /> <br /> Probably the biggest problem I have with the thin Staden ham playing Modesty is that it's just not too trustworthy to walk with an athletic and muscular guy who looks like Coaster-Waldau and defeats him . It's just not Peta Wilson or a pumped actress like Hilary Swank who can make a convincing blow. Coaster-Waldau allows you to be overpowered by Staden, it looks like she is just rough with her younger sister. <br /> <br /> Since this is not really an action movie, it is not a big drawback. I only hope that they will do better if and when they will do sequels.
