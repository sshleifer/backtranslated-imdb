I really liked this movie. Humor was sometimes absent, but I liked how this story moves between drama and seriousness throughout the film. This is the only second movie in which I saw the acting of Verdone (the second was "Un sacco bello") and I can see why the Italians find him tiring, but think that he played his role as a loving father. <br /> <br /> My only fault with this movie was that I knew it was in Italy - somewhere in the center or in the south, I suppose, but I felt that there was no representation of the place. This movie could have taken place in New York, Boston, Melbourne, New Dehli ... I always think it's important that movies take place to give viewers something to relate to. (Maybe I missed something?) :) If you like Italian movies, I think you will like it. This is not Fellini or Rossellini - it is not realism or neorealism. This is a comic story with serious moments that can happen to any of us.
