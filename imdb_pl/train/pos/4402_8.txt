After watching all the movies of Jesse James, Quantrill, jayhawker√≥w, etc. From the fifties, watching the movie with a new perspective by director Ang Lee is quite exciting. The Lawrence attack scene in Kansas is amazing. The romantic relationship between Jewel and Toby Mcguire turns out to be one of the best parts, and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is outstanding as a bad guy. All the time this movie makes you feel the horror of war and the desperate situation of the main characters who do not know if they will survive the next hours. It's definitely worth seeing.
