This film was not only one of John Ford's personal favorites, but also included Directors Sergei M. Eisenstein and Bertrand Tavernier among his devotees. Ironically, I got along with it thanks to the latest 2-disc Criterion set, which after many years did not participate in several original Italian shows on TV and again on Hollywood TV! <br /> <br /> The film marked the first of Ford's five collaborations with Henry Fonda and is the quintessence of Americana Ford's exemplary folk. A beautifully poignant and vividly executed work, sequences of the courtroom (and possible revelation) in the second half still have quite a lot of weight, except that they give the steadfast actor Donald Meek a remarkably meaty role of prosecutor. <br /> <br /> Fonda is obviously well-mannered as a shy, inexperienced but rigorous and humanist lawyer whose destiny was to become president; Fonda would present other fictitious politicians in the film - especially in the BEST HUMAN by Franklin J. Schaffner (1964) and FAIL-SAFE (1964) by Sidney Lumet - and is surprised that he was reluctant to accept the role of Lincoln at the time because he thought it was "like playing God "! <br /> <br /> It is interesting that Ford previously faced Abraham Lincoln (January) in THE PRISONER OF SHARK ISLAND (1936), a great but maybe little-known jewel that fortunately was just released as a DVD with a special edition, created by the British standardization company Criterion, the Eureka label "Masters Of Cinema". Besides, in my DVD collection I have two more films by Abraham Lincoln, which I still watch, and by the way, both were directed by DW Griffith - BIRTH OF NATION (1915) and ABRAHAMA LINCOLNA (1930) - and not only I received a few films I have never seen before I have not watched, I would gladly give them a spin based on my very satisfying viewing experience with YOUNG MR. LINCOLN.
