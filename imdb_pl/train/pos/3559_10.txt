I love that movie. My only disappointment was that some of the original songs have been changed. <br /> <br /> It is true that Frank Sinatra does not have the opportunity to sing so much in this film, but it's also nice that it is not another Frank Sinatra movie where he mainly sings. <br /> <br /> Actually, I thought it would be better to use my own voice of Marlon Brando, who has a voice that fits, and I could not see someone with this wonderful voice, tearing away the feeling of a gangster in his voice. <br /> <br /> Stubby Kaye's "Sit down, you're Rockin 'the Boat" is the foot, sings, and I just love. He is difficult to follow with his version and I still like his best. <br /> <br /> Vivian Blaine is just great in this part, and "Lament Adelaide" is my favorite of her songs. <br /> <br /> I really thought Jean Simmons was perfect for this part. Maybe I would not consider it first, but after seeing it in this part it made sense. <br /> <br /> Michael Kidd's choreography is timeless. If it was exhibited in 2008, I would not change anything. <br /> <br /> I think that many times something gets lost from the stage version to the movie version, but it kept the atmosphere of the scene, even though it was on the film. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was well manned. I have performed in regional versions of this and it is one of my favorites during this period.
