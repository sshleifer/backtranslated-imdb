How I came to this: when I started watching this series on Cartoon Network, I have to say that I have never seen anything like this and it was the best. But when I started to collect the series on VHS, and years later on DVD in the Bandai's Anime Legends collections. It was amazing and really worth seeing. He had a lot of exploding action that would blow you up. Of course, the thematic songs "Just Communication" and Rhythm Emotions "were the best. <br /> <br /> Characters and Gundams: My favorite characters in the show were: Heero, Duo, Relena, Treize, Lady Und, Noin and Zechs: My favorite Gundams in the series I liked the most, are Wing Zero and Epyon and of course Altron and Deathscythe I and II. <br /> <br /> The importance of the show: What this series also tells us is that in real life wars are very difficult and sometimes we can win or lose. But peace can also be hard to come by and I believe that Gundam pilots are doing the right thing and are trying to get world peace. <br /> <br /> However, this concert is really the best of the best, so at the end of this review, after watching this program, see the movie Endless Waltz.
