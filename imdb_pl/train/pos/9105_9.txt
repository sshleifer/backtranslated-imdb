Women never looked as attractive and pitiful as in Salazar Piedras. Although the editor here and there can help the film, it is exciting and enjoyable with an intense sign from the latest films by Pedro Almodovar. 5 different women cope with their male partners and families. Starting with a few different stories that are to be met during the action, Salazar portrays his female characters in the same neurotic and border behavior that Almodovar is known for. A high-class kleptomaniac with shoes for smaller shoes, a burlesque housewife taking care of her disabled daughter, a drug addict obsessed with her ex-boyfriend and a taxi driver taking care of her deceased husband's troubled children, all wander the streets of Madrid in well-designed scenes. Using some of Almodovar's famous actresses, the director manages to give depth to all the characters who share the film in the first movie, and create a real sympathy for each of them. Women control the storyline, and men will definitely stay with each other, in the end ... Surprisingly good at the first movie and worth the time in every standard. It is noticeable that Salazar hesitated in some of the necessary directions for actresses, but still an impressive act appears on the screen, especially Monica Cervera, who played in his previous short film. <br /> <br /> It is the duty of all Almodovar fans and pleasant for everyone.
