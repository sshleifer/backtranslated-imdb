I am surprised that nobody has ever thought about making such a movie. Horror is often the most effective when as a motif it uses real unpleasantness in life. And no one (except Steve Martin in The Little Shop of Horrors) likes to go to the dentist. Tooth torture has already been done (see, for example, The Marathan Man), but this introduces terror to the suburbs. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around the dentist, Dr. Alan Feinstone (Corbin Bernsen), who goes crazy. Now our dear doctor did not play with the full deck at the beginning, but driven by jealousy and obsessive-compulsive disorder, he begins to reek with ravage among people around him. Doctors develop mental health, which is close to what we see in the form of Michael Douglas in Falling Down, but with a frightening game. <br /> <br /> Written and directed by horror stalwarts Stuart Gordon and Brian Yuzna a great flow. He also acted as a cop, it's always welcome Ken Foree. <br /> <br /> Now I believe that this movie would not work without the absolutely fantastic performance of Corbin Bernsen. I really only saw him in the LA Act, I was delighted with his actions. <br /> <br /> The continuation of The Dentist 2 is also worth seeing, but slightly below the average compared to the original. <br /> <br /> TTKK's Bottomline - A funny movie with some scenes that will make you start to beat, covered (pun intended) by Bernsen's great performance
