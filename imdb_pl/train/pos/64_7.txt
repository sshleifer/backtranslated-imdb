This is the first and only full-length feature of Paul F. Ryan. He has not done anything since then. However, he managed to get an amazing cast of the band to present the heroes of his story. I do not know when and why this idea appeared in his head, but Ryan wrote the script, which later became his own director's film "Home Room". <br /> <br /> Busy Philipps wears a movie on Alicia's shoulders, anxious girl; the ones we always see in television series. With dark hair and black clothes; a pack of cigarettes in your pocket, a strange look and disturbing eyes (of course with make-up). The incident took place at her school; shooting. Some of the students died and she saw everything. Now Detective Martin Van Zandt (Victor Garber) is investigating the case and, as expected, Alicia is a suspect. But shooting is just genesis; the movie is not about shooting. <br /> <br /> Deanna Cartwright (Erika Christensen) is in bed in the hospital room. He is one of the survivors from the hospital. The script establishes a bond between them by the school's director (James Pickens Jr.). It helps all students regain their strength after the event, but Alicia does not seem to care. She is isolated. So the director punishes her; he must visit Deanna every day until five. Then the movie begins. <br /> <br /> I can not even describe how wonderfully this movie is written. I can identify with the characters and situations in which they live; I like reality. These things can happen to everyone. And the things they say are completely understandable. They grow up and try to deal with things they have not experienced; they do what they can. Not knowing this, Alicia (when she visits Deanna for the first time) and Deanna (when she sees Alicia standing in front of her) begin a journey that will determine their personalities and ideas for the next step in life; after high school. <br /> <br /> The director guides Christensen and Philipps very well. Look at the contrast between them. Deanna seems naive and has simple thoughts; lack of complexity in her mind. When Alicia enters her room and sees tons of flowers, she asks: "Who brought them?". "Many people," says Deanna; although a few days later we find out that they come from her parents who come every week. All parental characters are well represented, but they are not as important as the characters of their sons. Deanna is lonely. Alice seems mature and brutal; smoking and brutal conversation. But after two days of visiting each day, he returns to the hospital; even sleeping in Deanna's room all night. When they fight, I believe Deanna says, "Why are you coming back?" Alicia is lonely too. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie, without ruining it, is a bit disappointing; it's something I did not wait for. It eliminates part of the force of the movie. Revelation is totally unnecessary; it ruins the logical climax the movie could have. After all, it was a perfect script; and a perfect direction. A damn good movie. <br /> <br /> Regarding Erika Christensen, it was the role she needed to fly higher. Her role in "Ruch" was impressive, but it was a big step; the main role of. Maybe few have the opportunity to see her in this film and it's a pity. Since then, she has not made any false movement. She even made good appearances in terrible movies. On the other hand, Busy Philipps, who turned out to be very promising in this film (what a transformation), there are not many occasions for other roles. <br /> <br /> I am talking about Paul F (directed, cursing) the same and I expect that he is now sitting on his computer, finishing his new script; I am waiting for his next movie. I hope that the best for all of them.
