I only watched the first series on DVD, but I would summarize Sopran as a Shakespearean plot with a script similar to Tarantino. The series is as good as Goodfellas and Casino, and almost as good as The Godfather (hence not "10") and much better than any of Guy Ritchie's efforts. Although there are plenty of actions, some of them are quite bloody, history is driven by nature. Even some of the smaller characters contribute to creating great stories; for example, the priest's relationship (or lack thereof) with Carmilla and the restaurant's wife, and Christopher and his friend in disbelief (which did not last long (Darwin's nominee?)) script and acting, other reasons I liked; <br /> <br /> 1. I wanted to visit New Jersey and eat pasta with tomato sauce. 2. Music. 3. It shows that literally everyone can suffer from mental health problems.
