In this part of the series, Edmund Blackadder got stuck during the regency in Great Britain (later in the reign of George III). This time the prospects of the Black Harvest are much worse - as instead of the royal family, he is a servant of the very, very fat George IV (price regent). Unlike the historical accounts of George IV, this one is more or less as clear as a tomato, and as a result the Viper is able to use it and plan it to his heart. The only significant difference in style between this one and the earlier is that the series ends with a very, very, very different note - you just have to see it to believe it. Besides, all the usual elements of the story are there and the show is fun. The only reservation I have (as always) is that this show is not suitable for children because of its strict language and adult situations.
