The life and time of little Richard, as Little Richard said, produced and directed by Little Richard, was just as one-sided as one of his songs. This is not a biography or even a docudrama, but it has a good writing, great energy and an outstanding actor playing Richard. All music is written by Little Richard, so it gets tight in every song. <br /> <br /> The film tells about his early childhood, moves throughout the creative years in music, wild success and Richard throws all this to praise the Lord. Everything is well connected, and an obvious return in 1962. It is possible to avoid the idea that Little Richard discovered the Beatles who opened it. <br /> <br /> My main complaint is that his outrageous, opposing cultural behavior is underappreciated and you do not feel how his audience experienced him at this time. Part of his energy he still has is not full of power. He seemed tame compared to what I remember about him at that time. <br /> <br /> The best scenes are Richard, who is abandoned by Lucille and writes a song about it, and a bikini strap at a performance to do is not worth having a decent place to change. <br /> <br /> If they got into "Bronze Liberation", how Richard is used to refer to himself in interviews, that's a story. Trust me, I just saw him a few months ago and he is still flirting with pretty white boys, giving this particularly good dancer the audience, his band. Almost 68 years and still strong. I recommend this movie and every concert or appearance of T.V. Little Richard is always on
