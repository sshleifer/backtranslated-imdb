Although I love this movie, I barely watch it, it's so real. So I put it in tonight and hid behind my computer. I remembered it vividly, but I just wanted to see if I could find something I had not seen before ... I did not do it: it's because it's so real to me. <br /> <br /> Another "user" wrote that the age of commentators should be shown along with their summary. I am for all this! It is absolutely obvious that most of those who commented on "Midnight Cowboy" may not be born when it was released. They mention other films in which Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman appeared. I will be as honest sincere: I am 82 years old. If you know some of my other comments, you will be aware that for 60 years I was a professional female role-playing and I appeared in the movie - you would never know me, even if you were acquainted with my nightclub. Do you think I know a lot about the heroes of this film? COMES UP !! .... <br /> <br /> ... and I'm not the least embarrassed. If you have not come up with some of them, it's your loss - but there is a huge chance, but you just do not know about it. So many mothers, fathers, sons and daughters can surprise you. It should not be a secret MULTI actors / actresses emerged from the background of "Midnight Cowboy". Who is to assess? I can name a few current BIG-TIME stars that grew up on the dingy streets of many cities and were not the least damaged by the time spent there. I do not judge because they are people, like all of us - with love, courage, goodness, compassion, intelligence, humility: you call attributes, they all exist, no matter what the package looks like. <br /> <br /> "Trivia" about the fact that Hoffman actually begs on the streets to prove that he can play the role of "Ratzo" is a real gem - you can see him driving his car around Los Angeles - how Do you think where he gets his contribution? I can also name many men-stars who stood in the streets and circled the bars for money. Although the nightclub in which I recently worked for 26 years was known throughout the world and legit, I can also exchange HUGE stars that had to be constantly chased down our street, wanting to receive. <br /> <br /> It should not come as a surprise today, although it definitely works in Hollywood and other cities, big and small. Wake up and smell the roses. They smell no less sweet, because they have a different shade. <br /> <br /> Some "users" thought that "Joe Buck" was molested by my grandma. Although I saw him in bed with her boyfriend, I did not find any such an event. Believe it or not, the children ALWAYS did not have their own rooms - because it has to say today that the main bedroom can be something perverse. Whose business? Hoffman could have begged for a change in the streets, but some "users" emphasize that Jon Voight was not the main star during the filming of "Midnight Cowboy" - his real salary surprised you. I think he was robbed! No one can doubt the brightness he put into his role or that he was NOT the star of such a great work as "Deliverance". He defined a powerful man who conquered his devils and was better for him: few people commented that he had been exposed to this film. The late 1960s could have been one of the first films that were so open, but the society was always fashionable. <br /> <br /> I did not find homosexuality between "Ratzo" and "Joe" - they were clearly opposing, unattractive to myself. They discovered a much clearer relationship - real friendship. If you did not understand it at the end of the movie, you lost your time. Dazed "Joe" but brazen devotion was obvious. Yes, Voight deserves an Oscar for this role - the one that John Wayne has never been able to do, and was equally handsome in his youth. <br /> <br /> Hoffman is Hoffman - you're expecting fireworks. He gave them great. Wayne got an Oscar. Every character in this movie was beautifully defined - if you do not think they're still around, you're wrong. "Party" ? - attend some "rave" younger people involved in ..... if you can enter. Look at the lines of people trying to get to the hot clubs - you'll see every scandalous personality. <br /> <br /> Brenda Viccaro was the epitome of elegant women who sometimes had to go to the heart of the matter. If you were shocked by her brilliant acting, thinking that "this is not real," look at today's "ladies" who live on the edge of evil ... and are admired for that. <br /> <br /> the brutality of "Joe" seen in robbing an old man, unfortunately, is a part of life. You do not have to tolerate it, but it is not much different from violence. "Joe" clearly called his goal - in this situation, I would pass the money faster than he asked for it. This is one of the scenes that makes this movie a breakthrough that I do not watch. I am desperate for both ..... <br /> <br /> John Schlesinger was certainly familiar with this abomination to guide this amazingly beautiful opener - Waldo Salt did not write clairvoyance. Anyone who had any part in delivering it to the screen had to realize that it was making history and should be proud of its integrity. Perhaps "only in America" ​​we can close our eyes to unpleasant situations, while other filmmakers do not interfere with presenting their public opinion. Without looking, it does not mean that he is not there - give me the truth every time. Bravo! to all......
