Little Edie and Big Edie are characters for whom everyone can sympathize. Although their home was dirty, it is understandable, considering their mental illness. On the bulletin board, the poster wrote that "Ma≈Ça Edie has coping skills at the age of eight." It reminded me when in the dramatized version of Big Edie 2009 he says to Little Edie: "If you're stuck, it's just for yourself!" These women had everything; beauty, talent, intelligence, strong belief in your opinions and actions. Perhaps, if little Edie was not so difficult for herself, when the first time nothing came out, she would lose her hair, work and love of her life, that would work. This is somehow related to what I believe is her mental illness: her inability to rise when times are difficult, and to see that good times are ahead of us. The world will never know what happened if she did not hear her mother's request: "Come home, Edie! Let me take care of you! "<br /> <br /> However, these understandable, uncertain women somehow manage to be brilliant, heart-rending and sympathetic, even in their extremely dirty home. These women were extraordinary, and their interaction with each other brings humor and sadness. When Edie had one of her emotional breaks, thinking about what could be or how she wants to get out of the house because she feels like a little girl, she feels a strong urge to hug her and say that "everything will be be right! "<br /> <br /> Great documentary !! <br /> <br /> 9/10
