I just left and I can not believe what a great document it is. You rarely leave the cinema with such admiration and amazement. Recently, movies have become so exaggerated that the thrill of discovering something really special and unique rarely happens. Amores Perros did this to me when he first appeared and this film is doing to me now. I did not know anything about it before entering and what a surprise. If you hear this concept, you can feel that it is one of those thorny movies with an amazing triumph, which is behind the music from the top shelf and tries to convince us what a great story, but does not let us in. Fortunately, this is not the movie. People tell a story! He does it so well, grabbing every moment of their engagement when we enter their world and feel every second with them. There is so much outside of climbing that makes everything that passes is much more tense. Touching the Void was also a great doctor about mountain climbing and showing intensity in an interesting way, but this film is more of a human story. I just saw it today, but I'll say it's one of the best documentaries I've ever seen.
