Liam Neeson presents the Scottish legend of Robert Roy Macgregor from the early 18th century. He is a real actor. He captivates the audience with his charisma, as in all his roles. Jessica Lange is excellent as his wife Mary. Mary is such a beautiful woman. It is her love that makes Rob Roy a legend, but it is his passion that makes love immortal. They need each other. Tim Roth as bad Cunningham is perfect; in one way or another, after watching the movie, you'll find Cunningham disgusting. The scenery of Scotland is beautiful. The environment and conditions of those times are presented quite well. If you like history, romance, passion and love, you'll like Rob Roy. There is violence and blood, but it is inevitable to tell the story as it should be said; no unjustified violence. And you have to listen carefully if you're not used to the Scottish accent. An important point that makes this movie so good is that none of the actors or actresses are charming; they get dirty and look unattractive in different scenes. It's their skills as actors that attract you, do not rely on brand names, popularity and attractiveness of sex symbols. This is something special.
