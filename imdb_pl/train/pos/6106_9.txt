As for the erotic genre, I am lucky that I can go through the first 20 minutes of the story without getting up or looking for something else to look at. This movie is different. Julie Davis (I love You Do not Touch Me) has directed two very strong principal actors Kira Reed and Doug Jeffery in this fascinating thriller. Kira is convincing as "Kim," a sweet innocent novelist who falls into the seduction chain of Doug Jeffery's "Man", a handsome stranger. Kira loses control over her inhibitions in the role and as an actress, giving something that could just be another depth and credibility. I believe that this is her best performance. The direction of Julie Davis is a great gift for eroticism.
