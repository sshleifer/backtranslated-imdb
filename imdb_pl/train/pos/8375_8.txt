<br /> <br /> The jox robot is a great little movie, some sets are bad, and the acting is not great, but the special effects are very good for a movie of this size and age. You have to remember that this movie is over 10 years old and it was produced very cheaply in the first place, so you can not complain about many bad parts. Sit back and watch a cool movie with great robots.
