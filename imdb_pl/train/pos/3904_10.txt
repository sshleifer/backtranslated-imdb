In my opinion, this is the best stand-up show I have ever seen. I became a fan of Eddie after seeing Dress to Kill, but I have to say that I think it's his best job. I would say, however, that if you ever have a chance you will definitely see him live. This pays off! <br /> <br /> Most of the time after watching the routine routine, the jokes start to age. But I must say that I have seen this show so many times that I literally remember the whole thing (which, I realize, is a little sad), but every joke still makes me laugh. It's a really good performance. <br /> <br /> Kill dress will never get old. I have it and watch it whenever I need a good laugh.
