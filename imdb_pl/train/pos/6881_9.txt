Like a bad movie with Curtis Mayfield singing? It can not! The Groove Tube is a series of scattered blackout sketches that make fun of everything from 2001 to the Olympic Games. The tops (Clown Koko, the recipe for easy spreading) outweigh the advantage (too long "The Dealers"), but even falls are ridiculous. Best of all is the maniacal dance of Ken Shapiro on a busy sidewalk in Manhattan (this is Shapiro, not Nat King Cole singing Just You, Just Me). Definitely outdated now, but at the time The Groove Tube was disrespectful, bold, shameless and hysterically funny. Ken Shapiro did this little iconic hit, and 7 years later he made a Christmas bomb, Modern Problems (though I liked it) and since then unfortunately nothing. it remains for me an endless wave of positive energy, a film that 26 years after my first look still brings me real joy!
