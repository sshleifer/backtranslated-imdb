"The Thief Of Baghdad" is quite a story, almost as wonderful as the story told in this film. Alexander Korda almost went bankrupt, making this movie. <br /> <br /> According to the film series Citadel Book on Great British Movies, adopted son of Great Britain Alexander Korda invented this film back in 1933 and spent years planning and preparing. But World War II, unfortunately, caught up with KordÄ™ and the growing cost of filming a great spectacle. <br /> <br /> Budgetary expenses also happen in American films, only Cecil B. DeMille always had a free hand in Paramount after 1932, when he returned there. But neither DeMille nor any of his contemporaries had to worry about enemy bombs during filming. Partially during the shooting of Kord, he transported the whole company to America and made these sequences with Rex Ingram as a genie in our Grand Canyon. He certainly will not have such a scenery in Britain. Korda also finished the interior in Hollywood, just in time for the Christmas edition of 1940. <br /> <br /> The performance from The Thief Of Bagdad won four Oscar nominations and three Oscars for the best color photos, the best direction of art and a set for a color film and the best special effects. Only the original musical score of Miklos Roszy did not take the prize in the nominated category. Korda had to be really happy when he decided to shoot the Grand Canyon, because it is impossible to get bad colored pictures from this place. <br /> <br /> The special effects, however, do not overwhelm the simple story of victory over evil. The good thing is two young lovers John Justin and June Duprez, and evil is Conrad Veidt as a sorcerer who tries to steal both the kingdom and the heart, both belonging to Dupreza. It was the role of Veidt in his career up to Casablanca, where he played the Luftwaffe major Stroesser. <br /> <br /> Of course, good help gets some of the unlikely source. Beggar boy and thief Sabu, who could be one of the few who could be called an international movie star at the time. He literally grew out of poverty, working as a boy with an elephant for Maharaja in Mysore, he was noticed by Aleksander Korda, who needed a native advantage in one of its elements of the jungle. Sabu captures all the innocence and malice of youth, filling the fantasies of the Arab Night boy who overthrows the tyrant. This is not a bad message that should have been sent in 1940. <br /> <br /> Baghdad robber is doing very well today. It is an eternal story of love, romance and adventure in any order.
