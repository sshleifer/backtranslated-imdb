What a movie jewel, so good that they made a sequel. <br /> <br /> The movie starts really well with a nasty monster that eats a few people and an event where the two main characters first see each other. <br /> <br /> Bendan Hughes plays eccentric Vlad, a little suspicious who this character is, who moved to the city and uses the services of a real estate agent to find him a home. <br /> <br /> Hell, we've all seen vampire movies, we know the format. <br /> <br /> The movie is audible, but the performances of the actors are very wooden and do not seem to be in this film, but maybe it's only part of the decadent atmosphere. <br /> <br /> I did not like the ending, but there is a sequel, I need to follow it. <br /> <br /> When I watched the movie, I thought that Brendan Hughes did not really fit that role. Later, I could not stop thinking about him, he seems to exude an amazing sensuality, so maybe he was right in that role. <br /> <br /> BRENDAN HUGHES Last seen in "Hitler - the rise of evil" as Lieutenant Guffman. <br /> <br /> Where is he now?
