This movie is absolutely stunning. New Blade Runner - the future noir in this most severe. The vision of Paris is great, both recognizable and visionary, with vast views, grungy sets and futuristic virtual reality. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite simple, with a few surprises, but I do not like it the most about the movie. This is a visual feast. <br /> <br /> Made in 3D and rendered in black and white (without gray!) with only one short point of color, it is less difficult for the eyes than it sounds. There are many "artistic" camera shots - close-ups and weird points of view - but this only adds to the film's temperament. In general, you have the impression of a graphic novel in the form of a material. <br /> <br /> At first I had the impression that the film was subjected to rotoscopy, this was the level of animation and the high detail of the character's facial expressions. But unlike "A Scanner Darkly" - who suffers from (or is in fact reinforced) inconsistent character definition (see only how some hair changes shape!) - The Renaissance is coherent and precise. When the character is in close-up, additional details and textures can be seen, but when halfway through or further away, the details are skipped, but not to the detriment of the character's definition. <br /> <br /> For me, the only disadvantage of the film is that in one comment we were told that it is a one-off project. It is a pity, because I would like to see more of this futuristic plot of the noir movie, especially this innovative graphic style. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the English dub is great too. <br /> <br /> All in all a great movie and highly recommended.
