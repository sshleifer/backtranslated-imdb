I recently bought a very underrated Dreamcast and went to the city to find games that I could use. I bought Soul Calibur (classic) and then I went through the Resident Evil Code Veronica domain. I have Resident Evil 1 and 2 and have played Res Evil 3 many times and have been impressed with all of them, especially since the number 1 that has to go down in history is classic. <br /> <br /> But none of them is close to the dream game of Brilliant Gory. When it comes to buying a dream game for this game, it's worth every moment of your time and effort, I've never been so fascinated by a computer game as I was enchanted. <br /> <br /> In any case, the story continues the second story in which Claire Redfield is looking for his brother (Chris - from the first story), who is probably lost under a terrible umbrella corporation. Little is known about this corporation, except for the fact that you destroyed it three times in previous magazines. <br /> <br /> By helping Claire, with the assistant of the super god Steve, you must unlock the location of your brother. The second CD lets you control Chris if you manage to get that far without the fear of leaving the room. <br /> <br /> The control is very smooth, and the character's movements are extremely realistic, when the character notices the danger, he faces the direction from which he comes. PURE GENIUS !! <br /> <br /> Overall, I gave this game 10/10, because it's just a game of the year, a decade game and the best game in the world with full stop !!. Buy this game as soon as possible.
