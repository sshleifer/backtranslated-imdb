Good action and interesting plot. After seeing the original, I must say that it was an interesting improvement and showed more of the film. Good cast .. significant acting ... though it would be nice to see more expansion in action scenes than in the background. A fun movie to watch and keep vigilant all the time 7/10 is the right voice!
