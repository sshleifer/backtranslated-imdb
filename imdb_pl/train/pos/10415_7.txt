Three flash-backs depict the main characters (Abu, Jaffar and Princess) who will interact with Ahmad; three are songs, each of them related to the same characters. Three times Ahmad utters the absolute word "Time" in his declaration of love for the Princess, answering her three questions during the first of the three meetings. It is so strong that it gives the impression that the princess will resist three attempts to get her by Jaffar - three more tricks: cheating, hypnosis and erasing the memory. However, Jaffar is the owner of what he describes as the three inevitable tools of domination over a woman: whip, power and sword. Three are the number of flying beings: a mechanical horse, a Genie, a Genie, and a magic carpet. Gin offers three wishes for Abu during the first of three meetings; three times Gin laughs loudly in the mountain ravines, and three are his reflections on human weakness before he goes away. Abu overcomes three obstacles in the Temple of Dawn (armed guards, giant spiders and giant octopuses). Three are the tools of justice: the magical eye that shows Abu the future, the magic carpet that moves him just in time to save Ahmad and the princess, and the bow and arrow to perform Jaffar. Number three has magic, and in this movie is magic.
