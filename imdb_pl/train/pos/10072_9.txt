Unexpected pleasure because I have not heard anything about this film. <br /> <br /> Bashful because it guarantees a wider audience. <br /> <br /> A wonderfully human story with a mild social message, although it is predictable in its resolution. Principals acted solidly. Beautifully photographed with muted colors hovering against a gray background that captures the nostalgic tone of the film. <br /> <br /> My last trip to a Chinese movie (Shower, House on the Road, Not one less) was exciting and I hope to continue the study. China and their people are an amazing canvas for filmmakers. "The King of Masks" can be highly recommended as a starting point for anyone similarly interested in the last Chinese film. <br /> <br />
