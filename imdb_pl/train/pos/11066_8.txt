For a long time it seemed that all good Canadian actors headed south of the border and (as I guessed) all the other ranks filled the highest places, and that left the remains of sexual comedies. <br /> <br /> This movie was a real surprise: despite the bizarre threads typical of farces, the actors seemed to try to put something into their characters and what we, viewers, came back, was almost a real suspension of faith. When the statistics from the video clip attacked the eviction police, you almost believed it was possible. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of some of the better sex (Canadian or not), you should definitely look for it outside. And the big surprise is that this sexual farce is also full of very good nudity.
