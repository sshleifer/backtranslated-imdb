I used this movie in the religion classes I taught. The golden fish floats happily in its bowl in an apartment on the first floor. A young boy and his mother are out. The boy received money to buy milk. On the way home, he stops at the carnival to play the game. Next to him is a man in a black suit looking a little scary. The boy drops a bottle of milk. Breaks. A man in a black suit gives him money to replace milk. This scene is intertwined with what is happening at home. The black cat climbs into a fire and enters the apartment. He (?) Discovers a fish bowl and watches it. The fish floats vigorously and jumps out of the bowl. So far, a group of teenagers from my class and I fell in love with this fish. The cat takes a fish to the mouth and we all hold our breath. The cat drops the fish into a bowl. The double plot contains a suspicious man in black and a suspicious black cat. Both inspire prejudice. Both are innocent. This was a great start to discussions in my class.
