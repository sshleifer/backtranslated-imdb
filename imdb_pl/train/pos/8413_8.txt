A stupid young man is obsessed with a woman - so obsessive that he loses perspective and common sense. The evil magician approaches him and informs him that he can give him the great wealth that he can use to win the heart of her, if he agrees to give him everything he wants, he is in their room. The stupid guy agrees, and the magician steals the reflection of the man from the mirror - and as a result, bad things appear. <br /> <br /> If this movie was made only ten years later, I'm sure that they were not so good at reviewing and scoring this movie. After all, the plot of the film is a little unclear in places, and acting is sometimes a bit stiff. However, if you take into account that in 1913, "feature" movies were rare - and often only 20-30 minutes! What's more, the whole idea of ​​a complex story, like in this film, is very unusual - the stories were very short and widely disseminated. Given the time constraints, this movie is pretty good and is one of the earlier known horror movies.
