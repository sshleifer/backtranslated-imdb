Jay Chou plays an orphan raised in a kung fu school, but kicked out by a corrupt director after a fight with a gang of thugs employed by a wicked villain. It happens that Eric Tsang, a cheater with a knock down, immediately sees the potential of money in the skills of a young man. Basketball is the chosen path to wealth, and Tsang offers him a place in the university team and promoting it in the media. Overall success leads to the basketball championship and a really nasty team of rivals managed by the same wicked villain from the earlier. <br /> <br /> It's probably a bit of Shaolin Soccer, but not as bizarre or funny - the plot is pretty close to the conventions of a sports movie and provides all the elements that the crowd expects from the configuration. You've seen it before, but it's a kind of thing that never hurts anymore when it's over. Fortunately, this is really well done (some may say "surprisingly" with Chu Yen-Ping in the director's chair ... I expect he had good "assistants") - the script ensures and the presentation is smooth and stylish. Jay Chou remains quite expressionless, but this is his style, and when he allows emotions to flicker on him, it can be quite a good comic effect. Eric Tsang compensates for a larger than life character, which he has played many times (for example in real life), which gets many of the most exciting movies. <br /> <br /> Because the movie revolves around basketball, it's good that the scenes of basketball games are appropriately thrilling. The cast shows some real skills, including Chou, and some well-made network connections and CGI add an element of hyper-realistic kung fu skill that makes the scenes even more fun (assuming you like these things) and justify the story of the movie. <br /> <br /> There is only one significant scene of the fight in the film, but it is a doozy in the style of "one on many". Jay Chou does a lot of his own moves and is impressive - he is clearly quite strong and fast, and choreography by Ching Siu-Tung makes him look like a real martial artist. I would like there to be more, but at least it's a long fight. <br /> <br /> Very similar to the Chinese New Year, I hoped it would be with a trailer and recommended to watch!
