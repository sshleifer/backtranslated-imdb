As the creator of "this darkness", I admit that we neglected three very important thanks to our endpoints. Omissions were excessive goals that could not be repaired after they were committed, and the parties involved - whoever saw the movie - did not mention it at that time. On behalf of the great cast and crew of the movie, I'm sorry. Of course, some of the critical remarks here are sharp in the light of the accidental recognition of their loan. Our production values ​​were negligible, and our "special effects" were really special, but the plot is very strong, and the photos of John McLeod are wonderful. We hope that you, the reader, will enjoy "The Darkness" and the efforts of those who have worked without hurry. Thank you, Dylan O'Leary, director.
