It was a great romantic comedy! Historically inaccurate (Einstein did not have nieces or nephews, as mentioned elsewhere in IMDb), but he was a great matchmaker. He collected two very nice people played by the two best actors. Supporting staff (Lou Jacobi, Joseph Maher, Gene Saks, Stephen Fry, etc.). Everything clicked on the screen and made it a great visual experience. The fact that he was driving a car to move, seems to deny all those paintings and posters that he rides on a bike to get around. And did he wear socks in one scene ... apparently the professor never wore socks! (Two new entries for the Goofs IMDb section.) Apart from historical inaccuracies and inconsistencies, it was a great movie to watch with a great cast. I give him 8!
