I do not remember that this movie became a cinema. I only saw it when it hit the cable. The film concerns the dehumanization of children into killing machines. One person in particular, the way in which he is replaced and abandoned (literally) in a community outside of the world in which he can not cope with who he really is and what he feels. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that many people expected it to be Rambo in space and would be happy if it were. <br /> <br /> I'm certainly glad it was not - Kurt does a great job of an emotional cripple. The scene in which he sits outside the complex area shows this, although the decision of two repetitions in a slow motion reduces the moment. <br /> <br /> This is not a classic SF movie in the same way as Bladerunner, Alien, Silent running, Logan's Run or THX1138 were, but unfortunately the closest one I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> Changes the film to a credible degree, does not crack Arnie, does not become Snake Plissken and has no definite happy ending. <br /> <br /> That's why this movie did not go off well. This was not in line with the formula, and it is unforgivable among the 18-25-year-old American target audience, because it was not what they expected. <br /> <br /> Fear and discipline. <br /> <br /> Always.
