Paul Verhoeven (a brilliant and master movie producer) repeats less than a perfect, yet funny way to "dirty old man", Hollow Man. The first two acts are so good that the final act fails. Nevertheless, I recommend this film to get MIND BLOWING special effects (maybe the best so far) and two Dandy performances. Verhoeven's moral questions are obviously provocative and even though the movie has turned off a lot, this movie is quite soft for old Verhoeven. <br /> <br /> Two main disadvantages: Josh Brolin (also known as the walking monkey) the whole thing with the elevator. If there was an access ladder, why were they trapped in the lab? <br /> <br /> A funny horror movie on a Saturday night.
