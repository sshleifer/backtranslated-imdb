This is one to watch a few times. Excellent writing programs that must have survived in this story, or know someone who did it because they nailed him. Freebird made me relive and laugh at my badly spent youth. The title was a great choice. Great movie, setting, history, soundtrack and characters. It's a motorcyclist's move, but it would be a shame to risk it. Amusing to the bone, a bit like the Trailer Park Boys in the UK. If you have never seen TPB, please indicate if you like this movie. Thank you, I hope to see more of these characters in other movies. Continue? It can be done. There is a lot more of the world that I would like to see through their eyes.
