**** SPOILERS **** Powerhouse movie that shows how men in desperate situations can go to dedicate their best friends and family members and do not realize what monsters are doing. As with the Gypo Nolanda bull, Victor Mclaglen, it is too late. <br /> <br /> It is 1922 and the peak of the Black & Tan rebellion against the powerful British Empire of Tans, the British occupying forces in search of the Irish Republican rebel Frankie McPhillip, Wallace Ford, wanted to kill Briish. Gypo a good, really best friend of an escaped McPhillip who is not working with his girlfriend Katie, Margot Grahame, forced to trick her in the red light district in Dublin to pay her rent. /> <br /> After an outraged Gypo working on a potential John who wants to spend a few hours with Katie, for a shilling or two, the furious Katie tells the not-too-bright Gyro that she is prevented from supporting only the banking assets she owns, her body. Katie also tells Gypo that he should wake up in reality and realize how desperate he is. Speaking of the dazed Gypo that will go to America and get out of poverty in Ireland, it will cost only ten pounds sterling Gypo suddenly remembers the poster of his good friend Frankie McPhillip, who just announced a prize of 20 pounds sterling. That's enough money for both him and Kaite to go to America. <br /> <br /> Gypo going to the local home on the flop in Dublin and the soup to get a free meal, is surprised when he hits his friend Frankie McPhillip. Frankie tells him he came to Dublin to see his mother, Mrs. McPhillip, and sister Maria, Una O'Connor and Heather Angel, and if he can make sure everything is safe for him to go home, then go to an Irish Republican unit outside the city. <br /> <br /> Everything that Gypo can see on Frankie's face is 20 pounds sterling for being turned into police! Without thinking, after he assured Franki that everything was all right, Gypo secretly goes to the police and informs his friend, who was later shot in a police and dance shoot-out at his mother's home. <br /> <br /> With the action of the chief of police, more than 20 pounds sterling, like thirty pieces of silver, to almost dispassionate Gypo who takes them and slips out the back door of the police station so that you can see him. On the police officer's face and actions, there is nothing but complete contempt for Gypo's betrayal of his friend Frankie McPhillip. Although he was wanted for the murder and the enemy of the British Empire. In this way, low traitors or informers are kept even by those for whom they secretly work. <br /> <br /> Gypo turns out to be his greatest enemy after Franki's betrayal, when his conscience takes control of his mind. Gypo sees and hears everyone, including his unsuspecting girlfriend, Katie, pointing with his finger and dragging him into Frankie's betrayal and death at the hands of the British authorities. Gypo's guilty mind makes him a royal and glorious drunk, in a monetary reward, that before he is forced to admit his crime to his fellow Irish Republican army, who were almost dead, drunk and persecuting Gypo on trial, the money was just gone for partying and drunk. <br /> <br /> Any good feelings, if possible, that for a weak mind and a strong arm Gypo was completely torn down, when in the act of total desperation, in order not to be shot, falsely entangles the innocent man Mulligan, Donald Mack, in his crime of informing his friend Frankie McPhillip. What quickly reveals itself as a complete fabrication by Gypo himself, who is not offended by guilt. The dye is then cast, when the straws are pulled out, for whom it would be the one that would put the ball in Gypo's head for the last spillage of the heart-rending and unforgettable Crime & Punishment classic.
