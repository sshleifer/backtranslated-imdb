Some sayings on "The Play is the most important things," or something like that, are attributed to the old Bard of Avon, William Shakewspeare himself. if it was not an old Will, it could be our own, super-veteran movie director, Raoul Walsh. There are many of his films that support this hypothesis. None of them are more appropriate than GENTLEMAN JIM (Warner Brothers, 1942). <br /> <br /> The film also rewards another prize, called Errol Flynn's favorite of his own vehicles. He clearly shows evidence on the screen that can easily lead viewers sitting in a darkened theater or watching it on their home TVs or DVDs to see the same thing. <br /> <br /> To be sure, the story is semi-serious Biopic, which contains part of the actual material and combines it with a liberal dose of old imagination, to bring us a very satisfying, though slightly fabularized (which is not Biopic?). <br /> <br /> Casting is perfect because it uses the natural athletics of our lead, Mr. Errol Flynn. GENTLEMAN JIM, although not a Swashbuckler, Western or a War image, is probably the main role that best suited a durable Australian. <br /> <br /> Errol was a member of the Australian Olympic boxing team in either 1928 or 1932. His training and skills in "sweet science" are clearly visible throughout the film, especially in the "Great Fight" for the World Boxing Championships hard with the great John L. Sullivan (played expertly on Ward Bond) The cast sounds like a duty duty on the supporters of the Warner Brothers players. It includes Alan Hale as the father of Jim Corbeta, the operator of Livery Wagon *. His two brothers are Harry and George (Pat Flaherty and James Flavin), two men from the family of "blue collars", and their professions are referred to as "Longshormen". <br /> <br /> Big Jack Carson does his usual masterly comic performance as a friend of Jim Corbett and bank teller. The rest that we can both recognize and remember are: John Loder, William Frawley, Madeleine LeBeau, Minor Watson, Rhys Williams, Arthur Shields, Dorothy Vaughn, just to name a few. <br /> <br /> He also used the director of Walsh, a series of Pro Wrestlers in the roles of various boxers. Thus Ed "Strangler" Lewis and the unknown Grappler * are described as 2 pugs in the early stages. Others are Sammy Stein, Mike Mazurki (they've ever heard of him?) And "Wee Willie" Davis. These guys had a powerful, and at the same time unpolished look, which had brawlers from Pier 9. <br /> <br /> We have not forgotten about Lady Leading, Alexis Smith. She is powerful in characterizing an "independent" woman, but retains enough real skills as a comedian in many scenes. She performs in her field as a poor, little rich girl, Victoria Lodge. <br /> <br /> With all these ingredients at hand, the trick is how to mix items in the right proportions to give them the right 'mix' look. Well, Director Walsh does it with reckless abandonment. Because he is looking for a great movie above all. His treatment shows all the skills that he perfected to perfection, starting from the time when he was a D.W. Griffith. Mr. Walsh seems to have a special fondness for this period, 1890. *** Mr Walsh's direction moves in a relatively fast clip scenario, dividing the exhibition scenes with a humorous timeline, "Corbetty are in it again!" That is why he is able to keep light , even a humorous accent in history, which can become too grainy and serious. <br /> <br /> Moreover, in an almost imperceptible element, Walsh brother gives us an authentic San Francisco look from the 1890s. his passion for this period creates broad, dynamic images of historical battles for prizes, a lively, cheerful mood in the boxing scenes, as the crowning of this amazing, perhaps underestimated movie, director Walsh gave the painting a look like an illustration of The Police Gazette, which included such events in these "Old Days". <br /> <br /> But there is only one thing to display before displaying it. If it's the first time or if you see it again: <br /> <br /> "CORBETY ARE ALREADY AGAIN !!" <br /> <br /> * In my humble opinion, as a historian of both Film and Pro Wrestling, it looks like Tor Johnson, who after many years was the favorite of director Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> ** "Livery" is a bit of an archaic term for a rental vehicle for local urban transport. <br /> <br /> *** That's true. Mr. Raoul Walsh was Griffith Veteran Player. He was an actor who played the role of John Wilkes Booth in THE BIRTH OF OF NATION (1915). <br /> <br /> **** Born in 1887, Raoul Walsh was old enough to have his own memories of the 1890s and the Sullivan-Corbett Championship and what it meant for Athletic Life in America of that time.
