What would happen if a depressed policeman worked with a fall during the trial period? It can be a lot of fun ... This movie set the benchmark in the action / comedy genre of Argentine cinema. Frightening figures, probable story and pace, which has a thrill between laughter. I recommended it for a pleasant time of entertainment. Peretti and Luque combine their efforts in the fight against a cold and bold enemy at a time when it is difficult to trust someone. This movie will surprise you, the other side of the coin "Analyze me", but not the same, with nothing to envy. And if you want to know Bs.AS where there are several scenes from the center and the city center.
