This film has great stars in earlier years: Ingor Stevens never looked nicer; Yul Brynner was a very persuasive Jean LaFitte who argued about his piracy and wanted to remain neutral towards the United States. Charlton Heston did quite a good job as Andrew Jackson, but some of the moments were a bit stiff. It is really a good move for students to learn this part of our history, and this shows that all happy endings do NOT include lovers meeting each other - sometimes a happier ending is that they are leaving and finding partners of similar origin will understand them better on longer run. I have watched it every year at least twice since 16 years; and although this is not the best movie I've ever seen, I love it every time!
