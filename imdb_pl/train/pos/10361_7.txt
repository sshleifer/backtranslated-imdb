Once you take your jaw off the floor, realizing that ... somehow ... you have managed to combine it all so quickly that it was released in the same year that the case ended, you'll find that it's not half bad. The plot is captivating and interesting, and the pace is fast, which involves many situations and therefore often jumps quickly to the next after saying a line or two. Where it really stands out is acting. The performances are excellent. Neill and Streep are impeccable. It's great to hear so much Australian spoken in a Hollywood movie, and even those who do not come naturally, at least try to accentuate. Pictures and editing are nice enough, but they do not really go beyond standard things. The story of this film is fascinating, and the fact that it is authentic makes it even cooler. Although I have not read a novel or heard about what has happened outside of this image, I understand that it is quite close to the truth. There is some moderate or strong language and disturbing content. Sometimes it's a great court drama. I recommend it to every similar fan. 7/10
