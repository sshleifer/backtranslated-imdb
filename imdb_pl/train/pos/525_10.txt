Shortly after the end of World War II, Powell & Pressburger was asked to come up with something that could heal the gap between the United Kingdom and the United States. At the time, there were many comments like "Overpayment, over sex and here". Somehow they invented this masterpiece. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie of all time. He has everything. Romance, poetry, emotions, religion, drama and very bizarre. <br /> <br /> I can never explain exactly why, but it hits all the right buttons and although I've seen it a hundred times (yes, really) I still have a guarantee that I will be tearing at many points. <br /> <br /> Was it a great acting game, great sets, inspired scenario? Who knows. But * SEE it and you'll see what I mean.
