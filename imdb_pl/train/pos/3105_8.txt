The Bourne Ultimatum is the third and final trip for the super-spy Jason Bourne, a man who is about to kill people who have become a murderer. The Bourne series is one of the highest rated trilogy critics (Ultimatum has 85/100 on metacritic.com, which means that it is "universal recognition" and for good reason - the fight is very well planned, and a deep story can be very engrossing First, I advise you to view Bourne's Identity and Bourne's Supremacy, two fancy titles for the Ultimatum, there may be three different films, but in fact they are all continuations one by one: the missing leaves confused and disoriented like me, you will still enjoy the action and fight the Ultimatum scenes if you missed the first two, but then the story will certainly lead to some confusion. /> <br /> If you were lucky to watch the prequels for this movie, you probably had the pleasure of watching Bourne, who dealt with his enemies and track down the man who screwed him up with Supremacy. Jean Bourne plays ba All right, Matt, Damon, Damon is not doing anything to earn an Oscar, and his work here is good enough to keep his property. The adventures of Bourne take place in many different cities; all cities are so diverse that sometimes the movie does not become bland. The Bourne tracking agency uses every technological tool known to humanity to track it down. <br /> <br /> I will not describe the characters in detail because they are a continuation of the first two films. However, it does not hurt the film to write a few things for the audience - not every viewer is an ardent movie observer who can catch every little clue about the development of history. The Ultimatum would not have been hurt at all if history were a bit more in the front. <br /> <br /> It seems that most people agree that the Ultimatum was a movie success: the film opened at $ 69 million, and - the sum at the box office is currently up to $ 216 million - is still looking for a movie very much that has been in theaters since August 3. This is the best action movie I've seen since Live Free or Die Hard. <br /> <br /> Well) Damon is a solid but not spectacular, very intelligent movie. Bad) History is like many others
