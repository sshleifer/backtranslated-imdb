There were great moments of reality depicting modern life (not only in Japan, but everywhere). It shows how stifling can be culture, and wanting to break free from the form created for you. <br /> <br /> The dance was just a means to say: "Do what you love, even if it's against the norm." Rather Billy Elliot, I would say. I liked this movie too. <br /> <br /> Humor was well set in time, and touching moments were so real that you could feel the awkwardness between Sugiyama and his wife, tantrums in the dance room. I loved Aoki - he and this wig and his excess on the dance floor just made me howl! <br /> <br /> All the actors did a great job, the story was well written. I watched it a second time and noticed some minor nuances that I missed during my first viewing. Good entertainment!
