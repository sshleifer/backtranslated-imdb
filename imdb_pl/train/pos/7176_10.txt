OK - you want to test someone about how comfortable they feel during puberty and shameful and manic changes - then immediately react to watching this noisy documentary about children doing socially relevant horror films in the suburbs of the 80s. More than any movie I've ever seen, the movie deals with sex and ego burden in a completely human, never boring, and blush-like kind of innate goodness of youth, which is discolored by a frenzied adult world in which every eccentricity in youth is accredited for everything from madness to perversion. Darren Stien, a mini-tycoon, seems to reach for a deeper understanding of his triumphs and fears as a patriarch of austere childish world. What he finds in himself and others is not always nice - but shows how you can improve and come to terms with age. What changes without reflection. I love that movie.
