Mild Spoilery <br /> <br /> In the near future, Arnold will appear as Ben Richards, an unjustly convicted man forced to play The Running Man, a deadly television game show in which people have to move, trying to escape the brutal death of the hands. " stalkers ". Of course, people are expected to die eventually and Arnold will prove that the system is wrong. <br /> <br /> I have not read Stephen King's book, but it's a great movie, regardless of which one is the best Arnold. He does what he does best in the role of an action man, delivering death with unforgettable individual lines. Classics are probably "He was a real neck pain" after suffocating a guy with barbed wire and "He had to split up", referring to a place where he just saw someone upright. Dawson is annoying as a TV presenter, and all "Stalkers" are camped accordingly. The action is violent, but it is an action movie. That's it. The film is fast and after 90 minutes it is not exaggerating with the party. <br /> <br /> Along with Paul Michael Glaser and Starsky and Hutch at the forefront and The Terminator created after the success, this film was probably seen as another thoughtless action vehicle for Arnold and very far-reaching. But today, anyone watching a lot of television can see how the movie is approaching reality. I would not be surprised if I turn on the TV in the "near future" and see a program that will not be far from it. <br /> <br /> On this depressing note, however, I must recommend "The Running Man" to anyone who likes the 80's, Arnold, funny acts or violence or just good action movies. 9. 5/10
