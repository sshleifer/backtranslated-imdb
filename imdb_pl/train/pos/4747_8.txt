Anyone who has never seen anything like the battle scene in The Matrix has never seen this movie. The battle scenes were choreographed by the action-based psychopath Yuen Woo Ping, who also fought in the Matrix. And fighting scenes are something. <br /> <br /> Li plays a supersoldier who does not feel pain, who now lives his life as a pacifist librarian (you have me). When other villains start killing local drug lords to take over drug trafficking, Li works with his cronies to help stop them. <br /> <br /> There are a few crazy things happening in this movie (one badguy pulls his hand out of the glass and almost does not notice). The battle scenes are full of flying kicks and punches; that's where the body counts. Li was rarely better, and he surrounded himself with a group of beautiful female costumes (Yip kicked a serious ass as a supersoldier colleague). Anthony Wong even creates an episode as a drug lord (there are no surprises, he creates an episode in each HK movie). It's unfortunate that they do not make such action movies in the US; I would not have to sit through all these awful dubbing jobs to see the action I want so much. Recommended.
