In his first debut in this film, he has some thrilling and chilling moments in his veins. In the best movie style, the horror of the stomach tightens at any moment of the film. The ending is great. The creators of Blaire Witch apparently watched the movie, which ended not with the end but with the beginning of the end. A great movie and just a piece of great Japanese, when it comes to horror, an excellent result makes you think and scared.
