This typical Mamet movie provides a calm, even insight into what makes a man of trust (Joe Mantegna) good. Explored as a psychological examination by a well-known psychologist (Lindsay Crouse), he slowly draws her into his world with usual nasty consequences. The cast included several players who found several Mamet movies (Steven Goldstein, Jack Wallace, Ricky Jay, Andy Potok, Allen Soule, William H. Macy) and do their job well. I loved Lindsay Crouse in this movie and often wondered why she did not become a more-known player than she. Maybe I'm not looking at the right places! <br /> <br /> The film develops at a slow pace, with a flat dialogue, but it maintains the level of tension along its entire length, which logically leads to completion. You would expect a real profession at the end, but I found it uplifting and rewarding. I love that movie!
