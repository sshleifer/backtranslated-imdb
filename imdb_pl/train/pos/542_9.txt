When I first learned that Brian Krause will be in this movie, I wanted to see it. It took me a few weeks to realize that I had seen the original and loved it. So I had even more reasons to watch. Well, I watched. In fact, it was better than most sequels of TV movies. I hate what happens to Brian (you'll find out for yourself), and I did not like most characters, including Brian. But the film needed tacky, annoying and ragged characters to make Stanley Caldwell (Judd Nelson) shine again. At the end I cheered Stanley and his happy ending. If you liked the original cabin on the lake or you like horror movies without blood, I would suggest you watch it.
