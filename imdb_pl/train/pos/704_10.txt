This movie, though it may be a budget, is one of the best psychological thrillers I've ever seen. If you accept that from the very beginning there is a low budget, you can appreciate how good the story is, how well the script is written and how great the filmmaker was able to produce something so wonderful with such small money. > <br /> All elements of a great movie are here. Graphics, although digitally filmed, was great in some places. The bizarre, dreamy atmosphere of the film is particularly well visible in the scene with a talking dog, this scene was simply amazing. It's such a monstrous work, but not done in a pretentious way and for this reason I have great respect for this film. It is recommended to anyone who is looking for something special and captivating, and different from the many repetitive movies that are there.
