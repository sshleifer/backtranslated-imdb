And my children love it now! Of course, I can watch it now and realize that the animation was not so great, and the plot is trivial. Hey, if every villian introduced himself, saying, "I am ammmmm DAAAARRRKK HEEEEAAARRT", I think you can laugh at them, but for young children it's a moral story with catchy music. <br /> <br /> Music so catchy, remember that I still had memorized words after I have not seen this movie for twenty years. I would definitely suggest this for younger children.
