1967 In Cold Blood was probably more "real" (Think about it: do we really want to see reality?), But he was black and white in a colorful world, and many people do not even know what it was, and there was an opportunity to convert it for television. In addition, if you convert it, you can show some things not shown in the original. The book In Cold Blood Truman Capote was the first "novel from non-fiction". In fact, Truman's book was not 100% faithful to the true story. I thought the Canadian location was enough for Kansas to be a TV movie. Look for elements of sex, drugs and rock'n'roll: the female Dick, Perry as a drug addict, Perry plays the blues guitar.
