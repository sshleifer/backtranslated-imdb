Paulie is the fantasy of a smaller girl, and maybe the memory of her youth, like growing up. <br /> <br /> Tony Shaloub performs flawless performances as a Russian scientist who can not find a decent job in America. He befriends an isolated parrot while performing the duties of a caretaker in a behavioral scientific laboratory. <br /> <br /> The Chief Doctor is a bitter man, because Paulie, who can speak, fully understand the language and learn, embarrasses the Doctor who later drives him to the lower levels of the building where he finds him Mikail (Tony S.) . <br /> <br /> Paulie cancels her life with Marie and how they lose each other. The task begins to connect Pauli and Marie again, it's only been over 20 years. <br /> <br /> The film ends, some will say predictably, Mikail will meet Paulie with Marie again. The story ends when three people enter the house of Marie, where you can make the final you choose yourself. <br /> <br /> A great family movie!
