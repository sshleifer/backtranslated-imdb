Note to the previous reviewer: This movie is an "adaptation of the science fiction Iliad," according to the screenwriter. So, whether the references are painful or not, without apologies, it's the basis of the movie. They admit that they have stolen ... although it is adapted to P.C. term. <br /> <br /> Great traffic, but too short. Probably it did not work out as the author, director or studio wanted, but it's damn cool. The fact that the studio itself is implied during creation only contributes to its legacy. <br /> <br /> A remake with a big budget would not be so much fun and probably would not do more justice. But it's great to dream about the potential. A DVD release with some modest additions is apparently available, but I do not think it plays on NTSC players. I'm not an expert and I'm still trying to figure it out. For now, I live with the incorporation of VHS.
