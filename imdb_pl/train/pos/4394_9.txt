So the neighbor killed the neighbor. It reminds me of Iraq. When I watched the American flag (50 stars in 1864) pulled by a horse, I realized why burning this piece of red white and blue does not upset me as much as our destruction / indifference to the Charter of Rights. I am a Southerner and I must have a historical memory. <br /> <br /> Watching the figure of Tobey McGuire learning to respect the dignity of a former slave, when he looks at the blacks and Germans' scales (his ethnic origin) betting on poker ..... was interesting. Many twists in this movie. A wife who is forced into her marriage shows both lust and strong will, qualities that we are not used to in "respectable Victorian southern bells". <br /> <br /> The crazy sprawling renegade of the southerner gave me some insight into why my cousin, the head of Copeland Horse-thieving Gang, Inc. in Mississippi, was suspended at this time. Teams of homeless men wandered around the village, armed. Remind me about Iraq? How similar are we to the facade of religion and ethnicity? And why the southerners are still fighting this civil war today. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that we can not use the same knowledge in our dealings with the country that we have just invaded and occupied, fueling civil war everywhere. It is Mesopotamia, now called Iraq, which is unlucky to sit on oil. Wild murderers in Missouri, attacking Lawrence, Kansas can easily be insurgents, with whom we are now fighting without success. <br /> <br /> Another anomaly was the homage of the father to the Yankees, who moved to Lawrence and straightened the school "before they built the church. And that's why they will win. " Huh ????? I studied history in Birmingham, Al, and we were taught that the North is much more industrial and richer ... and that's why they won. Of course, LITERALLY they had God on their side. As you can see, when a freed slave indicates that he is cutting out to free his mother, sold in slavery in Texas. God, that gave us a horrible legacy of slavery. <br /> <br /> Acting quite well, a lot of blood and blood when the warriors ride happily in battle (but they have not heard any rebellious screams, so they resemble football matches in Alabama). You also get a real impression of how stupid war was when rioters and jayhawkers gather their strength for another raid. They lost sight of why they fight too. Even more thoughtless slaughter. <br /> <br /> You are also up to date with vulnerable children returning home from Iraq, as the bushwacker (ahh, what connotations) first has a closed arm, trying to save them, then amputating and then dying. So much suffering for such a stupid cause. <br /> <br /> The photos are fantastic. Now I have to go back to DVD and download production notes, one of my favorite parts of every movie. I suspect that this movie was written by Gore Vidal because the spoken language is the kind that you associate with this era if you know the story. Dialogue definitely provokes thinking. By no means a mere war movie of blood and guts. You see wounded, but still active soldiers, still fighting, because they have nothing else to do. You see the southern invaders, living from the land, stealing blindly. However, at the beginning you saw the battle stopped so that women could be evacuated from danger. When I read about the growing number of women and children dying in Iraq, I think, "Where have we lost the sense of honor as a nation?" I forgot why I was looking for this movie and bought it after 20 years, but some book praised it. There is a good reason. Tobey at its best, against Spideyman. Buy a DVD or rent. And tell me why others praise it, not just liberals.
