I've never seen such amazing acting in a movie like when I saw Daniel Day-Lewis playing Christy Brown on My Left Foot. In fact, his role did not end outside the stage. He played the role of Christy Brown, or at least he was disabled like him throughout the filming of the film and needed surgery due to the damage he caused to his higher act. For me it is extraordinary and for all the pain I have to face to play this role, I think it is quite true to say that he scored the Oscar-winning performance in history. He was so masterful in this difficult part that I think nobody would be able to do it better or more than he did. Although I can not say that this is the best movie of all time, I can say that the way it played this impossible role, and then played it until it was played, is without a doubt the biggest rate I've ever seen an actor do. Probably also a man.
