Essentially, this movie is one of those rare films that you either hate, and you think they're bordering on suicide, as another best thing to do, instead of sitting for two hours. Or, as in my case, you perceive it as a cult hit, one of those movies in which humor, plot, acting are in fact very hidden, but for those of us who want to look for it, trusting the director well, the prize is: laugh at ... The fact that you have to find the things mentioned above actually makes the movie even more fun because you get the impression that the director is not even aware of how funny his movie is, which does not seem like probable and this lies the intelligence at the forefront of this wonderful project called: Spaced Invaders !!
