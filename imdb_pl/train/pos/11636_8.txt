A beautifully filmed, well-played, closely screened movie of the suspense. I had me on the edge of my seat. I really liked the main actress and I thought that the villain was very well done. There is not much chewing about the subject, but if you just sit in your seat, turn your brain around, watch the fantastic camera work and enjoy the story, you will have a great time. The story is well worn, and ordinary viewers will probably know more or less what to expect after about ten minutes. But that did not bother me because I was enjoying how it was developing. In the old days, they could not focus so much on just two characters, and there were some tempting moments when I hoped they would allow other people to have several lines. But these people were probably right to make the movie so focused. The plot early threw me down my throat and never let go. It is not a good idea to think too much during or after a movie. because I'm not sure if it makes sense. Just sit back and enjoy yourself.
