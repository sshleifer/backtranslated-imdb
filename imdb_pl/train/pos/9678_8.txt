I made that I wanted my happy birds to be able to speak. Tisk tisk on the reviewer who rejected the movie. A sweet story that will appeal to people of all ages. Paulie is a nice little treasure. He has some clever lines that really made me laugh. I especially liked the dance sequences during his show business show. You can forgive the obvious stereotypes of how you support him in his quest to unite with Marie. A charming film with two strong characters that genuinely make friends with a small parrot separated from its young owner. He would like to see more a woman who becomes blind and has to leave her journey together. I liked her artistic and poetic inspiration, it's a shame she could not share Paulie's meeting. Bless Paulie in his new home, and finally with Maria, whom a nice young man can join, who helped him defeat his opponents to complete the journey.
