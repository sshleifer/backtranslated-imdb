Olivier, Kosentsev, Richardson, Coranado, Zefferelli and Almerayeda have directed Hamlet, but Branagh is the only one who did it well. <br /> <br /> This is the only "Hamlet" movie that contains the full four hours of William Shakespeare's masterpiece that gives a unique atmosphere to the story. <br /> <br /> Few directors could do it without the boredom of the audience, but Branagh's skilful use of daring movie style and stunt casting allows people to see the meaning of the scene, which is usually cut out. <br /> <br /> An example of this is Gerarde Depardue as Ranyaldo, whose purpose in the film was simply to say "yes, my lord" because Polonius asks him to spy on Leartes. It also included Billy Crystal as a gravedigger, Robin Williams as Osric, Jack Lemmon as Marcellous and Charlton Heston as an actor. <br /> <br /> Branagh's performance in stage 4 of soliloquy 4 (which is usually cut out) is nothing more than a cinematic miracle when the camera slowly moves away as the intensity increases. It's a scene that literally made me want to jump out of the chair and start applauding. <br /> <br /> Branagh is the only filmmaker who understood the meaning of each scene in this film and knew how to convey that weight to the audience. <br /> <br /> It is mandatory for anyone who likes a good story, brilliant acting and an amazing direction. All of these parts of William Shakespeare are the greatest triumph.
