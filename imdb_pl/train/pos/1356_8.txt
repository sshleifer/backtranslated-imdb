I started watching The Apprentice about 4 years ago (maybe 5) and I really enjoyed it. The first thing that strikes you is the refreshing format, which, though similar to many other reality shows, is still very funny. Donald Trump is also great as the host and main judge of the program. Also appreciated is the casting attack with intelligent people who look like players. But the best part of the program is the city of New York. Mark Burnett could do a lot of shit in his time, but his cinematography service is excellent because it makes NYC look like a character in itself. Jazz melodies combined with a great camera make New York look spectacular. <br /> <br /> Apprentice will easily make my 3rd best reality show of all time (The Amazing Race is, however, 1). But just like in an amazing race, this show is always best watched in moderation. If you watch it for a while, the originality of the show will decrease quickly (similar to the case of TAR). Star World, broadcasters in this country, did a daunting job of presenting the program. The first three seasons were shown in a row, and after two years were shown the next two seasons, which kept the concept fresh. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, you will love this concert, especially the first two seasons. However, if you watch the program constantly, its charm will CHANGE and FAST.
