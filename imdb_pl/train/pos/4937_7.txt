This film is actually up-to-date even today, taking into account the threat of bioterrorism and the dangers of superbugs, West Nile virus and SARS. As a thriller, the tension is quite intense. Richard Widmark and Paul Douglas are more than useful in their roles. The house scenes between Widmark and his wife are a nice interlude to the main story. The actor in this film, which most left a mark, is Jack Palance. His sharp features and seemingly laid back surroundings are always a way to reveal a greedy and cruel man under the surface. The chase scene at the packaging plant is impressive even today. Recommended, 7/10.
