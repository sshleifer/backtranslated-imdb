I love newer episodes with CJ and Grandad - I liked the story in which Kate fell in love with the director. I want to find out what will happen to Rory, Kerry, Bridget and my family. I think CJ is very funny and I love his scenes with his grandfather. I have always loved James Garner in everything he does, and this is due to his acting, that I never thought of him as James Garner or Rockford in the series and I believe him completely as Tata Kate. This family is so real and funny. It was terribly sad when John Ritter / Paul Hennessey died, but just like in real life, these things happen, and the way it was written in the series and advised was both funny and sad, and always treated with great tenderness and love. But generally a very entertaining program with lots of laughter and fun.
