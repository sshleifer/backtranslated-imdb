The third and final part of the Bourne (duh) trilogy is missing in the plot section, but it includes extensive action scenes! Twi in particular takes some time and makes the movie better. <br /> <br /> Sami the director and the star (Damon) agreed that it is difficult to find a story for the last part, because the end of the second movie was quite ... advanced in terms of the plot. How did they deal with it? Action scenes, at least once, but they also did something else that I can not reveal, because it would be a spoiler. But if you watch the movie, you'll notice it! Interestingly, I read that this adaptation of Bourne's books is the least accurate of all three films ... if that means something to you: o)
