A man at home is a real situational comedy in every sense of the word. The comedy is about a character called Robin Tripp (played by the great Richard O 'Sullivan), who is after a crazy party, ending at the house of two ladies named Jo and Chrissy. Ironically, the party was to say goodbye to the old roommate. It is obvious that it happens when it is introduced. <br /> <br /> The man at home was the forerunner to the Cooke and Mortimer show, George and Mildred, which included two owners who were the owners of Jo, Chrissy and Robin. These two characters would indeed be the harbingers of a man in the house with Mildred (late and very missing Yootha Joyce), in particular, getting one of the best lines in the series. The half-regular figure was Larry (Doug Fisher), a useless man who was always on guard and always appeared when he wanted to borrow something (and never give back). <br /> <br /> Americans version called the three companies, but there is no chance compared to this much more fun original. Thames risked a comedy about a man sharing a flat with two women in a very conservative time, but they should worry because in those days, estimates suggest that about 20 million people just wanted to see a good old-fashioned comedy inspired by casting and a sharp script. What a pity that modern comedy can not achieve such a high standard. <br /> <br /> This program is available on the network DVD
