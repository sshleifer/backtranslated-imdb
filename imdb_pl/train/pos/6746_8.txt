This is a great example of the quite simple story of Noir, which is exceptionally well supported - thanks to the excellent director Otto Preminger, as well as great performances. Dana Andrews acts as a hot detective who uses fists too often instead of the brain. Soon after the film starts, Andrews is reprimanded and warns him that if he does, he will turn off his forces. Somewhat later, during the investigation of the crime that the suspect had attacked, Andrews is forced to fight to defend himself. This time, he does NOT use excessive force, but the attacker is killed. Andrews panics and assumes that they will not believe him, so he tries to hide death - though an innocent man is guilty instead. <br /> <br /> The film has much more than this - including a plot involving a slimy villain (Gary Merrill) and an interest in love for Andrews (Gene Tierney). In summary, this is one of the better examples of the genre - with great, rough dialogue, excellent lighting and a simple but very effective story. In this way, Noir was supposed to be.
