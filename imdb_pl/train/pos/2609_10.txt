I'm writing this nine years after the last episode was released and I still can not help influencing Wildside's influence on me. <br /> <br /> It's already gone when many other dramas of the policemen are gone and succeeded. But it took even more and did not go away from the realism of the streets, often presenting life events and characters up to T. <br /> <br /> I miss this series very much, instead we have a stupid "Underbelly" which has been dramatized and worked, creating a whole load of American esquire garbage. <br /> <br /> Wildside remained true to Sydney and I am really grateful for this wonderful series. Acting was A-grade and it's a pity that only a few actors have deepened their career, while others have faded into oblivion. <br /> <br /> I do not want Australia to forget this great part of their TV history, so please ABC to release the entire series on DVD, not the first three. Give this series the end it deserves.
