Christina Raines plays a charming model in New York, who is looking for a new apartment and begins to get to know strange neighbors, revealing the secret of the building and herself, slowly reaching a climax after the end of the movie. This film has many neat elements of the plot from the Roman Catholic Church versus the devil, through the gate to hell, through bizarre rituals, through the growing conspiracy, and finally to the group of talented famous actors and actresses flooding the film. We get Ava Gardner, Burgess Meredith, Chris Sarandon, Jerry Orbach, Debora Raffin, Arthur Kennedy, Jose Ferrer, Slyvia Miles, Beverly DeAngelo, Eli Wallach, Martin Balsam, Christopher Walkin, William Hickey, Tom Berenger, Jeff Goldblum and who can forget about John Carradine as an old priest. Many of these actors are tugging it - especially Burgess Meredith, giving a great comic / dazzling performance as one of the neighbors with a small bird and a cat. Meredith is memorable, as are Balsam and Chris Sarandon. Some of the performers have virtually nothing to do with Jose Ferrer in the ungrateful role, even if it is just an episodic episodic scene. Sentinel is a great horror with many psychological elements and really terrifying scenes. The final scene is repulsive and yet chilling in your veins. I find fault for unjustified sex and violence in the film, especially for the whole scene with DeAngelo and Miles. Was it really necessary? I think not. Also, the father and daughter's affairs were a bit better, but overall the film works and has a winning pace. Director Michael Winner performs a hard work and effectively creates tension and frightening moments of the film. The Carradine scenes are particularly effective.
