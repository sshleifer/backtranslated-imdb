When the two writers create the script of the "Breakfast At Tiffany's" horror, you know that something will go well. Drew Barrymore, Patrick Highsmith, Leslie Hope and Sally Kellerman are great actors. The FBI agent was a terrible actor. The scenes in which Patryk looked Holly up and down like an object were just weird. Drew Barrymore is very hot. Intimate Strangers, where Sally Kellerman worked, was a great part. The strange gummy worm was just weird. Nathan was a very handsome cat. But what was the scene where Patrick followed Holly to the cesspit, and Mr. Gooding attacked him? And the scene with Dr. Wallace? What was he doing there? And not every man has a woman, as Sally Kellerman said. And when Patrick and Elizabeth saw Drew outside Victor, it was weird.
