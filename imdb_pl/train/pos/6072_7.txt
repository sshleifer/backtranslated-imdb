Branagh and Fishburne provide excellent performances in this version of Shakespeare's classic. Branagh plays Iago better than I saw a character played in a film or on the stage. Some may say that this movie is overly focused on Iago, but I do not agree. Fishburne, the first black Othello in the history of the film ironically, provides powerful performance. Fishburne has always been a good actor, but this performance as Moorish Venice may be one of his best. <br /> <br /> The only problem I have with this movie is the simple subtraction of many important scenes. Desdemony has a much smaller depth than in the game. In this movie it might as well not be added. One of the worst cuts made by Branagh in this film was the subtraction of the conversation between Iago and Desdemona at the beginning of the second act. This part of the show shows that Desdemona may not be an innocent child that he depicts in this film. There were many subtractions that hurt the integrity of the film. <br /> <br /> If you have not read the game or have seen the Othello movie version before, I recommend this movie. The plot, cut or not, is still incredibly fascinating. The operation, as stated earlier, is very good. If a few important scenes were added and Desdemona's character was set to a slightly higher level, it would be a great movie. In its present form, it is still an admirable version of the original. I give this a marginal recommendation.
