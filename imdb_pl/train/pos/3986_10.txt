I am a university student and I need help and comments from anyone who has any views about the mother in the film, in the mother. Regardless of whether you have gone through something similar or if you just want to comment and help me learn more about this film, any comments would be highly appreciated. Comments will be used only for examination purposes and will be included in my written exam. So if you have any views at all, I'm sure I can use them and you can help me get A! I also study "About a Boy" and "Tadpole", so if you saw these movies, I would be grateful if you could leave comments on this site. Thank you.
