This film is full of humor, charming and easily becomes a favorite of those who like light entertainment. Hollywood is not a place for serious history lessons, so I just accept it the way it is. Bing, in his typically unique style, performs quite well as a blacksmith, Hank Martin, who by accident is transported back to another age, during the times of King Arthur. Beautiful Rhonda Fleming is breathtaking like Alisande or Sandy, the object of Hank's feelings, although she is engaged to brave and threatening Sir Lancelot, played by Henry Wilcoxon. <br /> <br /> I love this episode when King Arthur (Cedric Hardwicke), Sir Sagramore (Wm. Bendix) and Hank (Bing Crosby) dress up in torn clothing and set out on a high road with their backpacks to experience the kingdom first-hand. The comment of King Arthur: "I say that we are not alone", giving his sloppy robes scratches, is one of those funny moments in the film. The presentation of William Bendix is ​​perfectly ridiculous, not to mention his peculiar attempts "ye Olde English". <br /> <br /> The story is not deep, but in my opinion it is well done and I am happy the more every time I see it. It is also great entertainment for the whole family. <br /> <br />
