This movie is a great example of perfect story telling. Acting is great. The story is inspirational without excessive manipulation or falsity. There were a few points where they probably made people a little bit more good or bad than they really were, but given that it was a Hollywood movie, they showed incredible reticence. There was not a single explosion in the film, although they had one occasion. The film, although it has very tight parts, has not been filmed in the action movie. In this way, history focuses on an unusual man in unfortunately ordinary times. Good job!
