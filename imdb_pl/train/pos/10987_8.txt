Going through the Sci Fi weekly section at a local Video Rentals store, I was losing hope of finding good movies that I have not seen before. Renting Cypher was like a punt on a probably very bad horse. My son is so tired of the current Science Fiction B that he has not seen it yet. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that I did not see anything about Cypher when it was released in Australia. It must have been very quiet or I just did not notice it. <br /> <br /> Well, it was a really nice surprise! This is also not a B movie. It is not a "scooter" of an epic variety and does not try to be - a more silent movie that has to be seen several times to make its story fully tasted. <br /> <br /> The special effects are very strong when used - my only complaint is that the super helo is CGI speck at first glance, but they do it well on the second look, and besides everything else is at the highest level. In any case, affects are secondary. <br /> <br /> I will not reveal anything about the story. The plot structure has an aspect of a Russian doll a bit reminiscent of the Basic Instinct (though with very different content). <br /> <br /> I will just say that Jeremy Northam's choice to lead was a master stroke. The actor was born in Cambridge ENGLAND, and his accent in this film hits the ear as a kind of extremely forced dialect in New England, it is the key to success. See the latest story change and you'll see why it's a great choice! And Lucy Liu is fine with her too. "Will she kiss me - or shoot me." <br /> <br /> I rarely watch movies several times in a few days - it's one of them.
