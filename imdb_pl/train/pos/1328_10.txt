Without the "mental anachronism", this film, which I would like to find on DVD, offers amazing diving in the living and mental context of people's thoughts before "disenchanting the world". The fact that he is thirty years old, the director and scriptwriter can test one of such empathy and the romantic truth to do it, the masterpiece surprises me. It would be necessary to be able to see and re-examine the film in order to better capture than the temporal and cultural distance, to lose the ability to be included / understood, to analyze and finally accept one or other example of "primitive thought" Because this thought persists in a secularized world almost to the feeling, but it contains some keys to our behavior that only future generations will be able to analyze with sufficient meaning. If anyone knows, where should I get a numerical copy or VHS to me or a DVD? thank you in advance.
