yes, I have a copy on VHS in great condition, which I uploaded on DVD and if anyone wants to bring back the memories of the classic Christmas edition, please emil me on dmd2222@verizon.net.i everywhere searched and I did not find anything and I thought I could not be the only one on this planet that has this classic on the tape, there must be other people, and if so, I match them, because very few have this classic, so I consider myself lucky and I have all the holy muppets except one that John Denver I did the muppets again, I think it's called a smokey mountain holiday im not really, but close.
