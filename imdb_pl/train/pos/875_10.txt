What can I say after watching this fantastic movie, when my nerves are still buzzing! Jacques Audiard, the director must make a name for himself in France and rightly so. Vince Cassel is not Tom Cruise and Emmanuelle Devos, they are not Penelope Cruz, but they are fantastic actors, and this is a tight and thrilling thriller, which starts slowly with the wise building of characters, and then begins to strain the tension to a wonderful climax. Others have been writing about the story, so I will not say more than everyone in this movie plays their part to perfection, director, actors, up to the cameraman, and everything seems so real, no stupid gun, no fight, when it's so reliable, expressions , emotions that it's almost like you are a spectator. Do yourself a favor, take a DVD, a bottle of wine, turn on the lights, take your phone off the hook and immerse yourself in this Hitchcock thriller :)
