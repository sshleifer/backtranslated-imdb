"The Days" is a typical family drama with a small hook - you have to refer to the emotions of the characters in every possible way to really appreciate the performance. <br /> <br /> [Possible Spoilers for those who are Unknown with the show] <br /> <br /> This story, of course, for all the people who watched the program is the world of Cooper Day, the middle child of the family. He writes his days into the family and hopes that one day he will become a rich and famous writer because of his observations. His family includes his mother, father, perfect sister and small brother genius. The first episode that sounds a bit silly since John Scott Shepard created this situation - both sister and mother get pregnant. This is the first situation a writer gets to. Then my father quits working in a law firm. The youngest son gets a panic attack. The average child gets into a fight with his sister's boyfriend. It's all in everyday work. <br /> <br /> [/ Spoilery] <br /> <br /> I admire this program. I do not know. It's a bit crappy, but I like it. First, I thought that working with the camera was a rip off, but then I used it and started to like it. I liked the quiet conversations in the dark light. I liked the intimate feeling of the show. I liked the low-budget style. I liked acting. I admire the story. Then I'm looking for the second season of The Days. I slowly became his fan when the 6-episode aired in ABC came to an end. It's a really good concert and there's nothing like The OC. They both have nothing to do with each other. So I hope fans will stop comparing them. <br /> <br /> And if you can refer to Abby, Jack, Natalie, Cooper or even Nate, you'll love this program. Much.
