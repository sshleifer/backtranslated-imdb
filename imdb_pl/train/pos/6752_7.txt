Detective (Dana Andrews) with a reputation of violence accidentally kills the suspect in the murder (Craig Stevens) and then tries to hide him. The film, directed by Otto Preminger, has a lot of atmosphere, but the story is diluted when the wife of the deceased (Gene Tierney) falls for Andrews. He did well, kicking himself in a big hole and leaving it, but there was too much light at the end of the tunnel to make a noir movie. Gary Merrill is great as Scalese, the head of the crime, which Andrews is obsessed with overthrowing, and the tension between them gives the film energy and drive, especially the scene in the baths with Merrill, Andrews and Neville Brand, and the night Meeting outside the Bellevue hospital that sets what should be the conclusion of the film. High notes for the atmosphere, Andrews, Merrill etc. ... and the general image of the underworld, though the angle of love and simplified good cop bad elements of the policeman do not help in his cause.
