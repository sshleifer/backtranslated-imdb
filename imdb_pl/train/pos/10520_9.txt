I saw this film as being addicted to Jane Austen and always doubting the filming of the complexity of her novel: well, this transposition is just accurate, intelligent, delicate, careful, tactical, respectful, intense, in a word, perfect! br /> <br /> "Emma" is one of the most delightful and funny novels of Austen, thanks to the general irony that permeates situations and characters. The film respected this subtle irony, without disregarding the comic element (especially Miss Bates). What drew me into the novel and the film clearly captures it is the profound knowledge of human life shown by the English novelist and the contemporary look that women and men and their relationships are dealing with, and it is amazing if we think like a novelist in the eighteenth century who lived an almost isolated life, could understand the depth and truth of life, like her: that she fascinates me the most and all the time. We can feel this modernity in the whole film: just replace the costumes and use a more current language, but situations, feelings, ideas would be extremely modern. I am thinking of a morbid interest in the lives of other people or this fierce jealousy that now governs women's relations as always, and still a difficulty in revealing and expressing one's feelings, especially love: every situation becomes universal and beyond the value of time. <br /> <br /> The cast is really talented and offers very good and extremely brilliant performances: young Gwyneth Paltrow is particularly suitable for this role (currently she would probably be too mature), Toni Colette is just great. And how I envied them with great dresses that they can wear! And then a breathtaking English village, where every situation has such a magical and dreamlike dimension ... a really nice and well-deserved movie.
