This game is a bomb and it's a game of the year 007 and it should be on the biggest hits. When I got Agent Under Fire, I thought it was a good game, but then Nightfire appeared and it was better, but now there is a new type of James Bond game. This time it is a shooter for 3 people and there are more than 12 missions, graphics of the game is outside the house. He even has all the great actors and actresses in this game, such as Pierce Bronsan, once again James Bond, William Dafoe as the villain Nikolai Diavolo, and Judi Dench as M (forgive me everything if I spell this wrong). This game would be James Bond's biggest game. <br /> <br /> I give it 10/10
