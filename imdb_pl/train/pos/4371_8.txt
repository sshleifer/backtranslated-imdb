When Braveheart first came out, I was fascinated and I was one of the most furious fans of this movie. When Rob Roy appeared, I was intrigued and although I liked the movie, I did not think it was a great movie. However, as time passed, my appreciation for Rob Roy increased, and my enthusiasm for Braveheart decreased. Braveheart is great entertainment, but of course there are also disadvantages. The most important, in my opinion, is the unflattering portrait of Robert Bruce, who was undoubtedly the greatest king of Scotland. Another is the historic inaccuracy of the film, which forces the film to the proportions of many historical distortions. I think I am also bothered by the fact that it is in this film, seen only (at least by me) in retrospect, the beginning of Mel Gibson's egomania is clearly visible for the first time. In contrast, Rob Roy grew up on me for years. Partly because it largely avoids the mistakes that I like the most about Braveheart. But also because Rob Roy is like a good wine, with each viewing becomes more mature and complex.
