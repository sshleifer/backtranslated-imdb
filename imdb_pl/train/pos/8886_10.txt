I did not live in the 1960s, so I can not guarantee that this movie was a completely accurate representation of this period, but it is certainly a mobile and satisfying experience. There are some great performances, in particular Josh Hamilton (with With Honor), Jerry O'Connell (Sliders), who play brothers divided by war. Bill Smitrovich, an actor long ignored by many, gives a heart-filled performance by their stern father, who is forced to question his beliefs and values ​​because one of his sons makes him proud when he goes to Vietnam but returns empty inside while the other is exactly reverse. In conclusion, it is a powerful and thrilling movie that I hope everyone has the chance to experience.
