A weirdly erotic gothic horror that will be loved by Hammer House of Horror fans around the world. It seems to be an interesting movie "Beauty and the Beast". It is definitely worth seeing and surprisingly well-preserved, taking into account the genre and era. <br /> <br /> Corsets, castles, ruts, crazy fake fur monsters in the woods, proof that nobody had Brazilian in the seventies and more body fluids than you can shake a stick, what else could you want ?! <br /> <br /> It certainly brightened my Sunday afternoon!
