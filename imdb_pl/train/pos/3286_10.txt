Simply put, this movie is frightening. <br /> <br /> It just starts, looks like a study of a rebellious young girl and becomes a beautifully made horror movie. <br /> <br /> Do not expect gore or zombie. This is psychological and as it would do in Candyman, Bernard Rose manages to convey a horror story that he does not believe in. <br /> <br /> Every time you watch this movie, you realize what is happening, about how the two worlds in this movie are merging. <br /> <br /> Drawings have never been more scary.
