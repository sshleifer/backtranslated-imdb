Actually, Goldie Hawn comes from Washington (Takoma Park, Maryland), but digress. This is the kind of Mr. Smith who goes to a movie in Washington, with some variations, but with the same premise. I recorded this film from the cable TV a few years ago because I had a great liking to Goldie Hawn. This story is interesting, but it is very unlikely that any waitress will get an important job in the government simply because she saved the life of a great shooter. It made me laugh and at the same time led me crazy. It made me laugh because some of the situations in which she found herself were so absurd that I had to laugh. (POSSIBLE AHEAD SPOILER). It made me angry that our government would set up the average citizen in the way it was set up. And the speech at the end ... beautiful. It is a pity that few people have courage in real life.
