Well, if you're open enough to like the Barber Shop, you'll love this Canadian movie. <br /> <br /> If your mind is as closed as Fort Knox, then you give it the score it has: 2.5. <br /> <br /> This is a movie for anyone who is prepared to watch movies from outside their own racial basics. It's addictive, it's faithful to life, two or three times you lose connections between scenes, but many times, especially at the end, you find tears in your eyes, and it's simply because it often reflects what life can be. <br /> <br /> I like it and recommend it to anyone who has an open mind outside the traditional American movie.
