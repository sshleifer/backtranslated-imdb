I have not seen this movie since the late 1980s and decided to pick up its VHS version. The plot is very slow, and the actors almost seem to be robots in this breakdance movie. Music, hip-hop / freestyle and breakdance scenes make this film unique. Breakdancing is better in this movie than in "Breakin", but I must say that "Breakin '1 and 2" transfer energy and excitement to the screen much better. This is a movie that I will store in my library, but it is not a movie that I can watch over and over again, only once in the blue moon.
