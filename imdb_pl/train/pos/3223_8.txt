Ok, basically it's a science-fiction popcorn movie, but from the very beginning it's obvious that it's been directed with a lot of intelligence. You can count on about 10 stereotypes to which the film is built, but it provides only about three of them, and some of them have something of what allows you to know again that the director did not assume that an idiot. Kurt Russell's actor is really great and he brings in a depth from a surprising and satisfying character. Recommended if you just saw something really stupid and want to rebuild your faith!
