This movie is one of the few high quality films from 2000 and definitely one of my best. The script is based on the novel by Vladimir Nabokov, and the transfer to the big screen is absolutely brilliant. <br /> <br /> The film's photography is excellent, just like the acting of Turturro and Watson. Turturro is definitely best suited so far, proving that it is worth much more than we thought. Watson is also doing a great job. <br /> <br /> A tale of a phenomenal chess player (Turturro), who is extremely eccentric in his everyday life. The film is presented in a non-linear time, with many childhood memories of Luzhina. Thanks to this, the complex character of Luzhina is described. <br /> <br /> I have nothing more to say, but to propose this movie to everyone.
