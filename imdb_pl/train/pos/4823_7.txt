It is difficult to play the queen. On the one hand, the actress must be majestic and commanding, and on the other hand must show sensitivity in a difficult situation, as well as gathering courage and courage to overcome the chances, because almost all films about queens have this basic plot line. <br /> <br /> Emily Blunt is quite radiant like Victoria, but she is not as full of performances as I would like, without guilt. I can not help feeling that this is an adaptation of the Mills & Boon novel compared to the darker, more dramatic movie about another young queen, Elizabeth. As a result, Blunt is not able to launch a range of exciting queens, at least not to the full extent since she is, you know, young Victoria. To see old Victoria, check Mrs. Brown. <br /> <br /> Jean-Marc Vallee is an interesting choice for the director of the film. He last did C.R.A.Z.Y., who was perfect and made him famous. It was a completely different movie, but I remember that it looked great and probably the main similarity between the two films. But while Vallee wrote C.R.A.Z.Y., it was authored by Julian Fellowes and though I really liked his Park Gosford, the story of the film was much less interesting. Soon I got lost with all government policy. Maybe it was less engaging because there was no possibility of cutting the monarchy. I'm just saying.
