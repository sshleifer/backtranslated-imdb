I saw for the first time the ice age in the Subiaco cinemas, when it appeared in "02". I was only 13 years old then, but even then I liked it. It had some heat. <br /> <br /> We've had it on video for many years and no matter how many times you watch it, you never get bored. This is due to one element that distinguishes it from all other 3D animations created at that time - characters do not have a specific "home" that they leave. They are nomads, and it's really refreshing and uplifting. <br /> <br /> Also every individual figure on the surface seems to just put up with each other, but they are all really good friends. Also all characters have their own charms (even bad ones). Sid laziness is charming in her annoying, too sensitive and naive way. Manny is charming in his depressed, lonely figure, etc. <br /> <br /> Another great point in the film is the beauty of animation. All environments and characters were originally modeled by clay, which gave the film an artistic edge. <br /> <br /> Another aspect that adds to the movie is that sex means very little. There are hardly any female characters, but you really do not realize that until you watch them a few times and even then, it does not have much impact on how you watch the movie. For this reason, there is no mention of a nuclear family that would be really pathetic in conditions such as the ice age. <br /> <br /> In summary, the ice age is a great movie and is proof of how much effort has been put into 3D animation before Shrek 2 and The Incredibles came out.
