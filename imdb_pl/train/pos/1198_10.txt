Like most other reviewers, I saw the movie for the first time (on TV, never on a big screen). My daddy always thought the movie was too high and he recommended it to me then and I must say that he was not only right, but that movie has stayed with me forever in more than two decades since I saw him for the first time. Since then, I've seen it two or three times (just a few days ago I gave him another watch) and he did not lose anything of his influence over time. It's still a great and worth seeing movie! Manr considers Peckinpa's RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY to be one of the first and best later westerns who had a realistic look at life in the old west, but the little known LAST HUNT is definitely a better movie and it was even half a dozen years earlier. Actually, it was probably 3 decades before your time, and maybe it's still ... <br /> <br /> Although I've been wondering and I've certainly seen hundreds of westerns (I like this genre), I do not remember any grim and depressive western like this. The two men are bound together, partly by hatred, partly because they do not seem to have other choices, surrounded by beautiful Mrs Padget, a crippled old man and a young Inian, leading the lives of buffalo killers, until fate reaches for one of them. <br /> <br /> No one who has ever seen this movie will be able to forget about its completion and the last frames of this jewel. When the camera moves and leaves from Mr. Taylor, white buffalo skin appears (on the tree), and the echoes of the past, when all hatred began, are again present. Mr. Taylor has his buffalo, but in the end the buffalo got him. <br /> <br /> In addition to the best performances of all involved, intelligent scenario and great dialogue, it should also be mentioned that LAST HUNT is perfectly photographed, I rarely saw a western that would be well done (except from those directed by Anthony Mann , which are also greatly photographed) that all locations are cleverly chosen and that even the soundtrack fits the picture very well. <br /> <br /> And the director BROOKS is really a great storyteller. Master craft! He made quite a few great films and succeeded in almost every possible genre, but even in such a prolific career as this, LAST HUNT still shines as one of his best, if not his best. br /> <br /> Definitely deserves a higher rating, compared to 7-RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY.
