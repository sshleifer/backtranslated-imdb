If you're a hard Freddy fan, you may not like him. It seems to be a trick from a series of nightmares. Not much to see here. The only reason he keeps himself is Freddy's story. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is always great in Nightmare movies are death scenes. But the death scenes were very painful in that. The visual effects were great, and the acting was OK, but the story was perfect. Basically, Freddy's story is full. <br /> <br /> I have read bad reviews on this subject, but I liked it despite many disadvantages: <br /> <br /> 1. Nightmare on Elm Street. (8/10) <br /> <br /> 2. Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 3. Nightmare on ulica Wiązów 4: The dream master. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 4. Nightmare at Elm Street 3: The Dream Warriors. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 5. Nightmare at Elm Street 5: The Dream Child. (6/10) <br /> <br /> 6. Nightmare on Wiązów Street 2: Freddy's Revenge. (3/10) <br /> <br /> I recommend that if you like the series. It is that Freddy is fully explained, but that's all. Next on my list Wes Cravens New Nightmare. <br /> <br /> (7/10)
