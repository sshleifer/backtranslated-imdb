I must say that the Grand Canyon is one of the most influential movies I've ever seen. I have watched it several times and still feel like the first time; that the film itself can constitute the entire postgraduate program in the direction of the film. <br /> <br /> Long time ago movie trailers promised: "It will make you laugh, make you cry." This is a very banal and shortened method of describing what the Grand Canyon is doing. It takes you to the best places in human experience, and the next moment takes you to the gates of hell. <br /> <br /> A large part of the film circulates among people who are close to happiness and the same people who are close to horror. This is also a short step. Driving this swing with grace and without causing it to look false or excessive is a direct genius. <br /> <br /> Spoiler (kind) is coming. After the audience has become accustomed to swaying back and forth in the emotional spectrum, the film casts a curve with a sequence that does not change from good to bad and back, and instead escalates from an ordinary marital spit, through an accidental self-taught wound that can require stitches or not, for an earthquake in which heroes flee from home. At the moment of their relief, the forgotten argument, the forgotten cut off finger, the earthquake survived, the neighbor cries that her older husband has fallen. The couple are starting to help him. I cried when I saw this sequence. I cried every time I saw it. I'm crying now. This is not sadness for me. This is not a particularly sad sequence. What tears me apart is that these few minutes of the movie were PERFECT. It's perfect! Amazing. (end of spoilera) <br /> <br /> There is so much to say about the Grand Canyon. It presents relatively ordinary people experiencing epiphanies and allows the viewer to experience them alternately. They are not glamorous or fading and there is no long break to look carefully at the moment. The film moves at a pace of life. Even when the characters try to understand what happened, they are not sure what comes out of it. <br /> <br /> The Grand Canyon is a very human film.
