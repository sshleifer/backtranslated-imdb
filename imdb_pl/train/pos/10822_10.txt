I was lucky to see this movie many years ago in England. I've seen hundreds of movies since then, but I've never forgotten. Although Sinatra played a rather ungrateful character, he was excellent in this role. his own up to his role in "From Here To Eternity", but in my opinion he was great at Concho. Another role that lies in my mind is the role of William Conrad. Conrad plays a great role in this film. I remember his deep and gravel voice and uses it beautifully to strengthen those few words that speaks with a threat that sets the tone for his character. and it seems to surround him whenever he appears. An excellent movie and my only disappointment was that I never had the opportunity to see him again. It seems that he disappeared from the face of the earth. In the titles, I see that the film is black and white, but when I saw that it really is in full color, I remember the blue shirt of Sinatra.
