I just watched "The Last Wave" at my school of fine arts. It's intriguing, like all of Peter Weir's stuff, but he's not always as attentive as I'd like. I was fascinated by the ideas that I was thrown (because they are very well supported by director Weir), but at the same time I was not stimulated enough by them. AKA I got bored in places. <br /> <br /> The story surrounds an Aussie lawyer who is obsessed with some dreams that unites him with the Aboriginal group he defends. <br /> <br /> It starts with an intense weather sequence and has amazing mood effects (above all a bizarre, "burping" sound) and a strong direction; but it did not entertain me like Weir's later films. Maybe I'll just have to watch it again. <br /> <br /> A good film about obsession and mystery. Because in the end the mystery existing between the white and the Aborigines gives some very serious consequences. <br /> <br /> May God bless Piotr Weir. Only for him this movie is worth watching ... very organic director. How does the Australian answer Malick! I would give him 7, because he has enough ideas to overcome the boring moments.
