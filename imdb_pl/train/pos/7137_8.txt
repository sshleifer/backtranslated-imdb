The story GOODNIGHT MR TOM on paper makes it seem that we are in a huge dose of bizarre, sickly sentiment. But the talented director Jack Gold is an expert on touching emotions in the right way, and instead appears as an irresistible, deeply moving war drama with excellent productions and the best performances. One of the best, if not the best TV movies from the 90s, which probably would have been even more successful if they were released in cinemas. <br /> <br /> Evacuation of children to rural towns and villages during World War II was of course a common practice, but in the case of a young boy here was doubly important because of a miserable family life in the capital of Great Britain. However, the horrors of war have not moved to the front of the house, and the construction of the film until its throat breaks down, misty eyes will end with optimism despite what happened before. It is almost (but not quite) worthy of comparison with the finale of IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE (1946), a modern classic.
