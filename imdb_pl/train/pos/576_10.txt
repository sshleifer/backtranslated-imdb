the film was just genius, casting, stage decorations, history, direction, they all really fit the role they played, and you can imagine it's there, Robert Redford is an amazing actor, and now the same director, Norman's father came from the same Scottish island as me, so I really liked the fact that there was a real relationship with this movie, witty comments throughout the movie were great, they were just brilliant, so much that I bought a movie when it was released for retail and I recommend everyone to watch, and fly fishing was amazing, really crying at the end, it was so sad and you know what they say, if you cry in the movie, it must have been good, and it definitely was, also congratulations for two little boys who played Norman and Paul's role, they were simply brilliant, children are often overlooked from the praised list, I think, because the stars that play them all are so u≈ºe for the whole movie, but these kids are amazing and should be praised for what they did, do not you think? The whole story was so beautiful because it was real and someone's life was after all what had been shared with all of us.
