It's a great movie for every fan of action movies in Hong Kong. In addition to a small plot, a weak drama and fragments of comedy freaks, the film is an action packed with the fight for weapons and martial arts. He kept me from beginning to end. I thought Shannon Lee was amazing in the movie. <br /> <br /> Having an action director, such as Corey Yuen, makes the action in Hong Kong strong. This modern action movie is highly recommended !!
