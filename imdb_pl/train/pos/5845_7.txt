I liked the movie much more than anything that made me predict; from reading other comments here, I suspect that he uses it so much that he was seen in full screen at the cinema, accompanied by a cheerful and enthusiastic audience. I was lucky that I experienced all this on a wave of wrinkles from around the world and I had a great time with this undemanding comedy. <br /> <br /> Because it's like a comedy that shines everywhere. Music is nothing special - in fact, I did not realize * was * a musical, and I was very surprised when the assembled ancestors fell into half-spoken text - but I must admit that the semi-threat, the promise 'Oh, what will do. .. "it turned out to be much more catchy than it ever seemed at that time, because it still circulates in my head! <br /> <br /> The plot, as in reality, focuses in the past on the title Francesca, a sixteenth-century portrait with a clearly anachronistic hairstyle and fur. Her idea of ​​the sanctity of marriage does not fit the idea of ​​her distant descendant, Countess Angelina, and you can almost hear the story cracking under the pressure of the Manufacturing Code to make sure the heroine arrives flawless in her very late marriage bed with the right man. .. <br /> <br /> Romance is not shocking earth, really the first few scenes, played pretty well straight into boredom. But where the script and the movie really come alive is the battle of the sexes that follows. The impudence of Douglas Fairbanks' courtship with Angelina's wife Betty Grable equals only Betty-Grable-as-Francesca's chase after him, which ends with a complete reversal of roles in a funny fantasy sequence in which he literally shoves his feet. This is probably the comic climax of the story, although the consequences of Colonel's understandable confusion are elaborated with a skilful touch in the other two "acts" of the operetta structure, and the performance of Fairbanks' blissful, bemused awakening is more or less worth the price of admission on their own. <br /> <br /> Grable is completely convincing in establishing his two contrasting characters, wisely gaining almost all (limited) singing opportunities and sharing honors, where excerpts of the quote dialog in different word bouts. But in the field of unspoken reactions, she is truly outclassed by her male leaders; Fairbanks in particular is an absolute treat in many senseless sequences whose configuration and humor are worthy of a silent screen. <br /> <br /> This film is too uneven to be classic, different from shiny repartee to boring boredom. But at best it's really funny and it brought spontaneous applause and laughter to the end of the auditorium when the lights went out. Not tuned with time, it may not have been able to draw a contemporary audience - but at this show, he really did not deserve to renounce both Grable and Preminger, the (unspecified) director. This is not a masterpiece, but a thoroughly fun little work, and for example, I have been smiling at the memory all the way home.
