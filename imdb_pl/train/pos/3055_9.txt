For the first time as Hollywood director, Henry Brommell casts a fascinating yarn that involves a penetrating relative marital problem with melancholy authenticity and lacing with an equally absorbing business thread of father and son. The film is perfectly directed and consists of a wonderfully composed cast and a fast, family scenario (also by Brommell), which animates an otherwise tired genre. As a bonus, "Panic" delivers subtle, bashful humor - an unexpected, undeniably charming and very welcome surprise? considering his line of work. <br /> <br /> The eternally magnificent William H. Macy again reflects our hearts as Alex, unhappy, torn, husband and middle-aged father who finds solace in the most dubious people: a young, attractive, ashamed 23-year-old Sarah (Neve Campbell), whom he meets in the waiting room in the psychologist's office, where he waits for the treatment of Dr. Josh Parks (John Ritter) to discuss his growing desire to quit the family business that his father built (Donald Sutherland). Alex, whose desire to lead a new life is hampered by the fear of disappointing his dictate father, provokes a silly fantasy for Sarah, which ultimately leads him to understand the essence and irrefutable responsibility of being his wife's husband and, more importantly, he, a good father for his six-year-old son , Sammy (played enthusiastically by the captivating David Dorfman). <br /> <br /> Henry Brommell's brilliant "Panic" is a kind of rarity rarely seen in Hollywood (with the exception of the "Path to Perdition" from 2002, when it was created in 2000, it intertwines two conflicting genres ( organized crime, family drama) into a fascinating, warm piece of watching films that is evenly strong in both directions - it's one that will keep its unique, rare caliber and shining honesty forever.
