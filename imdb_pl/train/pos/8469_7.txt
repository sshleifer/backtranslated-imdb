Generally, I love Charlie Chan movies from 1930, and this is no exception. However, something seems wrong in this movie. A late attempt to switch from Moto brain movies around feature devices to a salad bar with broken comedy relief that brings relief as sore feet. From nowhere appears a typical buffoon, playing the clumsy Englishman who plays the detective, and even other characters seem entangled in providing comedic relief. The plot may seem strange or unjustified today, but the possibility of epochal archaeological discoveries was not only real, but also universal.
