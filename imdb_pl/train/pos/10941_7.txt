At first, I was concerned that Sarah Silverman had his own show. The films in which she appeared were not too funny, and her humor is somewhat detached. However, I was very surprised to see how her true colors shine in this central jewel of Comedy. I could put her on a par with Amy Sedaris in Strangers with Candy - Sarah is a real sociopath, very similar to Jerri Blank in Sedaris. supporting the cast. Her sister's character is good; Sometimes funny, but ultimately it was not about stealing Sarah's show. However, the rest of the cast is extremely low compared to them. <br /> <br /> I'm glad, however, that Comedy Central gave Sarah a chance to show her a unique and crazy sense of self-worth and humor.
