"The Good Earth" by Sidney Franklin gained a classic status thanks to its timeless history and excellent acting, especially from Luis Ranier, who won an Oscar for the role of O-Lan. Rainers' performance is so complete that almost unrecognizable. With a very small dialogue throughout the film (and it's a long one), Rainer relies on face language and body language. It looks and preserves the Chinese to such an extent that anyone who is not familiar with its work can easily mistake it as such. <br /> <br /> The film remains current today because it explores the story of rags to the wealth and universal themes that come with it. When Lung and O-Lan's wife finally achieve financial success after years of hunger and poverty, they find a life full of possessions, but meaningless. Only when they return to earth after fighting with the swarm of locusts (the special effects used to create them are still amazing and beautiful to watch), are again fulfilled. Common formula told with a unique perspective of the Chinese family (especially in 1937). It makes a classic film. Money is not worth anything without friends and family, a point to which the movie goes home perfectly in the last 10 minutes with an emotionally satisfying conclusion.
