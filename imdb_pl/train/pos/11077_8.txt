First of all, do not go to Revolver waiting for another Snatch or Lock Stock, it's a different kind of gangster movie. <br /> <br /> I saw the gala of this evening and this movie definitely divided the audience. It's a movie where half of the audience goes away thinking, WHAT it was? It was terrible and the other half would leave thinking WHAT IT WAS? It was cool. Personally, I like movies that I do not understand, i.e. Drive Mullholland and the Suspects, so I liked Revolver. <br /> <br /> It definitely was not perfect. I saw a big turn about a mile away, at least part of it, and although sometimes some loose ends remain unexplained, they are good, the revolver leaves a lot of questions unexplained without a reason. Also some scenes, such as animation, and the scene in which Sorter plays the killing frenzy (actually one of my favorites), although the amazing scenes to watch seemed to just be there because they were amazing to watch, not because they matched with film. <br /> <br /> However, there were also many good things. I thought acting was great from all the main actors, Jason Stratham, Ray Liotta, Vincent Pastore, and even Andre Benjamin (who was a nice surprise). This movie definitely interested me one big, full of tension, full of action scene in turn. When Ray Liotta was kept under the table wow .... well, you must see it. The script was very well done, and the soundtrack, like most of Guy Ritchie's films, was great. <br /> <br /> Although it was a step below such movies as Fight Club, Mullholland Drive and Usual Suspects, it still was an amazing fast-paced movie, psychological, with many twists and tons of scenes that you will remember long after the movie .
