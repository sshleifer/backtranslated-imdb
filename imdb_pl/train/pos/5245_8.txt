I thought this movie was funny LOL. It's fun, not to be taken seriously, a movie about twisted views of one man for life, love and ... well, sir "from the scarce bus station, to a high class d√©butante ... bus station." Tim Meadows plays a guy (Leon Phelps) who was brought up in a Playboy-style residence by father Hugh Hefner, surrounded by beautiful porn models and actresses. When his "father" throws him on the street, he must learn to deal with the chauvinistic view of life that his youth taught him ... and the unfathomable, almost mystical level of charm and stupid happiness. And so begins hijinx! If you have not seen this movie and you like light, thoughtless, comedy / love story, then I definitely recommend hiring a "man".
