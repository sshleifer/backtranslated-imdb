The 90-minute experience does not correspond to the "Drive" standard because the actors have clearly learned to trade on "Who Am I?". the academy, while the action sequences are not generally better than those in the excellent beat of Marek Dacascos. However, those who liked "Drive" (and I thought it was wonderful!), They will certainly enjoy it. Surely you will not go back to the beginning and you will not see it all again, but you will definitely come back to some action scenes for a long time. <br /> <br /> It's refreshing that the art of qualitative fighting choreography is still practiced, even if not in Hong Kong, and I would love to see what these guys can do with the budgets, time and respect Yuen Woo-ping gives and Corey Yuen Kuei. If you sit for the first half hour and you are not crazy because of a horrible dialogue, you're having a good time. Bosch is great and can really fight off with great acrobatics, kicks and simple acts of courage. <br /> <br /> If you are lucky enough to find yourself within a radius of 500 miles from your copy, track it and watch it. This is not Shakespeare. In fact, it is less meaningful than in Coolio in "China Strike Force", but you will be impressed by both the movements on the display and the pain experienced by the stunt team - (I'm pretty sure there is no safe way to land directly on the head or be forced to hit the wooden roof with a speeding car!?). <br /> <br />
