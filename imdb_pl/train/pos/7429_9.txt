There is such an amazing singer who cares about everything else !!!! This last scene is one of the best moments in the whole show show - no bar !! I am glad that she kept the camera on for ten minutes - she deserves this iconic status - this is the power of voice. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time when I was five and had a huge impact on me. I see it today and yes, I see some faults (like Esther wanting to abandon the Grammy's law when her prize is announced). <br /> <br /> But some other user comments are just plain false - that is, where is the free nudity - maybe we saw different videos ?? <br /> <br /> The ability to sing Streisand is monumental, and if it has a big ego - it's fine! <br /> <br /> She deserved it.
