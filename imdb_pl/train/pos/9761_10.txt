Here is a movie straight from my childhood, my family was recording; but in a sense it has been used and lost for years. Now I was lucky to watch the whole movie on youtube.com; I loved this great movie when I watched it as a child and after watching it again (online) I still do it today. My favorite song from the movie is "Candy Hearts and Paper Flowers" (I will always remember this sweet song forever). <br /> <br /> I was surprised when I looked at the opening credits (who animated someone), that some animators come from the 1930s (WOW, it's 47 years old).
