Sweet and charming, funny and poignant, less-than-dramatic, "Before Sunrise" (1995), Richard Linklater's third film, dedicated to anyone who was in love, in love or never in love, but dreaming about it and hoping to find it. This is one of the very rare films that is / should / will be equally interesting for teenagers, their parents and even grandparents. It seems to be a very simple movie without spectacular visual effects, car chases or long and steamy sex scenes. Two young people at the age of twenty, two students (American tourist Ethan Hawke, who returns home after summer holidays in Europe and French student Julie Delpy, who goes to Paris for classes at the Sorbonne) meet on the train. They snap at once before they start talking, they jump off a train in Vienna, where they walk around the city all night long. They speak and fall in love. That's all, this is a movie. It could be boring and stupid, but instead it is a beautiful, trustworthy, wise and moving romance, which is getting better and better with every watching (at least for this viewer). High praise and sincere gratitude I am directing the director and writers for providing two charming characters, great writing, always interesting and witty dialogues, two amazing performances and an atmosphere of magic that falls in love. Julie Delpy, who looks like the angel of Botticelli, looks great as a smart, independent and extremely attractive young woman.
