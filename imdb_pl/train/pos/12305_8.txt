I was not quite sure what to expect from this, apart from the consistent positive opinions I read. It turns out that I have never imagined this movie, because it is very similar to "The Bride with White Hair" in operatic performance and dealing with fantastic. It goes a thin line between being a farce, comedy and just a good old fashioned ghost tale. There is nothing terrifying about it, it's not a topic, it's basically a love story about a clumsy guy who meets a beautiful spirit who has many problems with other ghosts. The main motive is the guy who is trying to save the beautiful spirit. This is also done in ancient China, with wild, bizarre Kung Fu exhibitions and a journey to hell (more or less). Some stop-action ghosts are pretty cool and the visual effects are top-notch. I could watch this genre of Chinese films all day long because they are very funny, visually great and almost absolutely cheeky. And I can not wait to see the first part of this movie. Highly recommended.
