I really liked Sidney Lumet's drama. The best word that I could describe is crazy. He throws the viewer for an hour and fifty minutes and does not allow him to breathe until the credits begin to roll at the very end. Trust me, this movie will let you guess all the way. <br /> <br /> This story is very well made and almost brilliant. It's almost like a complicated Tarantino story. Acting is amazing with all leads and even small parts, great cast. I also loved the photos, it gave a real impression of being an independent film. Everything was great. <br /> <br /> This movie is excited, exhausting and painful. It's almost hard to watch, but you'll be glad you did it.
