Minor Spoilery <br /> <br /> Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) is a successful model, living with attorney Michael Lerman (Chris Sarandon) in his apartment. She tried to commit suicide twice in the past: for the first time when she was a teenager, and saw her father cheating on her mother with two women at home, and then when Michael's wife died. Since then, she left Christ and the Catholic Church. Alison wants to live alone in her own apartment and with the help of a real state agent, Miss Logan (Ava Gardner), finds a great furnished old flat in Brooklyn Heights for a reasonable rental. He sees a strange man in the window on the top floor of the building, and Miss Logan reports that he is Father Francis Matthew Halloran (John Carradine), a blind priest who lives alone supported by the Catholic Church. Alison moves to a new place, and when she is there, she receives a guest: her neighbor Charles Chazen (Burgess Meredith) welcomes her and introduces her new neighbors. Then he invites Alison to the birthday party of his Izebel cat at night. The next day, strange things happen to Alison in her apartment and her health. Alison is looking for Miss Logan and is informed that she lives alone with the priest in the building. Further investigation shows that all the people she knew at the party were dead criminals. Frightened by the situation, Alison again embraces Christ while Michael examines the terrifying events. Alison realizes that she lives in the gateway to hell. <br /> <br /> Although undervalued in the IMDb User Rating, "The Sentinel" is one of the best horror movies ever. I saw this movie at least six times, for the first time in the '70s at the cinema. On September 7, 2002, I bought an imported DVD and saw it again. I saw this movie again yesterday. Even after all these years, this movie is still great. Terrifying and terrible history is terrifying even today. The cast is a constellation of stars and stars. You can see many actors and actresses who became famous at the beginning of their careers. Horror fans will surely worship The Sentinel, and I'm one of them. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Sentinela dos Malditos" ("Sentinel of the Damned"). <br /> <br /> Obs.: On September 2, 2007, I saw the movie again.
