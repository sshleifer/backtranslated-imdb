I just read TomReynolds2004 comments and feel that I need to jump in here. I understand that he does not like the movie, but his reasons are not obvious. My feelings about this film are such that it is not afraid to travel on the darker paths of loneliness, failure, disappointment and sadness. Each of these two people, as presented, has many reasons to be bitter and angry, and at the same time to find tenderness and comfort. Only great acting can make this work an emotional swamp, sentimental and pathetic. I became interested in these people because of their overwhelming humanity, which they gave them so strong performances. I have every reason not to like Jane Fonda for her actions in Vietnam, but apart from personal feelings, she is fantastic in this role. Robert DeNiro is wonderful as a man whose intelligence and goodness begin to fail him in a world indifferent to his abilities. This is the first time that DeNiro has seen how sensitivity, not endurance, sells a character and I really like it. This movie was a big surprise when I first saw it and I can not wait to see it again.
