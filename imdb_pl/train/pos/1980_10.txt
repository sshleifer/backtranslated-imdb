One of the last great musicals of the 1960s. I was 7 when I saw this movie for the first time and has always been a favorite ever since. Music numbers are unforgettable. In the 1960s, people who were cast in musicals had musical talent (in contrast to the current CERTAIN musical nominated for an Oscar in a large midwestern city). All the main roles were beautifully planted ... Ron Moody shines like Fagin, like Shani Wallis as Nancy. Oliver Reed was a dangerous Bill Sikes (who fortunately does not have music numbers, lol), and Mark Lester as Oliver and Jack Wild as Dodger were also great. Mark Lester turns out to be an innocent waif, what Dickens meant when he wrote a book! Of course, there are dozens of dancers who play 'beware yourself', 'I will do everything', 'Who will buy' and 'Be back', many who were children! It's a great show for the whole family.
