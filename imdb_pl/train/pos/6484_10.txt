I remember watching it in the seventies - just recently I borrowed a few episodes from our public library. <br /> <br /> With almost a 30-year break I came to another conclusion. Most of the directors interviewed in this series - some in the center of power, like Traudl Junge (Hitler's secretary), Karl Doenitz (head of the German navy) Anthony Eden (Great Britain) - have long since gone, but their accounts will first of all live . Generals and admirals to sergeants, Russian civilians, survivors of concentration camps, all are registered here. <br /> <br /> I remember an interview with Lord Mountbatten (killed in the 70s). <br /> <br /> It is a real jewel and I believe that the producer of this series has been knighted by queen El≈ºbieta for this work - Meritorious . <br /> <br /> Seeing these few episodes from the library makes me want to buy a set. <br /> <br /> It's the only "10" that I gave a review, but I've discovered how a fine bottle of wine is more appreciated with a little time ...
