Adam Jones's "Cross Eyed" film drives the viewer into a ride of redemption when the main character takes control of the wheel and organizes his life. Adam Jones has found an ingenious and refreshing way to strengthen his character and realize what is most important. These truths become visible to both heroes and viewers when you laugh and gag your loans. Simple but attractive costume settings allow you to guess what you'll see next. You can not resist the smile and laughter of the antics that take place in this film. I can not wait for his second effort. It's only a matter of time before Jones hits again. Bravo!
