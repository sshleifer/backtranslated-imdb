I have no idea what another reviewer is saying - it was a great movie and created a sense of an era that seems to travel in time. The heroes are really young, Mary is a strong opponent of Byron, Claire is a minor and a bit annoying, Polidori is a convincing beating flatterer ... everyone is beautiful, curious and decadent ... they are not terrifying wrecks that are in Gothic. <br /> <br /> Gothic works as an independent shock movie and I loved it for various reasons, but it works like a movie of a merchant and ivory, and from my reading best describes what summer must have seemed. Romantic, yes, but it totally animates my interest in Shelley and Byron's life whenever I think about the film. One of my favorite times.
