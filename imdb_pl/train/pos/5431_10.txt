I've seen this movie many times and every time I watch it, I can not stop myself from entertaining. Gunga Din is one of those classic films made in the Golden Years of Hollywood, when the actors themselves had to attract the audience to the movie without relying on fantastic special effects, and the man created "monsters" to move the scene. The charisma on the screen and the accompanying features of Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. they are great and very fun to watch. The attitude of the tongue and cheek, in which three actors play their roles, works beautifully and flawlessly. Some may consider it "trivial", but I consider it "classic" filming and acting at its best. It must be remembered that watching this film, Europe was involved in the war with Germany, and the audience went to the cinema to escape the horrors of war and be taken and taken to a place where people were greater than life and did heroic deeds good always wins evil. Gunga Din accomplishes this perfectly, allowing the audience to laugh with the actors during their shocking escapades. In short, it is a classic movie that does not take itself too seriously and does not want the audience too.
