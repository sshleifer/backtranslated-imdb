This is one of the best military films ever. And that's great because it focuses on values. This is a great story about human interest, which is based on commitment to honor, loyalty, love and determination. <br /> <br /> Gooding and DeNiro are great heroes. It's great to see that the Master's racism's racism is evolving towards respect and love through Carl Brashear's determination, drive and yes, a sense of honor. The title indicates the source of their ties. I never noticed until the last time I saw how the brilliant portrait of Carl Carl Lumbly, Mac Brashear, was. In a sense, it is the cornerstone of the film, because the memory of his father about Carlo helps him survive the hard times. <br /> <br /> I choose the movies I buy. It's one of those rare ones that I want on my shelf. I am sure that it will be seen many times in the future.
