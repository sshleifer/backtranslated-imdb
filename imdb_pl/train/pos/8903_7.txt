Sure, it's a unique 50's drive-in, but do not be fooled. In my little book there are many smart accents with unexpected humor. Catch the dangerous Mrs. Porter, who is supposed to look after the doctor's place. She not only steals the stage, but hides near the entire movie. And where these indie makers have invented goats for color filming, a wise decision, because the droplet would not show up well in b & w. Yes, the result is uneven at the edges, as illustrated by the number of fools. But apart from a few teenagers, the cast outside Hollywood plays well. At the same time, playing warm-ups and cops looks lively and entertaining. It is quite suitable for several directors more at home than on the sound stage. Apparently, they wanted to introduce teenagers in a positive light while the screen was filled with "juvenile delinquents". On the other hand, the 27-year-old McQueen hardly qualifies in the age bracket, but still manages the attitude of the hot rodder. The film was a hit in those days, no doubt helped by its catchy title track, which gained a lot of radio. And with the exception of the unfortunate final effects, the movie is still great fun, drive-in or without drive-in. In the meantime, I am waiting for the return of the droplet now, when the polar ice cover turns into, say, cooling water.
