What a great movie. The concept of nations sending people fighting with each other using giant robots is cheesy. The ending is not just matching, it's more inspiring. <br /> <br /> But I'm intrigued by characters. It is a pity that we have never seen the relationship between Achilles and Athena grow more than a few of Athen's kisses and fear for Achilles' safety. Their romance is very pleasant. <br /> <br />
