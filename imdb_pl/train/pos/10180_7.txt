Indian directors have difficulties, they have to compete with films such as "Laggan", where 11 tricky, castrated males defend their village, and half of them are certified idiots. "Devdas", unfortunate, federated foreign alcohol drinks to oblivion, and the characters run in endless corridors, unconscious feelings or sentiments - unfortunately, they live with the decorative misery of the red tapestry and the spectacular. But to make a good movie, you have to move forward to calm the frontbenchers, who are the most important gitters, who are hypnotized Split skirts and Dishum-Dishum fights, preferably with the would-be main Bollywood actor. So you can connect with a director who wants to tell a story about the head of the village of Leonine, who in his own words "defending his village" is considered a brutal film or too masculine for the male audience. There are very few actors who can convey anger and pathos like Nana Patekar (Narasimhan). Nana Patekar lets you walk into your courtyard and watch him with a beret and make fun of politics when his loyal devotees laugh with every word of satire thrown at him, in the meantime his daughter bathes his grandson. India. Nana Patekar is an important actor who belongs to the old school of acting, which disappears in the Hindi Films race. The presented violence is a complicated part of the story with Song & Dances tossed for onlookers, without whom the films will not be sold, sad, but the real state of affairs. Faster these changes better for "Bollywood". Everything said and done is one good movie.
