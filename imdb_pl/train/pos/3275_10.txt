I saw this movie for the first time when I was about 10 years old. Unfortunately, I could not watch it because it was broadcast late at night. Now I bought it on DVD, because I remember that I liked it. <br /> <br /> It really is not just a horror movie. It has some elements of horror, but I rather classify it as a fantasy. I liked it, but I was hoping for a bit more frightening and frightening scenes. Especially the scene where Anna's dad enters the newspaper, trying to kill her, is a bit short. <br /> <br /> Now to the story. This film is about a young girl named Anna who is ill. While she is sick and needs to lie in bed because of her smaller amount, she turns to finish drawing about the house - paper mill. When he sleeps, which happens often very often immediately, he is near the house on a large green field. He realizes that the home is exactly the same as the one she drew and that every new detail also appears in her dreams. One day, he drags the boy home to talk to someone. When he forgets to take his legs (because he is sitting outside the window), the boy can not walk. Later, the doctor tells her that the boy also has this strange disease and realizes that thanks to the boy she drew, she put this boy into her disturbing dreams. She also notices that it is getting harder for her to wake up from her dreams. When he misses his father, who is often abroad, he draws his father home. She made a mistake and my father is very angry with him. He tries to gum him, but he realizes that he can not change anything that has already been drawn. And the next time he falls asleep, horror begins. Her father is crazy and blind (because he draws *** on his head to mark him as "invalid") and tries to get into the newspaper and kill Anna and his friend. Her dreams have become a terrifying nightmare. They manage to escape and kill her father, and Anna can finally wake up. Then Anna finds herself in the hospital, where her parents sit by the bed. The doctors thought she was in a coma. They tell Anna that the other boy is dead and that they want to travel to the ocean to experience these tragic events. Anna draws a watchtower and notes that the same observation tower can be found near the hotel to which they traveled. He runs up to the watchtower and meets a boy (I do not mention his name because I do not remember him and I do not want to go back to the previous page) and I can say goodbye to him and forget about those terrible dreams. br /> <br /> There were a few things I did not understand in the film. Above all, it was an ending which I absolutely do not like. I think it is too long when the main part of the film becomes too short. How did the boy fly a helicopter and talk to Anna if he was going to be dead? Why did you have to put such a stupid radio on the wall? I hated this scene, it was so stupid for me. It almost ruined the main horror scene. <br /> <br /> What I liked was the scene with the photo of Anna's dad, who was the first real scene frightening and frightening. I liked the boy. The actor was amazing. He was even better than Anna. I also liked how Anna tries to get her father out of the picture while she is asleep and as she searches for it in the garbage. <br /> <br /> Generally a good movie. I give him 8 out of 10.
