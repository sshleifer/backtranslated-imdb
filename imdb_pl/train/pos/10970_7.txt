Fascinating but disturbing look at Edith Bouvier Beale (Big Edie) and her daughter (Little Edie) and the first cousin of the late Jacquelyn Kennedy Onasis. They live in a rundown, destroyed by a mansion, a mansion that the city has recognized as a threat to health. It becomes very clear very soon that these two are far away from the eccentric. Little Edie seems to be the most offended, because she behaves the way she was at the age of ten, even though she is 53 years old. The content consists of two things. The first of these were interviews with Little Edie lambastes Big Edie for pushing away all potential suitors and ruining her aspiring career as a writer, actress and dancer. These discussions usually become very rhetorical, nonsense and often fun. The second part consists of long fights of singing by both sides. Each of them thinks that their singing is perfect and that only the second one sounds bad. In one amazing scene, Big Edie actually physically attacks Little Edie with her cane to stop her. Very captivating, but you get the impression that some serious exploitation is happening here, and the respondents are just too far away to know about it. The creators of the film seem to treat it like a bizarre show in the circus, coming every day to record (and giggle) with any bizarre behavior that can happen. Ultimately, it is a sad picture because it shows how the world just passed the two. Their hopes and dreams have gone to ruin like the residence in which they live. Despite the quarrels, these two need each other more than ever. Without the other, there would be no shelter for loneliness. The most amazing line comes from Big Edie, which many cats release in her bedroom. Her response to the smell complaint is simply unbelievable.
