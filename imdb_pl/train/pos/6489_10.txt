I watched the series when it first appeared in the 1970s, I was 14 and watched it at my best friends' house, as my father did not want to watch. It became a weekly ritual every Sunday and as everyone will say that two fourteen-year-olds watching a documentary in almost respectful silence must mean that it was something special. <br /> <br /> a wide series of events from World War II makes the document difficult. the creators broke what they considered the most important major events and devoted one episode to each of them. Some episodes included long periods, such as the "wolf pack", which included almost all six years of the Atlantic battle. Stalingrad had one episode in itself. <br /> <br /> this document could not be done today because most of them are dead. The list of significant players appearing gives an amazing insight into thinking at the time. Anthony Eden, Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Carl Donnitz, h of one of the submarines, Albert Albert, pet architect, self-confident and later Hitler's military minister. One of the later episodes we see a traumatic jazg, Hitler's secretary who was with him in the bunker and she dictated his last will and will - he left the bunker after Hitler's suicide and fled through Russian lines. These and many others play a major role in the realism of the presented events. <br /> <br /> if I have any criticism The series is that the code breakers in the bletchly park are not included, but revelations about their role in the war appeared only after the creation of the series, so I can not blame the creators of the program. <br /> <br /> opening titles and the music is great, and Lawrence Olivier's narrative gives a natural seriousness to the script. <br /> <br /> the best documentary series ever made? without a doubt
