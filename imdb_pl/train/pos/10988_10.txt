Do not read anything about this movie (especially nothing that might contain spoilers). Just watch this amazing movie without knowing anything about it - and you'll have a really great experience. If you like to see an intelligent, twisted story: Go, take a DVD and you will not be disappointed. "Cypher" is not really a science fiction film, a more psychological thriller set in a globalized business environment. It's about corporate secrets, how big companies are spying on each other's research departments and their methods. The actors perform a great performance, and the overall visual style of the film ensures a perfect cool mode. Cypher is much deeper, more complex and - what belongs to history and ending - also much, much more satisfying than other films of Vincenzo Natali "Cube" and "Nic". Actually, it's one of the best movies I've ever seen (and I really do not say every fifth well-made movie). Sorry, I can not say anything more about this movie without the risk of getting hurt. Give him a chance. ;-)
