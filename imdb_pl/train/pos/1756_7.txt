The "40-year-old virgin" made me laugh. I do not care if it's a very sexual comedy, I just liked many jokes and scenes in this movie. Steve Carell is perfect as a pristine gull Andy Stitzer and I think the scene where Andy has chest hair removed by wax one of the coolest, especially because it is real. By the way, many actors and actresses present in this film are well-known or already famous. <br /> <br /> Andy Stitzer has a peaceful life. It's a bit strange and it collects loads of toys, but it seems harmless. One day, playing poker with friends from their work, they discover that Andy is actually ... a virgin! And he is 40 years old! After this startling discovery all his friends try to get Andy to sleep with a woman ... the problem is the turmoil Andy is entering, especially now that he really likes Trish, the woman he met when she bought a DVD player in a store, which he works.
