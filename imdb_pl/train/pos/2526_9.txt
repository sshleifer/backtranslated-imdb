This is awesome! In story mode, you go from punk to professional. You must complete goals that require skating, driving and walking. You create your own skater and give it a name, and you can make it look stupid or realistic. You are with your friend Eric for the whole game, until he cheats on you and you are not kicked out of the skateboard team (you can choose a team to be on it), and then start your own team! There are many levels, such as New Jersey, Manhattan, and even School II (but not in story mode) from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2. You can unlock secret skaters such as Iron Man, Gene Simmons and another skater. You can create your own goals, such as the letters SKATE, COMBO letters, Tricktris, Gap and many more. You can create a pedestrian target and write what they say. If you get bored of it, you can do pre-set goals in ready parks. The only thing that I did not like about this game was that sometimes it was difficult to drive cars. 9/10.
