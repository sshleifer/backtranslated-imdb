Expect to see ordinary bankers Askey and Murdoch so popular in their time, with many interesting, bizarre characters. The lady with the parrot, the couple because of the wedding and the trouble of "her", and my favorite, station manager, "No one knows where it comes from ... no one knows where it goes ..." Interestingly, the ghost train was written by the fame of Arnold Ridley of the Army Dads (private Godfrey, medic) Watch him on a rainy Sunday afternoon after lunch and smile.
