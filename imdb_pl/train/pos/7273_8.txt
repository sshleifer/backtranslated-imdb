Carlos Mencia was perfect this is an exceptional hour. He worked hard to show everyone that it was a real deal. I know people have said that he stole the material in this unique, but it is not true. Carlos brings a comedy the way he wants it, not what someone else wants, that's why he's so good. People say it's not funny, because Dee dee dee speaks too much, and they still do not realize it's part of him, and they do not want it that way, but he does it anyway and manages to create laughter. For all haters out there, here's the message, Carlos is here to stay, there's no point trying to bring him back.
