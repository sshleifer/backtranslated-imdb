Karloff and Lugosi - Together again! This is one of those films that random fans will pass and underestimate. This is not completely horror, like the previous two hits of the duo, The Black Cat and The Raven. But it is very worthy of both talents and is a fun movie after your next visit. <br /> <br /> Invisible Ray was directed by Lambert Hillyer, a director who mainly created Westerns, but what's interesting in recent days is the reign of Laemmles in Universal, he took care of it and the last horror of Laemmles, Dracula's Daughter. Both are expressive, pure fantasies, which, despite fantastic elements, are very light for the horror content. <br /> <br /> Just like Lugosi went crazy in The Raven, a lot has to be said about Hamming in The Invisible Ray. One aspect of this story, which is particularly unsatisfying, is that Karloff's character, Rukh, works so madly before being poisoned by Radium X that there really is not much change when it starts to shine. This is very similar to the complaint that people have about Jack Nicholson in The Shining - he's basically weird from the beginning. There is no real transformation. The same here. Halfway, Karloff simply has an additional purpose of revenge in his mind. I still liked his performance, just as I did exaggerations of Lugosi in The Raven. <br /> <br /> In the meantime Lugosi completely surprises and gives a restrained and thoughtful turn as Rukh's rival in science, Dr. Benet. Lugosi also has some of the best lines in the film, including a memorable warning to the police trying to catch Rukha, with whom I work with the horror writer John Soister on "And if he (Rukh) touches someone?" Asks the inspector. Lugosi responds hesitantly, just as Lugosi could do it, "They are dying." Just as Lugosi could have been so distant, he could also be more perfect than any actor. This is one of those moments. <br /> <br /> That's why the interactions of Karloff and Lugosi are very good, because we get crazy Karloff's antics compared to the cool logic of Lugosi. Karloff would play similar crazy scientists many times, but he would like Lugosi to play more simple roles like this one. He had only one chance (Ninotchka). <br /> <br /> Invisible Ray is a funny movie and a real treat for real fans of Karloff and Lugosi. This is one of those movies that improves every time you watch, not because it is a masterpiece, but because of the charisma and talent of your stars and how this story complements the darker, more terrifying pairs that they had. Special effects, always innovative John Fulton, are great, and supporting actors are enough. Frances Drake looks as beautiful as in Mad Love and plays a strong woman, something rarely seen in classic horror movies. The scene at the end, when Karloff sneaks up to her and she does not scream, is one of the most haunting moments of the movie. A great, fun movie!
