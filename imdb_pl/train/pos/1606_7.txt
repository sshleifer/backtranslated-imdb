"Adult-directed film" is now rare, but Moonstruck does it well and is still better than the average movie that is aging very well. Although his comic moments are lower than in the rest, the movie has a great specificity (Italians in Brooklyn), which is not used to change characters or viewers. (ie, gangsters never get complicated, they never become grotesque, like My Big Fat Greek Wedding). Stories from stories are told economically with short scenes that let you break away from the main story. These are scenes that are currently lacking in contemporary films, where their value can not be impressed by producers and large fish. I miss those scenes. It also engages older characters beautifully. The film has its delicate, silent path to the conclusion. There is no badly written scene that would make some managers relax. Cage and Cher do a very good job. <br /> <br /> Moonstruck refers to old-school, ethnic, everyday work. New York, like "Marty", except Moonstruck, is much less sacred.
