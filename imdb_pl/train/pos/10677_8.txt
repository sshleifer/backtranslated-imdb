This film was the first British film about teenagers, which in fact dealt with the reality of the brutal society of rock and roll instead of being a conscious parody of teenage life in the 1950s. Trying to celebrate the work of Liverpool's young liaison officers, the opening title indicates that 92% of potential criminals who have been covered by this system have not committed a second offense. However, this becomes just a pretext for another teenage drama up to the epilogue of the film, in which we are instructed that we should not feel responsible or apologize for such crimes, although they may seem mixed up. <br /> <br /> Stanley Baker plays a hard detective who is reluctant to take the position of a juvenile liaison officer. This hard character is the typical role of Baker. Being currently on the trail of a known arsonist known as a skylight and not enjoying the dispersion of the transfer. However, as in all good police drama, he is led back through the full circle of events, returning to the original investigation. <br /> <br /> His first case leads him to the house of two young children, Mary and Patrick Murphy (a real brother and sister duo in this role), who committed a small theft. Here he meets Cathie (in a satisfactory way presented by Anne Heywood), their older sister, with whom he eventually becomes romantically connected. It quickly becomes obvious that the miserable environment of such cities is a breeding ground for juvenile delinquency. <br /> <br /> Murphy's older brother, Johnny, is the leader of the gang of rock and roll hooligans. McCallum makes an eye-catching twist as a Americanized mixed-up kid who owes more to Marlon Brando than any previous British star. The hero of Brando, Johnny from "The Wild One" is reminded, who ran a leather-clad gang of rebellious cyclists in the same way that "Johnny" of the movie leads his gang. <br /> <br /> Luckily preaching Dearden crime dramas such as "The Blue Lamp" are not so obvious. Instead, we present a few well-developed figures on both sides of the law, because the drama criminals and romantic interest in Heywood and Baker are at the forefront. <br /> <br /> The plot, though sometimes predictable, provides unforgettable scenes. The breakthrough effect of rock and roll music took place in a scene in which Johnny devotes himself to music, leading a dangerous progress against the police sergeant. The most thrilling memorable part of the film, however, is the atmospheric scene in which a group of terrified school-age children, including Mary and Patrick, is hostage to Johnny. Of course, in the light of the real Dumblaine massacre, this scene seems terrifying. It is understandable that for this reason the film is rarely broadcast or available to the modern public.
