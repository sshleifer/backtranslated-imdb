"CASOMAI" was the last movie I saw before the wedding last year. <br /> <br /> It was also the first movie I was looking for after the wedding, because we promised to offer a copy to our priest. <br /> <br /> Sometimes reality is not like fiction. To all those who wrote that priests such as "Don Camillo" do not exist in real life, I recommend that they visit my priest Pe. Nuno Westwood, in Estoril, Portugal :-) <br /> <br /> I would recommend to all of them just watching this movie before and after "I do!". dzie≈Ñ :-) <br /> <br /> Rodrigo Ribeiro Portugal
