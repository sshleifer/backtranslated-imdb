There were a lot of the latest surfing movies that I accidentally came across without warning. I caught this treasure on a digital cable this week and what a pleasant surprise it was! We focus on the pioneers of surfing the big waves from Greg Nolla in the 1960s to our current Laird Hamilton, from Waimea Bay to Mavericks to Jaws. Hell, I could watch a movie about Lairdzie Hamilton - one of the best athletes of this generation - so the rest is just a sauce. There is a lot of good surfing mixed up with interviews with old and present surfing stars, in a pleasant, relaxed and unpretentious way. Of all the surfing videos I've seen, it's best to say this big wave and I think it's my favorite. Enjoy!
