Brutal, emotionless Michael Myers stabs his sister to death at the age of six on Halloween night in 1963; On October 30, 1978, he escapes from a psychiatric facility and sets up a new reign of terror in his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois. He is being chased by a psychiatrist (Donald Pleasence) all the time, who knows how bad this young man is. <br /> <br /> It opens with a bang and sets up a truly tight and atmospheric aggregate that is actually better for the many photos that have helped to inspire. It's subtle compared to nasty bloodsheds, many of which were later; subtle and frightening. It retains the ability to jump even after repeated viewing. How many really are movies that can still be scary, even if you've seen them before? Not much. <br /> <br /> Satisfaction is wonderful in probably the final role of his career; Jamie Lee Curtis, in her debut film, became the real queen of screams after her performance in "Halloween," as well as several more pictures, and she is an intended victim worth cheering for. <br /> <br /> Co -writer / director John Carpenter knows what works in this movie, perfectly using shadows and dark skies; notice how most of the movie is set after dark. With this picture, he and his former collaborator, Debra Hill, created a franchise that spawned seven sequels, many followers and the upcoming "reappaging". <br /> <br /> He is very approachable - who would forget dr. Speech by Loomis (Contentment), in which he describes Michael Myers to the sheriff (Charles Cyphers, a reliable repertoire player in several earlier Carpenter's works)? <br /> <br /> It's fantastic and it's worth looking for. This is my favorite movie by John Carpenter of all time. <br /> <br /> This is not completely infallible - in the end there are scripting holes - but overall it makes a solid impact. <br /> <br /> 9/10
