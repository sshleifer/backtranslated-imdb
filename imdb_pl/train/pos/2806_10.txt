Okay, first I hate commenting on this thing, but I felt I had to fight for the movie. So many people fought this and I felt that people who might want to see this should get a second opinion. <br /> <br /> First, Bend It Like Beckham is not meant to be the deepest film of the century. If you're looking for it, go somewhere else. Just because it is an independent film does not mean it has to be artistic. This is to make you feel good and you should have fun watching, and these two things are well done. <br /> <br /> Secondly, acting, although not "Halle Berry in Monster's Ball" is still good. The film does not have to be so honest, so do not look for it. It's a family movie. If that's what you wanted, you should not or should not even look honestly at this movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, it has a really charming story. I think it's well thought out and watching is fun. It is also a very loyal life for this culture, so if you want to sit down and watch a movie that you can enjoy and enjoy when you're done. If you're looking for something with deeply thought-out feature lines and great dramatic scenes, this is not for you. <br /> <br /> -Lyndsay
