It could not be better. Strong limitations in Mike Sullivan's expressions could not be presented in any other way. Tom Hanks provides the best results of his career. Young Tyler Hoechlin leads an emotional circle; play a fundamental role in history. And veteran Paul Newman has long been one of his best characters. <br /> <br /> This movie is based on the bold graphic novel by Max Allan Collins and Richard Piers Rayner. This is the story of a father / son who basically employs two candidates who are not fit for roles. Mike Sullivan did not have a father as a child, so he was taken by John Rooney. Although he was a generous man, he dealt with organized crime. Therefore, Sullivan's debts had to be repaid only through involvement in the business. Now Sullivan has a wife and two children and tries to ensure his children's safety, but at the same time pay off their boss. The events that are to take place will test Sullivan's loyalty and take on the fate of his family. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the great adaptation of David Self, dialogue is rare, but it is very virtuous. The story takes place in a beautiful scenery from 1930 (Brilliant Art Direction by Richard L. Johnson and Nancy Haigh) covered with dark rain (snow on the ground) surface. Directing the story is a great Irish result from Thomas Newman, which appears only when it is necessary. <br /> <br /> But the most important technical element in the film is the beautiful photography of Conrad L. Hall. These are some of the best photos I've seen; and I watch many movies. The scene where Mike and Michael are in the car entering Chicago is impressive. The shot starts at the front of the car, revealing Mike (Hanks) through the windshield. Then it moves around the car to see Michael (Hoechlin) waking up and looking out the side window. As time passes, the vehicle is transported sideways and lazily back around the car and reveals a stunning Chicago scenic from the 1930s. <br /> <br /> With a great cast and crew the main man creates an amazingly amazing movie. I'm talking about Sam Mendes, who made his feature film debut in 1999 with American Beauty. (he won many awards) Before American Beauty Mendes he worked as a theater director at the British Theater, but he decided he wanted to go on to say that there is nothing new in the theater for him. Only two films, Sam Mendes, was marked in my book as one of the great directors (on the list of about twenty-five). <br /> <br /> The movie is illuminated by an insolent genre that has its hits and longings and perfectly expresses the real motive. Photography, acting and history are phenomenal. I'm still waiting for the New York gangs at Scorcesee, but for now I'm totally convinced that it's the "Best Film of the Year". Considering the competition (signs, insomnia, minority report), this is a strong statement.
