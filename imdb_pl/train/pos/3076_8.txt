Why Panic never got a good cinematic release is easy to see: he is much too clever, and the audience probably would have a hard time comparing it to American Beauty in the study of midlife crisis, and Sopranos and Analyse This in his research on illegal activities in life family. Although Panic may seem to derive from non-original material, realistic Brommel characters in combination with a skillful dialogue and perceptive direction make the film a realistic look at the loss of a middle-aged man. <br /> <br /> William H. Macy plays Alex, a murderer who works for a company that kills his father's (Sutherland's) contracts. He lives a double life, and his wife (Ullman) and son do not know about his real trade. In middle age, he becomes more and more disgusted with what he has done all his life. Under his calm, collected facade, they arouse suppressed resentment to the father's control of his life. When he meets a young woman (Campbell), he feels excited and decides to leave the family business. <br /> <br /> The fact that the writer / director Henry Brommel decided to make a profession that his main character tried to break away from killing contracts is a one-off. He could easily replace him with any undesired profession; his characters are so well developed and credible, the scenes treated so smoothly and realistically, and the dialogue written so insightfully and naturally that he focuses rather on the conflicted character of Macy than on his work as a murderer. Brommel's script seems to be a Shakespearean tragedy, with a specific motive of fate that runs all the time. <br /> <br /> In Alexie Macy creates a tragic, easily compassionate character and turns into another thoughtful, great performance, as always be expected. Donald Sutherland is also effective and offensive as his overbearing father, and the dramatic turn of Ullman as Macy's wife is a welcome change for the comedian. Consider the scene in the bicycle shop, where her mood subtly darkens and reaches the top in an exciting scene. <br /> <br /> The first film of Henry Brommel, Panic, is a film that is well made in its sincerity. With a first-class cast, a credible script, a concise dialogue and a nice direction, I hope that the character's study is just a taste of Brommel's aptitude for creating characters that seem real. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
