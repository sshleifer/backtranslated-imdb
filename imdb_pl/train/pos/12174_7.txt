I think that the contract with this movie is that it has about 2 minutes really, very funny moments and makes it a very good trailer, and many people came with expectations from the trailer and this time the movie does not meet the trailer. It's a bit slower and it's a bit slow in such an exciting assumption, and I think I see that people who have a relationship with this movie love / hate. <br /> <br /> If, however, you look at this film for what it is and not what the casting talent might have taken into account, I think it is still quite good. Julia Stiles is undoubtedly a star, she is so shaky and carefree that she is among everyone else's conformism, she just shines and the whole audience falls in love with her along with Lee. The rest of the cast, of course, Lee's coworkers with testosterone, his elegant mother-in-law, his sister-in-law friend Jim and his future fianc√©e, are perfect in the stereotypes of compliance and nausea that make Stiles stand out in the first place. <br /> <br /> Lee does not meet his expectations, I do not think so, but it could be considered something that is difficult to deal with. Maybe this is one of the reasons for disappointment. <br /> <br /> The film itself, despite a little slowness and a few jokes that are not as funny as the writer intended, is still quite funny and I found a rather intelligent movie. The themes of compliance and the "safe path" seemed to fit cleverly into several layers. For example, there was a whole motif, how he would imagine scenarios, but he would never act on them until the last scene, or how he listened to the radio program on the highway, talking about how everyone is adjusting, or how everything that selma blair and Julia's characters Stiles said and echoed these motives that one person is a safe choice and the other a risky choice. <br /> <br /> Another good thing about the movie was that it was a kind of screwdriver comedy in which Jason Lee has to spin around after the movie and who by stupid luck (example: a guy from the pharmacy turns out to be a good cook) and some kind of cunning on his part he avoids him mostly. <br /> <br /> Although it was not as much fun as I expected and some wasted talent, but overall it's still a good movie.
