"Silverlake Life" is a documentary that was simple and straightforward. Actually, it was more like a home movie, and if you want dramatic illumination, see something else. And it is not a tear squeezer at all. But I mean it in a positive way. Shows two men who love each other and how being affected by AIDS affects the quality of their daily lives. It is difficult to say whether it was a high quality movie or not, because it was so undressed that I had to look for other ways to answer. It's a great movie, actually one of the most admirable, honest documents I've ever seen. These two men have incredible integrity, because their life comes down to the most basic parts. It makes the Hollow wood production for AIDS seem fashionable and soulless. These people have made this film for themselves, which is one of the best reasons to create something. The scene in which Tom sings "You are My Sunshine" to Mark and says goodbye to him is true.
