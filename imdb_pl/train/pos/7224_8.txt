After the release of DEATHTRAP, the poster - reproduced on the cover of this DVD - offered graphics similar to the Rubik's cube. This is the right picture: originally written for the stage by Ira Levin, who is the author of such memorable works as CHILDREN ROSEMARY and LIVE STEP, the game was one of the most-known Broadway twists, and under the direction of Sidney Lumet translates very well into the screen. <br /> <br /> DEATHTRAP is one of those films that is very difficult to discuss, because performing it in any way reflects the plot from which it is known. But the opening assumption is extremely clever: Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) is a famous author of mysterious plays, but now he seems to have lost touch. After an extremely brutal premiere, an old student named Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve) sends him a script for the play he wrote. It's called "Deathtrap" and Sidney recognizes it as an undeniable blow. Only such a hit that would revive his career ... indeed, a hit for death. And when Clifford visits to discuss art, events suddenly start to twist in the most unexpected ways. <br /> <br /> Like Anthony Shaffer's SLEUTH SHOT, DEATHTRAP is really a story more on the stage than on the screen - To achieve full power, you need the immediacy of a live performance. Still, under the guidance of an expert director, Sidney Lumet, he does something more on the screen than his respect. Much of this stems from the cast, which is exceptionally good. Michael Caine gives a really great performance, Dyan Cannon is funny and endearing, because Sidney's constantly restless wife, and Christopher Reeve gives what can be the best performance in his unfortunately short acting career. If you do not see it in first-rate theatrical production, it will be more than until it appears. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
