The biggest reason why I had to see this movie was the appearance of Susan Swift, an outstanding and too unappreciated actress. Time-travel movies usually do not interest me, just like movies about spells, but this movie was fascinating and frightening. He did not rely on outrageous special effects and did not focus so much on the time travel that the viewer got lost and confused. It was a really creative film kept in simplicity and focused on great acting.
