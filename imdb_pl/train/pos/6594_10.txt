Tweedyjscy professors thought that they invented all this. Today's people inhabiting Polynesia come from migratory Asians, constantly moving from the Far East, islands to the island, east towards Tahiti and all the other exotic tropical islands of the South Pacific for thousands of years. But the established thinking simply did not match the young Norwegian ethnographer, Thor Heyerdahl. If this explanation was true, then why do some people born and raised on these islands have traditions, works of art and physical features resembling those from Asia but from South America? How can the vegetation of Ecuador, Peru and Chile look like what can be found on an island several thousand kilometers away? Is it just a coincidence that the islanders point the sea towards South America and say that where their ancestors come from, led by Tiki, their counterpart Adam? Meanwhile, how do the Norwegians talk about the precursors from Scandinavia, who were hunted from the South American continent, which they colonized, and together with some of the natives with whom they became friends, set off to the west - heading west? It's too much to be a coincidence for Heyerdahl. With an amazing amount of moxie, a handful of crew members and local know-how in the field of traditional rafting, the expedition begins. It's just a journey into the human imagination, like a pseudoscientific demonstration that such a journey is possible only with the basics of tools and sailing. The Oscar-winning documentary can be dated and anglo-ethnocentrically approachable, but rises in the spirit of adventure overcoming even a space program that was launched ten years later because men are willing to risk everything to test the theory they believe is real. Great. Do yourself a favor and read the book first. It's an amazing page turner and the perfect configuration for a chronicle-style movie.
