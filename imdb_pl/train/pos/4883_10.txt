We, as a family, were so delighted with "The Last of the Blonde Bombshells" that we bought a copy of our home video library. <br /> <br /> Acting is A1, and the cast contains many favorite actors and singers. The subject is unusual and the script well written. Music / songs are timeless and take us back to our young days when we sang songs at the top of our voices. Presenting this story would ruin the "storyline" because it is really nice to sit down and enjoy the story that is developing. <br /> <br /> A full assessment of this most pleasant and uplifting production and we heartily recommend it to everyone who is looking for laughter and a lot of music.
