This movie has everything. Visual gags, subtle jokes, fun with words and verses. It's about a group of boys from different ethnic and social groups who meet to defeat a common enemy. If you look at it more than once, you'll find that you quote it like Animal House (and yes, I also love Animal House). I put 15 of the funniest films. Major in the military academy for boys is paranoid, that every child is bad and wants to cause trouble (in this movie is right). He is sadistic, indifferent, cruel and must be removed. A group of boys who do not get along early will join forces to survive and get rid of Major in a crazy plan that only Mad Magazine could write. Must see - you will love it!
