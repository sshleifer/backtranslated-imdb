This movie was a fantastic comedy. There were many comics like Akshay Kumar, Rajpal Yadav, Paresh Raval and John Abraham. <br /> <br /> Rimi Sen was good at playing the wife of Akshay Kumars, just like all air hostesses. Mr. Hot as Mac (Akshay Kumar) and Mr. cool as Sam (John Abraham) are two fashion photographers who like the same girl Maggie (Neha Dupia). When John Abraham deceives his job, he becomes Akshay Kumars senior, and Akshay Kumar becomes really jealous, because his apartment must be passed on to John Abraham, and Neha Dupia begins to like John more. Akshay Kumar wants to be better than John Abraham, so he finds a flat and goes out with three different girls (Nitu Chandra, Nargis Bagheri, Daisy Boppana).
