After too many years of waiting, the film Anne Rivers Siddons from 1979, "The House Next Door" was filmed. The result is somewhat different from the novel, which, especially in the first trilogy story, is understandable if it is not satisfying, because it is a TV movie, the whole of which is absorbing and actually very good, just not as great as Stephen the King's Favorite and one of my. <br /> <br /> With more time and fewer restrictions as a cinema premiere, all the wealth contained in the original three-part story of an ominous ultra-modern home could be explored and nurtured, especially the culminating revelation at the end. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the entire cast is doing well in this thought-out tale of mindless hostility. There are a few unnecessary cheap shocks, but the growing atmosphere of fear is well developed. In fact, one of the most disturbing scenes is the abstract painting of a house by a neighbor-amateur-artist who is trying to imagine his corruption on the canvas. <br /> <br /> Read the great novel.
