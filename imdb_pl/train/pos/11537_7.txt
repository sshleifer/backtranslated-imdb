Neil Simon had a talent for dialogue and nowhere is this more obvious than the lines that WALTER MATTHAU and JACK LEMMON give opposite as opposed to THE ODD COUPLE - a mixture of comedy and sadness that depends solely on the credibility of two such unmatched friends sharing a flat. <br /> <br /> Lemmon is a simple Felix Ungar, after a divorce with his wife willing to commit suicide, and reluctantly agrees to share the apartment with Oscar Madison (Matthau) with somewhat catastrophic consequences. It seems that everything that Felix says and does, leads the Oscar up and none of them can stand up to others, and Oscar is the most stubborn man you can imagine, and Felix is ​​just the opposite. <br /> <br /> Sisters do the pigeons in the apartment above and visit them on the day of the lunch. The invaluable interaction between Lemmon, Matthau, Carole Shelley and Monica Evans is enough to get you stitched. The talented sisters pigeons are the girls who made voices for Gabble Sisters in Disney's THE ARISTOCATS, and here - their comical time at the peak of Lemmon's sad story of despair is enough to make the film happy. - where there is a lot of time. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Neil Simon and enjoyed other screen treatments in his work, this one can not be missed. Matthau and Lemmon are very well-mannered (although they were thinking about exchanging roles before shooting), and of course it's easy to see why he later became the best-rated TV show. <br /> <br /> In conclusion: Comedy Simon's Mountain, which can not be missed.
