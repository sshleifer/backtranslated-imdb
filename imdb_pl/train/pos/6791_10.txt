The second application to do it in the movie would be great !! I was also surprised by the plot and character build in this game. I played again and again (over 20 times) to try something different and it gets interesting every time. Final Fantasy eat your heart !! THIS SHOULD BE PERFORMED IN THE FILM !!!!! If someone wants to help start a petition to do it in the film, contact me. I would like to help in this project every day. The graphics are great for PS1, and even make you forget about PS1 most of the time. A multitude of side tasks makes it change every time.
