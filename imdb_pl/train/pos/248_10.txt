"Ned Kelly" is a wonderfully made Australian film honored with a real Australian hero. We were taken to the world of Ned, his best friend Joe Byrne and other members of Kelly Gang, as the movie explains and perhaps justifies Ned's actions. <br /> <br /> There's a special cast, they all give great performances that bring the movie to life. (Great job, Heath!) Orlando Bloom was fantastic as Joe, playing the role of a quiet, loyal master. At the moment I was swept away. For a moment I almost believed that the Gang would win the battle at Glenrowan, unfortunately it was not meant to be. <br /> <br /> Some aspects of the film are fictitious and as a keen fan of Ned Kelly (and a supporter), he was a bit disappointed. Perhaps the movie could also be extended to cover more of Kelly Gang / Neda's life - I felt it was not enough. <br /> <br /> Regardless of a few flaws, it is a moving movie that moves all kinds of emotions. (And hey, I'm assuming that this movie would be watched better than Mick Jagger trying to introduce Ned ...)
