The fully rounded nature of the main role of this film, the policeman torn apart by his past and self-destructing so clear to the viewer, is unique for his time, 1950. <br />> With haunted music and a well-written story, the film is the best example of the film noir at its best. The close-ups of Dana's eyes reveal the anguish inside, Karl Malden excels as his boss, who has no nonsense, but also has compassion for those who are under his command in the district. <br /> <br /> Otto Preminger made this kind of film almost alone. If there's any fault, it's with the breathtaking beauty of Gene Tierney, who seems strangely out of place with hardened clay. Their scenes in the cafe are, however, great and true. <br /> <br /> Tom Tully, in part of his father is perfect, just like Gary Merrill as a hood. Great lighting and mood setting. The building where the deaths take place is very atmospheric, I love the old woman in the basement. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
