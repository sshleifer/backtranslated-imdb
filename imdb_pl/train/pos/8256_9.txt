I saw this movie at the Vancouver Film Festival and we thought it was deadly intelligent, stylish and FUNNY. <br /> <br /> The cast was ROCK SOLID. Great work of Carrie Anne Moss, Dylan Baker, Tim Blake Nelson, Billy Connelly and senior rider Alexia Fast. <br /> <br /> I was wondering about the movie for many days after seeing it. <Br /> <br /> Writers Dennis Heaton, Robert Chomiak and Andrew Currie put together a lot of political undertones - but they did not hit you on the head. <br /> <br /> The world they created had depth, and it made sense. In this movie there is a dizzying carnivorous spirit. <br /> <br /> FIDO guarantees the treatment of grouchiness. <br /> <br /> I really liked it !!!
