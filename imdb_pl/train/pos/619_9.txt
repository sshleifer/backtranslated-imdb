I expected this movie to be decent and probably stereotypical, but I was completely wrong! Charlie Cox (I've never heard of him before) played an incredibly good leader; he was so serious and romantic, me and my friend who saw the film with me, they fell in love with it. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes, which I liked before (I LOVED her in Romeo and Juliet), I'm happy with her even more. Her acting was fantastic, I could not even say she was an American. The chemistry between her and Charlie Cox was exceptionally good, the casting was pretty perfect. <br /> <br /> Robert DeNiro and Michelle Pfeiffer were equally well manned; DeNiro as a gay pirate ... priceless, priceless. I laughed so much in this one scene where Septimus goes on a ship ... oh my God, wow. Pfeiffer played a decent villain, I liked her as a cunning mother in Hairspray. But throughout the movie she had the right amount of melodrama and malicious comments. <br /> <br /> In general, it was fun (but not patting at all!), romantic, special effects were not very frequent, but when they were, they were great; the episodes of Ricky Gervais and Peter O'Toole were also well presented. <br /> <br /> I totally recommend this movie to anyone who likes fantasy films like Princess Bride and even Lord of the Rings. I was interested in all the time and I will buy a DVD when it appears!
