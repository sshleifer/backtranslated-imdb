"Girlfight" follows the project living in a New York high school girl with a sense of futility in the world of amateur boxing, where she finds self-esteem, purpose and much more. Although the film does not apply to boxing, boxing is a movie. So much so that you can almost feel the sweat. Technically and artistically a good movie with a sense of honesty and reality, "Girlfight" is not a hatchling and "Rocky". It is rather a very human drama, which even viewers who do not know about boxing can connect to.
