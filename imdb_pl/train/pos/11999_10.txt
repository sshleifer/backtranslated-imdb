I saw this wonderful production and I wonder if anyone can tell me something about the actress who played the blacksmith's wife - I'm not sure of the name of her character. I went to BYU with her and I lost contact with her - her maiden name was Kim Luke - and I wonder if anyone has any information about her. She is not on the credit list. This production was outstanding, mischief on all accounts, excellent performance of everyone. I do not think I want to put this in the general category of "acting," more like "portraying with the astonishing events that led to the opening of Heavens for this final dispensation" ... that. If someone has worked with Kim or has a website or something, let me know !!! She was fantastic in her role, by the way ... Thanks, Melissa Thorne
