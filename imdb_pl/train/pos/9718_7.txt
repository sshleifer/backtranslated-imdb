POSSIBLE SPOILER - In a sense, "How to Alienate Friends ..." is "the loser learns to adapt, succeeds and learns that something else matters" in the history of stars. - KONIEC SPOILERA <br /> <br /> I do not know the original book, but this comedy provides some good moments. Although I think the ending is flawed. I felt too fast and too violently, as if something was missing. Besides, I would say that the film is not able to maintain a high level. In addition, you'll find a sweet selection of actors and actresses over time with controversial acting features. So far, I have never seen Pegg differently. Still, it's a very special type, although on the screen it can sometimes seem a bit more boring than necessary. Fox has proved that she can play a hot star with her head in the clouds. I do not know if it was difficult, but its performance was hot and better than during "Transformers" (okay ... probably this is not a difficult match). Kirsten Dunst is very Kirsten Dunst (again) and you can like it (like me) or get upset. On the other hand, you'll see Anderson, who has proven his acting skills, and Jeff Bridges (who's okay, but maybe he could work a bit harder). They all fit in well with their character. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I think it's a cool comedy of fame with a few other, less entertaining fragments, a sweet cast, but too sudden ending.
