I really liked Timothy Dalton, although he was a bit young and too handsome for Mr. R., but I thought that Zelah Clarke was too plump and short. This version, however, was very loyal to the novel and very well filmed. I've seen 4 versions, Orson Welles is still my favorite Mr. R, although George C Scott did very well and it's a throw between Joan Fontaine and Sussanah York, although they were both too old for the role. I recently saw a genius television version of Rebecca with Charles Dance and Emilia Fox. I'd like to see these two Jane Eyre. While I was watching the version of Ciarina Hinds, I think I was Jane Eyred, but I will never get tired of those first minutes of listening to the voice of Joan Fontaine talking about opening the first version I've ever seen. I always want to go back and read the book again.
