The great thing about Withnail and me is that it intercepts the fact that soon abandoned college and life can go one way or the other with all other elements. Freebird is something for those who probably have never thought about higher education and just went to work at the age of 15/16. I know that some of the wide pages dug a knife into this movie when it appeared in cinemas, but I saw it in a packed house in Hailsham and everyone seemed to really enjoy it. I grew up in the forest of Dean, and it took me back to my mushrooming and awesome days (or some wonderful colleagues - they hated to think about what they are all doing right now - they probably carry out local advice). I watched it several times on DVD and I see this movie as an old partner, which will remain forever as part of my collection (how can I like this movie and Dambusters - somehow it does not seem right) Certainly towards the other half of this movie and I think that social interactions with locals are excellently made. I like the mix of the three main characters and there really is some beautiful writing along with some very cited poems, and I dare say that it is a good combination of integrity. I tried to get the soundtrack, but it was not released (it's a pity because it's a cork). Somebody told me that it was originally a scenic performance, not quite sure how it works, but I'm sure it was fun. I liked the little Shakespeare accents / references that seem to appear throughout the film (also spotted by Dylan Thomas ref) and like all little gems, there will always be little things to discover how the final scene that bowed to Easyrider start another journey. All in all a truly unpretentious movie song (I love it!)
