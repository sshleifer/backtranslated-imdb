This is where the term "classic film" comes from. This is a great story of courage, courage and loyalty of a woman. Poor Olan was sold to her indifferent husband, who for years has learned to appreciate her. (Yeah right, A PEARL !!) <br /> <br /> Luise Rainer was a beautiful star who a year earlier won an Oscar for Best Actress for her small role (and what a loss of Oscars) in "The Great Zigfield." It really did not show what talent she had, if any, except her exotic beauty. But in "Good Earth" it shows that it can really work! Her beauty was erased and she did not have great costumes. People say she did not show any real emotions in this movie. Like hell. Her character Olan is a shy and shy woman with inner strength. It is quiet during part of the movie, only her eyes and body convey emotions. Example: these scenes during the fall of the city and when the looters were shot. If you say it does not work well in this movie, you're NOT looking for it! <br /> <br /> Paul Muni shows that he can also act. His character is not sympathetic to me. He never sees her who he is until the end of the story. Sweet loving and devoted wife and mother, with their unique beauty. The greatest of all, beauty from the inside, like a pearl. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to see this movie, watch it. You will see one of the best movies that created the golden age of Hollywood.
