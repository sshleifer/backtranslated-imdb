I saw this movie for the first time drunk in a motel in Canada. When I was flipping the channels I came across the Easy Lube part. My friend was still falling, but I told him to come back. Something called easy lubrication just did not sound good. I watched the rest of the movie, it was damn funny. I wrote down a few names with credits and went home to see them. It turned out to be Chevy Chase's first movie. I did not remember him in it. I did not remember much about it, so I rented it and gave him another idea. It's quite fun and quite graphic. It's like a movie from Kentucky Fried, except not so much fun. I love fingers, I'm easy to grease, and I'm part of the president's family. Skit dealers are pretty cool too. I give him 6.5 or 7 out of 10
