This movie starts with fun for about 15 seconds and continues it throughout the movie. I can not remember the scene in which I did not look at people laughing at me. He is the perfect actor for this role because of what he looks like and how he dressed. <br /> <br /> Comedy parts were great to see from actors not too big and popular. As you can see, people like this movie, which currently is 7.9 on IMDb. I think it should be in 250. Let's put it this way, that I have not seen this funny movie from an American cake or an original holiday. see if you want to laugh. I give this movie the 2 highest thumbs I've ever given since I found out about IMDb, a great movie site.
