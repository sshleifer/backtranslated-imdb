I liked the movie completely, but four things really stand out: perfect comic timing and Sam Raimi's performance as a handy (?) Man, great characteristics of Alan Arkin's camp owner, and most importantly, photos. Beautiful golden shades of external scenes draw me into the movie like a sunset on the shore of the lake, draws me into my own summer memories. <br /> <br /> Dialogue and mood are very natural and reliable. Some reviewers criticize the lack of a more "deep" scenario. For me, this lack just makes this film work. Characters and their problems seem real, that's why I care what happens to them. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that all parts combine to form a whole that seems right.
