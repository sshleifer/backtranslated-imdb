Stunning. Quite stunning. It's a movie about two children whose father suddenly has a vision. He claims that an angel visits him and tells him that they must kill "demons". He receives instructions later and begins to catch demons that are the naked eye of ordinary people. They kill these so-called demons with an ax to the head and crush them, burying them in a rose garden. Their father claims he sees their sins when he touches them. The film is continued with a certain twist of action. <br /> <br /> What I love about this film is that it perfectly captures the weakness of human perception. Is their father crazy? Or is he telling the truth? The audience has to decide. Go judgment yourself and watch the movie. Now.
