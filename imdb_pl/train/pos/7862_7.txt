This is proof of why Mary Pickford was "America of Love." In this rather complex drama, Mary plays a young butler daughter who dares to dream of a relationship with the son of one of the "highlanders". Scenes where they steal a kiss and fall in love are simply delightful. She is even ready to take a bath. The fact that Mary could break away from this role at the age of 30 is simply amazing and a bit due to her slight increase (5 '). <br /> <br /> Tess has to face many physical and emotional challenges. He does it with courage not seen in many heroines of those times. Tess packs up and is not ashamed to fight anyone. Why she agrees to help her daughter, "the highlander" is outside of me, but devotes her own happiness to keep a deep secret. Pickford's pickups are great. <br /> <br /> Born in Denmark, Jean Hersholt is simply wonderful as a villain. The scene in which he deals with a small child is enough to throw vegetables (or whatever) onto the screen of the film. If Forrest Robinson (who plays Daddy Skinner) wore a beard, would he fit the model used in these posters of Uncle Sam from World War I? Wants You! <br /> <br /> Although the story is somewhat predictable and slow at the beginning, it's worth investing in your time to see a song or a clean "Americana". The film highlights the choices available to us, which include making someone else happy and being a real Christian. Recommended.
