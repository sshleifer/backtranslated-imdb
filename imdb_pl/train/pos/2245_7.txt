Salva and his buddy Bigardo were on the margin of the law for most of their lives. We see how they panhandling in an underground car, where their donation field is so bad, nobody gives them anything! Salva, who is a hardened petty criminal, does not even have any redeeming qualities until he discovers a reality TV show that gives him an idea of ​​what to do next. Religion and show business turn out to be a winning combination, something that Salva uses on capital. <br /> <br /> He and Bigardo were in prison after the accidental death of a priest who was critical of the duo. Salva shows that it is natural for a reality show. It transforms into a figure similar to Christ, which immediately succeeds in the program. Espe, who is a nonsense woman who is the producer of the show, can not escape the way Salva draws her extraordinary attention. Ultimately, Salva is the victim of her own success in the end. <br /> <br /> Jordi Molla, whose first directorial work is this film, has had some success in the way in which the film satirized the role of television. Spain, which was exposed to such programs, saw its participation in bizarre events, which the director considered an attack on the audience watching and wanted to set their story from the point of view of people who make a fortune to a naive audience. <br /> <br /> The cast of the band has some good moments in the film. Mr. Molla, like any actor who decides to make his first movie, would be more effective, focusing on the picture in front of the camera. Candela Pena, a good actress, is one of the best reasons to watch the movie. Juan Carlos Villedo, David Gimenez Cacho, Franco Francescoantonio, Florinda Chico and the rest responded well to the new director.
