I saw a few movies about eating disorders, but this one was definitely my favorite. The problem with others was that people with eating disorders at the end simply improve automatically or accept the fact that they need help and that's all. this movie, which seemed more realistic to me, because in this form the main character Lexi does not automatically improve. She gets better and then she has a disadvantage. I think that this movie shows more than others, that I saw that improving not only happens, it's hard work and takes time, it's a long way to recover. I think this movie shows it all very well. There should be more such films.
