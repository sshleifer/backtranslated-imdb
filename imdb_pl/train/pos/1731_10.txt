The era of erotic film from the turn of the sixties and seventies began with the admission of free nudity in mainstream movies and ended with the legalization of hardcore pornography. These were the peak years between 1968 and 1972. One of the most beloved and talented actresses of the era was Monica Gayle, who had a small but fanatical cult of supporters. In fact, she was able to act, unlike many who fulfilled the main roles of these films, and her subsequent credits proved it. And her seemingly deliberate disappearance at the moment when her career grew, only heightens her mysticism. <br /> <br /> Gary Graver, the director, was also a talent; probably too talented for the sexploitation genre, and his skills combined with the presence of Monica Gayle on screen make Sandra, Making of a Woman, a pleasantly pleasant experience. The movie never stretches and you will not press the fast scroll button with your finger.
