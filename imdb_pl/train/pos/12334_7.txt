Does anyone know where the movie was filmed? The aerial scene on the cliff is beautiful. This seems to be England. However, Ivy's apartment building certainly looks like a Brill building with its fascinating elevators. <br /> <br /> Charles Mendl is listed as playing "Sir Charles Gage". Maybe I blinked, but I never saw him. Perhaps he was a husband's lawyer, but I do not remember that this character was in the film, except that it was mentioned as a phone-maker. Maybe he was on the air scene? Is the ball scene? Has anyone noticed him? <br /> <br /> Herbert Marshall was 57 when he made the film.
