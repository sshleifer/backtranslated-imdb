Here's what I knew about Atlantis before watching it: <br /> <br /> * - It's officially the first animated Disney science-fiction adventure. I'm not sure how accurate it is (I like to rivet), but I wonder when I heard it described. <br /> <br /> * - The preview looked mostly damn cool. According to some critics, it was obviously "too mysterious" after the fact. <br /> <br /> * - Apparently, Disney said so badly, "Fuck it, let's put out Spy Kids again". <br /> <br /> So, with all this, how's the movie? <br /> <br /> Hella-cool. <br /> <br /> I am a sucker of animated fantasy that includes mixing music all the time and you are crazy about special effects, but "Atlantis" comes out. It is a return to all sweet shots of CGI in "Beauty and the Beast" and "Aladdin", so that it is almost the best effect animator. Characters may not be so memorable (except, perhaps, for the medical officer of the ship), and the plot is a bit boring, but it is not a movie that you watch on the story. <br /> <br /> Here are the controversies that worry me. "Failure" (as in "only" took five hundred million or something, I know the animators who killed to see fifteen bucks) of this film in comparison with the popularity of "Shrek" and "Monsters Inc." was considered proof of the death of traditional animation. I do not think that's true. How do you explain the movie "South Park"? What about "Final Fantasy"? Really history and artistry is everything, not a method. I do not know what the Disney movie will look like, but I do not think it will be outside the picture.
