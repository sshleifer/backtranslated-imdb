If people did not know who Barbra Streisand was before ... (is that POSSIBLE?) ... they certainly knew who she was! <br /> <br /> This concert won 5 Emmys, and stands out as one of the best things Streisand ever did. <br /> <br /> Consists of 3 acts .... <br /> <br /> ACT AND ... Standards of singing Barbra from room to room filled with musicians, including the episode in which she is a little girl again , ending with a great version of your signature song (at the time) ... "People". <br /> <br /> ACT II .... A musical tour of Bergdoff-Goodman, while Barbra sings songs of poverty .. is better than it seems ... <br /> <br /> ACT III ... .. The best part, Just Barbra, musicians, and some great songs, like ..... "Happy Days Are Here Again" and "Funny Girl" medley .... <br /> <br /> all in all, great part of the history of television, made by one of the largest performers in the world!
