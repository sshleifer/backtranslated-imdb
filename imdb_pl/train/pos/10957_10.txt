This program probably will not appeal to everyone. Sarah does what she wants; he does not ask for permission, and she does not apologize. It is a sitcom with zombies, robot dinosaurs, flying cars and a team of male cheerleaders stealing wallets. The star of the series is not a hero, he is a spoiled, bigoteric pervert. If you can not appreciate the unusual humor it offers, it probably is not for you. Everyone should at least give this program a chance. It combines the comic style of Sarah Silverman, Brian Posehn (Comedy comedy), Jay Johnston (Mr. Show), Steve Agee (Bobcat Goldthwait's Stay) and creative energy by Rob Schrab and Dan Harmon Jack, Monster House). It also presents the best talents of the growing channel101.com online community. (If you're at this concert, keep an eye on "The Department of Acceptable Media" on vh1 in March this year, it will come from the same talent pool.) <br /> <br /> Watch the Sarah Silverman show. That kind of thing is the future of entertainment.
