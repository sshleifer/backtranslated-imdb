Breaking Glass is a movie that everyone who wants to be in the music industry should see more than once. It is a very dark story about the way the record label manipulates the singer to do everything his own way and make as much money as possible from it. Looking at some of today's TV programs in the style of "search for the stars" both in the UK and abroad, I always remember this film. Although he is not an expert in this field, the winners of these concerts usually have one very big first hit, and then his congress. This film precedes these performances, although the effect seems the same. After getting rid of his manager, played fairly brilliantly by Phil Daniels, slowly but surely the record label changes the texts to stimulants and ultimately is completely burned out. You, potential stars of tomorrow ... SEE THIS AND BELIEVE !!!
