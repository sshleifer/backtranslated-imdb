The true story of a bunch of thieves stealing from an unprofessional businessman of drugs, jewelry, weapons and money. Some say that this is a tragic story about America in the eighties, when the peace of peace and love of the sixties has hit drugs and AIDS. Honestly, it's just ordinary people, aimlessly in life, who sit around and decide to rob a ruthless man. What is the second part of their main plan? When they have their own things ... they will sit down and stand up again. A great plan. Even if you do not know this story, there is no tension or surprises in this movie. The fact that Cox tries to create folk characters from these characters, party scenes and assembling their spoils, is weak and offensive. The story was better thanks to a more simple approach. In fact, this is a sad story of petty drug dealers killed by great drug dealers. Bigger history, in many respects, is John Holmes. And this is the center of this story. This movie should concern his life. He was in Wonderland, with miracles that were to disappear. <br /> <br /> P.S. Although this is not official, Boogie Nights is a better version of Holmes' life. This is not completely factual, but it is much nicer.
