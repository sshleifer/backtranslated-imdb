It seems fashionable to ripped the "Basic Instinct 2" to such an extent that a significant proportion of the audience (including critics) found it horrible before it was even released. It's even more fashionable to throw away Sharon Stone, who, like us, is now fourteen years older and, unlike most of us, still looks wonderful. The first comments about this movie were so cruel that I had to see them myself. In my opinion, this sequel is not as good as the original movie, but it's not as bad as most comments go. Michael Caton-Jones is not Paul Verhoeven, neither Henry Bean nor Leora Barish is Joe Eszterhas. "Basic Instinct 2" is simply a fun, average thriller, and in addition to adding the original result of Jerry Goldsmith, it does not look much like its predecessor. Even Stone gives her character a different dimension, creating a lusty, devilish Catherine Trimell, who can perfectly include other monsters like Hannibal Lecter. She is an intelligent actress who is not afraid to take risks and can play with the camp in her spare time. Unfortunately, it seems to be the main goal for those who like to destroy this movie. It has become too successful, too much of a major icon, and like all the actors who have achieved this level, its time has already come, and now it must be destroyed by the Hollywood audience. the cast is excellent, giving performances a lot better than it deserves. David Morrissey is a much better actor and definitely more interesting than Michael Douglas: his acting is impeccable, giving a compact, complex dimension of a character who would otherwise be one-dimensional. Because it has more time on the screen and is the axis of the movie, it can keep your attention from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend "Basic Instinct 2" as a great movie; I simply express my opposition to most of the comments on this site and my belief that programs other than the film itself shape the opinion of the majority of viewers.
