David Lynch's (1999) film about the history of John Roach / Mary Sweeney takes place in Iowa and Wisconsin some time before the final release of the film. <br /> <br /> We enter the life of Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) late in life. His health is weak, his life is mainly behind him and he knows it. <br /> <br /> It makes him decide to do something even more unusual and endearing. He decides (and at any point in the film his own name echoes in his actions) to straighten out a few things. <br /> <br /> Alvin is a man of great experience until then, but he means humble. His daughter Rose (Sissy Spacek) struggles with the obstacle in speaking, which makes communication a great effort on behalf of the audience. But it's worth it, because Rose's story can not help but reveal itself as the film progresses. <br /> <br /> This movie is a travel story. But like all travels, it is a journey in the geographical sense and in the human sense. At the beginning of the film, we begin to understand that this is an ambitious journey that should not be undertaken by any older gentleman in Alvin's age. <br /> <br /> But along the way, we are slowly learning how Alvin has so many qualifications that equip him to achieve his unlikely goal. His goal is very simple and simple. His brother is sick and will probably die, and he wants to visit him. He fell with him many years ago and they have not talked for a long time. <br /> <br /> Alvin meets a lot of people along the way. The manner in which he behaves towards them and the benefits they derive from getting to know him is the essence of this film. We find out who Alvin Straight is from what Alvin Straight does. And at the end of the movie, we know who we are ... better.
