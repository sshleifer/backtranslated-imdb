... Rather well done, actually - attack the evil villains in their lair, stop the Little Big Horn ambush, save the day with bugling waterboys, work for me. Stiff upper lip British and so on. <br /> <br /> How is it played on DVD 66 years later? It struck me as if I were Western, attaching Apache or Sioux for the Thugs, and American cavalry for the Imperial British Army. It's a very colonial look, you know? The weight of the White Man and so on? Kipling would certainly accept it. <br /> <br /> Cary Grant, Fairbanks and MacLaglen play it as widely as possible, placing a buddy friend in a slapstick for a mix of gunfights and brawlings. (I had no idea that it was Joan Fontaine as a pregnant army of tokens - did they leave part of their scenes on the floor of the cutting room? Very briefly). None of them was going to get an Oscar here - in fact Grant was not his best in a few scenes - but tease him, it still works. And where else would Ben Casey end up as an Indian trumpet player? Only in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Def. check it out if you like pseudo-western adventures. It has been done by several professionals, I can add. <br /> <br /> *** outta ****
