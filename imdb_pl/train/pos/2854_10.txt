Much has been said about this film and I would like to join those who praised it. It is a unique film that uses elements from various genres: drama, comedy, gangster film without clutter. At some point you just laugh out loud, in other points you feel the characters whose errors and mistakes you observe. Sabu's genius can be shown in relation to some of the movie's sequences. First of all, when all three men race each other, they have an erotic dream about a young woman who has just passed on the street. This sequence is beautifully made and very well illustrates the figures of all three runners. It is both erotic and funny. Another example of Sabu's genius is the part of the movie in which the runners get tired. First, one of them, a typical loser among three guys, hallucinates that the woman who left him for someone else, came back and see them dance with each other, and in the next shoot him dancing with himself who is deeply moving. All runners reach the point where they think they have something they have lost or are on the right track again. At some point in the movie, they stop racing, run in the queue, they just laugh. So here is the whole beauty and absurdity of what we call the life that Sabu manages to show throughout the film. His heroes fail (or at the end?), But they do not rob them of dignity. "Monday" and "Postman Blues", which give justice to Sabu's claim that he is a genius. Go watch them! <br /> <br />
