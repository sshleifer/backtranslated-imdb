This is Arnold's movie. Now that you know about it, I have saved a lot of the time it would take to read this review. If you do not like Arnold, you will not like this movie. If the case is second, you will love it. It's so simple. <br /> <br /> If you're still reading this, I expect you like Arnold. Good for you! He's pretty good, right? Running Man is a very typical feature of Arnold. We have a typical retro-future, which we know so well from B-Sci Fi 80s, has a handful of terrible single-rowers, lots of violence and explosions, a nice heroine and a happy ending. <br /> <br /> In this case, the evil opponent is the government in 1984, which uses television as an effective crowd control through gladiator quizzes. Arnold, of course, goes to one of these concerts and changes it down, with little help from two Confederates and a handsome Amber. <br /> <br /> It's not a big budget movie, but it still managed to create quite a nice atmosphere of the future, with some nice matte images and sets to help. It's hopeless 80's, but I think it's cute. Acting differently, Arnold does his usual grunt and scream, with the help of one-shell pebbles. Heroine Amber is, to put it mildly, somewhat stereotypical, and the subtly named Damen Killian is a typical man of evil TV. <br /> <br /> Despite all the disadvantages, the film shows its message very clearly; television is the opiate of the masses, a good way to control people. It also includes a futuristic edition of digital video that allows bad people to change faces in the movie to deceive their audience. This does not seem futuristic at all, which is somewhat disconcerting. <br /> <br /> If you've seen Arnold's movies, you know when to watch them. Enjoy.
