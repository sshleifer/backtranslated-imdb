Moonwalker is probably not a movie to watch if you're not a fan of Michael Jackson. I am a big fan and I liked most of the movie, the ending was not fantastic, but the first 50 minutes were - if you're a fan. <br /> <br /> Personally, I believe that the first 50 minutes are repeatedly played. Dance in every movie is breathtaking, fantastic music to listen to and entertainment dialogue. <br /> <br /> Contains many of his best films from Bad and excerpts from his earlier films. It also contains material from the live concert. <br /> <br /> If you're a huge fan of Michael Jackson, it's necessary, if you're not a fan / you do not like Michael Jackson, control it well. <br /> <br /> 9/10
