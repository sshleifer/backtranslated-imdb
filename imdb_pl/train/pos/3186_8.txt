I consider this movie very pleasant. The plot is simple and easy to digest, the humor is light and clean, and because the story associated with the wrong identity is quite common, I can not wait to see how this movie will develop this story. It turns out to be very nice. Performing a female role is admirable; her portrait of an innocent, naive girl trying to come up with white lies for David's sophisticated role was very charming. Also, the Vera dance is very, very well done. I pull it to my fingers when it effortlessly and flawlessly looks around the stage. <br /> <br /> For those who are fed up with the profanity of today's movies, you'll enjoy this movie.
