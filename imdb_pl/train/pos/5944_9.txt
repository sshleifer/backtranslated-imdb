Let me say this for a start: ... Why, oh, why WB can not do what the directors of short films do? Sandy is of course an amazing director and deserves credit from WB and DC. But it seems to me that they are on the edge when a man with a budget of $ 12,000 can do a super-hero. The World Finest is one of the best short films I've ever seen, a trailer or not. <br /> <br /> I think that choosing a bodybuilder (Mike O'Hearn) to play Superman was a brilliant choice. Let's face it, Superman is not a super-model. He can be handsome, but GQ Stud is not. And I do not know what this guy was, who had some comments on me, but Superman is really thick (Have you ever read Superman's comic book?). I'm guessing that this fact alone will seat me ... It seems that it is such an obvious choice, that someone with some real muscle mass played a superhero, not a pretty face. The same thing for Batman, Bartram is in awesome form and a great Batman ... I do not know guys ... If he gets a bigger budget and his own movie ... I think Bale and Bartram would be Neck and Neck. In summary, this is one of the few Super-Hero movies in which the actors LOOK through this part. <br /> <br /> Acting is also quite nice. I do not know what everyone is talking about, O'Hearn is not so bad. He's damned convincing like Superman and Bartram ... Well, I'm Batman. Come on, people, this movie had a budget of $ 12,000, what did you expect? They're all great too, unless Two-Face seems a little more crazy than usual ... But hey, we only have Tommy-Lee Jones as a reference. Oh, Lois is very hot too. <br /> <br /> SFX are cute too. I mean, seeing Superman, pick up the car ... MALE! Compared to the "Tank" scene in Grayson, I might have to put the one above because Mike actually looks like he's flying and easily. Sequences of flying left much to be desired, but once again, with a larger budget ... Oh, he even used a Batmobile (it was probably a model, but it looked damn convincing). <br /> <br /> In conclusion, the only disadvantage of this trailer was the lack of a serious budget. And WB refuses to admit that Collora is a credible Director, and NEEDS to be something like Project ... But no, they (like most Marvel projects) will just get those hack directors who show almost no respect for the fans and that what they care for, and keep shooting these gambling videos. Thank God, Superman Returns was a hit, or seriously it would be the end. World Finest is perfect, and in my book counts as a superhero movie.
