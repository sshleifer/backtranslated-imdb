Well, I come from Bulgaria, where it is almost impossible to have a tornado, but my imagination tells me to be "very, very frightened" !!! This guy (Devon Sawa) did a great job with this movie! I know exactly how old he was, but he did not behave like a child (WELL CARED)! Now about the tornado - it was not too realistic, but it scares you! If you want to spend time in front of the TV - this is a movie!
