Everyone knows about this "Zero Day" event. I think this movie did not make the Elephant make us see how these guys are. They showed their lives for about a year. We like them throughout the movie, laugh at them, even if we know what they will do. And it gives me chills. Because I felt guilty that they were cheering their comments, and I thought Cal was a sweet guy. Although I knew what would happen, you know? Even at the end of the movie, when they were about to commit suicide and just decided whether they did it at 3 or 4, I thought it was fun, but I was still scared to see their heads blown away. Of course I was. I must like them. Maybe they were bad, but I felt they were really normal guys that they did not really realize it. But I knew they were. <br /> <br /> This is IMO, the main force of this film. This makes us aware that our friends, relatives or anyone else can plan something crazy and that we will not even notice it. This movie, as good as it was, made me feel bad. And that's why I can not go to sleep now. It's still a small feeling in my stomach. Butterflies.
