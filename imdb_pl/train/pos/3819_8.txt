I've been waiting for this movie for a long time and finally I was able to see it at the Istanbul Film Festival. Maybe because I was expecting too much of this movie and that's why I was a bit disappointed. I was not the best movie from Korea, but it's really worth watching. <br /> <br /> The topic was nice, and the movie makes you watch the movie without boredom, though it's long. But there are gaps in the movie and you jump from one point to another. However, the game Jeon Do-Yeon is incredibly beautiful. It was one of the best performances in the history of early cinema and I think that this movie would not be so nice if it was not in the lead role.
