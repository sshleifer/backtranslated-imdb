"The Haunted World of Edward D. Wood, Jr." is the definitive documentary about the life of a man who brought us such films as "Glen or Glenda", "Bride of the Monster" and of course "Plan 9 from Outer Space". This excellent film goes well beyond other documentary films such as "Look at Angora" and "Plan 9 Companion". It complements his surviving dawn, many of whom have since gone on since filming and honestly examining Ed Wood and his work. Nostalgic in that he looks back to the dark corner of old Hollywood, sentimental in treating the director (to the haunting music), this document is absolutely necessary for anyone who loves a director who has failed in his day. The whole two hours of the film beautifully and retrospectively combine Ed's life and premature death for the viewer. Best to watch at 3am, wearing an angora sweater.
