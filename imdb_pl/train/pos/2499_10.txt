This movie was amazing. He had an original concept (the movie about the vampire meets the Yakuza mafia movie). It is a humorous and at the same time very dramatic and tragic film about friendship, love, immortality, death and happiness, as well as subtle comments about society. On the part of Gackt Camui, Sho's role was great, and HYDE was surprisingly good in his first film as a tortured, but humorous vampire Kei. I was laughing and crying over the happy heroine Toshi, who grew up with Sho. I loved every second of this movie, especially moments like the funny scene of cigarettes, battle scenes, and above all the heartbeat.
