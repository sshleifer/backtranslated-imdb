The most important thing in this film is the excellent performance of Daniel Day-Lewis and Hugh O'Conor as Christy Brown, a guinea artist and warrior who, despite his condition, defeated all the chances. As a person who worked with patients with cerebral palsy, I can assure you that their results were shockingly convincing. The enormous support Christy got from his family, the low-earners, the Dublin working class, encouraged him to do the impossible, and this picture showed it wonderfully without reading the book, but the dialogues were written wisely to capture Christy's witty arrogant personality Brown. I recommend this film to everyone, especially those who love classic films.
