WOW! <br /> <br /> This film is the best living testament I think, from what happened on January 9-11 in New York, compared to everything shown by major media. <br /> <br /> These stores can only show you what happened outside. This movie shows what happened at INSIDE. <br /> <br /> It starts with focusing on the debut New York firefighter who waits weeks for the first big fire to which he will be called to fight. The theme changes dramatically with the ONLY EXISTING IMAGE OF THE FIRST AIRPLANE TO GET THE TOWER. You will then get a place in the first row as firemen rushing to the stage, to the Tower One lobby. <br /> <br /> In the minutes before the crash of the second plane and the later collapse of Tower Two, you see firemen responding to the disturbing sound of people landing above the lobby. This is a view you will soon forget. <br /> <br /> Heartbreaking, tearing and very captivating from the first minute to the last, "September 11" deserves to go down in history as one of the best documentaries ever made. <br /> <br /> We must never forget. <br /> <br />
