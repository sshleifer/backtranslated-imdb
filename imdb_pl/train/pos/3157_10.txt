"This" 70s Show "is definitely the funniest show on TV. I started watching it about two and a half years ago and as soon as I saw it, I could say it was a great performance. I like all the characters, but my favorites are Fez and Kelso. Leo was also an amazing character when he was there, I hope he will come back because he is funny. It's classic when Fez goes "you motherfucker!" And when Kelso yells "burn! They are both great heroes and they always have something fun to say. Hot Jackie is another reason to watch the program; She started to look really good, but the hell, just around 5-6, she just got really hot. I've seen most episodes more than once, some of them have been 10 times and still funny. This is one of the few programs I can watch over and over again and still laugh the same as the first time I saw him. The cast is classic; almost everyone is funny, where there are only a few funny characters with many shows. I will be sad when I see this concert at the end of next year, but it will be one of the best concerts ever.
