I rented this movie (I do not think it had a cinematic premiere here), expecting worse. The announcements made the movie look awful. I was very surprised, it was worth watching; it was loosely written, almost like a movie band. He had some very funny moments and, although he is defective, he is an effective satire on the show and people on the show without much virulence. It is flawed, mainly due to the horrible soundtrack of 'comedy' effects, but it generally turns out to be so honest and generally in line with the form of altmanesque or Larry Sanders. At the moment when Jerry Springer's criticism is at hand, he is also an easy target. Springer could have created Citizen Kane and would be declared "the worst film ever made". I recommend this movie to everyone interested in the show. A defective but innovative and interesting movie.
