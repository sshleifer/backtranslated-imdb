On one level, this movie can bring out a child who wants to build sandcastles and throw them into the air just to see how it falls. However, at a deeper level, he explores the deep desire to reconnect with the earth. I totally felt at the artist when he said: "When I'm not here (alone) for a long time, I feel unruly." <br /> <br /> I recognized Andy Goldsworthy as one of the great contemporary artists. I know his works mainly thanks to coffee books and installations in several art galleries. But seeing his work in motion, perfectly captured by the Riedelsheimer lens, was a revelation. Unfrozen Goldsworthy creations come alive, swirl, fly, dissolve, disintegrate, break. <br /> <br /> And that's what he wants: Time. The process of creation and destruction. Appearance and disappearance. About leaving the Emptiness and becoming the Universe and back. There is a shamanistic feature in it, bordering on madness. You feel, watching him at work, that his art is a life force for him, that if he does not, he will be where and he will die. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for us Goldsworthy is able to share his vision through the communication medium of photography. Otherwise, except for a few mounds and walls, they would only exist for one person.
