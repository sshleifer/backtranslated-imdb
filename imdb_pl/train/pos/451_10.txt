If someone wonders why no one is making films like they used to, with conversation, character and a simple theme of friendship, which tries to evolve into something new, better and different, these people have to take part in this film and see top-notch writing, directing and activities that merge into a wonderful evening of observation about how it used to be in Italy and England. Other days, at other times, were a frightening comedy of entertainment, made in 1992 with Alfred Molina, Joan Plowright, Polly Walker, Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent, Miranda Richardson and Michael Kitchens in the leading roles. Under the direction of the brush by Mike Newell, these actors perform vivid, unforgettable performances, which are photographed with the subtly subtle eye of a painter. Recalling the theatrical farce of the bedroom at the turn of the century, this movie can be called a farce of friendship, which becomes a valuable experience in the development of romantic nature in every form, as well as the viewer. An artistic telegram about the importance of taking care of people around us.
