I've always liked movies that depict life as it is. Life sometimes has boring patches, no real plot and not necessarily a happy ending. "A River Runs Through It" is the perfect name for this film (and Norman Maclean's novel). Life flows away and flows like a river, and has raw places, but it's a great journey. <br /> <br /> Robert Redford brings a lot to the movie. His narration has a friendly character that fits the image perfectly. As a director, he is restrained and calm, and also records incredibly beautiful scenes. When it comes to acting, Craig Sheffer and Brad Pitt work surprisingly well like brothers. I do not know how to describe the performances of Tom Skerritt and Brenda Blethyn, except that they really feel real. "A River Runs Through It" is a great movie. <br /> <br /> 8.6 out of 10
