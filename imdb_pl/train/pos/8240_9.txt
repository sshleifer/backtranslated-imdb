I was also at the premiere in Toronto. This movie was kind of a consolation when I thought I would not be able to see my first choice. Well, I was totally amazed. Before I got to the theater, I did not remember much except the basic plot of the film (yes, I actually forgot who was in it.) Great performances from the entire cast. Carrie-Anne Moss was great in a true departure from her time as Trinity. As for Billy Connolly, I do not think since Chaplin has an actor who plays so brilliantly, without any lines. The children were great too. Definitely check it if you have a chance. <br /> <br /> And by the way, I saw my first choice anyway - and it was much better.
