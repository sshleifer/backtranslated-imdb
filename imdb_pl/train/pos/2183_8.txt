Billy Wilder is co-accredited for this story, and his unsentimental touch is noticeable in this quite original story of ghost writers who both work for Oliver Courtney's music legend. Obvious misunderstandings are removed from the road quite quickly, thank God, and what remains is a brilliant and airy mixture with some great songs (and a few more forgetful), Crosby in his most charming, wonderful breakthrough of the legend of Broadway Mary Martin and Basil Rathbone and Oscar Levant delivering most of the cynical hooks (Levant is in a rare form, and his jokes were not dated at all). A great surprise and recommended for all fans of the genre.
