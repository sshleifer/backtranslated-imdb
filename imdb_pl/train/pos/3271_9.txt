I've always been a big fan of this movie, first of all you've seen the cast, the acting is great and it helps to make this movie move very well. Cybill Shepherd received great reviews for her role and were well deserved. The beginning of this film begins in the past when Corinne Jeffries (Cybill), whose perfect marriage stops when her husband Louie unexpectedly dies. Luckily, Louse gets a second life chance when he agrees to "recycle" back to earth as a newborn Alex Finch (Robert Downey, JR). Alex continues his new life, forgetting his previous life, while Corinne tries to live with her. But fate crosses Alex's path 23 years later, when he meets daughter Corinne, Miranda (Mary Stuart Masterson) and is suddenly flooded with the wealth of unwanted memories (here the fun begins and embarrassing situations arise). they are heart and very sweet. You will not be disappointed if you give him a chance, Chances. Do you like it. Very funny and sweet!
