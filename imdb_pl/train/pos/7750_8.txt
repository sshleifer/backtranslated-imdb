The bartender directed Any Way the Wind Blows because he sang the dEUS song. Anarchy governs a logical and common strain of thought. The story behind this movie goes in any way when the wind blows. It can really be refreshing if you're prepared and willing. Viewers who say they have nothing to do with maintaining the story are right. Who the hell is this Windman? Nevertheless, I really liked this movie. Antwerp is a beautiful, vibrant place, and Any Way reflects this feeling. It also captures stupidity, racism, bureaucracy, addictions and violence that survived undetected in a seemingly friendly city. The film is funny, funny and a bit shallow. The debut on the Bartender screen will not have as much impact as his musical debut. Some people may be disappointed in this light. But on the other hand, the "worst case scenario" would be a subtle subtitle "Any Wind".
