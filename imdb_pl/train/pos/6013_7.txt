Watching it again after many years of break and remembering about the flop that appeared after the first release, I'm surprised how well it lasted. One of the reasons for his failure was that one generation thought it was over indulgent shit, and the younger one was disappointed that he did not show full hippie praise. Now it is clear that Antonioni was already aware and fascinated by the strong combination of hot enthusiasm for change and the lack of a clear vision of the future. The lead couple is perfect and it is shameful that they took so much of their faxes to the perceived failure of the film. They are perfect and perfectly convey different contradictions and show pure pleasure in making love. I blame others for excessive pressure on the student revolt sequences at the beginning, but I must say that from this point on, it is one of the most beautiful images of directors, and he certainly has the best of natural landscapes created by man. Oh, I did not even mention a very explosive ending.
