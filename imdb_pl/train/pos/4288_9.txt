Rain or shines outside, you enter the cinema. It makes you happy. (If not, leave immediately.) The lights go out. You settle with a bar of ice cream. Moving images begin to flicker on the screen. You feel the content. In the dark you are back at the beginning of time. Sitting by the fire ... looking at the modern version of flickering flames 24 times a second and sharing the joy of discovering unknown turns and twists with the rest of the clan / spectators. <br /> <br /> Those who are not happy with themselves should not write comments. (Long live romantic comedies ...)
