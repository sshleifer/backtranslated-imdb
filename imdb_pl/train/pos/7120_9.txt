Most war films made in the USA during World War II were great fun to watch, but they suffered from serious realism gaps because they were produced more for propaganda values ​​to raise ghosts at home than anything else. I do not beat these films because many of them are still very visible. However, because they often lack realism, they can not really be great films. A great example was the movie John Garfield Air Force - in which the B-17 almost alone takes half of the Japanese air force! However, Pride Of The Marines is a welcome departure - high marks for showing the true story in a fairly accurate way. When I saw this movie for the first time, I thought it was NOT a real story because it seemed too unlikely to be true. However, after further research, I discovered that in fact it is true to the amazing story of two men who have done so much to win the Medal of Honor. This is one case in which real life seemed too unlikely to be true!
