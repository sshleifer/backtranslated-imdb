Sublime is the way we must reach for Beauty. And sublimity is what this movie is made of. If not his best, he is the most beloved of all Bogdanovich's films. <br /> <br /> This unique masterpiece reminds us, like most other director films, about what life is (or should be): love, lost (or failure) and hope, faith and love. As a song from which films take their title (well-known composition Gershwin), the film makes it impossible, and tries to make us aware that no one can judge anyone; all this with the lightness of comedy and the sense of the master's direction (the first ten minutes, with detectives following women, almost without dialogue lines, constructed on the looks and views of the characters - with this "Bogdanovich" touch based on the point of view - is a class on the subject of cinema language , something that PB has learned well from his admired directors from the Golden Age of Films. With a great cast and a great soundtrack (including the best from Sinatra's Trilogy), this film, full of self-awareness and compassion, far from indulgence and emptiness (as some critics have written) deserves a better place about the history of American cinema than where it was placed, it is not "long in style, not much content": it is complex in its simplicity and beautiful, absolutely beautiful.
