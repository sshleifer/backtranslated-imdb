Of the elements that make it the best at this point, I must say that # 1 is Christine McIntire. Shemp's scene after poisoning and her reaction are really great. I imagine that, as one poster suggested, Christine tried to stop the laughter from happening in the scene, but in fact she made her seem even more deliciously angry, smiling at Shemp's death. <br /> <br /> Another character that helps you stand out Goon. His gaze was a great intersection of terrifying and comedic stupidity. Few characters would choose to meet in a dark alley or anywhere. I would prefer some real criminal secret, but hey, when a lie is so good, who will complain. Not me.
