Tom cat, Jerry mouse and Spike the Dog (here called Butch, his third name, his second "Killer") decide to sign a peace treaty so that everyone would love each other. It's weird and a little unnatural to see them all buddies like this, and their friends think so too. But ultimately, thanks to misunderstanding about the steak, everything returns to normal and everything is fine. This short is the second of three on the new editable DVD spotlight and I have no idea why it was. This drawing can be found on the DVD "Tom & Jerry" from the collection Spotlight <br /> <br /> My class: B
