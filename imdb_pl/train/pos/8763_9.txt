This film is cold, naked truth. We often think "Oh no, it will not happen to me." But maybe. Drug trafficking is a lot of money, and often people unconsciously (or deceived) do something for smugglers. The story of these two girls is the story of many young people who like them, just wanted an exotic vacation - which turned into a nightmare. People must know that these kinds of events are not improbable or exaggerated - this is a serious problem in today's society. <br /> <br /> I recommend this video to mature viewers because of the understanding needed to really appreciate the film. It is very emotional and raw. It's worth watching and it will definitely remain in your memory.
