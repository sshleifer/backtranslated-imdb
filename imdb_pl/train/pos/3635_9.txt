This is a great Disney flick.it is the story of an aging high school baseball coach (Dennis Quaid), who was once on his way to the big leagues as a pitcher, but he suffered an injury ending his career. Morris (Quaid) has a chance to try out with the top league team, and even makes roster.this a great family movie. It is inspiring, but not exaggerating. We play and have fun. just like kids.it is based on a true story, although I'm sure the filmmakers have used a bit of freedom in telling stories. Quaid is sensational as the title character, very convincing. If you are looking for a movie, the whole family can be enjoyed, see further.9 / 10
