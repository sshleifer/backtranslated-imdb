In the fast economic development of the 1990s, China revives traditional Chinese culture, partly because of the rise of nationalism, which is accompanied by an increase in wealth and, more importantly, because of a sense of spiritual belonging after the fall of the old socialist ideology in the post-culture-revolutionary era. <br /> <br /> However, the rebirth of traditional Chinese culture, namely Confucianism, was not without disaster, because the Chinese adopted the whole tradition without eliminating the wrong part, and the discrimination of girls demonstrated in this film is a perfect example. <br /> <br /> Moreover, not only the part that should have been rejected was inherited, a good part that was to be inherited, for example a traditional opera, and his technique, such as a face change, was ignored in revival and the face of extinction. <br /> <br /> The director used this film to criticize the problem of the re-adoption of tradition by contemporary China and that is the deeper meaning of the film.
