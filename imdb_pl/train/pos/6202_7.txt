When I started watching "Fay Grim", I had no idea it was the continuation of "Henry Fool". Now the latter was not a movie that I imagined as a continuation. But one has arrived and is quite good. I assume you have seen the original, so I will not explain it. This begins with the life of Fay (Parker Posey) with the son she had with the dead Henry (Thomas Jay Ryan). Simon (James Urbaniak) is still in jail. One day, the son is expelled for bringing a pornographic toy to school. But this is not an ordinary toy. He keeps a secret that explains a lot of what happened in the first movie. And this secret delves deeper into geopolitics than 'Syriana'. <br /> <br /> I must say that I am impressed by what Hal Hartley has achieved here. Maybe this one does not quite achieve the quality of the original, but it certainly works well in the world. And the end leaves the possibility of another continuation. <br /> <br /> Jeff Goldblum starred.
