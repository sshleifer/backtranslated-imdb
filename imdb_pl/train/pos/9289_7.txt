In BARBARIAN AND THE GEISHA, John Wayne plays Townsend Harris, a real envoy from the United States who was responsible for opening Japan to international relations in the late 1850s. Before him Commodore Perry basically fell into Japan with gunners and in 1853. He forced a treaty on the Japanese. Harris, who arrived a bit later, worked on the details and helped ensure compatibility - many Japanese did not feel like honoring the first treaty. All this is true and shown in the film. According to other sources that I found, the romance between Harris and the Japanese geisha is mainly fiction, and this romance is the focus of this film (hence the title). <br /> <br /> My first reaction the first time I saw this movie was surprised. John Wayne as a diplomat ?! When he's diplomatic in most movies, he says, please, and thank you when he's fighting people !!!! So seeing him as a man who is NOT a man of action and able to play a diplomatic game seemed really strange. In fact, I can not come up with too many actors in 1958, who would be more unusual in this role. By the way, I've seen pictures of Harris and Wayne practically unlike him at all. <br /> <br /> However, despite the fact that history has many freedoms with the truth and strange casting, the film is still very visible. Colorful cinematography is nice, the film shows a nice insight into Japanese customs and culture, and acting is not bad. All in all, a nice and watchful movie despite a strange casting. <br /> <br /> PS - Read the trivia about this movie. You will learn a little more about the real characters, as well as the alleged battle between Wayne and the director (John Huston), where Wayne apparently knocked him out !! Based on what I read about Huston and the way in which he dealt with the actors, this is an incident in which I believe. And this is also a nice example of John Wayne's "diplomacy."
