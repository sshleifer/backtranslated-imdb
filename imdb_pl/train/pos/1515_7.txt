Amicus approached a good half-dozen of these horrors in the '70s, and this is one of their best efforts from the leading writer of horror, Robert Bloch. There are four stories, all worthwhile, but two - "Sweets For The Sweet" and "Method For Murder" - stand out as highly effective travel in fear. <br /> <br /> In "Sweets", Christopher Lee plays an impatient widower whose charming daughter (Chloe Franks) is offended by his negligence and brutal intolerance, so he carves a voodoo doll with which he expresses his dislike for his methods. Franks is a beautiful form of malicious evil and delivers one of the greatest performances of children in horror since Martin Stephens in "Innocents". This part is directed with great subtlety, and the final indignation, appearing off the screen, is the moment of the purest horror. <br /> <br /> "Method of Murder" tells the story of horror (Denholm Elliott), who is threatened by one of his own creations, terrifying Dominik. This episode is striking because of simplicity and severe terror. Dominic may be real or not, so director Peter Duffell has a great time playing with our expectations. Dominik's short shots reflected in the pond or seen as a fleeting phantasm in the meadow are really haunting. <br /> <br /> The original art of the poster, depicting a skeletal figure holding a tray with Peter Cushing's head cut off, was rich temptations for players who are focused on fear.
