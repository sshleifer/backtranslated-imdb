Gillian Holroyd (Kim Novak) is a witch. Secretly neighbor Shep Henderson (James Stewart) is secretly attracted to her. He casts a spell on Shep, who forces him to drop his fiancé and fall on her. Everything is going well until Gillian finds out he really cares for this mortal man. He decides to tell him his secret. But how will Shep react when he finds out he has been "cheated" to fall in love with Gillian? <br /> <br /> When it comes to light comedies from the '50s, Bell Book and Candle are good, but nothing spectacular. It is a pleasant enough watch and should appeal to almost everyone who sits with him. Just do not go into the movie expecting the biggest thing from sliced ​​bread. The film is sometimes sweet and funny and finally touches it. Kim Novak and James Stewart do their best and have some real chemistry. Novak (as others have noted) looks quite unbelievably low. The supporting cast with Jacek Lemmon, Hermione Gingold and Elsa Lanchester is often funny and laughs with Novak and Stewart. The biggest problem I see is that Bell Book and Candle is not able to decide what kind of movie you want to be. Is this a screw comedy? Is this a romantic comedy? Is this a supernatural comedy? If director Richard Quine got stuck in one approach, the film could be even better and more memorable.
