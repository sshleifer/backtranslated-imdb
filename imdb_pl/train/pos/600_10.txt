Michael Bowen plays an innocent young man who hitchhikes a thousand miles to visit his absent father millionaire (terrifying Ray Wise) on a vast ranch powered by a windmill and ends up entangled in a dangerous network of his young, intriguing and seductive stepmother from hell (delicious Clare Wren) , causing trouble for an already dysfunctional family. An annoyed, stylish and exciting drama that has not received any promotion and was sent directly to VHS and cable television - where I saw it for the first time. It is beautifully written, elegantly made and closely related to the script that makes you bite your nails. I can not believe that reviewers who did not like it had ever seen it. It's an undiscovered classic.
