This is my favorite of three movies about bears to care for. Once again, I liked all the songs. The biggest problem, however, as most people have pointed out, is that this story is contradictory to the original. For those who saw the first recall of the film, bears met their "cousins", whom they apparently never knew. Of course, it was not until the end that the cousins ​​received the belly symbols after proving how much they cared. In this story, however, cousins ​​grow up with care bears and have always had belly symbols. Saying this is not a bad movie as long as you keep it separate from the first one. I thought Darkheart was much more evil than Santa's first. But at the same time I felt that it added some balance to the sweetness of the care bear. I also liked the fact that some of us care, although I know that other people had mixed feelings about this scene. And of course I loved the songs. My favorites are growing up and always young. Videos about caring for bears have always had such good songs. Ten stars for a very good movie.
