Warning: contains spoilers. <br /> <br /> Open your eyes <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie and you do not plan to do it, just stop reading here and accept my word. You must see this movie. So far, I've seen it four times and I still have not decided what exactly happened in the film. That's all I'll say, because if you have not seen this movie, stop reading right now. <br /> <br /> If you are still reading, I will ask you a few questions and maybe if someone has any answers that you can send me by email and let me know what you think. <br /> <br /> I remember my English teacher from grade 11 quite well. His name was Mr. Krisak. For me he was smart outside of his years and he always had this cruel way of teaching things that you may not have been so eager for. If we did not like Shakespeare, he transformed this story into a modern romance with modern language so that we could understand it. Our class room was never a room, it was a cottage and we were at the lake reading a book in our spare time. It was his own, indelible way of marking something in our sponge minds. <br /> <br /> I start this review of Vanilla Sky from the description of this genius man, because he once gave us a task that was heavily etched in my mind, like the phone number of a long-lost best friend, and finally made sense to me after seeing the Matrix . If I did not know better, I would think that the Wachowski brothers were really a pseudonym for my teacher, Mr. Krisak. But by giving them the benefit of doubt, we'll assume it was not him. But this was the first time that this task was more than imperceptible. <br /> <br /> He asked us to prove to him that they are real. Show me how you can say that you are real. This made the class throw away all the usual ideas that you can certainly imagine. Everything, from pain, through the sense of touch, to the sense of loss of hunger, was thrown out to our teacher to prove him that we are real. After each scenario we gave him, he returned with one answer that would allow us to be speechless. <br /> <br /> "And what if you are nothing other than the dream of someone else?" <br /> <br /> And if you were someone else's dream? What a confused question. It was a question / scenario put to us about 15 years ago, before the astronomical use of the Internet and fast computer development. How is it possible that it would seem then? But if you look at today's technology, ask yourself now what was part of someone else's sleep. <br /> <br /> Another brilliant but surreal movie this year, David Lynch's Mulholland Drive explored similar areas. But Vanilla Sky goes deeper than any other movie she can hope for. In short, it's one movie that literally (if you let it) blow you up with all the possibilities that surround you. <br /> <br /> Open your eyes. <br /> <br /> Tom Cruise is played by David Aames, a young, hot shot, right, self-publisher and owner of several magazines. He inherited it from his father, and although he has talent and business knowledge, his board of governors, the Seven Dwarves, thinks he is a rich diner born with a silver spoon in his mouth. They think he has done nothing to deserve the pinnacle of success that everyone thinks is right. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, we meet one of David's great toys, named Julie Gianni, played by the pernicious but bombastic perfection of Cameron Diaz. David and Julie play a good game, both claim that they are there to use each other and are not interested in a monogamous, committed relationship. This is a type of relationship commensurate with David's other shots he had in the sexual life force. And although both say a good game, we can say that only one really tells the truth. <br /> <br /> Then we meet Brian Shelby, who plays the genius of good friend Kevin Smith, Jason Lee. Brian writes a book that David intends to publish, but they are also very good friends. This is something that David has very little in his life and you can feel the real concern for yourself at the beginning of the movie. Brian has one famous line that constantly repeats to David. And it is "sweet is not so sweet without bitter". He goes on to tell him that one day he will find true love, not just that half-time part-time lover who seems to be doing with all the floozy that inhabit his bed for a night or two. <br /> <br /> On David's big birthday bash (so big that Steven Spielberg wishes him all the best) Brian comes in with his date, Sofia Sorrano, played by Penelope Cruz of course with what has to be the best performance this year by an actress. This is bash only by invitation and at the beginning David and Sofia tend to be intrigued by each other. In a way typical of David, even though his best friend is there, he begins to flirt with Sofia. To complicate matters, Julie appears without invitation and begins to spy on David. David spends the night with Sofia, but they talk and draw caricatures. There is no bloody panky. The next day, when David leaves Sofia's apartment, Julie greets him, who offers him a ride, and from there ....... well, I think we've all seen advertising. <br /> <br /> That's all I really want to say about the story, because from here the movie teases us with what is reality and what is the blurred perception. We present the character played by Kurt Russel and several other suspicious characters who play a role in this maze like a haze. There is an undertone of death and a possible panacea-like medicine that may or may not create the possibility of eternal life. This is just one of the intriguing possibilities that the film offers us, but it does not end there. <br /> <br /> How many movies seem to thrive today, this movie has a secret. The sixth sense could start this madness, but look further and maybe you can thank Angel Heart for starting the madness. No matter where he came from, Vanilla Sky has one of his hidden gutter. And what makes it so funny is that the movie gives you a lot of obvious tips along the way, but not enough to give you an overbearing solution to the problem of truth and lies you have just given up. I've seen this movie four times and every time because I want to see if there's something more that I can pick up, something that I can understand. In order to be able to work with the mind in the theater, in order to enable him to open himself up to new possibilities, he is something rare in the film. All so-called "best pictures of the year" were good, but nothing spectacular. They lack substance. The beautiful mind was intriguing, but flat, Royal Tenenbaums was interesting but uneven. Vanilla Sky is a rarity because it's a movie that makes you miss even more satisfaction, because the movie and those that made him care about it. I know that this film has received mixed reviews, but I think that those who do not like it do not quite understand it. <br /> <br /> That's what movie making should look like. Here's what the movie should do to you. It's supposed to make you feel something. Most of the other films this year are just empty spaces. This is not. <br /> <br /> 10 of 10 Best movie of the year. I'd like to see him get the best photo nomination and would like to see Cruz for the best actress, Diaz for the best support, Cruise for Best Actor and Jason Mewes should be the shoe for the best supporting actor. Cameron Crowe should also be there. None of this can happen, and it's a shame. This is one movie that can not be missed. <br /> <br /> And finally, I'm pretty sure that Mr. Krisak would like this movie and maybe this is the only movie that can answer his question. Can you prove that you are real? Are we just a figment of someone's imagination? Are we artificially transplanted for someone else? It's a movie that raises more questions than answers. And I'm sure he's okay with it. <br /> <br /> Open your eyes
