Being a fan of Andy Goldsworthy's art and having a few of his books, I had some expectations as to what I would see. I got something completely satisfying and a little more than I expected. Being an artist (I work in clay), finding inspiration in our environment to create a good art is necessary and it is something that Andy Goldsworth has mastered. Following him throughout the year, the director gives spontaneous energy, skills and dedication to artists, combining them with nature through a dramatic, inspiring style. The music for the film is overwhelming and intoxicating. If you are an artist in need of inspiration, or whoever needs a sublime experience, SEE THIS FILM. First of all, I'm glad Andy is out there. Creating, dancing, struggling with the forces of nature to make our world more beautiful.
