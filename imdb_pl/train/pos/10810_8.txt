A very nice movie. It stays in your memory. It's better to announce an affair than flying or war, although the flying parts are realistic and almost flawless. Flying enthusiasts like me will enjoy this movie, even if they are attracted by planes, unless they are uninterested or have never been in love. <br /> <br /> Funny watching early Crowe. It is good and exudes charm. His reading of "High Flight" is great. <br /> <br /> cheers, Boom
