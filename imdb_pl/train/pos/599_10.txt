I really liked this movie because acting was true honesty. Writing was at the highest level. James Arness is a great actor and he showed it here. Brian Keith was too old to be Davy Crockett and could anyone really play Davy, but Fess Parker? who led Mexico through stormy times. <br /> <br /> While some may think that the movie was at a slow pace, captured the battle that has developed, a lot of boredom, and then a few hours of terrifying terror. <br /> What impressed me the most was thinking about the cause and how some people are willing to die for what they believe. Nowadays, when nobody means anything, I found it refreshing, I think that there was a time when people were dying for freedom, no matter how you feel in the politics of that time.
