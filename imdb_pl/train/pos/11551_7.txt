UNKNOWN PARA (3+ out of 5 stars) <br /> <br /> Like most people, I will always think that Jack Klugman and Tony Randall are definitely "Strange couple". Their amazing work in the television series from the early to mid-1970s was at that time a highwater sign for television ... easily exceeding the stage and screen versions of the story. However, how can you go wrong with the pairing of Jack Lemmon / Walter Matthau? Matthau is in a particularly good shape as Oscar, slob. Lemmon got used to Felix a bit, especially if you've seen Tony Randall's outstanding achievements before. The script is good ... definitely the best Neil Simon. (I will record here as saying that Neil Simon is probably one of the worst, most overvalued playwrights of American theater.) The plot is simple: Felix, a neat freak and newly separated from his wife, introduces himself to an Oscar, a slob who needs help in saving money for child support. Their vivid arrangement is also reminiscent of a marriage culminating in funny tiffy and spats. A lot of fun and some great liners.
