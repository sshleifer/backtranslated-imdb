Okay, so it's coming a few weeks later, but it's here. This is mainly due to statements about various negative natures. Starting from technology. When Star Trek: TOS worked, the special effects technology was extremely low, and what's more, the crew had little money to make all kinds of correct mockups. Within 35 years of the premiere of TOS, the Star Trek team has become an expert in the field of economics. <br /> <br /> They finally decided, quite rightly, to give up the look of TOS and reverse engineering TNG et all. And what if they decide that they will not do the transporter with a golden glow or make the phase guns look closer to those of Star Trek II? When it comes to picking out the first touch of the Klingon Empire, it was supposed to be based on the comments of Kirk and Riker that the Earth met the Klingons only in the year 2200. Nothing has been determined. <br /> <br /> The Enterprise gives us the most promising place of exploration we have seen for some time. That's how Voyager COULD was. No series can evolve without a few inconsistencies, but be grateful that Star Trek has so little. So stop having fun and enjoy.
