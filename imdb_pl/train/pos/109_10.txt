This is a film for those who believe that cinema is the seventh art, not entertainment. Lars von Trier creates the atmosphere of the post-war Germany noir completely captivating. You go to sleep and let go only at the final loan. The plot is in second place, but it is still a thrilling story with difficult issues. Just great.
