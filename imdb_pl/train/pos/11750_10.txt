I saw it in the theater in 1986 and fell out of my chair laughing more than once. "Beirut" ... "What do you know about Beirut?" ... "Beirut ... is the best damn baseball he has ever lived." <br /> <br /> You know how it will end, but it's great fun there. The training scenes are very fun, but the best scene may be the one where Jack and Reno are trying to watch the match of Monday's Falcons football against Vikings while trying a make-up dinner with their wives. <br /> <br /> It seems that Williams and Russell are having a great time with it, which is a pity that it is overlooked as a first-class comedy.
