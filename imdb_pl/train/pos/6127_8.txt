Jack Frost talks about a serial killer who was sentenced to death. On the way to the death sentence, the prison truck in which he rides collides with a chemical tanker filled with a chemical substance that turns particles into snow on the ground, turning it into a snowman. Sam, as an assassin, would turn him into a snowman's killer. Jack wants to get revenge on the sheriff who caught him. Jack is now starting his craze again by killing people in a small town. <br /> <br /> I do not think Jack Frost has a chance to become a classic of horror movies, but it's a fun movie. Just hold your brain and enjoy it, but just do not take it too seriously.
