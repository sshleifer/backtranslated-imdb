Probably one of the funniest movies in the world. Oscar material. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are fun and before you see this, I suggest you see "South Park", one of the funniest cartoons. Buy it, you'll laugh every time you see it. A pure stroke of genius. If you do not think it's funny, you have no soul or sense of humor. 10 out of 10.
