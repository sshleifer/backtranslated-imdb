It was a great introduction for me to the talents and beauty of Marion Davies. In this film is not only great, but also fun. (I believe that Lucille Ball could model his later career on the style of Davies, which can be called "wild beauty.") The direction of Vidor is light but confident, the story is of course chestnut, but the acting is wonderfully modern and the element for watching celebrities for fans quiet era, with many episodes, adds overall fun. It combines elements of a slapstick with an adult drama and an old, good, timeless romance. For all movie fans who have a reflexive reaction to watching silent movies, sit on one of them and this may change your attitude. <br /> <br />
