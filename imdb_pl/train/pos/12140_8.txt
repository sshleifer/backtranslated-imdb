Somerset Classical Maugham about a film about an obsessive love of a young man who is abused and humiliated by the object of his obsession to such an extent that he loses everything he needs to find true love in the end under the most unusual circumstances. <br /> <br /> Leslie Howard plays the role of Philip Carey, a sensitive young artist in Paris who is trying to make a living selling his paintings. Told by a local art expert that his work is not good enough to be sold to the public, Philip decides to return to his native England and study medicine and become a doctor to help others. <br /> <br /> Filip born with a club foot is very sensitive to his awkward condition and makes up for it, being a very nice and friendly person. One afternoon, Philip is in a local cafe with another medical student and notices the beautiful waitress Mildred Rogers, Bette Davis, and falls in love with her immediately. Initially, Mildred rejects Philip, who is sick to love, but later realizes how much juice he is using. Mildred devoted himself to poverty by buying presents and taking her to the theater every time she leaves work. Phlip also lags behind his studies, paying so much attention to Mildred, to a medical university, and fails to pass final exams. <br /> <br /> Going in the buttocks buying an engagement ring for Mildred, trying to get her hand in marriage, cold heart Mildred tells surprised Filip that she is already engaged to Emil Miller, Alan Hale. It turns out that he is one of the customers of the cafe, with whom he always flirts. <br /> <br /> Filip broke down and the sick heart slowly regained his life, and later receives his medical examination and passes it on, and at the same time finds a new love in Nora, Fay Johnson, a writer of local love magazine. Then Philip's shock and surprise Mildred returns to his life. <br /> <br /> Mildred told Philip that her husband Emil, whose child was with him, threw her out of the house, having a kind and understanding Philip, who took her away at the expense of Nora, who was very much in love with him. Later on, it turns out that Mildred was not married to Emil, but he had an illegitimate child with a forbidden affair with him! It turned out that Emil was already married. <br /> <br /> As before, Mildred uses Philip's kind heart for her and her daughter, where she supports them with medical care and shelter, until she flushes again and can not continue her education until she leaves Philip; after a very hot and emotional meeting with him. In the streets where there is nowhere to go, Philip takes over Mr. Athanly, Reginald Owens, whom he once treated in the hospital and falls in love with his daughter Sally, Frances Dee. <br /> <br /> Later Philip has an improved club footing at the medical center and with the help of Mr. Athenly returns to being a doctor. Then he meets Mildreda again, who is really at the end of his rope. Dying of tuberculosis and losing a daughter, she is completely alone, no one takes care of her. Philip, now well done and respected in medical circles, does everything in his power to help the sick and poor Mildred, but eventually succumbs to his illness and dies. <br /> <br /> Mildred had love and devotion in Philip for all these years he was in love with her, but decided to abuse him and have an affair with a man who was like her, cold, insensitive and selfish. In the end, Mildred regained what she gave to a nice and sensitive Philip: she became both unloved and alone. Philip found everything Mildred was in sweet and caring Sally, and finally found the true love he had been looking for all his life.
