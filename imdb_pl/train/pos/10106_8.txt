After "Aakrosh" it was the second film for Govinda Nihalani as a director. There were no documentaries in India for this film. This movie has proved that the document can meet the requirements of a commercial movie without weakening its essence. It was one of the successful films in the year in which it was released. This movie has challenged the big bollywood banners, such as "COOLIE", "BETAAB", "HERO" in 1983. <br /> <br /> SmithaPatel, in this movie, acted more like the hero's conscience, as soon as he sailed or lost his temper, she was there to remind him. She was not like an ordinary heroine who used to run on trees and shrubs. She once gave up on love, when the hero's ruthlessness touched the roof. <br /> <br /> There was another character in this movie, which was played by contemporary Om Puri, Naseeruddin Shah. He played as an inspector who became an alcoholic. The role conveyed the news about the final result of an honest policeman who rubbed the wrong side of the system, which also gave viewers a chance to predict the end of the hero. <br /> <br /> In his debut film Sadashiv, Amrapurkar captivated the audience with his episodic role, which ultimately brought him the best supporting actor. he was not a complete, simple personality that he was able to adapt to the system. Anger, which he left in the middle, was continued in another film by Govinda Nihalani "Drohkaal". Even after two decades, this film is remembered only because of the director and the entire crew. Each of them played his role par excellence.
