This is a rare opportunity when I want to watch the movie again. "The Amati Girls" is a movie. I would have stayed longer in cinemas in the old days. Was this story autobiographical for the scriptwriter / director? He has the aura of reality. <br /> <br /> All stellar heroes depict their characters reliably and with tenderness. Who would not want Mercedes Ruehl to be an older sister? I love her work from "For Roseanna". <br /> <br /> In the case of most films, belief is suspended because we know that it is the work of actors, producers, directors, sound technicians, etc. It was difficult to suspend such faith in "The Amati Girls". I feel that part of this family! How I wanted to defend Dolores when her family suppresses emotional life. And I wanted to cheer on Lee Grant, who criticizes Cloris Leachman's hair color. Humor in its entirety is not a humor of laughter on the stomach, but it has a good frame of mind that satisfies much more than pratfalls and such. <br /> <br /> Love, which is presented in this family of cinema, is to be imitated and nurtured. <br /> <br /> It is no coincidence that the name Amati translated from Italian means "loved ones".
