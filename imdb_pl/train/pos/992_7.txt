I did not have any expectations; I've never heard of Jamie Foxx; I only knew that there are strong actors in the film. I thought it was very funny; it was fun. The plot was different and unpredictable enough to interest me. For me, Foxx is the original. David Morse is wonderful (true, this is not his best role). I thought that chases and pyrotechnics contributed to the creation of the film and were well made. I did not expect much and I was surprised.
