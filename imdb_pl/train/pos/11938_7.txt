I like such films for their spirit, without words. It's a decent, clean movie about a baseball team that's lagging behind, and a young fan wants them to win because his inept father said it was the only way he would come back for him. <br /> <br /> The spirit shines in two ways: a funny cast with Danny Glover and young Josep Gordon-Levitt and the heavenly herald of Al, adopting the dynamic form of Christopher Lloyd. It's an energetic movie. It makes you smile and really engage in this sport. <br /> <br /> This is my problem. The only thing that torments me are the sports videos that make you become an unexpected team fan. There's nothing wrong with it. It's just weird that I should leave the movie, thinking that Angels are a strong, cool team, when my basic loyalty is in Toronto Blue Jays. It's really interesting. If it's just a movie about a weaker team of children, that's good.
