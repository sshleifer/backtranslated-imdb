This Belgian film directed by Tom Barman, the singer of the well-known dEUS band, will not be favored by everyone. For the simple reason that there is no clear story or story. This film shows 24 hours in the "city" (here Antwerp) and allows you to watch and really enjoy dialogue, direction, humor (Dario !, osteopata Bruno !, ...) and tragic (Windman, Paul Garcin, ...) characters . <br /> <br /> There are some unforgettable scenes: Windman on the beach, dance party at the end, fan KISS, Windman visits osteopath, ... <br /> <br /> Of course, some other viewers did not understand what is so beautiful and interesting in this movie. They complain that this movie has no history, etc. But it's the atmosphere that makes you watch and pull you into it. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it yet, be sure to listen carefully to the music. The soundtrack is unusual, like Tom Barman and his dEUS group. <br /> <br /> And "ssst, mondje dicht h√©." (do not tell anyone)
