Twenty-five years ago, I showed this film in some Entomology children's activities and I still remember the emotions of children; they were enchanted! It's not just about termites that they built and live in "clay castles" but also about other animals that use mounds. There is a fantastic scene in which the cobra fights with the monitor lizard while the mongoose colony is watching. This is not only good for entomological classes, but also for teaching about ecology, because there is so much about interactions between termites and other organisms and about the ecology of all organisms living in and around mounds. <br /> <br /> I would like it to be available on DVD so that I can view it and show it to others.
