James Michener's books, taking readers to distant places with strange-sounding names, were probably the most popular in the 1940s and 1950s. His stories about the South Pacific have become Broadway's main hit for Rodgers and Hammerstein. The South Pacific was directed by Joshua Logan and was the natural creator of the film adaptation of Michener's next success, Sayonar. <br /> <br /> It was only a decade earlier that American films during the Second World War did not show the Japanese kindly. I am sure that for people who fought in the Pacific War, it was not easy to change their attitude during the night. This and general policy of brotherhood with occupied peoples is not at all the heart of this story about inter-racial affairs. <br /> <br /> Sayonara is an important movie today. The military has always been involved in the personal life of its staff in a way that no civilian employer could legally escape. In America, when Sayonara was filmed, there were still laws on non-compliance in many states. Today, gays in the army are a serious problem. Someone may film Sayonara's movie one day. <br /> <br /> Joshua Logan was on known territory. The South Pacific also had racism as a component of its conspiracy. With a hand, Logan collected a great cast and made a beautiful story. <br /> <br /> Marlon Brando, Patricia Owens, James Garner, Kent Smith, some random players do a great job. But the picture was stolen by orientalists. Miko Taka beautifully hits the brand because he is interested in Brando's love. But the real stars are the two that support both the Oscars of players, Red Buttons and Miyoshi Umeki. <br /> <br /> Buttons are your team member who became a member of the team. Passionately falls in love with Katsumim, played by Miyoshi Umeki. They get married, and the army cruelly does everything in their power to break them down. They assume that I KNOW what is best for Buttons and Umeki. Buttons was a television comedian and a good talent, but he never had such a good role as the rest of his career. <br /> <br /> Oskar Miyoshi Umeki was the first to receive the Oriental. He was interested because Miyoshi appeared on Broadway at Flower Drum Song during the Oscars. I had the honor of seeing him on Broadway, it was the first Broadway show I've ever seen. I still remember it. <br /> <br /> This Oscar also symbolized something else. Our war with Japan was really over and we saw a wonderful nation in Sayonara with a proud tradition and culture. <br /> <br /> Ricardo Montalban plays Nakamura, actor of the Kabuki Theater. If Sayonara ended today, Logan would never have succeeded. But Montalban is doing well. <br /> <br /> Good location photography and great history. This film should be discouraged more often, it has a great moral.
