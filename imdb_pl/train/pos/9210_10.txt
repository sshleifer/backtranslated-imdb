I feel it's one of the best movies I've ever seen, I'm an older man and I love most of the westerns. I love movies based partly on facts, if I'm not mistaken, it's a movie. I also like revenge movies, which also qualifies, in my opinion. Some of my favorite parts of the movie were the starting scene with the scene of flagging and barn shooting. I felt that the scene of overcoming the farm is a bit exaggerated, but it does not affect how I feel about the whole movie. I saw what I think is a continuation of this film in the smoke episode of a firearm. I also liked it. I recommend taking the time to watch this movie, I will watch it again. I also felt that the love affairs of this movie were well done. I thought Randy Travis did not play with character, but I always like his game.
