Yes, sure. Sammo Hung was already in the lead role in "Zu Warrios from the Magic Mountain" from 1983. Now, 2001, he does it again with "Zu Warriors". But this time it does it well. He is rarely seen in wuxii, more often in the classic Eastern or criminal slapstock. But this role just fits him! The ancient Chinese legend about the mountain zu is not often depicted in films (as far as I know about films translated to the west). The legend, however, contains many interesting stories and possibilities. He said simply: you have not seen any history in a modern movie yet! And that makes it great! And wow: all colors plus an incredibly deep, good-sounding story that makes you fall into this movie at this point. When I first saw it, I had to watch it immediately and I did it. OK, I did not understand it all the first time. But it only improves! You know, you did not understand all this because there's so much spice in it! That's why it's a pleasure to watch it over and over again. And so, deeper and deeper in your heart, the more you watch it. <br /> <br /> Summary: the story you love, the characters you cry with and really: a movie you will never forget! - Note to editors: well, I think I have to watch it again: D
