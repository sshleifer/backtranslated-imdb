I just saw jail yesterday and I liked what I saw. It was a fun movie. The guy looked great on Bike.He looked good in this movie compared to other of his latest movies. It's quite good now. . I would not call it the best movie, but it is still a good movie. <br /> <br /> But he also had his share in the problems. The first of them was the way in which the missiles flew everywhere, and even when they were fired in a spotty empty field, they did not hit the target. Another problem I had was the way the students cursed. I do not know in which school students can swear in front of their teacher and even in the classroom. The third problem was that the bad were very few. There should be more bad guys. The last problem was certainly the fact that the set looked trashy, but it resulted from a small budget. Overall, the movie was a good movie. I liked. I recommend to others to watch it. P.S. Now you are a DEAD beat cop. (Some One-liners were also cool) <br /> <br />
