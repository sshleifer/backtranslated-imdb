If you want serious laughter, watch this movie and the things that Bruce asks his friend. Deleted scenes are invaluable. I do not know why they did not put them in the original film. It can not be because of the time, because the movie lasts only 101 minutes. Morgan Freeman is a brilliant actor who has not been noticed for too long. Jim Carrey needs medicine!
