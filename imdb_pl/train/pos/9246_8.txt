One of the biggest secrets of life, suffering every day, is that pretty girls are so much more interested in jerks and heels than nice guys. <br /> <br /> Worse, when nice guys even want to marry these girls, girls WILL FREELY prefer jerking and heels, even after the jerks and heels showed their contempt, they showed that they are simply interested in using girls. <br /> <br /> Stu Erwin is a nice guy who is still nice after lying and cheating, and even after losing the girl completely. <br /> <br /> Clark Gable is a jerk, and he is perfect in the role, rather a sad remark for his fans. br /> <br /> Jean Harlow turns out to be more slender Mae West, sounding even like La West in some of his cynical lines. <br /> <br /> A little mysterious is that so many other characters, I'm going to be bad guys - I mean, damn it, they're locked up, so they have to be - they're nice people, of course. <br /> <br /> In fact, there are many nice people here, people who, to a lesser extent Film or history, growl and stab me in the back, but here they go out of their way to help someone else. <br /> <br /> So maybe the story is rather banal, at least according to modern standards, but ultimately the viewer will be happy to watch. <br /> <br /> The biggest complaint I have is that so many really good actors have not received credit. Once again, we can say "Thank you" to IMDb.com.
