It must be one of the best serial killer movies I've ever seen, and it comes from someone who absolutely loved the Silence of the Lambs. HBO hit the spot here. This film is fascinating from the first moment to the end. <br /> <br /> This movie has so many topics that it's hard to say what's going on. It is a chronicle of the ten-year search for the Russian serial killer Andrei Chikatilo. Stephen Rea gives a well-reserved performance as an inexperienced forensic expert who is responsible for the investigation, and Donald Sutherland gives even more engaging performances as his cynical supervisor and the only person in the Russian government ready to help him. Both of their performances are subtle masterpieces --- Rea begins to be na√Øve and does not want to compromise while Sutherland begins to detach and is almost amused by the situation. At the end, Rea becomes weary and beaten by the system, while Sutherland is more passionate and idealistic. <br /> <br /> In every other movie I would say that Sutherland's performance stands out above the rest, but here even Jeffrey DuMann competes as the serial killer himself. DuMann genius here creates a figure that inspires rather to empathy than hatred, which, we think, we find - is a monster, but does not want to be, and we think that he is equally disgusted with what he does just like us. He is tortured, embarrassed, but also cruel. <br /> <br /> If you can take an incredibly dark subject (and it is * very * disturbing), you should see this movie.
