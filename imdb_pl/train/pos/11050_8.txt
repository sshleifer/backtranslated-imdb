Well, magic works in a mysterious way. This film about 4 prisoners, trying to escape with the help of spells, written by an elderly prisoner centuries ago, was a great occult thriller with a surprising end and a great deal of uncertainty. Even if it had a kind of theatrical game (almost everything happens in a cell), it was never boring and it worked very well. In the "Cube" tradition, you felt imprisoned with characters, and even if you were a criminal, you developed some sympathy with some of them, only to change your mind thanks to the twists and turns of the action. Some events have surprised you and it always felt crazy in the air. In total, intense and funny, and because I did not expect anything (a friend rented it), it was a positive surprise!
