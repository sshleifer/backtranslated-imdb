When you first watch this video, it's difficult to know what happened, but after the next watch it becomes more clear. I liked the movie. Dean Cain was perfect in the role of Bob. The figure of Lexi Doig was incomprehensible, at first she wanted to catch Bob, but I really believe she landed, loving him, although she broke his heart then. The Dean Cain performance was usually perfect. With each movie it gets better and better. My only question at the end of the movie concerned what happened to Bob, Camilla and the child. The decision was made by the viewer
