I read the book in the fifth grade, and now a few years later I saw the movie. There are a few differences: <br /> <br /> 1.Billy was supposed to eat 15 worms in 15 days, not 10 worms in one day until 19:00. <br/> <br /> 2.Billy is to get $ 30 after he has eaten all the worms. In the movie after Billy eats all the worms, Joe has to go to school with worms in his pants. <br /> <br /> 3. Joe aims to fake some worms, but the movie does not have it at all. <br /> <br /> Although there are changes, this movie is still one that will appeal to children.
