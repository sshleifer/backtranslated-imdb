I made you think about it for a few days after seeing it. This is a sign of a great movie for me. Eyes wide shut had the same effect on me. I'm tired of people who need these happy Hollywood endings. I'm going to see it tonight to better understand the story - but regardless of that, the emotional messages of the film were completely felt.
