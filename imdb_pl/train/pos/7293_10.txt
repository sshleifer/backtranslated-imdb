What should I say about such an absolutely beautiful film? I saw it in Atlanta, Georgia Dragoncon, considering it was my main city. I'm a science fiction fan and I like action movies. I was on my feet all night and I was ready to call it the day I noticed this movie playing in the morning. This is not a science fiction movie or an action movie. Let me start by saying that I am not a Witchblade fan or Eric Etebari, watching a few episodes (his performance seemed old and robotic). But he managed to really convince me to perform. I mean, really win me. Seeing Cellular, I did not think this guy would have much to offer. But his performance as Kasadya was simply amazing. He was extremely persuasive as a bad demon. But this character had so many details that it absolutely amazed me. Later, I checked it online and discovered that Eric won the Best Actor award, which is well deserved, given his best career and gained my respect. Now I'm still reading about this fx and the production of this project and let me just say that I did not pay attention to them (sorry Brian). They were very nicely made, but I was even more impressed by this story - which in my opinion was even more of its purpose (watching movies such as Godzilla with great effects simply scared me away). I could not sleep after this movie, which kept thinking about it in my head. The situation of an abusing family is never easy. I showed a trailer to my friend on the Internet, and she almost cried because it affected her, so living with abuses. This is one movie about which I think constantly and I highly recommend.
