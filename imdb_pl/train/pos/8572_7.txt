The first movie was cool, but it's not as good as a great animated classic, which I think is more poignant and captivating. This continuation is worse, but it is not bad at all. Sure, the slapstick is too much, the script has weak points, and the story is uninspiring. But the dogs are very cute here, and Eric Idle is as funny as a macaw. The film is pleasing to the eye with stylish pictures and eye costumes (especially Cruelli), and the music is pleasant. Acting is mostly very good, Ioan Gruffudd is attractive, and Gerard Depardieu, who gave better performances, has a great time as partner Cruella. But the best asset, as was the case with the first movie, is the amazing Glenn Close in an excellent performance over the Cruella, even more evil than before. Overall nice. 7/10 Bethany Cox
