Last week I had to see it on a plane to NZ and I wondered how it would face both the British film and the book. I must say that I was impressed. If anything, the fanatical attachment to Red Sox during the lean years works even better than the original dedication to Arsenal FC, which has been successful over the years. As a Briton, I was also interested that you do not have to understand baseball to find out what's going on. One question comes to mind - is the script written using Sox as a band before he finally broke the Bambino Curse? Was there another team in the squad? As a Red Sox fan (strange, I know, a Brit who understands baseball) I have to say that it added joy.
