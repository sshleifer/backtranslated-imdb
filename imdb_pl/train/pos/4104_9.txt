It helps if you understand the Czech language and you see it in the original language and understand Czech obsession with "The Professionals", but if not, "One ruka netlaska" is another great Czech movie. It's funny, dark and extremely pleasant. The biggest compliment I can pay for it is that you never know what's going to happen next, or even keep that feeling in the second and third watching. <br /> <br /> In a small country, the Czech Republic has created an amazing amount of world-class film and literature, from Hrabal, Hack and Kundera to films by Menzel, Sverak and many others. Czech humor is by nature dark and often uncompromising, but often with a naive and warm sentiment. This movie is just that it is unkind and deals with the less-pleasing sides of people, but under all this is a beautiful tale full of promises, good intentions and optimism. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend and most other projects in which Trojan and Machacek are involved. Enjoy it, it's a movie made just because of it - anyway, as close as the Czechs will ever get to write a really happy ending ...
