Why did it sound like her husband was still calling her Appy? It ruined a great episode, so I can only give it 6. The right grammar and pronunciation are necessary for the film. <br /> <br /> It was very Hellraiser, which with the whole skin tearing apart, although I do not know how anyone can survive without skin, the skin is an important organ for the organism, which is the largest organ actually and without which we would die. The more horror is real, the more terrifying and funny it can be. <br /> <br /> I admit, however, that the stories of great horror directors are very disappointing and very average. <br /> <br /> 6/10 come to the Yankies, pick up your English!
