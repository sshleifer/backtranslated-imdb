Do NOT judge this production for a 2-hour version that was released on VHS in the United States, which is a chaotic and incomprehensible mess. I had the pleasure of watching a full-length 6-hour version available on DVD from the UK and I was charmed. The intentional pace and growing sense of danger are hypnotizing, as are the amazing visual and sound landscape; it is an ancient Rome that we have never seen before, and much more authentic than most. <br /> <br /> The director Franco Rossi was rightly celebrated for his Odyssey mini-series from 1968. Just as Bekim Fehmiu became the best Ulysses on the screen, Klaus Maria Brandauer can be the best Nero on the screen. I hope one day I will see the Rossie version of The Aeneid (Eneide), which was broadcast on Italian television in 1971. <br /> <br /> I am undecided about which version of QUO VADIS is a more efficient miniserial from 2001; everyone has different virtues and complements in many ways. Certainly one of them dominates over this Hollywood camp with the participation of Peter Ustinov.
