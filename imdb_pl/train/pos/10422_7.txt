Of course, Mario Lanza is "The Great Caruso" in a 1951 movie starring Ann Blyth, Dorothy Kirsten, Eduard Franz and Ludwig Donath. It is a highly fictionalized biography of the legendary, world-renowned tenor whose name is known even today. <br /> <br /> The movie is staged, and the music is great and beautifully sung by LanzÄ™, Kirsten, Judmila Novotna, Blanche Thebom and other opera stars that appeared in the film. If you're a purist, seeing people on stage, smiling at Sextet of "Lucii", will make a strange impression - even if Caruso's wife, Dorothy, had a daughter. It is also highly unlikely that Caruso would ever sing Edgardo in Lucia; the role was too high for him. <br /> <br /> Taking a dramatic license, the script omits some very dramatic parts of Caruso's life. What was so unusual in him was the fact that he was in fact creating roles in operas that are now in the standard repertoire, but never mentioned in the film. These roles are Maurizio in Adrian Lecouvreur and Dick Johnson in "Girl of the Golden West". His picture is known with a sheet wrapped around him like a toga. Reason for this photo? His only shirt was in the laundry room. He was one of the pioneers of music recordings and collaborated with the Victor Talking-Machine Company (later RCA Victor). He sang Jose in Carmen in San Francisco on the night of the earthquake. <br /> <br /> Instead, MGM's story basically made him die on stage during Martha's performance, which never happened. He had a hemorrhage at "L'Elisir d'amore" in Met and could not finish the show; he sang three times in Met, and his last role as Eleazar in La Juive. What killed him? Same thing that killed Valentino - peritonitis. His first role in Met was not Radames in Aida, as indicated in the film, but the prince in Rigoletto. So, when the screen appears "suggested by the biography of her husband Dorothy Caruso", it was - it was suggested. It is true that Dorota's father renounced her marriage and left $ 1 on his massive estate. They also had a daughter, Gloria (who died aged 79 on 7.07.2007). However, Caruso had four other children from his mistress before he married Dorothy. <br /> <br /> Some say Lazy's voice is very similar to Caruso's voice, but just listen to Caruso singing in the movie "Match Point" - Caruso's voice is extraordinary as opposed to Lisa's voice. In fact, with his sound, if he wanted to, Caruso could sing as a baritone. It is believed that he had trouble with high notes, another proof of penchant for baritone; and the role he was preparing when he died was Othello, a dramatic tenor role that Lanza definitely was not. Lisa's voice did not deserve a comparison with another. He made a unique contribution to the history of the film, popularizing opera music. He sings music in "The Great Caruso" with strong energy; he is really at the peak of his short career. His acting is natural and real. Ann Blyth is cute like Dorothy and she sings a little. <br /> <br /> Really a movie for fans of Lazy operas and fans, which are probably one and the same.
