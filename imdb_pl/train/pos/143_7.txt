Riget II is a good continuation, but not as good as the first one. This series does not seem to be as serious as the first one. There's a lot more comedy in it, good. <br /> <br /> We return to the Danish Rigshospitalet, a Danish national hospital. Mrs. Drusse is just coming out of the hospital because her work is done, but her destiny wants it differently. Soon the ghosts chase, and Helmer does all the madness and soon it will be worse when the black powers are released in the Kingdom. <br /> <br /> This story is associated with a much larger comedy than the previous one. It means a lot of fun, but it makes the series a bit less serious. History has preserved many elements from the last series and added some new ones. It's well written, but some of the new elements are simply stupid, but they save them, making them more comedy. Good story, but not as good, original and thrilling as in the first series. <br /> <br /> The actors are the same with some addition to the usual cast. They are all very good. It's a strange story and setting. Some parts are a complete show of idiosyncrasies, and the heroes change during the show, so keeping it serious and keeping it is not an easy task. However, these actors are perfectly capable of dealing with this whole situation. <br /> <br /> Many good features from the first series remain intact. Cinematography is one of these features. The hand-held camera that made Trier famous all over the world gives the series tension and reality. It gives the camera a unique ability to move and follow characters, and Trier uses these skills. Well, movement, great lightning and good composition and editing make watching pleasant. <br /> <br /> Get ready to see the better effect in the part that in the first. Prepare for more too. I did not think this green thing looked good. I thought it was unoriginal and does not fit. Nevertheless, effects like ghosts are really good. Non-decimal effects also look good. Little Brother looks really strange, but you accept it. I would say that the effects are from OK to good. <br /> <br /> Music is also quite good. Moody and nice. Some of them are really moving. It fits really nice. As the first one there is not enough music in the action scenes and it works very well. <br /> <br /> Everything together creates a good continuation. If you've seen Riget, you can see it without disappointment. It has many of the same features as the first series. However, I recommend watching the first series before watching it. These two form a series that you do not want to miss.
