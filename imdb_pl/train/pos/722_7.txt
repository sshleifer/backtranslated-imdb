The biggest cult classic of Roger Corman, producer of films b and c, was the Ramones (originally intended for Cheap Trick), Rock N 'Roll High School. It's just a simple, technically outdated story (but it would be good to have an extra dose of nostalgic humor, considering that these were the things that made Napoleon Dynamite heroes funny - see Eaglebauer's van) about teenagers who love rock n 'roll. <br/> <br /> The students of Vince Lombardi High School face the resistance of the evil director, Miss Evelyn Togar (played by iconic favorite Mary Woronov), who is afraid that Rock N 'Roll turns children into uncontrollable, amoral deviations and marriages Rock N 'collision-free zone. Actually, he's going to erase Rock N 'Roll for all students, regardless of whether he's in school, and he's working with the majority of adults who can make the plan work. <br /> <br /> But not if Riff Randell (PJ Soles) can help. Ramones fanatics, she wrote several songs (including Rock N 'Roll High School) that she wants to hand over to Ramones, and by trying to do so, she is rejected by Miss Togar, who is doing everything to stop her from going and see Ramones playing in the city. The culmination is the final rebellion between outdated, hating adults and teenagers (at the end resembling somewhat Over the Edge). After years of punk, when the fame of garage rockers, The Ramones (and others) would mean another change in the evolution of music, it was great to see a movie that celebrated all this in such a humorous and exaggerated way. <br /> <br /> It's mostly a gentle comedy, but it's still a great comedy when you're in the mood for something more laid back to entertain you. Jerry Zucker (from fame Airplane) and Joe Dante (from fame Gremlins) are taking part in some directors, you can figure out what kind of humor you do (and not to mention, expect Dick) Miller even if only for a few minutes in the final movie) . The story later had to inspire (and was consistently updated) by a comedy from the mid-90s, Detroit Rock City, in which some minor character changes in the vehicle for older rockers, Kizz. <br /> <br /> I recommend handing the vehicle to Corey Feldman, Rock N 'Roll High School Forever, released almost ten years later. The original is still the best.
