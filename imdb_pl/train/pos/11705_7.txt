Of course, there was not a big budget for this movie, which definitely hampered production. But the history and ending were so brutal that they made up much. I mean brutal on the level of Ju Dou and other (great) Chinese films. I saw it for the first time when I was 14, I ran home and begged God to forgive me everything ...
