Japanese cyber-punk films have never done much for me, but from the handful I've seen, most of them were at least visually interesting and at least mostly entertaining. MEATBALL MACHINE is no exception. <br /> <br /> The story tells about the species of parasites that take over human hosts, take control over their bodies, turn them into "necrophytes" and cause them to fight each other The only purpose of eating each other - apparently as a "game" for joys from the aforementioned parasites. The film focuses mainly on the shy guy and the gala who fall apart, but whose romance is interrupted by both parasitic infections and forced fighting. It becomes a test of the human will and control of the parasite over their physical bodies ... <br /> <br /> MEATBALL MACHINE will always be compared to TETSUO (like most cyber-punk movies) and for good reason. There are definitely thematic parallels, although the films are definitely different. There is a lot of fun, moments splattery in MEATBALL MACHINE, and creatures / borg FX are definitely the most important - a mix of TETSUO-meets-GWAR, which are both sophisticated and imaginative. Depending on your preference for these types of movies, MEATBALL MACHINE may be yours or not. If you like hyperkinetic cyber-punk movies with a healthy dose of splatter - this one is for you ... 7/10
