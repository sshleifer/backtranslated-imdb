I always liked Johnny Concho and I would like this movie to be on VHS and DVD. Frank Sinatra gives one of the most remarkable performances in his career in this career. <br /> <br /> When we meet Frank in the title role for the first time, he is the brother of a notorious rifleman who is currently out of town. The brother is making fear in the heart of the city, and Frank makes the most of it to intimidate the city's inhabitants in its shadow. Only Phyllis Kirk has a feeling for him. She is the daughter of shopkeeper Wallace Ford and Dorothy Adams. <br /> <br /> Two other marksmen come to William Conrad and Christopher Dark and it turns out that Conrad killed Brother Sinatra and comes to his city to take over. They humiliate Sinatra and lead him out of the city. Kirk follows him. <br /> <br /> From day to day Sinatra changes from punk to coward and becomes a man looking for a spine. It's a good performance, almost as good as his Oscar-nominated role in the movie The Man with the Golden Shoulder. It's a shame for some reason that it has not been visible for years. <br /> <br /> Two other important performances are Keenan Wynn as a former gunslinger who turned to a preacher who helps Sinatra find what he needs to oppose Conrad and Darek. And then there is Conrad in what I think was his role on the screen. He is a villain of incredible hostility, pure evil incarnate walking and talking on a silver screen. <br /> <br /> However, at Johnny Concho I like the climax, unforgettable, in which Conrad and Dark will cope. Let's say I believe that Johnny Concho was MGM's response to High Noon and the foundation for what you do when evil causes a breakdown in all laws and orders.
