As well as previous posters, the true Rockstar stars: INXS - or rather its continuation, Rockstar: Supernova - are Paul Mirkovich, Rafael Moreira, Jim McGorman, Nate Morton and Sasha Krivtsov. You do not know who they are? They are an amazing, crazy rock band House Band, whose musical talent and talent made this concert more than just a sad American Idol clone. <br /> <br /> Do you remember the night of "strings"? It was musical precision and perfection if I ever saw it. Epic version of Suzie McNeil "Bohemian Rhapsody" Queen, memorable cover "You Can not Always Get ..." You Taylor, JD Fortune singing "Suspicious Minds". The common denominator is the amazing House Band. <br /> <br /> As good as INXS were in great shape, they are unfortunately a shadow of old ones, although JD's live performance breathed new life into their music, this show is about HB. <br /> <br /> Note for producers: Season three (if we are blessed enough to make it happen) should be Rockstar: House Band. Let these boys become a good vocalist and they will go to places.
