There are several spectacular, beautiful photos with diverse landscapes and animals, from arctic to tropical and everything in between. Camera techniques are diverse and involve different situations, from close-ups to aerial work. The edition is huge, and the commentary is also in place, with the right tone and a few dramatic and convincing facts about our world. Where the movie falls a bit, four topics are tried to cover and integrate - seasonal patterns, climate change, stories about individual animals and hunter / hunted interactions in many environments. In the end, everything becomes a bit weak and chaotic. In general, it's worth seeing, especially considering the issues discussed, but do not expect the Oscar material.
