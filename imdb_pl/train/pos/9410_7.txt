I liked the movie. But I was surprised to see people calling it comedy. Sometimes it was fun, but it was not really fun at all. If I expected it to be a comedy, I could be disappointed with the movie, but without any expectations it turned out that it was pleasant and engaging. Maybe because as an engineer I identified with the hero. I was less worried about the satire of capital or work, and more about the basic history of a man struggling for his invention. A man who is less interested in the monetary gain of his invention than he sees that came to fruition and was put into production. She is absolutely heroic when she refuses to take big money and a hot woman in exchange for suppressing his invention. Interestingly, people here compared it to the Jurassic Park; I compare it to The Fountainhead.
