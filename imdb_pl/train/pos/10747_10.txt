Gédéon and Jules Naudet wanted to make a documentary about newcomers from New York. What they got was the only film material in the World Trade Center on September 11. <br /> <br /> Working previously with James Hanlon's ladder company, Jules went with the captain to check and repair the gas leak, while Gédéon stayed in the fire station in case something interesting happened. The plane flying low over the city distracted Jules and aimed the camera up, a second before the plane crashed on Tower One. <br /> <br /> Jules asked the captain to follow him to the Tower. The first thing he saw was two people in the fire, something he did not want to film. He stayed in place for the next few hours, filming the reactions of firefighters and others who were there. <br /> <br /> The Naudet brothers have tried very hard to make the film not too sharp, grizzly and up. But the language of firefighters is a bit rough, and the CBS has shown that many balls float without censorship. The Naudet brothers mixed the film material they filmed during individual interviews so that firefighters can explain their thoughts and emotions in particular moments of the crisis. <br /> <br /> In contrast to the feature film of a similar title, most of the money from DVD sales goes to the charities of September 11. Very well made, emotional, moving and completely devoid of political propaganda, is the best document of this type so far.
