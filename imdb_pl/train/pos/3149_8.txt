Ever since The Simpsons debuted, a sitcom appeared, which I did not want to turn on in 2 minutes. Of course, it was said that The Simpsons killed sitcoms. But not this one. <br /> <br /> The first season was that teenage characters were not as scandalous as later. Sometimes they even went to school. Next seasons in which the character was crossed out. Eric, a sarcastic asshole, Donna, his nice girlfriend, Kelso, a faint light bulb, Hyde, a conspiracy theorist and anti-establishment punk, Fez, a pervert student, and finally Jackie, a spoiled rich swimmer. When it comes to adult characters, there was Eric's mom, a suburban mother, "Can you believe she is so upset," Eric's father, a simple arrow, which obviously was not that hard asshole, it seemed, daddy Donna and her stupid blonde mother . Everyone is faithful to their characters, but especially to Kurtwood Smith, who finds the perfect balance between endurance and still makes his Red Forman quite pleasant, not forcing us to throw in with unexpected sweetness. <br /> <br /> The main reason why this series is so good. He is a difficult character to play because he does not allow the actor to indulge in wild reloads, such as Kelso, competently played by Ashton Kutcher. I was happy to see how these two characters interact, because they are the most different. <br /> <br /> Hyde's character is a bit more difficult because it is more realistic and if we really have to see the orphan's story once again, although I will say that the writers came up with a fantastic plot for him in recent seasons. <br /> <br /> Jackie, Family Guy's dude, Guy Kunis, is hilarious and has nails on the board that actually fit her character. The only sad part is that we did not see any more scenes with her and Eric because they were ...... fun together. Too many stories have been wasted on the problems with her relationship, because we have already succeeded with Eric and Donna. <br /> <br /> In the end, I will say that the cast of hospitable actors has always been great. A few favorites: the big girl Fez in the middle of the season, Pastor Dan, an amazing Leo played by equally amazing Thomas Chong, another of Fezu girls who is completely certified and a unique appearance by the teenage witch Sabrina as a slutty Catholic girl. <br /> <br /> The next is coming on Fox, whatever.
