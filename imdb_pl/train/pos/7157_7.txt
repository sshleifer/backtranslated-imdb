This movie is a fun, funny and quality movie. The film cleverly follows the directions, if the book, and tries to keep the line exactly. All actors are appropriate and one would expect them to be part of them. They use several well-known actors that give a great effect on the film. In some parts the graphics are a bit suspicious and there are a lot of mistakes in the film. For example, there is no such thing as a yellow lizard. The camp is not as macabre as explained in the book, and rather does not show what is happening in the camp, like a book. His entire group is mentioned a lot in the book, but it is not in the film. Overall, a great movie for a rainy afternoon
