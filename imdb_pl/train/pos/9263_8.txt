It's a totally amazing and unexpected movie. You start with following a young person who is hoping to get into a qualifying football match between Bahrain and Iran. If Iran wins, he will get to the 2006 World Cup in Germany. The problem is that a young person is a girl and girls (or women in this area) can not enter football matches to "sit with men". Below is a great comedy played with excellent skills by a small cast. The film examines the absurdity of women's freedom restrictions (and thus of young soldiers who must ruin them). There are some great sets, especially when one of the girls has to go to the toilet and of course there are no women's toilets in the stadium. Working with a camera is the simplest and in some ways this story could be told as a stage game. However, this small scale gives the film a bite. Great cinema? No, probably not; great entertainment - for sure.
