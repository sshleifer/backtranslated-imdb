Someone has already mentioned "being at the right time in the right place." It was so true for this document that I had doubts about the authenticity of the scenes and thought it might be some acting, but it is not. This is all true. History is nothing new to people from developing and / or poor countries. It sheds light on the manipulation of people by corporate media, disinformation, artificial polarization of people through the intentional creation of tensions on the streets, sometimes to the extent that the army, intelligence agency and even government (many believe, led by the US) uses agents who attack "Every" side to provoke the masses to violence, and thus justify their upheavals. The marine officer in the film also mentions it. That they wanted to see nations on the streets. All these scenarios were played in Turkey (an American dog in the Middle East) throughout history, which experienced 3 upheavals, and recently secret plans of the Turkish army were, ironically, pro-government religious / conservative media opposed to the a-religious army doctrine, in which a very important mosque is bombed by a military agent to provoke people, etc. <br /> <br /> What makes this film special is that they filmed from the inside, perhaps by accident, when the events happened . It is obvious that the directors are pro Chavez. Regardless of whether it caused directors to filter and manipulate events and information, I would not know. <br /> <br /> And if Chavez will defend the people of Venezuela from the dictatorship of the US and the global economy without suppressing any contradictory thought with force and eventually becoming an indulgent tyrant, the story will tell you. <br /> <br /> But at least Chavez hopes and I believe that it's worth taking a chance.
