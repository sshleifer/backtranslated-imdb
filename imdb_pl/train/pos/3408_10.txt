I am giving this A + movie to this camp! As the daughter of Dietrich Maria Riva wrote in her book about her mother: "If anyone sees the Garden of Allah in the context of a high camp, he can be very funny." And how! I laughed with delight over the over-all result and astonishingly, ridiculously, fantastically melodramatic dialogue. Viewers who read Boyer's wig relation (continue to float in the heat) will laugh each time they appear. <br /> <br /> Dietrich and Boyer rarely look at each other when they give out their lines - instead, they stare drowsily into the distance, presumably so their faces can be photographed at the best angle and with the most favorable light (if you play in turkey it might look like well!). Dietrich's outfits are out of this world. As Riva notes in his book, Dietrich managed to steal Travis Banton Paramount and order him to design some of the most divine dresses, such as chiffon beige dress and cape. <br /> <br /> I heartily agree with other reviewers who are delighted with technicolorem. It's really hard to believe that the movie was made in 1936 - the color is fantastic. <br /> <br /> In short, if you see the Allah Garden with a gentle attitude and accept his stupidity, you can not help but enjoy it.
