We loved this movie. I am the mother of two small men. I love to have a movie that I can watch when men have honesty and character. Move where money is not the most important. And the family is eternal and love means more than words. <br /> <br /> It is a pity we did not see the Davis family anymore. But above all I loved, it left me the same feeling that others "please do not finish." We both wish that the actors would not change. he asked me to buy them all. He's a film critic, so he said it tells me something. The family should see this movement for friends. Help restore the value of time. We will read books now when we are addicted. I really hope to see more. Be blessed happy moving
