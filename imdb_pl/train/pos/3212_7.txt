I watched the movie a second time to find out why it was not as effective (commercially or artistically) as it should be, and discovered a significant artistic value - which could ultimately be its commercial loss. /> <br /> First of all, this movie tries "serious" science fiction, social commentary, more than adventure action. There's action in it, but it's not really about that. If you focus on this, you will end up with (as others have noticed) the "alien" clone. But again, that's not the point. <br /> <br /> The film is really about the transformation of Todd (Kurt Russell) from man to machine and back to man (mostly * back *). But since he is not trying to give a typical Hollywood-style answer, Kurt Russell must make this transformation without speaking, largely without broad expressions. And he really does a great job - he can appreciate it twice. <br /> <br /> The surrounding "social logic" is flawed and it is never adequately explained whether Todd's ability to stick to his own army supposedly better troops come from his experience in the battlefield or his newly discovered humanity, but the film continues is a great showcase of Russell's talent (easy to disregard).
