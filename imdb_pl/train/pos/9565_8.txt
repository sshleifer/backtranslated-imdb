Dog Bite Dog will not be for everyone, but I really enjoyed it. Full of cheeks, knife thrusts and shooting (but do not worry that lead is a terrible shot), you can best describe it as a violent attack by Hong Kong and Cambodia. Edison Cheng plays Pang, a Cambodian murderer in the city to kill a lawyer. Even though he is dirty from his travels, he sits almost at the big table in the middle of an expensive restaurant. If you think it's incredibly improbable, you should probably avoid this movie. It acted as my tip to suspend disbelief, and I had much more joy. <br /> <br /> Chasing Pang is Wai (Sam Lee), a young, nervous policeman who likes to hit people almost as much as he likes smoking. Wai goes a thin line that investigates Internal Affairs, and his father, the legendary Good Policeman, is in a coma after a drug deal that went south (due to Wai letting her father rape about his corrupt relationships). <br /> <br /> There are car accidents, lots of homicides and a strange and awkward love story on offer, all in a nearly comic style. I suspect that the humor was intentional (no one uses giant concrete bludgeons, not paying attention to the extravagant absurdity), although too many of my colleagues from the audience lost too much nature. At least three points in which the movie could end, and after 109 minutes could have used a more ruthless edition or removal of one of the narrative threads (carefree things worked well, so I would leave interaction with the three fathers). <br /> <br /> However, I am willing to give him (high) pass, if only because of the ending? I have rarely heard so many people laughing so loudly, which should be a moving moment. This is one of the groups of friends who love this funny
