What a great romp? very competent film that has so much charm and good humor that it lacks many romantic comedies. Einstein is brilliantly played by Walter Matthau, while Catherine Meg Ryan is unforgettable? better than I saw her in the movies with Tom Hanks? as a young mathematician fighting for recognition. <br /> <br /> You do not have to be a young woman to understand Catherine's fight and feel compassion for her immediately, and as a young man it's easy to understand what must have gone through the mind of Ed (Tim Robbins) in pursuit of his true love. There is widespread appeal in these emotions, even if I.Q. keeps everything light, pleasant and well tied. <br /> <br /> Sure, it's not heavy, but if you look, there are some subtexts. People remember Albert Einstein as a scientist, but he was a great spiritualist; his statements like something like: "If it is not impossible, why would you do it?". he suggests that he believes in meeting higher goals beyond immediate comprehension. In this video, questions arise, what is the accident? what counts is whether Albert and his damn intervention of the helpers in the nosy Catherine away from the stiff upper lip, the devoid of love James (Stephen Fry, who gives life to otherwise cardboard and you can not not feel that he feels lack of feeling). How many interventions happen in our lives that we do not see and turns out to be unexpected? <br /> <br /> And of course we would like to think in real life, despite what we often see among people who I know that we, Edwards, get Catherine, and James must learn to thaw ice water in their veins. It's so nice to know that it can be done in the innocent (and worrying, exclusively Caucasian) land of Eisenhower.
