The animation was great and the movie was fun. Two circus worms, Tuck / Roll were very funny. If you were waiting for the subtitles at the end, you saw a very funny sequence of movies in which they showed worms pretending to be doing something wrong, like in other movies, which was clever because it made the characters more human and credible.
