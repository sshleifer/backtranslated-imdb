It's depressing to see where Jackie Chan ended up. He used to be an unstoppable hurricane of blows, kicks and amazing stunts. To be honest, he is now fifty years old and one would expect a slowdown. But with "Rush Hour 3", where he takes the back seat of Chris Tucker (of all people!), And then there is "Kung Fu Panda", where he is not only in a purely vocal role, but his character barely conducts a dialogue. .. to say that Jackie Chan has seen better days is a colossal understatement. <br /> <br /> It's such a time when the only solution is to pull out a dusty old VHS tape and watch Jackie dig a donkey in his junior, fitter, days off from Chris Tucker. <br /> <br /> Enter "Police Story". Jackie Chan plays Kar-kui, a policeman whose job is to protect the witness from a serious trial. He faces the resistance of both an inoperable witness and numerous murderers sent by the crowd to silence them both. <br /> <br /> But on the other hand, who cares? We do not watch Jackie Chan's films for this story. We watch them to see how Jackie Chan performs spectacular stunts and generally hits and kicks a lot of people who are less amazing than him. <br /> <br /> At this level of "Police Story" do not disappoint. At the end of the shopping center there is an amazing game, culminating in Jackie slipping down a gigantic high voltage chandelier. Seriously, if something like that happened more often, no man would ever have to persuade him to go shopping for clothes. <br /> <br /> There is also a comedy, from which much is associated with the accidental nervousness of Maya by Kar-kui, his eternally suffering and apparently always forgiving girl. Humor is generally quite careless, but it works, so I do not complain. <br /> <br /> Acting is not too subtle either. Indeed, I am not sure if there was something subtle about "Police Story". Director Jackie Chan (yes, he does it too) clearly understands why we watch his films and knows that when we wait for the next fight, the last thing we want is to look for nuances and depth and inner meaning. <br /> <br /> So "Police Story" is an explosion. As with most of his films, the fact that Jackie actually does the things you see on the screen puts him above the competition. That is, when Jackie Chan really hangs from the speeding bus behind the umbrella, a completely new "Wow!" Factor is added to the action.
