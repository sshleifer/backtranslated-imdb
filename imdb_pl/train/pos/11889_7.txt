A well-made, but basically grim melodrama with a low standard of living, which according to the accompanying interview with Isabelle Huppert, the screenwriter / director of Pialat, contained many autobiographical details; considering mainly insensitive characters, he does not give him any compliments - and he seems to have been a worried man, because Huppert also says that Pialat often disappeared for a few days while shooting! <br /> <br /> Acting is equally perfect; despite their relatively young age, Huppert and co-author Gerard Depardieu (as the title hero!) were already at the forefront of contemporary French celebrities - a status that, with varying success, both still persist to this day. <br /> <br /> I still have 3 Pialat movies in the "VHS To Watch" stack, although all in French without English subtitles; due to this fact, but also the disruptive realism of LOULOU - despite the undeniable artistic merit - I can not say that I am in a special hurry to check them now ...
