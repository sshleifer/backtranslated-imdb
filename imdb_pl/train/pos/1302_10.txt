Often the band meets at a re-union concert, only to find out that they can not connect. Not so here. This concert is just a glow from beginning to end. The three musicians apparently gathered earlier and planned and planned what was needed to ensure that it is not just a nostalgic bash to satisfy someone's ego. This is obvious from the very beginning, even before they stand on stage. Many faces in the crowd were not even born when the first ones performed. From the first song they capture this old magic, which was Cream, 3 men, 3 instruments, no fuss. Clapton, he admitted himself, said he had to stretch to this concert because there were no keyboards, synthesizers, etc. So we can see him at its best. Ginger Baker demonstrates why so many drummers talk about him as a certain guru of drumming. Jack Bruce just great. They really managed to collect a piece of magic that will stand the test of time for many years. This is 10 for me.
