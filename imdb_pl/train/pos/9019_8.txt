Not wanting to give * anything * here, I would say that this technically perfect, flawlessly played and uplifting flic will reward the viewer with perfect entertainment for one and a half hours: it will be funny, surprisingly, perhaps embarrassing from time to time and almost certainly tugging on hearts from time to time, when it approaches the inevitable, but not obvious, ending without becoming a stereotype or predictable in any way. I definitely recommend it. <br /> <br /> User's previous commentary gives 8 out of 10 movies and 10 out of 10 for outstanding achievements of Branagh and Bonham-Carter - I agree completely ....
