This is not a masterpiece. Not so well written. Beautiful photos do not think so. This movie was not too scary, but it was not much better than average. The main story of the highly immoral teenagers should focus more on the forbidden romance and why this happened ... it really should come in, instead of scraping the surface basically "because mom says we can not." Some parts should be completely removed or reworked to be more important to the difficult situation of the two main heroes. Several times I was wondering if the writer / director was a fan of the classic American Graffiti George Lucas. It does not mean that being a fan of this movie is something bad, but that your movie sometimes looks like that, I mean! The worst part was that Madchen Amick had such a small part, I mean double come !! She was the only person on one or two lines who tried the southern accent. (Listen well, it was there, although her character was from California! DOH !!) Maybe if she was a star, others could follow her and we would have a more authentic sounding movie. Well, what can you do if you have a director who is only a director, not an artist. Detriment. Generally speaking, I give it to B- and it is a bit generous because I am partial to Mrs. Amick.
