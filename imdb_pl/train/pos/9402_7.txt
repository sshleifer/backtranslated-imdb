I saw this movie only after listening to it for years. Needless to say, the actual experience turned out to be somewhat counteractive. But despite this, Alec Guiness vigorously leads the magnificent cast in a merry, though formal, thrilling industrial England after the Second World War. <br /> <br /> This is a familiar story about the misfortunes of inventing the ideal everyday product. Do you remember a car that goes on water? Do you remember the promise of nuclear energy? In this case, it is a fabric that does not wear out, wrinkles or even gets dirty! Of course, fabric manufacturers and their employees are terrified of the prospect of withdrawing from business, so the plot becomes a bit thick. <br /> <br /> Guinness makes the whole venture worthwhile, and observing how it blows up the factory research laboratory is still great fun! (These Britons ... always have a stiff upper lip when under fire.) The film can squeeze exactly the same as Guinness's stupid invention, but it's a good ride.
