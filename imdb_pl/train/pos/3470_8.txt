Although I am quite young, The Beatles is my absolutely FAVORITE band! I never had the opportunity to hear their music because they were releases, but I loved them since I can remember. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that you should try once. I can see why it was not released in the cinema, but it is certainly a great movie that can be put on the TV. I was browsing through my TV guide and it happened that I saw this movie, not much detail except something like, "John Lennon and Paul McCartney meet after the breakup of The Beatles, Jared Harris Stars." I've never heard of him (played John) or Aiden Quinn who played Paul. However, they are certainly underestimated actors! <br /> <br /> The movie had a slow start, but as the development progressed, I could see how well Quinn, but especially Harris, played his heroes. As a big fan, I know what true Lennon and McCartney look like. The script was brilliant, and Harris saw Lennon's accent, personality and manners! Quinn played quite well at McCartney, but sometimes he delved into his Irish accent. The make-up artists made them look great. <br /> <br /> THIS PARAGRAPH MAY BE CALCULATED AS * SPOILER *: <br /> <br /> As I mentioned earlier, it started slowly, but soon it developed and became quite an emotional film. I found a piece in the park a total waste of time and completely out of character for both musicians. As for the rude Lennon line in an Italian restaurant, completely unnecessary. The ending was very touching and brings me a tear in the eye whenever I watch it. <br /> <br /> It's completely different from other biographic films I've seen in which it's about how The Beatles came together and became famous, and they never did so well. E.g. "Backbeat". <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I would say that if you're a fan of the Beatles or John Lennon or Paul McCartney, give him a chance that you will have a pleasant surprise. In just 95 minutes, wait until the movie develops. <br /> <br /> If anyone knows if the 1976 meeting really happened, send it to the "comments page" of this video, and I would be very interested.
