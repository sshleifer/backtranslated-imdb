This is one of my favorite Govind movies of all time and the best movie from 1994. David Dhawan is doing a great job in directing this movie, making it fun and adding family drama. Govinda is perfect as Raja Babu and gives a great performance. Karishma Kapoor is an actress I hate, this movie is a bit less annoying, but she still gets angry in some scenes. Kader Khan is a master in acting, and yet he gives excellent performance. Aroona Irani is wonderful as a mother and gives excellent results. Shakti Kapoor is brilliant as an assistant to Nandu. This film has a comedy, action, family drama and an entertainment full of entertainment.
