When the Chamberlain family camps near Ayers Rock in Australia, Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep) sees her child being pulled out of the tent by the dingo, and then begins a torment that no one should experience. It seems that the public or the press do not believe in the history of dingo, and this whole thing turns into a circus. Lindy does not help either because she does not play in the jury or in court, she's alone, and she's a hard nut to crack, so of course everyone thinks he's guilty because there's evidence that did not reach the light. Neill himself is perfect as Michael Chamberlain, the Seventh Day Adventist pastor who has doubts about his faith and perhaps about his wife. It's good (or bad) to see that people are just as prejudiced and stupid elsewhere as in the States, because Australian public does not believe in this story, and the media are just fans of flames. Eventually, Linda is found guilty and sent to prison for hard work, but after years of missing evidence and is released, but only after the family's life is essentially ruined. A breakthrough story, very well done, a bit long, but worth seeing. 8 out of 10.
