I feel that this film is a rare treasure. This is not only the beginning of Shirley Temple's career, but a rare look at how our society has changed. You must understand that certain things that we would see today as sexual would then be considered innocent. For example, parents of children in the film, as well as many parents who took their children on this film, saw it as children imitating adults. Most people did not think about anyone who would look at sexually attracting children, except for teenagers craving teenage girls. For them, he was not sexual. Remember that it was before we had internet, TV, etc. Most sex crimes were not openly discussed. From time to time whispers about a child with a "funny uncle". But it often resulted from it. So sad. But today it is a bit sad because I see the film as something other than intentional, innocent and funny. When I saw Shirley dancing like that and the boys watched her, yes, I felt worried. I have to remember when it happened! These children did not know what sex is. Parents knew that both from the film and those who watched it. This thought may not even have crossed their minds. In the eyes of the average adult, it was not more sexual than if Shirley played at home. Even today, children will participate in a beauty contest, many dressed very carefully, for three years of life. However, the child only pretends. I do not blame the child for wanting to behave like an adult. Or old movies that display it. To be honest, our media made many things seem bad and bad then. This can sometimes be the best. But I really believe that this movie is not one of them. It gives a rare appearance of an innocent mentality that we have long lost.
