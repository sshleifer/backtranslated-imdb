Opium's den, dirty boy (actually dwarf), abundance of prostitutes, brutal tailcoats in diving, motel for sexual shenanigans, scantily clad infants with cleavage, stairs down alcohol, mixed clientele bar with Asians, Africans and Anglos treated equally, does it sound like a movie playing at a local shopping center? Wrong. These are scenes from the musical from 1933. <br /> <br /> The first half of "Footlight Parade" is a preparation for musical extravagance, which takes the last half of the movie. Chester Kent (Cagney) is about to lose his job and loses his wife with music as a result of talking pictures squeezing live musicals. His producers take him to the popular gadget of the day, John Wayne in "The Big Trail." Before each movement show, the dance number is presented as a prologue. Shorts, reels, series and comics were to serve this purpose later. Kent believes that the prologue chain will be a way to salvation for a shrinking live music business. Kent is basically a man of ideas based on the choreography of Busby Berkeley. Is it possible that Cagney's figure is modeled after Berkeley? Possible. <br /> <br /> Preparing for the prologues, Kent learns that his ideas are stolen by his rival. He discovers the traitor, shoots him, and then without a knowledge of him appears a new leak in the form of a dazzling temptress. His assistant, Nan Prescott (Joan Blondell - soon Mrs. Dick Powell), has a fever for Kent and is determined to reveal the temptress's tricks. A new singer from Arkansas College appears in the form of Scotty Blain (Dick Powell), who turns out to be a real find and is connected to Bea Thorn (Ruby Keeler). The resulting three prologues, which could not be presented at any stage of the cinema, are as fresh and pleasant today as over seventy years ago, "Honeymoon Hotel", "By a Waterfall" and "Shanghai" Lil. "<br /> <br /> Particularly noteworthy is the song and dance of the tough guy James Cagney. Like Fred Astaire and Bill "Bojangles" Robinson, Cagney's dance seemed natural and unsuccessful, although the hours went into practice to make every step right. Not as good a singer as Astaire, Cagney's singing, like Astaire, sounded natural, unlike the song so popular in those days. It's amazing that one person can be as talented and as versatile as James Cagney. <br /> <br /> Most critics prefer the "Shanghai Lil" segment to the other two. However, the kaleidoscopic choreography "By a Waterfall" is amazing. How Berkeley was able to film underwater ballets and create a human snake chain must have been difficult because it has never been repeated. Close shots mixed well with distant angles are mandatory. Clear black and white photography is much more artistic than in the case of color photographs. <br /> <br /> Though not as socially conscious as "Gold Diggers of 1933", "Footlight Parade" is one of the most amazing and outrageous musicals ever to be put on a big screen.
