The icy and deadly hit of Tony Arzenta (divinely fit and commanding Alain Delon) wants to leave the murder business, but the dangerous gangsters he works for will not let him. After the death of Arzat's wife and child, he announces an open season to everyone responsible for their death. Director Duccio Tessari tells the absorbed story at a steady, lively pace, keeps a serious and senseless tone, staged rousing shootings and exciting car chases with a significant provocation of rage and interrupts the narrative of explosive explosions of bloody violence. Delon's delicate and charismatic presence adds an extra class to immersive behavior. This film additionally benefits from brilliant actor bang-up with Richard Conte's praiseworthy king of the mafia Nick Gusto, Carla Gravini as supporting friend Arzenty Sandra, Marc Porel as loyal friend Arzenta Domenico Maggio, Anton Diffring as ruthless, calculation of Capo Grunwald and Lino Troisi as the poisonous gangster Rocco Cutitt. Glossy cinematography Silvano Ippoliti prides itself on several graceful pans. The functional result of Gianni Ferrio goes to the service. Erika Blanc and Rosalba Neri appear briefly in cool pieces. What's more, there is no question of a filler, and we even get a decent piece of tasty female nudity. This surprising conclusion contains the center and lingering intestines. A solid and satisfying winner.
