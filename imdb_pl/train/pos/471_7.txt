Emily Watson from "Breaking the Waves" appears in the film. This film about the obsession of one man takes place in the center in which the chess tournament takes place. A chess master arrives and soon falls in love (at first glance) in a woman played by Emily Watson. It's raining on this man who's obsessed with chess. It frightens her mother, who is much more interested in seeing her with another young gentleman; right gentleman. Her mother thinks it is simply fancy fantasy for a young woman because she has a tendency to take strange animals and so on. What is happening is, above all, a journey through the human psyche. He tells the story of how his past is closely related to his present. Emily Watson is amazing in this, as is the actor who plays the main character. It is definitely slow, but it's worth watching. The ending was even satisfying. :)
