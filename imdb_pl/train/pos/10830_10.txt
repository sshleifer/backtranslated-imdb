I liked Still Crazy more than any movie I've seen for years. A successful team from the 70s decides to try again. They start playing concerts in some dingy European halls with fun results. The music is fantastic, the script and acting are great. The characters are in place, especially the vocalist with a high metal voice, make-up and personality problems. The concert at the end was unreal. Go and see, preferably in the cinema with a good sound system :)
