Illudere (deluded) comes from the Latin verb "ludere" (play), so he warns against the "spy game" as a cruel, and at the same time sophisticated and intelligent (!) The action derived from the complex absurd and vain personal history, whatever it would be ; yet I feel fascinated by the mechanism of betrayal and loyalty, the raw material of any relationship, from personal to social; after many years I was able to finish the book, it was a revelation! At the beginning I was so bored, if not a surprising style of writing (I really started to love Le Carre after this novel). The main character does not hesitate: he made a choice to redeem his weakness, following the path of faith to friendship and love, or not? After this novel you can clearly understand the darker version of "Our Man in Havana" by Green written by LeCarre from "The Tailor of Panama"; there is no longer any game, it ends either in a tragedy or in a grotesque comic or both. There is no Smiley here to maintain human dignity in "service", or at least it does not make sense to present it in this case. The BBC has done a great job with these series from the LeCarre novel: the actors are great, as are the locations and sets; of course the script is perfectly adapted. However, I warn you that even if someone finds it funny, the taste is bitter.
