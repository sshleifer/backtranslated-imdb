I saw Holes and I say it must be the best movie all year long. It brings out a child in everyone. I mean, who would come up with the idea that the troublesome boys would dig holes as punishment? Louis Sachar is who. Although the film was different from the book, it was still very good. For example, Caveman / Stanley was supposed to be the largest there. Mądry i wysokościowy, but ZigZag / Ricky was taller, and Armpit / Theodore was bigger. Also, X-Ray / Rex was supposed to be one of the smallest boys, but he was not. The only thing I did not like about the film was that the flashbacks were rather convincing and long. I'd rather see more of the present than the past, but that's just my opinion. I especially like the boys' work. Like Squid / Alan, who played Jake M. Smith was supposed to be a moody and tough child. Jake M. Smith did just that and did a great job, like almost all actors in Holes. So I would say that if you have not seen Holes yet, you should definitely see it when it comes out again, otherwise you will not have fun.
