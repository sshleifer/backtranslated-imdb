OK, so the FX is not too high. But this story is based on real events. It is not something to do, to make a pair of rich actors, even richer ones !! Like most book-based movies, there are things that just do not fit. Only a few people said that this movie is based on real events, not on downs, as most people think !! This movie is in no way related to TWISTER! Other than both films concern tornadoes. <br /> <br /> For those of you who have problems learning about tornadoes and thunderstorms in the film, there are a few things to keep in mind ... The "Twister Night" took place on June 3, 1980. This movie was released 16 years after the events. Try to think how far storm research has progressed during this time. It happened in a larger city; Grand Island, Nebraska is the third largest city in the state. Although the movie calls the city something else, and says it's a small town.
