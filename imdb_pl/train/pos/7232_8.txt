After the usual pursuit scene, Jerry accidentally rolls up in a bottle of invisible ink that was part of the chemical kit. He quickly discovers that he is invisible ... so predictable results appear, which means that he uses his new hidden condition to torment Tom. Jerry often defends herself, but often has a sadistic passion that torments the cat whenever possible, even when it is not provoked. <br /> <br /> Here he makes Tom think that his eyes mislead him when the cheese from the mousetrap disappears before his eyes or milk from the dish. Tom can not take it anymore, so he tries to sleep out of this nightmare, but Jerry lights her paw! Man, I hope that little children could not imagine watching these cartoons in the 40's and 50's! I always thought Jerry, a little mouse, more evil than sweet. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, in cartoons, in general, any damage that a character suffers, passes in a few seconds and returns to normal. <br /> <br /> The best part of this cartoon is about two-thirds of the way, when Tom discovers what a story with Jerry, and tries various methods to detect the place where the mouse is located (e.g., putting flour on the floor to see his footprints).
