This film is so badly understood that it is not even funny. If you think about watching this shootout ... stay clear. This concerns the effects and trauma that the survivors must survive. Even detectives are looking for an answer that we all do ... WHY? Fantastic acting of the two leading ladies, because we see how the ones we are exposed to affect the ones we ignore. Yes, the language is sometimes spicy, but it fits the character well. Remaining loose ends or missed, but all movies have such. The most important issues have been discussed, and the film presents an important statement as all our adults feel after such serious incidents. I highly recommend it for teens and adults.
