<br /> <br /> Filmed shortly after the war, this story was created to emphasize Anglo-American relations after the war. It ended up receiving the honor of being the first Royal Premiere after World War II. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, the movie interweaves the Royal Air Force, Sigmund Freud Psychology, the founders of America and many others on the long stairs (special effects in the infancy) and outside the heavenly gates without losing integrity. <br /> <br /> Although it sounds absurd, this clever scenario leads and dances the viewer between heaven and earth with the skills of a mountain goat and presents the enchanting ease rarely seen in the cinema since then. <br /> <br /> Get ready to warm your heart thanks to this sweet, innocent and charming love story. Roger Livesey behaves like a man possessed to steal the show !!!! <br /> <br /> British cinema should cry when it remembers how good it used to be in those early post-war years. <br /> <br />
