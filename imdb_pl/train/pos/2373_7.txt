The new Pendragon Pictures' movie "H G Wells" War of the Worlds ", the first faithful adaptation of the original novel, has been going on for about 5 years. The movie release was intended for the beginning of this year (March 2005), but it never happened. The DVD was released to coincide with the release of the Spielberg version, which will go to theaters on June 29. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie, with some reservations. <br /> <br /> How accurate is adaptation? He is not 100% faithful to Wells' book, but 90-95% of the faithful are good enough for me. At least a few scenes were completely new, such as the confrontation of astronomer Ogilvy with a farmer and an unnamed writer / narrator who clumsily drunk tea with his cousin. But in general, this film follows the book very closely - certainly much more than the classic version of George Pal from 1953. <br /> <br /> The biggest disadvantage is that it apparently was made on a very cheap budget. Most of them appear to be shot in blue and composed of digitally rendered backgrounds. This is particularly annoying during most of the indoor photos and scenes of crowded city streets. Reviews from London from 1898. They look like a video game. Many scenes were faked in horse-drawn carriages - they probably could not afford to rent a horse. The only scenes in which "real" revolves are those in open fields or forests. <br /> <br /> But within these budget limits they managed to do quite a lot. Artistically, the film looks good. The Martians and their stands are quite well made and very faithful to Wells' descriptions. I was impressed by the heat radius. Although the Thunder Child sequence, which should be one of the highlights of the movie, is very disappointing. It is a pity that they can not afford more real sets or better animation quality. <br /> <br /> Acting and director will not win any Oscars. Most of them are competent, not bad, but not outstanding. Music is also quite good, though not on par with any of the main Hollywood composers. <br /> <br /> I am glad that I did not get the cinema version, because the budget constraint would make it look much worse on the big screen. In the current situation, I assess it similarly to the adaptation of classical literature on BBC television. <br /> <br /> A few tricks: most of the scenes are presented with various colored filters (mainly red ones). It could have been an artistic choice, but it is used very inconsistently and seems to be a messy task to master the DVD. And of course the fake mustache of the writer / narrator changes from stage to scene. <br /> <br /> Conclusion - Is it worth seeing? If you can look at technical and budget constraints and get into history, I think you'll like it, especially if you read the original H G Wells novel. However, if you are easily discouraged by low production values, it's best to pass it (unless you're a MST3K fan). I warn you, however, that the film lasts for three hours, so I do not recommend watching all of this in one sitting. <br /> <br /> BTW: A completely different version of War of the Worlds (aka "INVASION") was released on DVD in the same month in which Spielberg went to theaters: http://imdb.com/title/tt0449040 /. This has also been done within the budget, but is updated to this day like the Spielberg movie - but it is much better! And in addition, Jeff Wayne creates an animated movie from his best-selling album from 1978, but will not be on screen until 2007.
