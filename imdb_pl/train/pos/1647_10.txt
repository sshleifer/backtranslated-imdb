Perfect. Raw and true representation of pioneer ranch life on the Western plains with an emphasis on the role and place of the woman. A moving film, beautifully made and based on real people and their real experiences. Low budget, independent film; I have never earned any money. It is definitely not a romantic, unrealistic Hollywood version of pioneer life.
