A great movie, one of the best 70's horrors. It is a realistic scenery and atmosphere. As usual, negative comments were inevitable. I noticed that most horrors of a certain period many times do not achieve even sufficient performance. Of course, because most horror movies are old and must be denigrati, it is like a mental mechanism that brings the minds of the potential of music critics here. <br /> <br /> Before you read the review, you already knew what the final sentence was. In the film a good present, because 10 is really well done. Raines reads quite well, and the movie, as the way it was made, reminds me of many of Kubrick's films. He really makes an impression. An excellent movie really. I am considering a movie anthology of the '70s.
