This early film has its drawbacks - a predictable storyline and several long scenes of dubious relevance - but it clearly shows the Hitchcock championship in the assembly and use of powerful images. He is also one of the most expressionist of his films stylistically; note, for example, the strange distortions that it uses during the sequence of the part and the frequent echoes of both the title and the plot in the picture. <br /> <br /> Its core, however, remains the final match, which is still among the more exciting examples of film boxing. Even if you know that the hero must win, it becomes quite credible that he will lose, and the movement of his wife from the master's corner to his, motivating the final repayment of the story, is very well linked to the progress of the match. Stopwatch inserts do exactly what they should; you can almost hear ticking (although it is a silent movie, visuals often have a surprisingly sensitive sound). Stimulation becomes surprisingly fast, and the viewer gets drawn into the excitement and brutality of both the match and the sexual jealousy underlying it. <br /> <br /> The only DVD version I'm familiar with is Laserlight, a company in the public domain. As with any silent Hitchcock they released, various musical selections, mainly orchestral, join the action. Sound editing is often messy and the sound quality is very varied, but it seems that most of the real choices were about real care, and the music accompanying the final match works very well; it is unlikely that this sequence will ever be better accompanied than it is here. <br /> <br /> This film is much more impressive than its current ambiguity would suggest. He deserves an honorary place both in the Hitchcock canon and a slim list of valuable boxing films.
