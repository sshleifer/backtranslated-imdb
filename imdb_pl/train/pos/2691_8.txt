Probably the best achievement of Bigas Luna for achieving a delicate balance between lashes, eroticism and surrealism. Pyszna Mathilda May, who spent most of Tobe Hooper's "Lifeforce" in the film, is the subject of a young desire for young Biel Duran. He can not get May out of his mind and wants to suck and suck on his mother's breasts so much. His quest for May is a movie. Like in Luna's works, such as "Lulu" and "Jamon! Jamon! ", The director brings a slightly distorted sexual sensibility to his strange but beautiful story. Ordinary suspects will be offended, but those with open minds will enjoy this foamy erotic poem to a woman's breast. The paintings of Jos√© Luis Alcaine are wonderful, and Nicola Piovani's result is sweet and rich. Great movie sweets with astonishing anarchic sensitivity that the Spaniards do it naturally.
