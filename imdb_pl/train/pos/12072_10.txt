What would happen if Marylin Monroe, Albert Einstein, Joe Dimaggio and Senator McCarthy met in a bent mind in the evening of relativity? <br /> <br /> This delightful Roman treble clef never really uses the names of heroes, it is so thin curtains that they viciously display not only the people they had to be, but also what they represented with time. If you are confused by allegory, or if you like your films in the predisposed and mushy versions, you will not like this movie. It is a demanding work that rewards the viewer with many levels of intelligence to appreciate him. <br /> <br /> Abandoning, for now, strictly avoiding the use of real character names, we see Einstein, who will soon make a pacifist speech to the United Nations hellishly inclined for atomists, visited by Marylin Monroe, after making the famous Seven Year Itch scene, which according to some led to the end of her marriage with Joe Dimaggio. They have a wonderful game in which Einstein stumbles with a proper professor's clumsiness around innocence, probably the greatest symbol of contemporary sex. <br /> <br /> Enter Senator McCarthy, who thinks Einstein is Red. He is determined to bring Einstein's assurance that he will support the Unamerican House Action Committee, while providing the ultimate weapon in the name of peace. Add Joe, a surprisingly delicate and defenseless person who may not be perfectly staffed as Gary Busey, who hates Marilyn's exhibitionism and believes Einstein has become her lover, although Marylin only wants to show Einstein that she understands the Special Theory of Relativity. <br /> <br /> But there is more. <br /> <br /> Like all of us, these characters have their deepest fears that reveal one by one in haunting flashbacks. It is these weaknesses that give humanity characters that we can not help but see today almost exclusively in abstraction. Finally, we see the shocking terror of Einstein's vision, and the film's statement becomes clear. It is a powerful and unforgettable moment. <br /> <br /> Lack of meaning is one of my five best films of all time. This is amazing.
