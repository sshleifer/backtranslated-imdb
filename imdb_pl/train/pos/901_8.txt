Well ... Vivah is a pretty good, but typical movie, Sooraj Barjatyi. It shows different aspects of Indian families, wedding ceremonies, etc. The film is more than good, but not good. <br /> <br /> The big plus of the film is Shahid and Amrity's direction, music and acting (especially the last scene). The film begins with the common factor of the Indian film --- a girl disliked by a stepmother. The story is that the movie is a little bit ordinary, but it's good, good enough for the movie to be a hit. <br /> <br /> Minus point is a shared history of the Bollywood movie. Generally, I would say that you have to watch a movie twice if you want to see typical Indian family values ​​and of course love!
