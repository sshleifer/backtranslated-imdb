Idiotic scammers, baby, safe, plan and child. Add them all and you'll get the best comedy you've never heard of. <br /> <br /> Even with a few star powers (at least a-minus ... ok, b-plus?) this movie has very few ads. <br /> <br /> But it does not reduce his genius. <br /> <br /> Great writing, solid delivery and a reliable group of characters. Some truly classic lines and a funny phrase at the end. <br /> <br /> This is not some watered comedy "Nutty Professor". These are bad people with a low level of life. They speak the language of a bad guy with a low standard of living and do things to a bad guy with a low standard of living. But they do it for your entertainment and entertainment, and they do it well. <br /> <br /> One of the best comedies I've ever seen.
