When I first heard about the title, I thought about "The Simpsons", like many other reviewers, but when I saw the cast, I was completely stunned that so many great character actors would actually be in it! First of all, we have Christopher Walken (Deer Hunter, Pulp Fiction) who plays the title character, McBain. He was saved from a prisoner of war in Vietnam by some of his buddies, one of whom is Santos (Chick Venner, Yanks) who shares BILL START DOLLAR with McBain (apparently soldiers from Vietnam are loaded with cash) and tells him he can return him a favor if he'll ever get in trouble. <br /> <br /> Then, 18 years later, Santos and his sister Christina (Maria Conchita Alonso, Running Man, Predator 2) join the rebels in Colombia trying to get rid of their evil dictator, El Presidente (Victor Argo, Taxi Driver, King of New York), and when Santos fails the mission, Christina goes to McBain for help. <br /> <br /> McBain then asks her good buddies from Vietnam for help. At first he is a playful, hard black guy, Eastland, played by Steve James "American Ninja," which was also in the previous movie director James Glickenhaus "The Exterminator," where Eastland was also the real name of the exterminator, coincidence? I think not. There are also many other references to The Exterminator, among which the most notable is that McBain himself wears a mask of welders when Christina sees him for the first time when he is working on welding. bridge! <br /> <br /> The other guys in the Vietnam package are: A rich guy who can afford all kinds of equipment for the band, Frank Bruce (Michael Ironside, Total Recall, Starship Troopers), and then there's doc, Dalton, (played by Jay Patterson, who does not look like the guy that IMDb connects to, and I did not see him in other movies, so who knows), and finally, there's a cop, Gill, who's fed up with his unsatisfactory job, he's played by Thomas G. Waites, whom some of us remember from The Warriors and The Thing. <br /> <br /> And in other great roles we find Luisa Guzm√°n (Boogie Nights, Carlito's Way), as a small drug dealer who can not get a decent job. In addition, Dick Boccelli is the king of drug trafficking, which is suspended in a crane on the roof by the McBain gang, almost exactly the same way in which he hung the John Eastland meat grinder in EXTERMINATOR-film! I have not seen Glickenhaus "Shakedown / Blue Jean Cop" yet, but I am almost ready to put half a billion banknotes that Boccelli will also hang in this film! <br /> <br /> Well, going back to the story of this movie ... go to Colombia and save the day, yes! But who cares about the story anyway, the cast is great, and the action scenes are very well done and you never get bored while watching this movie! I highly recommend all action enthusiasts!
