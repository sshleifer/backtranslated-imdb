There are so many reasons why I rate soprano so much that one of his greatest successes is casting and building characters. Each character develops more and more in each series. Each series also has a number of different "small time signs" as well as the main one. A good example of a character (which was only in three episodes) that you can sense is David, a compulsive gambler played very well by Robert Patrick. Every smallest detail creates the perfect TV series. The show revolves around the mafia boss Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini), who tries to balance his criminal life with the role of the father of two children. The concert is not afraid of boldness and strength thanks to its dialogue and imagination, which makes it so credible. While Tony leads the case with Paulos (Tony Sirico) and Silvio (Steve Van Zant), his nephew Christopher (Michael imperioli) is looking for a promotion. Each episode also contains another Tony family, including his children and wife Carmel soprano (Edie Falco). In addition to these problems is his uncle Junior soprano (Dominic Chianese) trying to get what he can, from Tony's interests, despite being under house arrest. All acting are powerful and complex characters, but the two who stand out the most are; James Gandolfini, who is "Tony Soprano". Also, Michael Imperioli, who plays Christopher, represents the younger generation (20-30 years) in crime. If David Chase did not create this masterpiece, contemporary television dramas of such caliber may not exist, such as The Wire and Dexter. So Sopran√≥w is definitely godfather, Goodfellas and Pulp TV fiction
