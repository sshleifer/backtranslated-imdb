Now this program looks like most other concerts of this type from the mid-90s, but the only thing that's related to it is that it's different, they use a lot of comedy and action in it and maybe some drama too. Personally, I thought it was a good concert, I can not understand why they would cancel it. The good thing is that the fan base of this series is still alive since 1997. <br /> <br /> I hope WB will restore the program, and even make a movie that I know will not be able to do it, but hey, it does not hurt to dream, right? <br /> <br /> In any case, I would recommend if you did not see him to find a DVD with all 13 episodes, because the characters are great, the story is good, the comedy is good, and the whole concert is just great.
