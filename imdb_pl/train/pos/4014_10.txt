Spoiler for anyone who is lucky enough to see this movie (it's not really a spoiler). I saw this movie when it was released and I still remember its parts. Everything is set in a small town in the west or in what's left of this city. More like a ghost town with a few inhabitants. Among them, the couple in which the wife is particularly angry. At the end of the movie, he lets his man die and leaves the city, but he has to cross the desert. We never know what will happen to her, but just before she leaves, the dying man shoots after her and deliberately does not hit her and instead supplies her with water. She does not realize that she will soon be very thirsty. Mark Damon kills some bad guys in a fun mansion - but that's another story I do not remember very well. The other impression of the film was that it was one of the first moments in which I saw a really wicked woman in a film who pretends that she is not wicked - you can not compare it with the witch of "Snowwhite", which is easy to find in comparison. A very tight western with a few main heroes and still absorbing.
