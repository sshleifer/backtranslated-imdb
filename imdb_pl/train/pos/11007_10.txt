The characteristics of Jeremy Northam for the stuttering, gentle, book-oriented Morgan Sullivan and observing him, allowing free fragments of his true identity under the influence of Scottish single malts and influenced by the presence of Lucy Liu, is exquisitely made and joy of watching. His offering her cigarette in the bar is an old habit, done without thinking, and even asking, and gets lost in her face, neck and mouth. Regardless of brainwashing, love has a way of persevering. Love can not be "brainwashed" with any of the two false wives. In gradual stages, he begins to give up his glasses, walk and talk differently, and even his face looks different as the film progresses. The music is fantastic, hypnotic, sexy and properly leading. The wide application of shades of black and white and gray makes it almost a movie "noir" in the tradition of many classic thrillers. I would like to see greater sensitivity in Lucy Liu's performance whenever he sees him in his various states, the man he loves and for whom he performs a blind faith mission, some restraining his helplessness and flashes of genuine sympathy and concern. That would make her performance less one-dimensional. It just does not match Northam's talents, but overall I liked this movie very much and would enjoy the knowledge of other scenarios written by the same author.
