Why is this movie not the best in 250? This film still looks amazingly fresh 56 years after its production, but it could only be realized after W.W.II because of the perception of the nearness of death. People were more aware that life could be stopped in one unexpected moment. And what about life? At the end, I liked the scene in which the court and all people from all nations gathered. A phlegmatic judge (Abraham Sofaer - a typical British judge), Dr. Reeves (Roger Livesey) defending Peter Carter (David Niven), and June (Kim Hunter) against US prosecutor Abraham Farlan (Raymond Massey I - is the reason why this is American -). It's all so ingenious! Michael Powell wrote, directed and produced this amazing film, which is a real "tour-de-force". The message of the film is clear: in the universe, the law is the most important, but on earth nothing goes beyond the love between people. The way in which this beautiful story is told is much more interesting than any Hollywood movie.
