Shit, there was a lot to do. I was hypnotized. It was quite perfect, although I would say that the assembly had a lot to do with it. I can not believe that this guy was on good terms with many of them (especially with Anton) to get all this material without serious ... beef. Dandy's did well, middle-class children who took advantage of their situation (and rightly so!). I felt bad for Jonestown, and especially for Anton, which may not have been what many other people felt. A great movie track and a large selection of themes. I recommend it to every music / movie fan. You'll probably learn something about filming.
