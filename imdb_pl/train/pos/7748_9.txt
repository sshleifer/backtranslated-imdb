Tom wanted to shoot a movie for a long time and he did it. it's like visualizing a dirty and worn notebook full of great little ideas that it fills and moves for 10 years. no transformation of the grant form, no Hollywood components just life and a bit of magic. balance, speed, strangeness in comedy and drama is perfectly weighted. this movie will take you on a journey that will end before you realize how nice it was. the music is great and your eyes will be equally happy. the fact that this movie is about nothing, only a sequence of sketches of people connected mainly by the party of one of the characters, makes it very pleasant and surprisingly fun, it is brilliant, because it is empty. between the lines is happening. see it or not, is it?
