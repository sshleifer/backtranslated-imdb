"Presque Rien" is a beautifully observed portrait of the experiences of a young French homosexual. Avoiding both stereotypes and preaching, it is a wonderfully naturalistic film, well preserved, filmed with a view to the seaside city in which the action takes place, never melodramatic, but often painfully real. If it is almost too realistic at all, because there is little conventional story, simply scenes from life. But the lack of conventional dramatic tension counts for less than in a world so subtly drawn. "Presque Rien" may not be the most exciting film ever made; but his simple humanism serves him well in comparison with previously conceived celebrations or great points of view, which often treat this subject. Worth watching.
