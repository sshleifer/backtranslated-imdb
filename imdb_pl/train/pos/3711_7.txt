"The Gingerbread Man is the first thriller I've ever done!" ?? Robert Altman <br /> <br /> In 1955, Charles Laughton directed "The Night of the Hunter", a terrible piece of Southern Gothic in which Robert Mitchum plays a terrible serial killer. One of the more well-known film sequences consists of two children escaping from Mitchum by boat, the kids rush feverishly, while Mitchum wades after them like a monster. <br /> <br /> Seven years later, Mitchum also played a terrible killer in "Cape Fear," another film set in South America. In this movie a local lawyer appeared who tried to protect his family and ended up terrorizing people on the boat through Mitchum. In 1991, Martin Scorsese, trying to branch out and face something more popular, he transformed the "Cape Fear", the boat scene and everything. <br /> <br /> Now we have Robert Altman "The Gingerbread Man", another piece of the small town of Southern Gothic. Altman says that he consulted "The Night of the Hunter" in search of inspiration and coped with such mainstream film because he wanted to "spread wings and try popcorn", but secretly tries to deconstruct canonical genres South genre Gothic. <br /> <br /> So instead of a showdown on a small boat, we have a showdown on a giant ship. Instead of kidnapping two children, we give the two children a safe return to the police. Instead of hiding money, we have money that can be easily transferred with the help of the last will and testament. Instead of the right-hand attorney of the 1961 film and the regrettable advocate of the 1991 remake, we get a rather three-dimensional lawyer at Kenneth Branagh. Instead of a monster chasing a family, we get a hero chasing bad guys. Instead of a monster breaking into a family boat, we have a hero hunting for the monster aboard the monster's "house-ship". Similarly, instead of a murderous serial killer, we get an innocent freak played by Robert Duvall. . .etc, etc., etc. <br /> <br /> Altman continues to work, turning everything a little, pulling the edges and doing his own. His touch is most visible during the first half hour of the film, a film in a restless space between a conventional fictional narrative and Altman's fondness for overlapping dialogues, free narratives, marauding camera movements and the way characters are not so much introduced because they are just part of what's going on. <br /> <br /> Despite Altman's best intentions, the movie never rises above mediocrity. Altman is too attached to the "thriller" convention to do a lot of damage, his style is too lethargic to generate tension, and the movie simply is not radical enough to oppose other canonical films in this genre. "Gingerbread Man" is therefore too mainstream to work as a more pure Altman movie, as well as Altman, to work as the main thriller. <br /> <br /> The film is not a complete loss. Robert Downey Junior, Kenneth Branagh and usually unbearable Daryl Hannah, all are turning around in juicy performances. The film also has a nice atmosphere, set against the background of a hurricane, and the final act contains some interesting twists and turns. Although this is not a complete catastrophe, the "Cape Fear" Scorsese, the film is still nothing special. <br /> <br /> 7/10 ?? In the late 1990s, Altman made three more films in South America: "Kansas City", "Gingerbread Man" and "Cookie's Fortune." Unlike "Gingerbread Man," both "Kansas City" and "Cookie's Fortune" deal with this genre on broader, more loose canvases that Altman felt best with. <br /> <br /> "Kansas City" is the more important of these two films, its hierarchy of classes, politics and crime, as well as the desire to radical departure from the typical gangster genre, will be influential on all major 21st centuries of the creator of detective stories film (see, for example, "The Wire"). Having said that, "Cookie's Fortune", although it is a much weaker story, is perhaps a better picture. <br /> <br /> Note: Altman claims that this is his first thriller, but he directed "Pictures", a thriller from the house of art, in 1972. <br /> <br /> It's worth watching.
