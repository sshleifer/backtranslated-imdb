Before she began to pursue politics or public service, Glenda Jackson was one of the best British film actresses. This film shows her talent, despite having a supporting role in the stellar cast that includes Julie Christie as Kitty, the wife of the British royal captain who has lost her memory of the last 20 years, and Jenny played by American Ann-Margret in the almost unrecognizable role of her sister. Alan Bates plays a captain who suffers from memory loss caused by the shock during World War I. Sir Ian Holm has a smaller role than a doctor who heals him. You see familiar faces like Sheila Keith, Patsy Byrne and Frank Finlay. You can not refrain from watching Glenda, who is a joking housewife and the first real love of the captain, but she came from different classes. This is not the best movie, but it's good to see Glenda's amazing talent. She is still a fantastic actress, comedy or drama. He makes Margaret Gray become a nice character and you see why the king's captain fell in love with her.
