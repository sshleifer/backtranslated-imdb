Robert Urich was a great actor and makes this TV movie credible. I remember watching this movie when I was 15, and when I saw it a second time, my opinion remains the same. People are losing what they were when they enter this exclusive club in a computer-rich California city. Urich is trying to figure out what's wrong with his family, and I love the idea for a cosmic Halloween costume, brilliant. This movie is about the battle of your own spirit. The quality of television, which exceeds, a large budget, gangs of New York. I wonder if Robert Urich was a compassionate man whom he presented in many of his films? I hope! 6 or 7 out of 10.
