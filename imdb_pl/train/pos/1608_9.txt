Watching "Moonstruck" after all these years reminds you how sweet and sensational the movie was after its first appearance. Who knew that Cher could work? Who has ever heard of Olympia Dukakis? Nicholas Cage was the beginning of his career, and Vincent Gardenia and Danny Aiello were not known for their comedy talents, and Norman Jewison was not a director. <br /> <br /> The only truly flat note in this wonderful work is "When the Moon hits your eye like a big pizza dough, it's Amore," a song that is sung too many times in a movie (once it's too much ) and which had a long life after death in popular music. <br /> <br /> Cher is - forgive me - sensational as Loretta Castorini, a widow who wants to get married and does not have to be in love with the groom. Aielo (Johny Cammareri) commits herself by offering her a small ring as a substitute for the engagement ring and then runs out to Sicily to be with her dying mother. He accuses Loretta of seeing that his brother Ronny, who was married, attends the wedding. Loretta confronts Ronny and falls in love with him quickly. Meanwhile, her father (Vincent Gardenia) cheats on her mother (Olympia Dukakis), which Loretta accidentally discovers when Ronny invites her to the Metropolitan Opera. <br /> <br /> Everything ends in the end because it inevitably happens in the movies of this genre. In the meantime, all actors behave perfectly and the audience enjoys each other. In their own way, "Moonstruck" is the way Hollywood was at its best: entertaining entertainment without social significance. If they lost "To Amore" along the way, it would be perfect.
