Magnificent. Initially, I thought that considering the communist tendencies of Amrita Pritam and the film of the nationalistic tendencies of Dr. Dwivedi, he would be more honest than fictional, but when I read the novel, I was surprised to find that it was the opposite. for not being pseudo-sex and that Dr. Dwivedi is objective. This film touches on a delicate subject in a delicate way. Every woman is a victim of every war, as a poet said, and this film personifies her. It is also a sad commentary on the Hindu psyche, because they can not face up to their girl's kidnappers or Hindu Brother, who can only burn the fields of his torturer. On the other hand, it also shows the economic aspects of the division or, in fact, why the girls were abducted in the first place. I think the hijackers thought that kidnapping girls would become lawful homeowners, and hence the new government. he will not be able to ask them to return the houses. In addition to having to worship the protagonists of Puro and her Bhabhi, they are two simple village girls who do not pay attention to the outside world and risk anything at all, trying to come back after defamation. Because there are many documented cases where such women have not been accepted by their families in India. <br /> <br /> No wonder it required a woman to understand the pain of other women.
