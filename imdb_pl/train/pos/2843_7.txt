If you're not in the mood for a movie that lasts more than an hour, this movie may give you some changes. What I love is constant surprises. Not once you want to continue one or more short films in "New York I Love You". Yes, some of the short films make you curious, some of them are very short, some longer, some have specific goals, some are not. <br /> <br /> Most of the history depicts the sad side of the capital. It shows many different nationalities. Many of them make me feel the same as I used to be in the capital in other countries for a year in which many people came from different countries. This movie reveals many kinds of things that you might know, but for all characters are new things. Maybe some of you travel abroad to stay a year or two to feel something new, meet new people; to feel dreamy, sad, but the kind of sadness you seek because you are bored that you were in your own home. You can relive this by watching it.
