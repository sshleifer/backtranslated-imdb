It is a very grim, heavy and even brutal movie about an unsuccessful break in the death cell. It is a black and white photograph that protects it from dating. Mickey Rooney is perfect as a twisted but strangely sympathetic leader. One of the first films depicting the psychological havoc on the death row. It is also quite poignant.
