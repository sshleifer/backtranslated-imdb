Halloween is one of the best examples of independent film. It is very well made and has more psychological elements than one would be able to see at first glance. This is a simple movie very well told. Music is perfect and is one of the most haunting results ... If you have not seen this movie yet, you must check it out. The cast is great. I'd like them to never make a sequel after the sequel. The first was by far the best and it should have ended as if it did not have a sequel. It was nice to see Jamie Lee Curtis in the movie. She did not seem to get old (she is just as beautiful today, no hairstyles and clothes from the seventies). Scenes through the mask is one of the most terrible things in the world!
