Disney did it again. The brilliant way that Timone and Pumba are brought back to life to tell us how they met and helped Simbie when he needed them. I love this movie and watch it over and over again. It shows how Timone lived with his family and other meerkats before he set out to search for his dream home and adventure. Then he meets Puma and everything changes. Together, they are looking for a home that Timon wants and fails many times, which is fun because Timone is becoming more and more crazy. Then Simba appears and we see more of his childhood than in the previous two films. The rest, you know.
