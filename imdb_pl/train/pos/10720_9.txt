Hurray! A space movie that does not take too seriously and anyone can come on an exciting ride like a space camp. The film begins slowly, the usual mixture of idiots and tall pilots mixed up in a suspicious soup. But when the situation becomes difficult - it is difficult to sort out and it is not impossible to predict a change of form, because you can believe that there is some responsibility in their young minds. <br /> <br /> The only drawback in the film is that Kate Capshaw is extremely annoying because the instructor "I'm right and you're angry." I recommend it as a nice night in the film and 7 votes.
