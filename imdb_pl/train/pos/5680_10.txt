Holy shit is so hysterical! Why are American comedies not written that way? For anyone who thinks that comedy must be stupid - there is more joke and intelligence in the six episodes of this series than on the bookshelf! Hugh Laurie is a complete game. I could not believe it was the same guy as House! In this series there are so many great lines and gags that you can watch every program dozens of times and receive new items every time. Rowan Atkinson is funny as talkative and put on Edmund's butler. This is my favorite of all Blackadder series. And Tony Robinson is wonderful as always in the somewhat obtuse heart of the series, the "oppressed mass" Baldrick. Some of my favorite lines: "When someone mixes with Wellington, he really puts his foot in it," and Baldrick explains how he received the name and cousin of Macadder, the "top shelf seller" and the murderous swordsman from Scotland.
