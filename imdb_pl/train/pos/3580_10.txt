I do not think that such a film should appear today. It takes time to show the depth of heroes, and the plot is not full of twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat. <br /> <br /> But what this movie has: interesting to learn how families cope with sadness. When the language of healing and imminent imminent loss leaves us dumb, and instead rely on harsh emotions. Sadness without reason and patience is anger and even hatred. And unfortunately, the main character (a young boy who accidentally shoots and kills a brother while hunting) in the film receives more than his fair share. Finally, he leaves and moves in to his grandfather (Wilford Brimley), who explains to him that it was an accident. I got the impression that this young man knew it in his heart, but he had to hear these words from his parents and receive their forgiveness. <br /> <br /> What I loved in this film: no dialogue. Huge emphasis was placed on the physical response, facial expression. And the slower pace of the movie allows you to really watch the reactions of the actors. Something we can not do with today's movies. <br /> <br />
