This movie, saved when it appeared, now looks handsome and sounds great. A feast of intelligent, well thought-out acting by Gielgud, Kenneth Haigh, Harry Andrews, and especially by Anton Walbrook, as well as the touching, central performance of the beautiful and unbelievably young Jean Seberg. Preminger does not jump around and does not show off - his long slow moments encourage listening and reflection, and Graham Greene's scenario condenses Shaw without sacrificing complexity. all the worse. Too many contemporary films on "historical" themes can not resist stupidity. What would Mel Gibson do from the maid? Probably a lot of drooling her shots on the rack, and then crunching on the grill when the flames are burning. Preminger does nothing about it. Burning is mainly visible in response to feelings of guilt. There are a few poor results, but not enough to cause serious injury. I caught this movie on TV and did not expect to see it, but I was overcome. In our era of religious fundamentalism and dedication, Joanna's story has an unexpected resonance.
