I saw this movie on Thursdays in the evening after a really boring day. I did not have any expectations, the ones I had were rather negative. Because the only movie I've ever watched is the American version of the Taxi from Queen Latifah (?) ... do not ask why! But seriously ... this movie is so cute! Drew Barrymore is always sweet, but I almost fell in love with Fallon. Why can not I meet such a lovely fool? :) Such films are excellent. Simple, sweet and necessary. Sunday on Thursdays. I'm not even a sports fan, but I'm fascinated by American baseball movies. Probably the fact that we do not have this sport in Norway. <br /> <br /> (My first comment ever.) Haha
