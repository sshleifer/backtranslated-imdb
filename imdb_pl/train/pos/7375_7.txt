Not on the same level as Ring (or Ring 2), but nevertheless a good Japanese horror movie. I would like the North American horror producers to get the Japanese horror page and put in more "ghosts" and less cheap shakes for their films. A lot of good examples in this case, scenes in which a ravaged face is a scene staring at a young actress, photographs on the wall suddenly see a smile, only for a second and more. It's worth checking if you like this genre.
