Viewers in 1936 had to be stunned by what they saw: a full-fledged beautiful Technicolor film full-length. I can not say for sure, but it could have been the first (3-band). In any case, it still looks beautiful over 70 years later on DVD. In fact, how good it looks is amazing. <br /> <br /> Kudos must meet with director Richard Boleslowski, director of photography Virgil Miller, Selznick International Pictures and, for DVD - MGM Home Entertainment. They all came together to give us one of the best-looking films from the Classic Age. <br /> <br /> I thought this story was: excellent in the first half, standing in the second. In the end, it gave a nice message, although many people could not be happy about it. I can not say more without breaking things. <br /> <br /> Marlene Dietrich never looked better, I do not believe, and she certainly never played such a gentle character ("Domini Enfilden"). Heart-throb Charles Boyer was a male star and object of Domini's feelings, but some of the smaller characters were the most interesting for me. People like Joseph Schildkraut as "Batouch"; John Carradine as "The Sand Diviner"; The most memorable, at least for me, was the dancer "Irena" played by Tilly Losch. Wow, there's a face and dance that you will not forget soon! I've never seen anything like it in the thousands of movies I watched. It was enough that she saw her doing something that was worth the price on a DVD. Looking at her CV with IMDb, she was only in four films, but all were well-known films. <br /> <br /> Basil Rathbone, an actor who really became famous for playing "Sherlock Holmes", is also here like C. Aubrey Smith, another well-known British actor of his time. Incidentally, Schildkraut will be appreciated by the lovers of the classic film as a man who played an arrogant salesman in the great hit "The Shop Around the Corner" with Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullivan. <br /> <br /> The beautiful direction, photography and color, and Tilly's dance are the best things that I will remember in this film. There are many good and not very good things in one. If the last half hour was better - although I admire the ending - I would rate it even higher. Definitely one movie collector wants to add to his collection.
