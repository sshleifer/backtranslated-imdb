The story is about a little girl growing up in colonial Africa, but that's much more. <br /> <br /> Anyone who grew up in the south would experience the same things. Longing for another, another race that can not be achieved. Even a look is forbidden. You do not need words. Their mimicry says it all. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a black servant, Protée (Isaach De Bankolé) and a white woman, Aimée (Giulia Boschi). Their desire for each other is so strong that they torture each other because they can not have each other. <br /> <br /> The girl, France (Cécile Ducasse) is lonely and spends all her time with Protée. I really can not see this dance. <br /> <br /> One of the more annoying aspects of the movie is the laziness of the colonists. They can not even undress to bed themselves. The world is ending; they just do not know it yet. Their racist attitudes will be removed along with their presence. <br /> <br /> I think I would like to visit this Africa. It seems so quiet; especially at night when you only hear animals.
