Los Debutantes is the story of two orphaned brothers who moved to Santiago from the south after the death of their mother. Confident and streety Silvio, the older brother, gets a job working for the owner of a dingy strip club after taking his naive Victor there on his 17th birthday. <br /> <br /> When Silvio flourishes under the care of his boss, both brothers are involved in the owner's sexy and manipulative mistress, Gracia. As the film unfolds, the characters are redefined as we begin to see the subtle and explicit ways in which each of them manipulates the next. <br /> <br /> The film is well made, with good cinematography and fast pace. She is also very sexy, with plenty of nudity and quite clear sex scenes. He now uses the popular technique of layering different scenes from different angles, from a chronological order. Many people hate such films because they do not understand what is happening - Memento, Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs and many other good movies use this device. The plot itself is nothing new, there are elements of Body Heat, Pulp Fiction and many other good noir movies. <br /> <br /> With the disclosure of different layers, our understanding of the characters and their motivations evolves. Although the plot may be a bit banal, it is also clever and fun. <br /> <br /> I would call it a pleasant movie, worth seeing, but nothing unforgettable. I have not seen many films from Chile and it is always interesting to film noir from other countries. Also, rent it if it is available, but do not lose it if it is not.
