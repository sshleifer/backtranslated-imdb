One of the most interesting films that can be classified as "blaxploitation", "Coonskin" by Bakshi is a rich text full of great insight. He wrote it in collaboration with Scat Man Crothers and Barry White, who also appear in the film. Racist ideas can often be disturbing, but the message of the film was so powerful that the NAACP expressed support (but only reluctantly). <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film to anyone who is interested in studying the pervading atmosphere of racism that Bakshi is trying to deconstruct. Wonderful things.
