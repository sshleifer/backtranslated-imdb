Why the previews are so fantastic for a movie that is so amazing !! Everyone should know what a great movie it is. It's addictive and fun from the beginning, original and well-preserved. I would like the movie to perform as well as it deserves! <br /> <br /> For anyone who loved Princess Bride, Labyrinth and other really fun and original fantasy adventures, this is one of the best. Robert DeNiro is hysterical. Relative novice Charlie Cox is an amazing leading man. Claire Danes is fantastic as always. Michelle Pfiefer is having a good time when she has recently returned to the screen. There are also many great moments from small characters ... to facial expressions.
