"Hatred of a Minute" is probably one of the better movies that have come out of Michigan in recent years. Not to mention the fact that it is a brilliant movie, but definitely worth watching. <br /> <br /> "Hatred" tells about the dirty adventures of Eric Seaver (played by director Kallio), a once battered child and beginning to listen to his evil side. <br /> <br /> "Hate" is very pretty visually. The pictures are creative and the lighting is moody and interesting. This film has an element of production in contrast to other recent releases of Michigan, such as "Dark Tomorrow" and "Biker Zombies". Subtle dolly shots and a stylized shot composition make good use of the $ 350,000 budget. <br /> <br /> However, "Hatred" stumbles in the same places where many other local films are made, in the history and character section. Basically, things just happen. Eric Seaver does not grow at all. Basically, he was always crazy, people just start noticing. The film simply wanders along its merry road with little development. The ending is also very violent. <br /> <br /> However - because it's a horror story, when do we care about the story? We just want to see how people die, and "hatred" certainly provides. When the body counts, people in the theater began to cheer "Kill her! Kill them all! "When people shout back at the screen, it's always fun. <br /> <br /> This is the place where "hatred" works. That's funny. And finally everything counts.
