If the creators of this film made any attempt to bring reality to the story, it would be another waste of time, money and creative effort. Fortunately, by casting any semblance of reality into the wind, they created a comic miracle. Who would give up the movie in which the alien pilot spends the entire movie acting like Jack Nicholson, along with the Lakers T-shirt. Do not underestimate this movie.
