I found this movie by mistake many years ago and wondered (why) why he did not get such recognition. Well written, beautiful acting, one ironic turn on the other, AND THERE IS ENSURING what the wicked characters are trying to do. I do not recommend this movie for people with short attention; it requires enough intelligence to understand that in this story there can be a core of truth.
