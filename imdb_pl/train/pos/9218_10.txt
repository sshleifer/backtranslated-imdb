First of all, let me say that I wanted to see this movie for about a year because I knew that Angelina Jolie is in it and I love her. But my love for her has nothing to do with my opinion about the film. Either way, no video store wore it, but it was low and it was the local library. I watched it and loved it. Yes, there were Italian stereotypes, but it was good and fun. It was not degrading in any way. <br /> <br /> Every actor and actress did a great job. I was laughing very much with sexual humor. In general, I think that this movie is worth seeing if you find it. It is charming and simply pleasant to watch. I rarely rate movies as 10, but I give it to one 10! <br /> <br /> Find him and watch!
