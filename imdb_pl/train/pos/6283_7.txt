As much as I like great epic photos - I will save you named photos - it's great to kick with a few beers and sometimes make simple moves. Films in which the story takes the back seat on the set. Movies in which dialogue is not so cleverly written that it merges into endless knots of purple prose. There are hundreds of movies that match the bill ... but in my opinion, Gone In Sixty Seconds is one of the better ones. <br /> <br /> This is a movie update that has its name. He also shares the ethos of this image, but not its completion. Everything that was great in the original was improved. Everything that has been improved has been strengthened thanks to a larger budget. Often, such projects are prescriptions for a complete disaster - see the darkly exaggerated remake of "Italian work" for the one who dispelled it - but here, thanks to the cast of mainly excellent actors, Sixty is successful. <br /> <br /> The plot and much of the dialogue is not much to write about IMDb. Often you will have scenes in which the same line of dialogue will roll back and forth between the actors, each of whom will preach with various inflections. Many people found this annoying; I think it makes you smile. Each actor has a chance to present here his definition of style, of course with Cage, Jolie and Duvall at the head (and it should be noted that it is also funny that Mrs. Pitt did not receive the first bill). Chemistry between good Saint Nick and steadfast (see review date) and Angelina leads to some nice moments. <br /> <br /> The villain is not even a bit scary - I saw Chris Eccleston playing tough, so I know he can deal with them, but I think he was purposely directed to make his role irrelevant do not distract from the action. We know that the heroes will succeed; we just sit with them in the car, enjoying the ride. It seems to me that many of these scenes have been played out of the tongue so far on the cheek that it has passed through the heads of many people who judged it wrong. Actually, I would not mind winking at the camera with the fourth wall: it's just that kind of movie. <br /> <br /> All this style and not so much substance - something that often exhausts my patience, if it was not done * only * yes - it would be worthless if it was not for action. And most of it is. Wonderful. I have noticed that nowadays a common tendency is to use fast, extreme close-ups. Personally, I think that these kinds of things are exhausting. I prefer movies in which the acrobatics are so impressive that they do not need artificially growing tension, raping tight shots all the time. I was told that Cage did so many car exploits as he could escape without losing insurance (in real life I mean - his character obviously does not care) and it shows. The man can really move the vehicle and it is well used in the slow-burning finale in which he drives the Mustang to the ground in the most bizarre and funny way. <br /> <br /> So yes, this film is not "an epic, life-proofing image after 9/11 with obligatory social commentary". Stimulation is uneven, some scenes may have been cut, and not all actors are towing the line. But car films are rarely better than this. So if you hate cars ... why do you even read these comments ?! <br /> <br /> I would care about the many iterations of "The Flaccid And The Tedious" (guess the franchise) every day. 7/10
