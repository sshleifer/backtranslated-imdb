Despite Disney's best efforts, this is a rather nice movie about following dreams. I was surprised that it did not seem too sentimental; he played this movie honestly. Dennis Quaid was very, very good in the role that says something for a sports movie. I can not remember how many sports movies I was tormented by; here everyone looks like a part. This movie is surprisingly good and I predict that it will do a surprising business because it is a G-rated film that does not require the viewer to stop thinking. Ebert, on the contrary, this film is a success.
