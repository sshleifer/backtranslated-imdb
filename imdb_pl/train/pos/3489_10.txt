I love that movie. It was one of my favorite movies. The action never ends. The whole film was made very well. The ending is really good. After they have been fulfilled, they are even surprised for you. When I saw what the movie is about on the Internet, I was not sure if I wanted to see the movie, but I feel that I'm such a big fan of Luke Perry that I decided to give him a chance. I am glad that I gave him a chance because it was a very successful film. It was very original. Whoever came up with this movie gets a standing ovation from me. Acting was great. Luke Perry once again did an excellent job. I give this film the highest rating.
