Do not be wrong with "War Inc." for a sharply carved satire or a bold comedy full of jokes for message lovers. This is not. <br /> <br /> This is an old-fashioned screwdriver comedy, with absurdly random twists, action heroes (a bit of depth in the fun performances of John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Marisa Tomei and Hillary Duff) and a direct approach to political content. <br /> <br /> You see, the political points of the filmmakers are things that almost the whole country already knows are real. Yes, we understand that corporations making profits from war are corrupt, inept pigs, the political leaders responsible for this war are even more clumsy buffoons, and American imperialism has never looked more recalcitrant and more devoid of contact than now - but none of this has anything to do with it. sense. <br /> <br /> Here, all this noise is a set that breathes - sometimes in a brilliant way - as a background for a stupid clown, like John Cusack (heart-attack blow) trying to change his life with the help of a journalist-benefactor, who does not trust him (Tomei) and a young Middle Eastern star who wants to cancel his marriage (Duff). Sister Cusack, Joan, plays his assistant with almost cartoon enthusiasm. Ben Kingsley seemed to me to be wasted to a lesser extent as a ruthless CIA chief. <br /> <br /> It's all and works. It's simple fun, but if you can not see reality in some way and you think the war is going well and everyone involved in it is doing a good job and there is no corruption, and people in the Middle East want our Western culture to replace them, then you can not consider it funny. <br /> <br /> For all the rest it was a light comedy with a political edge.
