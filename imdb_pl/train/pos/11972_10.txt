I grew up watching Full House as a child. I stopped watching him for years, but about two weeks ago, I started watching him again. Now my children are watching the program and they love to watch it. My children can not believe that the DJ is on the show, and I'm the same age. <br /> <br /> I really love this program because it's a program that you can watch with your family. He has good teachings from which children can learn. There are no drugs and violence on him. Also, when children at the exhibition have a problem, they can always open up to the family for help. This is a message that children should receive from television now, ask for help for their family, not for drugs. Children should watch more performances, such as Full House instead of half a mess on TV, now for a few days. <br /> <br /> I also love this program because it makes you laugh and stay on the ground. He talks about real life problems and family matters. There is always a lesson you can learn from the show. <br /> <br /> I vote for the show 10.
