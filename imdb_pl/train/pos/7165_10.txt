I recorded these ages ago, but I watched them today. I was sick, so there were not enough things to watch! I am very happy that I saw it and I could erase my memory and watch it for the first time. This movie is so great! It reminded me of the fried green tomatoes at Whistlestop Cafe. <br /> <br /> The story goes back and at the end of the movie we can see what the connections are. Some people said it was a movie for children. I do not agree - it may be Disney, and many characters are children, but I am 23 years old and I LOVE IT! There were times when tingling in the spine. This story does not resemble any other movie, full of adventure. I just ordered a book from Amazon, I can not wait!
