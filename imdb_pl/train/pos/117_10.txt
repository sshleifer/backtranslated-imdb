Europa Lars von Trier is a good echo of the Third Man, an American arriving in Europe after the Second World War and entangled in a dangerous mystery. <br /> <br /> Jean-Marc Barr plays Leopold Kessler German Americans who refused to join the US military during the war come to Frankfurt as soon as the war ends, to work with their uncle as the conductor of a sleeping car on the Zentrop railway . He does not know that the war is still secretly taking place with an underground terror group called the Werewolves who attack American allies. Leopold is strongly opposed to accepting any pages, but is drawn in and seduced by Katharina Hartmann (Barbara Sukowa), daughter of the femme fatale owner of the railway company. Her father was a sympathizer of Nazism, but he was pardoned by American colonel Harris (Eddie Considine), because he can help launch the German transport system. The colonel is soon enlisting or forcing Leopold to spy (without giving him a choice or a chance to think about it) to see if the Werewolves can attack the trains. <br /> <br /> Soon Leopold got stuck in the adventure, engaging in both sides of the conflict in a mysterious and cinematic way in which everyone and everything is not what it seems. It is amazing to see how the naive Leopold deals with everything (his lover, terrorists, colonel, annoying passengers, his dissatisfied uncle, even the railway company officials who come to investigate his work ethic) before finally cooking and jokingly checking. The film is infinitely unpredictable. <br /> <br /> The film is stylishly filmed, always takes place at night in the winter with a lot of falling snow. His shot is black and white with pictures of colors appearing randomly throughout the text. In addition, background screens display images that work with images from the front. Add the hypnotic narration of Max von Sydow, and Europe will become a phenomenal place that is not of this world. <br /> <br /> This is my favorite personal movie now.
