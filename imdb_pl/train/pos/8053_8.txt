This is one of Sammo's greatest comedy movies. This is not a parody of entering the dragon, the main character (Sammo) is obsessed with Bruce Lee and emulates him strangely well for a man of his size. A nominal story of how his fight causes trouble for his relatives - and then the fight. Oh, fight. Good, fast scenes with a big impact (the white guy who plays the boxer looks like he was really hurt by one of Sammo's kicks). <br /> <br /> The funniest part of the movie was completely unintentional. There is a guy with Jim Kelly (one of the three experts employed to take out Sammo), but he was a Chinese in a black face with an afro-wig. Come on, in Hong Kong in 1978. Did not they have any real blacks? Well, I think I've seen enough fake "Chinese" in old American movies. <br /> <br /> This is one for every Sammo fan or Bruce Lee.
