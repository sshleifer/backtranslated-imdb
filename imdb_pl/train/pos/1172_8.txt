And another South Park run is coming to an end. It was not as strong an episode as I expected, but Night of the Living Homeless was a stronger finisher than Stanley's Cup, Tsst, Bloody Mary or Erection Day. He still is not able to keep candles in Woodland Critter Christmas and Goobacks, but few episodes can. <br /> <br /> Night of the Living Homeless is a zombie species trick, done in a way that only South Park would have thought of. Instead of body-eating zombies, beings are homeless that need change and seem to survive. <br /> <br /> Randy and other residents are locked in the House of Culture, but this time on the roof, where they can explore the scene. Particularly funny is when one member finds out that his home has gone away and becomes homeless, leaving Randy no choice but to shoot him. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the four boys decided to solve the problem, with the whole story of the homeless takeover, trying to pass the message, but seriously not inspired. South Park is the best in times when it is funny. Matt and Trey have played it safe this week and have not really criticized the homeless problem, they just freaked it out. <br /> <br /> The shocking moment of the episode takes place when the scientist shoots himself, trying to avoid the homeless. This is the first case of suicide in South Park and we observe how the poor man misses his brain and then tries to shoot himself many times while he is painfully dying. Another inspired moment of South Park. <br /> <br /> In general, the episode was fun, but he was stopped from being great, refraining from a real comment about the homeless and sticking straight to the zombies. The ending is a bit fun, but nothing new. <br /> <br /> Now we have to wait until October for the next episode of episodes. It is a long way to go, but South Park must be applauded for its course. Last season it seemed that the show ended with a couple, but now it's back in full form.
