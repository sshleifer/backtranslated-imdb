This is one of my favorite games of all time. Great music and some fun pieces. I laugh every time in Millie, the maidservant pretending to be a debutante, chatting her sweet handkerchief and mindlessly polishing furniture when she talks. I just can never miss her French accent, never a problem, because they try to pass it on as the daughter of the boss. <br /> <br /> Seeing the teenage Mel Torme and the very young singing of Frank Sinatra is such a feast. My mother saw Frank Sinatra in the theater at about the same time the movie was released. She said that they are not able to remove "bobby-soxers" between movies (in those times you did not have to go out between shows). This film shows how attractive and appealing was young Frank, and also allows you to appreciate his early talent. And Victor Borge gets some of his routine, which is a bonus. <br /> <br /> This is a fun movie with a sweet, simple story. Very nice.
