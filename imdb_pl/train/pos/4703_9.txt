This movie is totally funny. The cast casts immediately with the help of a cage and takes us on a wonderful ride through fake gangster films. Conflict of brother versus brother appears when brother Johnny becomes the benefactor of D.A. However, the best character is Johnny's rival with a criminal, too accented Moroni. As Johnny says: "This man should be arrested for murdering the English language." <br /> <br /> Check it out on the video. It's worth a look.
