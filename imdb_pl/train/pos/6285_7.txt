What is on behalf of? If it's called Jerry Bruckheimer, expect it to be filled with action. <br /> <br /> In the latest film by the producer Bruckheimer, Gone in 60 Seconds, everything concerns the nomenclature. With characters like Kip, Sway and The Sphinx as well as idealized cars such as Diane, Sue and elusive Eleanor, this is just a non-stop action that prevents you from playing the name. <br /> <br /> This is not a deep scenario, but it is a great tool for action, like Nicolas Cage as Memphis Raines, along with Angelina Jolie and Robert Duvall, he comes out of the theft of cars to save his brother's life by stealing the list 50 exotic cars in one night. A remake of the cult hit from 1974, this movie may not be designed for the same iconic status, but it is fun. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, this is an action that makes you do not watch acting. Although loaded with stars, none of them have outstanding performances, including the very poor performance of one of my favorites and Giovanni Ribisi. Even Jolie, starting from the recent Oscars victory, is just a symbolic love interest with almost no time on the screen. <br /> <br /> Is the series of beautiful cars and car chases that they are involved in create a great movie? I think so. The film is a pleasure to watch and although one particular scene takes you into the realm of unbelievableness, the action is non-stop and the tension is convincing. Watch out for other drivers fighting for pole position when you leave the theater. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 out of 5
