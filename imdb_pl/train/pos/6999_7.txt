Seven pounds are playing Will Smith as Ben Thomas, an IRS collection agent who has a hidden motive to meet those who have lost taxes. Thomas caused the deaths of seven people during a telephone conversation, and the film follows his attempt to redeem his quite sincere, unforgivable crime. <br /> <br /> The plot is as subtle as a brick window of a green house. What you see is exactly what is happening - even the ending of the Titanic was more surprising compared to the Seven pounds. There are absolutely no twists, there is no doubt as to what is going on. <br /> <br /> I usually like Will Smith when he's in full Bad Boys mode. The guy is on his way when he has a gun, he drives a Ford GT and says "Aw Hell Nah" because when he tries to act seriously, there is only a pathetic attempt to win an Oscar that is so desperate for. This is probably the main reason why I did not expect a movie, although here it is very underestimated. There are flashes of comedy, but they are subtle, in fact it was the most understated performance of Will Smith I've ever seen, and for that reason alone was fantastic and, ironically, he should be nominated for the main prize. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast was also great - Rosario Dawson almost looked like the door of death, and Woody Harrelson and Barry Pepper were all right, like all other players. <br /> <br /> Generally, it is tearful - but it does not throw away all the usual clich√©s and sentimental violins, so as not to give you any other choice but to cry. A few times even my hardened heart almost broke down. It will be difficult for you to find one of the situations that do not relate to your own life, which makes it seem more real. <br /> <br /> I would give him 8/10. The Will Smith show moves to the drama without the desperation of The Pursuit of Happiness and is better.
