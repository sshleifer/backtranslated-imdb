I know that technically this is not the best TV program in history, I mean that it was shot on video, and its limitations show both in terms of audio and visual. acting can sometimes be a bit depressed. I showed so much. I got scared when I first made it in 1988. Of course I would be 5 years old. But recently I bought a DVD with the first 3 episodes, which unfortunately I hear is now removed. I also heard that Warner will not spend more due to bad sales of the first DVD. Also, the TV show did not have the same impression as the movies, in fact I thought it had a more sinister tone. it is similar to the nightmare on elm street 4 (both this movie and the television program created in the same year), it has a more serious tone, while the phymes gradually became more sardonic and playful. freddy as a wise clown cracker. But I think it was the power of this TV show, you did not have freddy appearing every minute got stuck in jokes before and after killing someone, in fact it has a more sleepy character, enhanced by the soft focus lense.im I'm not sure if it is the intentional action of programmers, or just the limitations of being shot on video. I love this program and not as an addition to movies can be very pleasant. Much better than anything on TV today.
