This movie is so old that I never realized what young Ray Ray Milland looks like in 1936. I remember how he played in the great movie Lost Weekend. Ray plays the role of Michael Stuart, who is a very rich banker. In this picture there are three girls who are not too happy about separation from their father and mother, and they find out that their father will marry a young blonde who is a gold seeker and only looks for a rich daddy with sugar. They employ a man to pose as a very rich count, his name is Count Ariszted (Misha Auer) who is always drunk and penniless and gives a lot of comical laughter throughout the picture. Deanna Durbin (Penny Craig) surprised everyone when she was booked at the police station and told the police chief she was the star of the opera, and then Penny began singing with the most fantastic soprano voice I heard, the entire police department and the convicts applauded, which was very a funny and pleasant scene from this movie. This is the first film debut of Deanna Durbin, which immediately became a success and became a great movie star at Universal Studios after leaving MGM.
