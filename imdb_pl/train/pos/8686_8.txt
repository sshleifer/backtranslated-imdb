The second official episode of the series "Columbo" ("Murder by the Book", made later, first hit the radio waves). Robert Culp, who in the next few episodes will match the cunning of detective Peter Falk, is wonderful as a hot-tempered head of a sophisticated private detective agency that murders a client's wife when he refuses to submit to his blackmail schemes. Two stars are well-matched in this clever exercise of cats and mice, which is one of the best in this series.
