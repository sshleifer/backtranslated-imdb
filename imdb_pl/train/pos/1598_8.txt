Either or, I love the suspension of any formula in this movie. I have visited him many times and always keep up. A bit too stylized for some, but I like every opera lover to love it. Norman Jewison, a friend from Canada, has a great chance with his films and casting and almost always pays off in movies that are out of the center and somehow delicious as it is. I have often wondered about the lack of Cher's acting roles, regardless of whether she chose to minimize this part of her life or not have enough good roles to chew her. I found her a great actress who can retreat into a role like this one, or be loud, bold and fierce as in "Mask". The comedic hits were sometimes very wide (the Cinderella hair salon), but that was the intention of both the writer and the director. Nicolas Page plays a furious, impetuous tenor of the opera, all extravagant gestures, at one point demanding a knife to cut his throat. The scenes from Brooklyn are magical, it's Brooklyn in the moonlight, romantic and dramatic, just like the opera. All in all a very satisfying film, I do not like everyone after a long shot, I loved the ending, everyone gathered like a Greek choir, every part subtly polished and merging with others, the camera moves back down the corridor, leaving the players to speak. 8 out of 10.
