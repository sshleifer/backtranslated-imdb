I just can not resist the genius of Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon. It's like the movie does not even need extra characters, because you'll never be tired of dialogue between the two. <br /> <br /> Lemmon has already been featured in several well-known films such as Mr. Roberts and The Apartment and Matthau were fresh after winning the Oscar for The Fortune Cookie (another film by Billy Wilder also with Lemmon). This particular movie was not as great as this one, because history could not stand such a long time (I think it was almost 2 hours). However, it takes an hour and a half, although the introduction of events leading to Lemmon ending in Matthau's apartment is a bit long (just like this sentence). However, this is a minor problem and you have a great time for the rest of the time. <br /> <br /> I have already written a comment about how the continuation of this movie has been drawn and I will not go deeper into it. The reason why this is such a joy is probably that the film was made, just like the innocence of American movies began to rapidly disappear. There are several sexual references, but they are treated in such an innocent way that you can not even get "Well, I never ..." from the most prudish person. It's nice to see a movie from a long era that has gone missing, and probably that's why the sequel did not work because Matthau and Lemmon said some f-words, and it just does not suit them. > <br /> Of course now they are gone and you can be happy that you can still enjoy them in such a great movie. I think the only male actor in this movie who is still alive is John Fiedler. Edelman died recently. So you have it. Just one of the best comedies and movies in history. <br /> <br /> Add: Recently, I learned that John Fiedler died, so I am very sorry for all his fans. I did not mean any disrespect and I will try to pay more attention to what I blah blah next time.
