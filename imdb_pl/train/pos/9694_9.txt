I was delighted with this moving and funny movie, not to mention the surprise. I was also surprised that Jayi's voice was made by Paul Mohr. The show was so subtle, it did not hesitate in the murmur, nor did it become too difficult under the influence of the New Jersey revolt, that I thought it must be some underrated old professional, not Mr. Mohr. A very impressive performance, and really satisfying that his talents are taken seriously in a series of bizarre, independent films.
