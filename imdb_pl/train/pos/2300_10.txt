This movie has so many great elements! Reese Witherspoon's debut performance is of course wonderful, but also her chemistry with Jason London. The result is unusual, airy and clean. James Newton Howard improves the quality of every film he composes ten times. It also seems that he has talent for films with young people, remember to catch his music for the latest "Peter Pan" and haunted gothic music "The Village". I saw this movie for the first time around 13 or 14, and now I'm not just crying at the end, I dropped a tear or two for longing. Show this movie to your daughters. As a result, it will become a movie that provides comfort for a lifetime.
