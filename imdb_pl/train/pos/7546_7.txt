CAT SOUP has two "Hello Kitty" kittens starting a bizarre journey through the afterlife, where anything can happen and it happens. This crazy Asian mind does not use any dialog box, instead of replacing balloons with words. You can not describe this mad cartoon, except to tell you that you want to see her. And make sure that there is no one under 10 in the room. Fragmentation and cannibalism, cruelty and cruelty as well as sudden death and callous disregard for others are common subjects. Honest. Perhaps the most memorable picture is an elephant composed of water, which the kittens swim deeply and also ride. But as practically everything else in this movie, this stupid picnic interlude soon ends terribly.
