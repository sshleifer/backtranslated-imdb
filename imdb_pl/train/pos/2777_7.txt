For some, this biblical movie is a tale of judgment and condemnation ... Others see it as a tale of grace, restoration and hope ... It's really both? Henry King illustrates the portrait of a powerful monarch almost destroyed by his passion, his downward spiral of sin and his ascent after healing .. <br /> <br /> "David and Bathsheba" is an emotional film full of vivid memories of characters who achieve mythical status, preserving humanity ... Henry King deals with a powerful story, taken from the Old Testament, with skill ... <br /> <br /> David, "Lion of Judah", storming the walls of Rabgah saves the life of one of his faithful warriors Uriah (Kieron Moore) and returns to Jerusalem ... <br /> <br /> After returning to court, his first wife complains about neglect and insults him for being the son of a shepherd, distinguishing himself that he is the daughter of King Saul ... . <br /> <br /> One evening and walking on the terrace of his palace, which apparently had an impressive view of the area, David's eyes became a ride to a young lady who was taking a refreshing bath ... and beautiful and attractive ... David could not take his eyes off her ... Later he found out that she was the wife of one of his officers ... <br /> <br /> By sending her, she discovers that she too is unhappy in his marriage ... At this point it is obvious that David's intentions are shifting from the interest of taking Bathsheba to his wife, simply taking Bathsheba ... As always, sin had its consequences, and David did not plan this possibility. . <br /> <br /> When the drought overwhelms the land and threatens her with hunger, David suspects that the Lord punishes him and his people for his sin ... But when Bathsheba tells him that she is pregnant and worries that he can be stoned in accordance with the law of Moses, David tries to hide his sin ... <br /> <br /> He sends a message to Joab, the commander of his army, and ordered him to send a husband to Bathsheba ... David did something it was disgusting in God's eyes ... He sends a man to the front line, where he will be killed ... <br /> <br /> The soldier is really killed and away from him, David marries his beloved Bathsheba in royal splendor ... . <br /> <br /> God punishes a couple when Bathsheba's child dies shortly after birth ... In the meantime, a powerful famine has spread throughout the land and the Israelites - led by Nathan - blame the King for their difficult situation ... storm the palace and they demand that Bathsheba pay for her sin ... < br /> <br /> Peck plays a compassionate king, whose lusty desire has outweighed his common sense and honesty. <br. <br/> <br /> Hayward as Bathsheba is a sensitive woman who begins to believe that every disaster in her life is the direct result of her adultery ... The sequence of her bath, which could have been a great moment in the history of the bible, is badly celebrated, and the eyes of the viewers are briefly directed at the face and shoulders of Hayward ... <br /> <br /> Raymond Massey appeared as Nathan the Prophet, sent by God to admonish David after his adultery with Bathsheba; Gwyneth Verdon is Queen Michael who tries to resist ambitions and greed, which have become an integral part of the personality and kingdom of David; ex-silent screen idol, Francis X. Bushman, had the short role of King Saul ... <br /> <br /> The best moments in the movie are: The Ark on the way to his permanent home, when God breaks a young soldier who tries touch the holy object; the decisive moment in David's life when he confesses his sin and is ready to accept the death penalty; and for the climax of the film, inserting it as a flashback, David remembers his fight with the giant Goliat ... <br /> <br /> Thanks to the excellent color photography and masterly musical score "David and Bathsheba" they won Oscar nominations the following categories: scoring music , direction of art and scenography, photos, story and script, and costumes ..
