It was a good movie. It was not your typical war movie, but something a bit different. This movie showed us recruits during pre-war training, not war. This film is one of the most realistic views on war and army than most other films of this type. Colin Farrel did a great job of presenting recruits to the army, and Clifton Collins Jr. and Matthew Davis contributed quite well. Seeing Colin Farrel going from class b to class in a few short years, you would never have thought it would happen. I will also add that the creators of tigerland did a great job during the filming in 2000 and make it look like 1970. It was a good accent. It's good to use talent wisely and I hope to see the same talent in the near future.
