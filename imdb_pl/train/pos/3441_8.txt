This film is unbelievably realistic and I feel very just about a crime that many people do not understand because of lack of experience. Many people who think they can understand what goes through the victim's mind are arrogant. As a victim, I feel that Dawson has done a fantastic job as Maya. I agree that this is an incredibly bold movie. It looks like rape from a different, more realistic point of view than any other movie I've ever seen on this subject. The end has stretched a bit, but I know that many victims imagine such justice, because the chances of sending an attacker to prison for a crime amount to about 1%. It's good to see a movie that is closer to reality than most.
