Although he has one of the standard "Revenge Charts", this movie is my favorite work of Vincent Price. Gallico has the quality that is missing in so many heroes of horror movies. When you watch him, you feel for him, you feel his frustration, the injustices against him, and you support him when he goes for revenge, even though he frightens you a bit with his original fury. As the film develops, its character becomes tragic. He did his murder, but now he must kill to hide it. And again, to hide it. And again ... your stomach sinks in your soul as it descends down the spiral - like watching your beloved brother in the hood. Even if the story of revenge is old, the plot devices themselves are original - Gallico uses his tricks to kill in an increasingly ingenious way. It is a pity that this is not available at home.
