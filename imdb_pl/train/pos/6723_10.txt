Riding Giants is an amazing movie. It really shows how these people lived then to surf. Their life was essentially surfing, life, breathing and having fun. They did not care about money, work, girls or anything. For them, the waves were their girls. I've never been on a surfboard and it looks so hard, I do not understand how they can stay on them, it makes no sense. It's an amazing movie and if you like surfing, you should really see this movie. If you're a surfer and want to find out who surfed, how it happened, who is really famous or what, then you really should see it. It can be a document, but it is really good. -Tara F.-
