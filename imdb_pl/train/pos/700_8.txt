Insomniac's Nightmare is a very interesting, well-made movie. I loved the way it just throws you into the subconscious of the main character without spoiling the viewer ... the acting was at the highest level - honestly, I would watch Dominic Monaghan's book! - but everyone else, especially a young girl, was also great. I was also impressed by the appearance of the film. Usually "independent films" have a grainy appearance, that is on my camera, but this director knows what he is doing. Lighting, cinematography ... quality of work. I am looking forward to the full-length work of Tess Nanavati!
