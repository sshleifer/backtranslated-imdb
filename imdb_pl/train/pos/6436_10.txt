Ingrid Bergman is temporarily an impoverished Polish countess in Paris in 1900. He is considered the most popular French general and enchanting count - and besides, he is engaged to a shoe magnate. This is an unpredictable assumption that captivates one of the most delirious plots in film history. There are political machinations behind the backs of generals' merchants, shot down ballistics and the ecstatic crowds of Bastille Day, but the heart of this wonderfully photographed movie is crazy intrigue at the top / bottom in which angry servants and only slightly restrained aristocrats come. Yes, this is the redux game rules. Before everything is over, Gaston Modot, a jealous gamekeeper in the Rule, appears - as a Gypsy capo, no less! At the end everything happens a bit too thick and fast, which causes some confusion for this un-French speaker, but what the hell - Elena and Her Men is another deeply human work of Renoir.
