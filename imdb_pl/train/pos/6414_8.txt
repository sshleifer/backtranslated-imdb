I was curious to see how the critics reacted to this thrilling, inspiring movie, so I went to Rotten Tomatoes and was terrified to discover that the pompous gallery of peanuts, which is our national film critic, gave the film an average of 43% (or "Rotten") rating. <br /> <br /> I can only say that if this movie does not move you, you have no heart. (It's worth noting that the same video on the same page received 74% of the rating from viewers). <br /> <br /> Not that critics' opinion is so important to me. After all, I can not think of a more useless, overpaid profession. For some, schmo gets to go to the cinema (what a hard life) and does the same as everyone on the planet: he creates an opinion. But these chumps have a way to meet, as if their opinion somehow counted more than yours, and worse, they love to hate. <br /> <br /> I'll let you make this movie old-fashioned (well, with the exception of bombs f)), syrupy and a little predictable ... you know from the very beginning that Cuba Gooding Jr., portraying a true navy hero of martial Carl Brashear, he will triumph (in the end) at every step simply the way he meets: determined and bold; strong will and optimism. <br /> <br /> But his performance and De Niro's work (like Billy Sunday, the complexity of some real people) are so powerful and inspiring that you'll be on your feet cheering on many scenes, especially the climax of the hall. You would have to be a real stick in the mud, not to move these scenes. Like film critics of our nation. Michael Rappaport is an excellent, and also sweet-venomous, stuttering dive student who befriends Goodhe's Brashear. If anyone saw "Higher Learning", this character completely redeems this character. <br /> <br /> In any case, it confirms what I always felt: do not listen to critics. Watch this movie and get inspired.
