I just thought it was perfect and I'm still doing it. I am grateful that we are still able to see things from what Hollywood almost floods us. Saving Grace is wise and pleasant - those who feel offended by the marijuana thing are better at watching a film like the bride of America. <br /> <br /> Saving Grace also shows that a funny movie does not have to be stupid. Most of the time I laughed at my ass, but I also wondered what the main heroine should do to pay off the debts of her deceased husband. <br /> <br /> In short - witty plot with typical English humor and good acting and direction. You can not ask for more. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
