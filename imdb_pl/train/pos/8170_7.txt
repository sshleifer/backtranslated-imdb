As if most people did not have a shaken look at the field of dentistry, this little film will surely make paranoid patients squirm. An effective dental hygienist is a witness how his wife descends to the pool (on the anniversary of all days!) And makes a great time for a furious fall. After launching the attacker's head, he goes to work and ends his marital aggression on patients, planning what to do with his wife's "whore". There are a lot of close-up photos, such as biting the lips, cutting the tongue and caressing the beauty queen, as well as a wonderfully insane performance by Corbin Bernsen. The scene in which he binds and gasses his wife before he ruthlessly rips her teeth is definitely difficult to see. A dentist is absolutely the wrong type of person who will come down from a deep end, and this movie explains it in detail. "Dentist" is incredibly funny, fast and sometimes funny bloody. Check it out!
