This is another example of Gene Wilder's absolute genius. He wrote and played in this amazing mystery. No one could do it better. The tension was felt all the time. I'd like Mr. Wilder to take one more of us. I liked everything I'd ever seen in Wilder, but I had no idea how talented he was until I saw "Murder in a small town" and follow up. He really has a strong idea of ​​what the audience wants and how to deliver it in his writing and, of course, in his brilliant acting. His subtle joke appears in spades. I recommend this film to anyone who likes Gene Wilder's secrets and / or film work. His star becomes brighter and brighter.
