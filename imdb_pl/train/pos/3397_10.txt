Soylent Green IS ... really good movie, actually. <br /> <br /> I would never have thought about it. I do not like Heston in his sci-fi efforts. He is one of those actors who, like Superman, most of the time can come across all mockery and invincible. I prefer more sensitive heroes. And indeed, he also mocks many Soylent Green, but because he should play too confident, I do not mind. <br /> <br /> I can understand why some people turn their noses in this movie. Soylent Green does not make any effort to create futuristic visualizations (as you know - it looks exactly like in 1973) and lacks action. But I admire the film's vision of a complex, corrupt and heavily stratified society, and I was very pleased to see that Edward G. Robinson had such a poignant, funny, final role. Nice little moments of the character - for example, when he shares valuable food with Heston - really create a movie. <br /> <br /> The Soylent Green message is quite valid these days, when nobody seems to know what the hell the government or corporations are ready for. Funny, right, see Heston in the prototype film of Michael Moore ...
