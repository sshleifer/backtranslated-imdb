In general, this movie was perfect for its time and will be interesting for many future generations. Although the plot is not 100% accurate to the book, everything is correct. The film skips far and few important parts are missing. I found a book and I was ready, and I immediately regretted that they did not make the film (because I did not find out about the movie yet), but later I found a movie in the basket at Wal-Mart and decided to buy it and see if that's what I was expecting. In general, I give these films 7 out of 10 points for good parts (relative accuracy and general sense) and for bad parts (big time jumps and small but noticeable inaccuracies).
