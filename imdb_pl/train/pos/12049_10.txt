I gave this film 10/10 with a certain reluctance, because it's hard to praise something that has haunted and frightened me for years. The mere threat on the woman's face in black is simply pure horror, and the accompanying music worsens fear. <br /> <br /> I saw it when I was first on TV when I was 10 and it really bothered me for years. I'm fascinated by the fact that so many other users have also said that. So many movie reviews tell you how disturbing or frightening a movie can be, but you can believe all those who have posted on this album are really amazingly powerful things. I mean, I really like horror movies and I usually find them quite funny, but it's really dangerous and probably bothers most people. I have not seen him since I turned 10 and I am tempted to see him again, but I'm afraid that I can spend some sleepless nights. I can not say exactly what it is exactly, but I think it has to do with the fact that fear is the woman's biggest weapon and that we, as viewers, are just as vulnerable as we feel fear so intensely. It is extraordinary that the feelings of other viewers are so unanimous. <br /> <br /> I also saw a stage play that was an excellent production ... but nothing can compare with it.
