I just got back from the Montreal premiere of Zero Day ... and I'm surprised how to find a negative commentary on the film. Basically, the fault is that Coccio makes an easy and crowded social message ... well, sir-I am a reviewer, it's an easy and overflowing critic of films with a social load. <br /> <br /> Not that I want to reveal my life here, but I come from a small town with a similar school than these guys. Dismiss and ignorance on the menu. The thing is ... I understand how small children can be forced to do such a horror story. Secondary schools became battlefields. It's a real ugly sight. You must fight your way to being like others. It is difficult to explain, some people do not realize that high schools become cemeteries of human intelligence. Meanwhile, parents close their eyes and smile that their life in a comfortable suburb is perfect. <br /> <br /> The real motive of the movie is not what drives it. It's a quiet suburb of death and everyone closes their eyes and tries to create the atmosphere of the perfect city. Cal expressed it well. It's an alarm. Drama is everywhere and can take any shape. In this case, small dramas (like Andre called the pedal for wearing J.C Penny shirt) are shaped as the worst nightmare of the whole city. Andre & Cal used the most extreme way to express his pain. A bad mood in an era in which you need more than ever to be like others to be accepted. <br /> <br /> I especially like the last scenes in which some guys burn the crosses of Andre and Cal, as if with the pain they passed, Cal & Andre passed their blind fury of the community, refusing to think about the causes of some of the acts. <br /> <br /> It may seem aggressive like in a movie, but Coccio meditates more than whining or speaking. What Andre & Cal is living is a reality ... and frightening that can get to other children. <br /> <br /> A disturbing movie ... Home making and a strong feeling made Ben Coccio a very disturbing movie.
