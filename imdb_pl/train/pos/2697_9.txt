Nothing revolutionary here; just an impeccably elegant, restrained cinema. <br /> <br /> GARDEN VUE is almost exclusively limited to a gray police station, and above all to one interrogation room, but director Claude Miller (who created the wonderful movie TEN SWEET SICKNESS, among others) intercalates slow flashes of external scenes as a minimalist set of locale. Miller's reticence, especially at an early stage, is breathtaking, and his excellent service of consistently key interior design makes viewing captivating. <br /> <br /> Lino Ventura is as good as ever, he manages to legitimize the figure, on paper, he is a clich√©: laconic, hard, world-weary detective from the homicide department. Ventura fulfills this role, making it completely credible, although the script allows us to have little access to its internal mechanisms; the film ends at the moment when it seems that it will be forced to face its defeat for the first time. <br /> <br /> Michel Serrault equals the task of a suspect child killer who cleverly fights a single thinking flic. The exchange between them is more often than not pregnant with the tension and aura of the ever-changing field to the battle of reason. Serrault's character, in turn, is pitifully haughty and cunning and pathetic; then later .... <br /> <br /> The "message" of GARDE VUE, if someone is looking for it, is a condemnation of police methodology and a kind of pressure, which makes the policeman eager to close the case at the expense of justice if necessary. Most of the time, the film shines with nothing more than an example of how to transform a potentially soporous scenario into the tight drama of the largest cinematography. <br /> <br />
