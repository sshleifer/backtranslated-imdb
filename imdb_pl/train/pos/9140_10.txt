I love that movie!!! Purple Rain appeared in the year in which I was born and since then I remember. Prince is so tight in this movie. Last night I went to a special Purple Rain show and it was like a concert that I enjoyed seeing real fans because this movie is so underrated that it's really one of the best films of all time. The music is untouchable. The film is about "The Kid", played by Prince, his family is dysfunctional, his band is the hottest act in the city, and he has eyes on Apollonia, a novice singer. There is no question why purple is my favorite color. I can thank "The Kid" for that. So if you have not seen it, you must be as soon as possible. It's classic - 4ever!
