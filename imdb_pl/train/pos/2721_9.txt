A real story (took place in Kansas in 1959). Murders (Perry and Dick, two former inmates who broke into a distant home on a rainy night to steal and kill everyone they met). Richard Brooks has directed a bloodcurdling and disturbing book on Capote about the reasons that led these children to crime (are they born killers?). Crime scenes are very brutal and persecute because of the lack of senses and reasons for which we have witnessed. Wonderful black and white photos from Conrand Hall, excellent country music from Quincy Jones, amazing performances in two main roles of Robert Blake and Scott Wilson, and for the first time in the film a sad commentary on the death penalty in the last moments before his death. Jones, Hall and Brooks (as the director and screenwriter of the adapted script) are nominated for the Oscar. Catching, superbly directed and frightening, one of the best films of this decade
