I really liked this movie because I have a husband like a guy in this movie. This movie is about Lindsey, who meets Ben in the middle of winter when there is no baseball season. He falls in love, but when spring comes, he gets shocked in his life when he's put one step down on her pedestal and puts her down. <br /> <br /> It's a funny movie with all the baseball obsession that Ben has. He can not get away from what he loves the most, that's why he is so funny and why so many women can relate to Lindsey in real life. Also, people with whom he sits at baseball games have the same obsession as him. <br /> <br /> It's a funny movie and you will not get out of it if you rent it.
