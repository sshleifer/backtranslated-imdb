VIVAH is in my book THE BEST MOVIE OF 2006! DOT !!. In my book, this is one of the best 100 films by EVER MADE IN Bollywood. It's sad that this movie does not have many reviews and is not so popular. <br /> <br /> VIVAH is once again the real achievement of the director who is doing it again. After HAHK and Maine Pyar, Kiya Sooraj once again won a great VIVAH. <br /> <br /> These are the simplest and prettiest movies I've seen this year. After watching Don 2 who was CRAP and later Dhoom 2, who even beat Don in this matter, I finally see a movie that is so close to my heart and my culture. <br /> <br /> I do not know why Bollywood is moving away from the beautiful culture we have and making Hollywood crap movies like Dhoom 2 and don. <br /> <br /> The story is beautiful and refers to the Indian system of arranged marriage, to which I would also like to be a part. Our system, which teaches us obedience to the elders, following them and of course obeying their thoughts, is so wonderfully shown in this film! Of course, there is no strength in choosing a life partner and it should be a short meeting between the couple and it is up to them to decide how it is shown well in this film. <br /> <br /> Returning to the movie ..... VIVAH is a story about a journey between a beautiful period of commitment and marriage. The phase in which a guy meets a girl! ... They both understand each other .. Both try to assess whether they could love each other for seven generations (as our system says) and different ones that occur during marriages. <br /> <br /> Amrita Rao is brilliant in the movie ....... Shahid is alright ..... and Alok Nath and Anupam Kher are amazing !! The songs are brilliant. ! I especially like HAMARI SHAADI MAIN HAFTE REH GYE CHAAR and Do Anjaane Ajnabi ...... <br /> <br /> Generally they MUST SEE for anyone who still believes in Indian culture and tradition, and I certainly do! <br /> <br /> Go see this movie ...... I just have to say one word ....... <br /> <br /> BLISS !.
