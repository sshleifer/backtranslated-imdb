I like this! The plot was strange, and Drew Barrymore and DC were awkward for both of them. Drew's acting was clever in some places, but it could have resulted from her life at the time. Dennis Christopher as a psychiatrist was pretty cool and, as always, he's doing everything in my power - I'm a big fan of Dennis, that's why I bought a DVD. <br /> <br /> I did not get the ending! this strange animatronic red skeleton looked like it was from a film school, which is probably okay, but it could have been more. <br /> <br /> ... and the whole thing with the knife - if it was uncomfortable, why did not they just get rid of it? <br /> <br /> It was very confusing when it was the strange Doppelganger phenomenon, or when it was DC - or was it Dennis all the time? Because Doppelganger met Dennis and Patrick. In scenes with Patrick, if it's Dennis as Doppelganger, I think Patrick will notice that. <br /> <br /> The music was OK, but in some places obtrusive, the entire orchestral score seemed to revolve around the subject, but the subject was exaggerated. <br /> <br /> A large blend of many blood and free photos of Drew nude. <br /> <br /> All in all a bit of GPM-Guilty Pleasure Movie. Do not read too much, do not look for secret messages and a fantastic script because you will not find it. There are several diamond moments and goose bumps - WATCH IT AND JUST HAVE TO BIT OF FUN!
