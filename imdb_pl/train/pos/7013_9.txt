The fascinating performance of Will Smith and the story that draws into your heart more than the rock guitarist in the middle of the solos, the Seven Pounds have passed the former collaboration of the director with the actor (The Pursuit of Happiness), a film that I loved too. Remember the name of Gabriele Muccino, because some of his films can be omitted if the actor attached to the project is not so loud. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that I first discovered Will Smith's plan, combined two and two, when in the first scene and on stage, when Rosario Dawson's figure has an incurable heart, cries for suicide -disease. <br /> <br /> However, I still think that the screenwriter / director has made the right choice, putting the bookends (books are the first and last scene) in this way, it is a source of urgency and tension in the film, learning gradually how exactly a man he may be brought to this ultimate sacrifice, and it was painful to see how the relationship between Smith and Dawson's character flourished and developed, knowing deep within the mind, which was always waiting for these unlucky two. <br /> <br /> One of my friends with whom I saw the movie, he thought that Smith's character could have a divine gift and understand why: his performance is almost angelic when in the presence of the seven chosen, but other times he could be stern and terrifying, and when he was alone, his weight was too big for him and completely breaks down. It's quite a versatile performance. <br /> <br /> Finally, I can not forget about the reconstruction of the disaster scene, which was really stunning in terms of cinematography in connection with music. Put it on your list.
