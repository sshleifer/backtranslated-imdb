Not one of your tougher stories, and this is the real power of this film. There are at least two accounts in which less confident writers would add a little too predictable romantic tension. They not only save the audience, but also throw surprises. There are a few Disney moments, especially at the end, but they are manageable. Overall, it was worth renting and it was good, relaxed fun. <br /> <br /> BTW, if you get a DVD, watch the segment in which the director teaches you how to make aloo gobi. We followed her directions and it was brilliant! Next time we will do it the day before, because we are going to eat it, because it is one dish that definitely improves with the whole night in the fridge to release the spices!
