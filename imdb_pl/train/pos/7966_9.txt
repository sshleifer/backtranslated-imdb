As a child, I thought that this movie was great. He had animals, he had beautiful music and he had my favorite actor: Michael J. Fox. I still love this movie for various reasons. He has well trained animals that are subject to various stunts and scenes that look great in the camera. He has a beautiful, well-written musical that perfectly fits the scenes, with thrilling, fast melodies and a motif of the heart that still moves me. Even when people are humming. And this is my favorite actor, Michael J. Fox. <br /> <br /> Based on the book, this is the story of three pets, intelligent, too trusting and much fatherly laboratory named Shadow, witty and vain - but still wise - cat with fear of water called Sassy and bulldog street, ridiculously interesting and somewhat neurotic, Chance. Three of them are taken to a friend's farm when their family leaves. Concerned and worried animals fly out and plan a journey through the Sierra Mountains for the journey of their lives. A really amazing journey. So what, maybe the house is just above this mountain. But what if it is not? <br /> <br /> I suggest Homeward Bound for people who like three amazing actors delivering voices to the main heroes of animals, and for everyone ... everyone watches.
