The film brought everyone back to October 20, 1944, where it seemed that we were part of the great Philippine landing scene "I Shall Return"? It is on this shore of Leyte, where General MacArthur gained fame? <br /> <br /> First of all, Gregory Peck triumphed in the performance of the great general ?? This is a step, a set of arms, intensity? What both men had in common: intensity, total absorption, devotion? Was it for the army with MacArthur? With Peck this was the challenge of acting? Oscar winner for "Kill Mockinbird", nominated for an Oscar for "Keys to the Kingdom", "Yearling", "Gentlemen's Agreement" and "Twelve o'clock", he played seemingly deadly amnesia to a journalist; from a restless shooter to an obsessive attorney; from biblical David to Captain Horatio Hornblower? He brought them all his unique insights, character, honesty, warmth and love, especially his humor? <br /> <br /> There is a scene where "MacArthur" stands on the deck with the "president of the Philippines". We hear a dialogue: "General, I hope that the water is not too deep," says "President", "because my people will learn that I can not swim." Then comes the loud voice of Peck: "And my people will discover that I can not walk on water!" <br /> <br /> As "MacArthur," Peck once again justified his reputation as a giant in the film industry? Through him we felt the emotions of MacArthur: we knew his anger, his happiness and understood the relationship with the whole family?
