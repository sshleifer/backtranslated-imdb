Guys and dolls must be one of my favorite music movies. This is a very nice movie to watch and nothing more. It embodies what people have forgotten about musical-musicals created for entertainment, not for preaching. We currently have Rent and Chicago, which are great musicals and good movies, but they do not bring us solid entertainment without any obligations. The only thing that bothered me in the movie was Marlon Brando, the guy can not sing! Listening to and singing when I did not understand him was very annoying. If it were not for Marlon, I would give 10 stars. Guys and dolls provide old-fashioned entertainment, which is rarely acquired today. See to have fun!
