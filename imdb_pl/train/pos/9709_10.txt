For the first time, I went to LoG one night when I was in TV: I have never missed an episode since then. <br /> <br /> This humor is very strange, like the intersection of the social commentary of the Brass Eye, the excellent Fast Show One-line and an incredible plot that seems to develop every week without going anywhere. The best example of this was Hillary Briss's special things - what was it all about? <br /> <br /> Humor will not like everything. Some will say that he is simply too sick and it is easy to see where they come from. Nevertheless, try it. If you do not like it, do not watch it, but if you like it, you'll be very glad that you took my advice.
