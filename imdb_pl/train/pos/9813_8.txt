The settings are great and almost like a movie. Unfortunately, the Jarada probe sent shortly afterwards damages the holodeck and all security devices stop working. Picard and now guests must outwit 40's gangsters in America and come back to a meeting in Jarada. Picard greets Jarada correctly, and a new day begins between humanity and Jarada.
