Fearful Symmetry is a nice episode with a few bugs. The first thing about this episode is that it takes place near the Home Mountain Air Force base in southwest Idaho. The seasonal "Deep Throat" takes place near the Ellens air base, also in the southwest of Idaho. I wonder if the air force bases are the same, but they decided to use the real name in Fearful Symmetry. Mulder and Scully have a good dialogue, always a plus. Ed Meecham, the zoo keeper, reminds me of broken, old teachers. They must have liked children one day, you just can not imagine how. Just as at some point he had to take care of animals more. I liked the concept of the episode, but I felt that it had some inconsistencies. If aliens are so proficient in kidnapping people and returning them safely, why can not they put the animal in the right place? And strangers now have problems with the return of animals? I do not buy Mulder's theory about the problem with the space-time continuum. As if he was an expert in this field. I also thought that Jayne Atkinson's performance as Will Ambrose was not well done. In addition to these tricks, I still liked the episode because of the intriguing concept of aliens that harvest animal DNA and human DNA.
