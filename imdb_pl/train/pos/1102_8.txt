In Manhattan, the American middle class Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) lives with his wife Muriel (Myrna Loy) and two teenage daughters in an apartment with four bedrooms and one bathroom leased. Jim works at an advertising agency collecting USD 15,000.00 a year and feels uncomfortable in his apartment due to lack of space. When he sees an advertisement for a large home for sale in the country of Connecticut at an affordable price, he goes with his wife and real estate agent and decides to buy an old house without any technical advice. His best friend and lawyer Bill Cole (Melvyn Douglas) sends a friend's engineer to investigate the house, and the man says he should put down the house and build another one. Jim checks information from other engineers, and everyone condemns this place and it turns out that he has bought a "pit money" instead of a dream home. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Blandings is building his own home "is an extremely fun comedy with witty lines and a top-notch scenario. Cary Grant is hilarious in the role of a man raised by the impulse of fulfilling the American dream of having a huge home that finds the wrong choice, losing touch at work and feeling jealousy about a friend. In 1986 Tom Hanks worked in a very funny movie, which was inspired by this delightful classic "The Money Pit." My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Lar, Meu Tormento" ("Home, My Torment")
