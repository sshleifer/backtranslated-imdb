Chances are, you think this movie is incredibly stupid when you first watch. But if you look at it for the second and third time, and the fourth and fifth time (I'm already in the hundreds), you'll see that you spit a line here and there and you break! My friends and I threw Fear of a Black Hat Parties to get more of our friends, "as they say, because of riots."
