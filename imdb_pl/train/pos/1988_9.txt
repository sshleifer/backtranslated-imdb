First of all, I would like to make a correction in another review of the film, in which it was written that the last musical that won the award for the best image of the Academy was "Gigi" in 1958. "My Fair Lady" won in 1965, and "Sound of Music" won a year later. That said, this movie is absolutely fantastic! The novel from the novel has been slightly changed, but it's more because of the limitations they had on stage that they just did not return to the film version. However, I do not mind. In fact, I think that all production flows better than a novel. I like Nancy bringing Oliver to the bridge with her and being killed there instead of later in the apartment. The subtle things in this movie make me laugh. I love the moment when Mr. Bumble and Mrs. Bumble are starting to emerge from the governors' office. The emphasis for this moment is brilliant. My three favorite actors in this movie were Jack Wild, who plays the best Dodger in every version of the movie, Ron Moody, funny and funny Fagin (this character is worked out much better than in the book), and Shani Wallis, who is the strongest, worst version Nancy. The only reason I give this film 9 instead of 10 are two big production numbers that sound like "Concider Yourself" and "Who Will Buy." I always hate it when the choreography in musicals is supposed to look like people performing everyday duties and work. It looks horrible and cheesy, especially when they dance at London Meat Co. They should have made a regular choreography for these scenes. However, this movie is a rare treasure that will stay with us, hopefully, forever.
