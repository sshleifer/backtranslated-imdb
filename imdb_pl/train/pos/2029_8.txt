As a horse lover you can only appreciate this movie. There are several videos showing horse riding, as it does. I'd like to know if Brian is riding his own movie. I would also like to know if he likes horses. Brian was in many of the films he traveled on. Where did he learn to ride? The only part that is difficult for me to accept is that the driving scenes are always full, as the horse can run forever with a full swing. Working with the camera is first-rate and gives horses in a way that shows how dangerous things can be on a horse. It would be very interesting to know how they went in planting this movie to find all the very good horse riders.
