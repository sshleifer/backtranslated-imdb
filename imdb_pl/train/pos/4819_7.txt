In general, I thought it was a very nice movie - I hate to use the word "nice" because it is rather dry, but it looked very beautiful and the central performances of Rupert Friend and Emily Blunt were very strong. What I liked the most was that despite the shiny aesthetics of costumes and settings, all gilded and shiny, this aspect never took over the heart of the movie, which was good, strong in writing (thank you Julian Fellowes: D); nothing too extravagant or saturated with the pump, i.e. not very sensational (when Victoria is pulled out of bed to be informed that she is now the Queen, well, you can not get a less impressive hand over the crown). Circulated gently, and each line in the film had its value. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, the show of love between Victoria and Albert, though somewhat fairytale on the face, was actually a slow, burning candle and Friend and Blunt did a good job showing how effortlessly these two people "fit" themselves even though the relationship was initially arranged (my favorite moment was that after returning home after the hunt, and Victoria just hugs her new husband from the back; that's what the movie is about). Blunt has also beautifully held her, has a face that requires your attention and I can not fail to mention the costumes she wears - just wonderful. If I was Blunt, I would have a problem with parting with any of them! The rest of the cast of the band played their roles well, Harriet Walter as Queen Adelaide, which is the main attraction. <br /> <br /> The only thing I have is that she missed a sense of urgency or an event that could have made the movie a little more exciting? (It was rather tame) I do not know, I wanted something to happen, which would make Victoria draw some strength and prove that it is worth a little. When she and Albert were arguing, I loved it, I could do with some more important dramatic moments, although it can only be me. <br /> <br /> In the end, at the risk of sounding patriotic, it renews the kind of pride and admiration in the crown and what it takes to be in such a position, especially so young. This may partly be due to the fact that the inclusion of this young life of Victoria is immediately adapted to what I wrote for one of my characters in "The Sword & The Scion", nevertheless, it meant those feelings (those who follow my book, Can you guess what Victoria so aptly describes - a nation that only recently renews the recognition that Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were so active in this domestic field, which made the government seem rather useless - little changed then, I suppose . <br /> <br /> BLOG on movies and books: http://sempergratis.blogspot.com
