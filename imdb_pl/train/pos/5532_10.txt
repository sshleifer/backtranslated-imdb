Maybe I'm focused on foxes, fox stories and everything, but I thought it was wonderfully done. <br /> <br /> I really liked that it was shown when Lily did not feel comfortable, like fire and peace (trying not to ruin too much here). I think it is important for children to see and try to understand. <br /> <br /> After reading a few other comments, I am a bit confused, it is said that in the end -spoiler - the mother and her son appear, as she told the son about her story. The movie I saw did NOT have a mother or son at the end, only a picture of a girl with a fox. Can anyone enlighten me? In any case, I really liked this movie, although some scenes can be a bit slow, which can be difficult for children with high energy. It is still worth it if they can sit still.
