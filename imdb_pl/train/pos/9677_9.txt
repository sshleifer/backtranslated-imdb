This movie seems to be a kind of movie for kids whose parents can unfortunately watch with their funny little kids. The film seems and is aimed mainly at children, but does not stop at this level. I watched the film first as a small child and found it to be fun, entertaining and cordial, and I have not seen it for several years. Recently, I watched him at the age of 18 and it turned out that he is almost as funny, but equally pleasant and funny. This film is very undervalued and contains a lot of real life news. This film is an inspirational tale of adventures that was created for children, but in itself epic. I recommend this film to all people of all ages.
