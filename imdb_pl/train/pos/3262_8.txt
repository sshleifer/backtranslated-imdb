I do not think I could like it any more, though some things were disturbing. I will not say what if you have not seen it ... you have to convince yourself. In any case, what movie may be missing in the eyes of a dog puppy Robert Downey Jr. In general, the plot has been developed sufficiently. Nothing seemed too hasty, as it usually happens in movies. The heroes were talented and there were lots of funny scenes in them. The idea is primarily that history is very well connected, even if some aspects can be unsatisfactory ... based on the opinion. But as I said before, it's hard not to love any movie with Robert Downey Jr.
