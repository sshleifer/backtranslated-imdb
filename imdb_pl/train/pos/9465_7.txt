Steve Carell once again plays in a romantic film about choices, family and pressure. Assessing the story and the cover of the film, I expected a flat-out comedy, many laughs and unrealistic elements, but I think I was wrong. Sure, the movie had some comedy, but it seemed to me that it was a more dramatic drama, and Steve Carell once again gave a great performance. The film itself really deals with real observations and it was a strong element that I found. But the ending seemed a bit hasty and predictable. The cinematography was great all the time, the acting was great, and the message it provided was obvious but still very important. Though it boiled down to an old, flat and predictable ending. I think that if a different choice was made at the end of the film (maybe even for the bad one), the film would gain more publicity. Still a funny movie.
