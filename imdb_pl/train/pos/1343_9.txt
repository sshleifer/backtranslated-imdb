This is not a single Scorsese movie that I would put on the list of my favorite movies. But that's the best thing I've ever launched in my DVD player in about five years. The patient explanation of Scorsese's favorite film moments and Hollywood's work is incredibly gracious, calm and intelligent. <br /> <br /> It is material from 3 DVD pages. It would have to be British production, because everything related to American corporate culture would step down on a calm, methodical, without any unnecessary additions, a "focus on content" approach that was adopted here. And American production would require him to say that he likes only movies that were popular favorites. I would like everyone to take the page of his love of movies. You should love movies that you do for personal, specific and specific reasons. Not only more "I also" for the Godfather, etc. People have no idea what ideas are being studied in their favorite films. If that were the case, the films would be more interesting than they are. Scorsese does NOT know what ideas are being researched, and this makes him an attractive and committed speaker on the subject. I really appreciate his articulated, generous interviews over the last decade. <br /> <br /> On the sidelines, Scorsese is the best when he's excited to show you an unknown movie, not when he teaches something well-grounded about film history. And I'd like him to break those three hairs from the back of his nose. It's very distracting.
