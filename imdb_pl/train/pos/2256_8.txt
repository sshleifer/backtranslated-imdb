He did not know what to expect from his partner and friend / trainer Van Damme and his choreographer to fight most of his films. It was nice to see him as "TONG PO" in "Kickboxer and other Van Damme movies. Now he is alone. He and his wife create a great team. In this Qissi is the director of the action and leads a bad guy, and he is his wife was a writer, producer and director of most of the scenes that did not require action, and also did a good film editing. Together, they did a great job. The story made sense, the battle scenes were well assembled, the leaders were real fighters and they looked good together - the story was going well and if you can believe in it ... there is no bad language, no sex, only action. New to me. Check it out !!!
