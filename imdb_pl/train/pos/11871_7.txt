Written by Oliver Stone and directed by Brian De Palma, SCARFACE paints a picture that can not be easily forgotten. Al Pacino performs the staggering role of Tony Montana, a Cuban refugee who becomes a powerful player in the drug world because he ruthlessly runs his own Florida crime kingdom. This gangster movie is sharp, violent, loud, glaring, unpleasant and has to keep a record for saying the word "f-k" the most times. Almost three hours or so, it can become repulsive. A strong constitution keeps you in your seat, cheering the ruthless criminal master to death. <br /> <br /> Also interesting are Michelle Pfeiffer, Steven Bauer, Robert Loggia, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, F. Murray Abraham and Angel Salazar. Pacino turns out to be one of his greatest generations. He manages to introduce reality to his character, which leaves a strong impression. It will not be a movie for everyone, because you will leave thinking that you have left the disaster. Is it strong enough for you? Crime does not pay too long!
