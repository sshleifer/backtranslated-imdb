In all the comments that praised or condemned Dalton's performances, I thought he was perfect. He does not play Rochester as a spoiled, rich boy, but as a rogue, powerful man. I liked the version, although sometimes the aspect of the video was distracting, and the scenes with Jane and St. John has never been completely gelled. I give it to 8.
