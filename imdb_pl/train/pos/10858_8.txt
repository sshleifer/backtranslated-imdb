he liked the film and the effective Confucian crime drama, the old order survived the threat posed by a bold, greedy young man, no doubt representing modern society. I thought the final scene was strange and I could not understand whether to believe that the big D was punished for being greedy or part of the plan for a long time. I loved this scene and once in a Chinese film, violence was not a choreographic martial arts festival. The thing that always entertains me in HK's films is that the main influence of the British seems to be the introduction of "yes sir" and "sorry" in the local language and its fun that they are still there long after we've gone.
