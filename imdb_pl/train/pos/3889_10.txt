Eddie Izzard is nothing more than a comedy genius, and this is the best Eddie. His material is extremely witty and funny, and his delivery is one of the best he has ever seen on stage. Instead of insulting the audience's intelligence, it's about humor in wardrobe, Hitler, landing on the moon and the British. With so many unforgettable laughter, it's impossible not to repeat some of the lines. For ever more, "Do you have a flag?" Should be considered one of the funniest lines ever delivered in standup mode. Each fan of the first-class standup comedy must see "Dress to Kill." By far the best British comedian I've ever seen, Eddie Izzard fought for live success on the stage. However, his lack of commercial success in the film should not prove how truly he is extremely talented. "Dress to Kill" is a treasure that happily hit home video and it can and should be viewed again and again.
