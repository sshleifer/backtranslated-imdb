Stephen King's best film next to IT, though this one is more fun than frightening. <br /> <br /> This one has it all: <br /> <br /> - a great cast with Alice Krige and Brian Krause and a funny episode from the King himself; <br /> <br /> - well-manned horror in a funny story; <br /> <br /> - great use of music, in particular the "Sleepwalk" by Santo & Johnny; <br /> <br /> - characteristic figures in the typical setting of the king: the middle of nowhere a village; <br /> <br /> -the moods of humor. You really can not be afraid of it here because it is too much fun and above it; <br /> <br /> - but really cool makeup effects that they do not do anymore! <br /> <br /> Rating 4,5: I really do not understand it. When was the last horror game as funny as this one?
