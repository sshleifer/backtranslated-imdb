For those of you who are not aware of the topic that Kusturica continues with the breaks in his films - the western attack on traditional Serbian values ​​- it will be impossible to understand his narrative. This constant theme, expressed through fantasy and scandalous comedy as his vehicle, is one that Kusturica decided to entrust. Since his fantastic work and "Underground" Magnum Opus, Kusturica's cat's "Cat of the White Cat", "Life Is a Miracle" and more recently "Promise Me This", his slapstick carnival style underlines the "westernization" of Balkan culture, its ambivalent arrival and attack for a traditional idiom. In the case of "Promise Me This" contrasts the paradoxical world of the city (urban space) and space (traditional idiom). The city's world reflects the western attributes that anchored the spatial and temporal setting; organized crime, sexual abuse, the break of the sense of identity and a violent disregard for traditional values ​​- expressed to a young kid - a peasant. The end of the film is another example of how we observe a funeral service and a wedding on a one-way dirt road. They are on a thick collision; accordingly, a wedding that represents the village's life line and pulse, i.e. traditional values, will soon clash with the funeral mourners, illustrating the death of tradition in this context. However, Kusturica genuinely analyzes this topic through his unique, stylistic singularity. His scandalous and extravagant style serves as a vehicle in his performance.
