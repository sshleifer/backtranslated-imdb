"Ship Ahoy" was probably created to present the MGM talent. The film is a fun ocean liner trip on the way to San Juan, Puerto Rico, at a time when the country was involved in the Second World War. It was a typical study fee that gave the film public entertainment as light entertainment in the difficult times in which the country lived. <br /> <br /> The beautiful Eleanor Powell is perceived at its best in some numbers where it clearly shows she was a dancer to be reckoned with. Red Skelton is also seen in a simple part with not too many clowns, because he is chasing beautiful Mrs. Powell on a ship that brings them to Puerto Rico. The inflexible Bert Lahr has a lot of potential in the film to show that he was a funny man. Virginia is also considered to be a funny girl that no one deceives. <br /> <br /> There are good musical numbers with Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra, in which you can see, among others, the incredible Buddha Rich, who has several solos with Mr. Dorsey and Mrs. Powell. Young Frank Sinatra also appears as a band singer supported by Pied Pipers. <br /> <br /> This is a nostalgic journey that should be enjoyed by fans of this genre, which MGM completely controlled.
