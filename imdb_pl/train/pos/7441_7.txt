I personally disregard The Jerry Springer Show, but I found "Ringmaster" as the funniest movie I've seen this year. The endless satire of Jerry Springer's "guests" beginning on the opening scene makes you laugh all over the movie. Despite the short scene in which Jerry Springer makes a poor attempt to justify his existence, I definitely recommend this film for pure entertainment value.
