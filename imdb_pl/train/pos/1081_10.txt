One of the great classic comedies. Not a slapstick comedy, not a heavy drama. Fun, satirical movie, buyers watch out for a guide to a new home. <br /> <br /> Filled with wonderful characters, all of whom, Cary Grant, are convinced, flee to build their dream house. br /> <br /> A great look at life in the late 1940s. <br /> <br />
