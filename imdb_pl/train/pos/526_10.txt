If anyone asks if cinema is a form of art, you can do something worse than point it out in this movie. <br /> <br /> It is simply the perfect combination of history, script, actors and cinematography that have ever been made for celluloid. <br /> <br /> The story of a missing bomber pilot missing from a blue conductor in the English fog during World War II, and his subsequent brushes with celestial authorities (or in his head) played with the nebula of David Niven and Kim Hunter and is extremely moving - especially in the opening scenes, when the doomed pilot (Niven) describes his difficulty to the terrestrial radio operator (Hunter). <br /> <br /> A sense of a different world is reinforced by Jack Cardiff's photography and amazing production projects. <br /> <br /> The highest accents extend to the heavenly shots appearing in the black and white and earth scenes presented in Technicolor - even the heavenly conductor (fantastic Marius Goring) remembers about it. <br /> <br /> Not only the climax of the British cinema, but the climax in the cinema, period.
