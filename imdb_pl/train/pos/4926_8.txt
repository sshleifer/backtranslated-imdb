Elia Kazan, one of the best theater directors in this country, showed that he is equally at home with movies. Thanks to "Panic in the Streets", Mr. Kazan gives us an early version of what will come later, perhaps with his master piece "On the Waterfront", although both films only have a water setting because they are different visions of different actors. <br /> <br /> Mr. Kazan shot in New Orleans. The adaptation of Daniel Fuchs from the story of Edna and Edward Anhalt, which are the basis of the film, is extraordinary because it takes us to places that no tourist dared to see when visiting The Big Easy. One of the greatest assets of this film is the wonderful black and white photography of Joseph MacDonald, which shows New Orleans at its best. Also, the music of Alfred Newman and the song Billie Holiday make the procedure a nice touch. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been filmed in New York or another big northern city, because it shows us characters who speak more like "broklynese" than maybe the southern accent you can hear in this part of the country. <br /> <br /> One thing is clear in the movie, Jack Palance, debuting on the screen, every time the screen sees him. He was so intense! At the same time, this tough guy shows him a delicate side, when he goes to see his sick partner who does not know him, he is affected by a deadly disease. Blackie, comforts this man, caressing his sweaty face and dropping his hands through the fat hair of a dying man. Also noteworthy was the fact that Mr. Palance and Mr. Mostel seemed to do their own tricks, something so refreshing, because both actors make it seem real. <br /> <br /> The movie also presents a normal page with the introduction of the Reed family at the beginning of the movie. We see a family man painting furniture with his young son. Later, he and his wife discuss how it seems that they can not end their salary, which many families have to deal with on a daily basis. Richard Widmark, playing a normal person is not as effective as when the actor plays more cunning and intense people. Barbara Bel Geddes, as a wife, sounds like she was a suburban woman from Connecticut. <br /> <br /> The film is pleasant thanks to Mr. Kazan's direction and the excellent cast of the film.
