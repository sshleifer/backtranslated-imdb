The only program that I have watched since 90210! Why did they stop him? It was the only show that captured the essence of Hawaii and made you feel like part of it all! At least they should do it to release it on DVD! <br /> <br /> I checked similar programs, but nothing happened. The cast had amazing chemistry and I was eagerly awaiting each episode. <br /> <br /> They made a big mistake pulling this show. If anyone has any information about where I can get a DVD from the North Shore, please write a few lines here. Thanks! Aloha!
