Now most people do not watch classic movies like this one. Most friends only watch movies from the 90s. It's a bit skimpy. <br /> <br /> Most of these old films are masterpieces, unique in their own way. Just because when these films were invented and created, it was when ideas were fresh. Now people are only burdened with thinking about new ideas. <br /> <br /> In any case, to the movie. For real fans of classic horror. This is for you. The film is based on a researcher from Scotland Yard, who studies the disappearance of a film actor and encounters three other strange events with former inhabitants of the same house. <br /> <br /> I will not say anymore, because I will ruin the movie more than I already have. But it's a great movie for as old as it is. And I would not mind watching it again!
