The infamous film in front of the code, really the only movie that made people insist on strict enforcement of the Hayes Code. Barbara Stanwyck performs as a young girl whose father sells drinks does not have a problem with picking her up to customers. When she dies in an accident, she is released into the world with the knowledge that her body can get what she wants. He goes to New York and enters the corporate ladder, one bed at a time. Although, of course, there is no sex shown, the movie is quite dingy. Unfortunately, after the initial shock value disappears (while Stanwyck turns the wagon inspector so that she can travel for free), the film becomes a bit repetitive and boring. Stanwyck is the only thing that makes the film worth sitting. As always, it's fantastic.
