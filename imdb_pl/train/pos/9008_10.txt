I saw this movie, not knowing what it was ... I am a fan of Branagh, and even his Shakespeare movies, and at the beginning I saw it only for this ... eyes, because great, great calmness, values, affect the courageous philosophy of the life of Helena's girlfriend . Recommended for people with bored TV programming (at least in Spain).
