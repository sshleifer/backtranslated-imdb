Airwolf The Movie, a variation of the original 2-part pilot, but the film, although shorter, includes additional film material Invisible in a 2-hour pilot The pilot is much more a pilot than the film Where the pilot movie is usually the same (2 connected partners) But the movie is in in fact a different edition with additions here and cut there. <br /> <br /> It's worth a look, even if you have a DVD set from season 1, I'll still receive a copy of "movie" Still in some stores like virgin, Woolworths and similar mixed media stores, although it generally requires ordering, but it saves you the need to buy online (because many of us still do not or do not trust online shopping), but if you look around at airwolfes in stores <br /> <br /> Airwolf was really one of the most underrated concerts of the 80s. <br /> <br /> The full-size Airwolf is currently being rebuilt into the Helicopter Museum:) Information and work in progress Photos are now available at http://Airwolf.org Also with Airwolf modifications for Flashpoint and Flight Simulation games Seams she finally he stay again :)
