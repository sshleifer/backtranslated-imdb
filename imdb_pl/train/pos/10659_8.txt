"Better perfumes are better, they do not last that long ..." - the figure of convicted Ralph Meeker (Lawson) tells this figure of Helenka Barbara Stanwyck, after he got the perfume she chose with her husband in Tijuana ...! This line has torn me apart, and it seemed to be a metaphor of this film - the cheap one is better than the expensive, because a cheap, loving perfume a man who has a way of 2 x 4 is a better man in the long run! I agree with some of the other comments regarding the attractiveness of Helen to Lawson. Although her narrative says she wants Lawson to be set aside, he seemed to be drawn by his fiery nature and the passion he aroused in her would probably not have faded with the tide!
