How friendly, charming and cordial is this unpretentious old series; I was happy to see old Lugosi. It is disarmingly friendly and lively. This is a document about a long lost ship. (The best TV series today can not compete with these old moderately good series.) CHANDU is deep, deeply optimistic and hedonistic. Refreshes the mind. This is not stupid; stupid are those who do not understand how these TV series work. CHANDU has an irresistible sense of simple, unpretentious and friendly fun. <br /> <br /> Without giving too much Chandu is a Western sorcerer who also follows this Eastern name, and loves and protects his niece from the killers' sect. <br /> <br /> Chandu exerts his supernatural gifts in a discreet and moderate way. <br /> <br /> As for the pretty sexy niece, Nadji, she is kidnapped by the priest Ubasti: dirty Vindhyan. A poor sexy girl is in fact repeatedly carried away in a sarcophagus after she fell asleep with a flower; almost kidnapped from the boat; by a false policeman; Lemuria's temple and its strange, scary ceremonies resemble the images of KING KONG and are a barbaric mockery of the RCC ceremonies and rituals. <br /> <br /> Would you protect a girl as bravely as Chandu does? <br /> <br /> Lugosi looked like an old libidinous and rather soulless, nasty drunk, and that only contributed to his performances. Is a prototype nasty drunk uncle, playful and cunning and oblique. This may sound rather crooked tribute to Lugosi, but Burton's biography about Wood left me that impression about Lugosi, and allied with him strong sympathy for the disintegrating actor. I like the fanciful performances of Lugosi. <br /> <br /> This series is unjustly beaten.
