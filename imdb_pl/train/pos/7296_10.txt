There is no connection between Fortier and Profiler, but the fact that both are a police series about violent crimes. Profiler looks crisp, Fortier looks classic. Profiler charts are fairly simple. The story of Fortier is much more complicated ... Fortier looks more like the First Suspect, if we have to see the similarities ... The main character is weak and strange, but has "clairvoyance". People like to compare, evaluate, evaluate. What do you say to have fun? The funny thing is that people writing Fortier look like Americans, but on the other hand they say they prefer American TV series (!!!). Maybe it's a language or a ghost, but I think this series is more English than American. By the way, the actors are really good and fun. Acting is not superficial ...
