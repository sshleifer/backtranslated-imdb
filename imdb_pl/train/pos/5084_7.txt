I was surprised that "The Secret Fury" was a good, enjoyable movie ... Probably because I had no expectations for the movie ... Although the movie has its own role-playing holes ..... I would say that it was impossible to guess who was behind until the very end of the movie ..... At first I thought it was Robert Ryan, using the same method as "Gaslight", where my husband tries to rage his wife, but I was wrong ...... The main problem with the movie is that they drive in a completely different direction, which in the beginning did not give any hints. ..... I thought Robert Ryan and Claudette Colbert wear their parts well ...... Plus, Vivian Vance, a great actress who steals scenes in this ...... Those who like movies that you're guessing will you like this ......
