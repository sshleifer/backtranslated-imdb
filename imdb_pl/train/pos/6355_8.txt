I already loved "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" when it was released and I still love it, 5 years later. Many people still disagree with my opinion and this film never received such great love when it appeared. <br /> <br /> Sure, the movie is oversized and campy, but in the movie it's also the reason why this movie is so charming and fun to watch. All sets, costumes and characters are made perfectly in a fun way without becoming really funny. It's a spectacular movie to watch. This is the best movie in the camp! Director Ron Howard really surprises with this funny, small Christmas movie. <br /> <br /> The main reason why the movie works and why watching is so much fun is Jim Carrey as Grinch. He really wears a movie with his good and funny role. Of course, he helps him with convincing makeup, which he also received an Oscar. Of course, if you're someone with Jim Carrey, you should not even think about watching this movie. This movie is really his movie and it makes everything work and watching is so much fun. Jeffrey Tambor, Clint Howard and Josh Ryan Evans play other fun and unforgettable roles as a young Grinch. <br /> <br /> The movie has good morale, but it's a bit dissatisfied for me. Maybe because I'm a Dutchman and we do not really celebrate Christmas as enthusiastic and great as in the United States or England. For me, the movie was just fun and funny, and the morale just left me quite cool to be honest. <br /> <br /> The music score of James Horner is good and funny, even if it's the average daily material of Horner. Everything still works perfectly for the movie and helps to do some work on the stage. <br /> <br /> Excellent Christmas entertainment. <br /> <br /> 8/10
