I just read the last comments about this movie and would like to answer. you probably do not know the original story of the rap group N.W.A. which dates back to 1988, in 1989 the ice cube left the band to go solo, and finally in 1991, the band broke up when Dr Dre left. which led to a large amount of beef, ranging from the departure of the ice cube and dr.dre in 1991. this story was a bit based on it. <br /> <br /> this movie was a 90 minute laugh, they explained that the song from the shoe juice was a political statement that was fun. not to mention the fact that the "love song" was tasty. and when vanilla sherbert got a kick in the ass, just like the director of the record company is also hilarious and makes managers shoot them every time. <br /> <br /> people who did not like this movie, probably do not get it or they were complete idiots, my opinion
