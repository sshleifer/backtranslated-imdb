I do not know what makes me look like in this movie, but for the first time I saw it, I wanted to see how it ended. I'm not a huge fan of Paul Winfield or war dramas, but I really wondered how and when Winfield would find his child. He only knows that the boy has green eyes. Truth be told, I have not seen this movie for years, nor has it been shown on television for some time, but this movie is a bit of a man's odyssey after the pain of war. Winfield shows a very sympathetic and heart-warming portrait of a man lost in memories. In this film is the message that he is looking for the last piece of human morality in the wake of this war and the reality that he is struggling with. Why this movie is not yet on DVD or video is a mystery to me.
