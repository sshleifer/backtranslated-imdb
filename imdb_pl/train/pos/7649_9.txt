A fun vehicle by Jim Belushi, a modern version of "A A Wonderful Life". Michael Caine plays a kind of angel that allows Belush to see what life would look like if he "made it big." Jim is in the best shape with good history and cast; looks like real chemistry between him and Hamilton. Not a pretender to the Oscar, but good fun with the heart.
