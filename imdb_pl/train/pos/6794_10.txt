I have read most of the comments posted here and I can say that most of these posters have serious problems in life. This performance, unlike most quiz shows, was fun. Mr. Shatner, whose brilliance in EVERYTHING he does, was once again the hit of the show. He is a truly muscular personality who shines like a lantern, wherever he goes. It's funny and makes you smile and that's exactly what the program does. Dancers and questions, fashion for the round they are presenting, only add charm to the concerts. And even if it's a lot of money, it's great. Pressure (stress) occurring in most game shows does NOT exist here. Several people who sent messages complained about how much time they spend with dancers and chooses questions, c. Like Millionaire, there are no similar waste of time. All I can say is that most of you missed the whole concept. The idea is to have fun and PLAY. Everyone will find something for himself. Questions to test your knowledge, sweets for the eyes (dancers), tension, wonderful, fun personality Mr. Shatner ... well, if it does not excite men, I feel bad for you; and if that's not enough, YOU CAN GET RICH! I really miss the show. Of all the games I've ever played, and to be honest, HATE is going to quit, that's what I really like and I miss. The only other game show I liked was a match game.
