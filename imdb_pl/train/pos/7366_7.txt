This is a movie that the mainstream market will probably never be able to access because it does not give viewers an easy viewing experience. The story of anxious Spike and his friend Heaton is not exactly the movie of a Friday evening, but it has its unique advantage and I found it funny. There are moments of greatness because the movie was shot on a budget as low as when Spike inhales the spray. However, I did not really understand the relationship between Spike and Heaton and to be honest, he forced me to try to solve most of the movie. I did not like the fact that the majority of the film is spent with two friends talking and not too "action". It is a small movie that is complicated to watch and that makes it attractive.
