For the first time we sat with my best friend and watched this movie, we watched it for Alex Winter with the fame of "Bill and Ted". We did not know what to expect except for who and what it was. <br /> <br /> Before the movie ended, we knew it was love at first sight. This film, though not entirely historically accurate, was and is the best in its genre. I have seen other films showing the history of this famous summer and in my opinion none of the others can compare. It was slightly charred in some detail, but these parts did not differ from the pure elegance and romance of this story. I've seen other movies this summer and I think most of them are good, but none of them is as addictive as this. <br /> <br /> "Haunted Summer" has the features of the picture. Colors and settings seem to be something that can be found on canvas, framed and suspended in a museum or on the walls of an eccentric house. The costumes were beautiful and even though they were not the most comfortable clothes in the world, I made that I wanted to find a dressmaker to create such a robe for myself. The whole film was set on the picturesque Lake Geneva (where I hope one day to go because of watching this movie) and the calm that these historical figures found there. <br /> <br /> This film shows, apart from the peace found by all the escapees of the harsh courts of England, the strangeness that surrounded this adventure. Yes, there were drugs. At the time, it was a fairly common practice, a time when drugs were not illegal. And taking laudanum (liquid form of opium) was curative and recreational. Shelley was suffering from consumption. Lord Byron suffered a painful foot. No wonder there will be prescriptions for the strong drugs that were in their possession this summer. And they were poets at a time when the key was experience. There was no time for cautious caution. Passion and experience were a big part of the romantic period. From the thoughts and discussions about science, religion and philosophy, the legend was born: "Frankenstein." <br /> <br /> Yes, in this movie we see a beautiful and liberated Mary Godwin (not married Shelley at the time) played by a beautiful and talented Alice Krige. It is a controlling factor for everything that happens until it also has experience. But she stands on the ground and experiences things on her own terms. Like the strength she inherited from her mother and father. <br /> <br /> The actors and actresses in this were perfect for the parties that played. Matching music. The direction captured the essence of summer, which I read about. This film was made on the basis of the great book "Haunted Summer" by Anne Edwards. If you like this video, read the book. The author takes a story of what she managed to collect from the real magazines of Mary Godwin Shelley and other participants in this story. <br /> <br /> If you are a person who loves history (even small inaccuracies from time to time) and romance and gothic, this is a movie for you. It shows the birth of a monster that even today teaches us about the morality of "playing God." <br /> <br /> Determined to see the movie!
