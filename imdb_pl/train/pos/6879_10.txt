"The Groove Tube" was one of only two films by Ken Shapiro, the second is also the evil "Modern Problems". This is just a full-scale TV parody. In addition to Shapiro - who apparently did not do anything after "Modern Problems" - the film also features Chevy Chase and cousin Henry Winkler Richard Belzer. Three cast members (plus a few other people in smaller roles) appear in various sketches. One of the funniest presents Chase in an ad pretending to be Geritol, in which he describes medicine as his wife, and ends in the fact that he is sad. There is also a pornographic information program, an annoying culinary program and an epic story about some drug traffickers. <br /> <br /> Either way, the whole thing is just real. In my opinion, the three best films that pretend to be TV are the one, plus "Tunnelvision" and "Kentucky Fried Movie" (although I can also join "The Truman Show"). Really fun. <br /> <br /> I wonder what happened to Ken Shapiro.
