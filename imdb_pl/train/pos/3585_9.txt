A great story about teenagers, leaders, "stars" of school football. How far will you go to protect your friends? To lie, to kill? How much can you lose if you're stadiumed by an innocent girl? Can love overcome chances? Can you beat people with limited minds and small cities? When your friend scores a goal and you "lose", will you do everything in your power to pay for it, or will you be about this man and respect her right to choose? Will you rap it and show it as your victory over the "problem girl"? Can you stand by who is the only sin, have your own opinion, be able to make your own decisions, choose for yourself? I thought twice before I pronounced judgment on who was right and who was wrong, but one is for sure - a very worrying movie and subject in general. Thumb up!
