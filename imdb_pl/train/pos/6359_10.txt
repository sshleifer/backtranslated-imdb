If you went to this movie to see a great presentation of the academy awards ... well ... but if you'd like to see a funny, delightful adaptation of an old classic, you'll love it ... Jim Carey was amazing as usual. The plot was great, a few parts added, as the story of Grinch made it even better. Ron Howard has never missed the rhythm. But although we have added a few comments and comments for ADULTS, this is to be a show for children or a family. Try not to lose sight of this ... if you really do not like watching the movie ... and when it comes to comments on Ron Howard, try to make a big movie and see how you do it ... it's not easy as it looks. ..
