Brazilian films often receive more positive ratings than they deserve. Rather unbelievably, Contra Todos (Against Everybody) (the original title that the producers rejected: God Against Everybody) got a very low GPA (average rating) on ​​this page. It seems that women are widely rejected by viewers. Actually, it's not so brutal. I mean, when it comes to graphic violence. His brutality is inextricable because it represents would-be lumpen, I mean weaker citizens who actually have technically advanced equipment who coldly execute murder orders in exchange for "grana graud". Is this a postmodern man? Is he worried only by the fast, almost impersonal, ultra-permissive position, among the saturated meals? The picture is probably the best Brazilian film from 2004. His shiny style of editing, à la Godard, his interesting counterpoints of the soundtrack, his more than an effective overall cast, and above all the original narrative, with subtle non-chronological hidden points that reveal themselves only in the epilogue, deserve at least an 8 mark.
