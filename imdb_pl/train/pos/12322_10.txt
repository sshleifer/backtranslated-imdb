This movie is one of my favorites. It is a mixture of genres with components Action- / Horror- / Romantic- / Comedygenre. Some special effects may seem outdated compared to modern standards. This slight defect is easily ignored. There is much to discover in this story. The romantic relationship between the two main heroes is so beautiful that it hurts. The graphics are beautiful too. The action is great, which is not a surprise, it comes from Honkong, the birthplace of the best action movies in the world. Humor sometimes seems a bit stupid, but in a good way. Somehow this movie is able to balance different moods and is good. Absolutely recommended.
