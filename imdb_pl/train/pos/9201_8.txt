Dev Anand (or Prashant) and Zeenat Aman (Jasbir / Janice) are siblings raised in single parent families. Jasbir (sister) grows up in a prosperous environment, but it is not enough to reject life and eventually join the hippie movement, which ultimately leads her into drugs. On the other hand, Prashant (brother) grows up in a less prosperous environment, but grows up to be a mature gentleman. The story is about Prashant, who is trying to save his younger sister (who is eternally in a trance) from a hostile hippie community. This film withstands the test of time, commenting that cults and hippie groups are a place for those who give up their lives when instead they should stand up and face adversities. Great musical compositions in this movie, which mean different things in different situations and for different people, and the director evokes a strange feeling in it.
