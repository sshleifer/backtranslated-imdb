This shortcut is a surprise. Words fail me here because it's almost indescribable, technically unique after more than 90 years (visuals are unusual and sometimes even amazing), it's not something you watch if you like things that are mundane or "normal", because most certainly not too, it's a strange gang, it's worth checking out, but if things like Ren and Stimpy make your head hurt, you can skip it.
