This is one of the best films from the 80s in the MY collection, about which I think all the time. <br /> <br /> The running man is one of Arnold's best and most different films, even to this day, and when I saw "Running Man" for the first time, I was so excited to see such a movie. I love all fights and it's a really special movie. He also has Jesse Ventura, legendary Toru Tanak, Sven-Ole Thorsen, beautiful Maria Conchita Alonso, Yapheta Kotto, Kurt Fuller, Richard Dawson and Thomas Rosales Jr., who always like death in their films because he was killed in films like Universal Solder, The Lost World, Robo Cop 2, Predator 2 and more. All fans of Arnold should love this movie from beginning to end, because his action is full, the star filled, and his only one of the best so far in Arnold!
