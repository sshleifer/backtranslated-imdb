Miracle. One of the best musicals in history. The three Busby Berkely numbers that end the movie are spectacular, but what makes this movie so great is the amazing non-stop and natural action of Cagney and Blondell. (Keeler is also cute, although maybe she was not a great actress). There is freshness in the film, which is not seen in movies today, much less in films with 30 often-tuned fragments, although the plot, including the creation of film prologues, is quite outdated.
