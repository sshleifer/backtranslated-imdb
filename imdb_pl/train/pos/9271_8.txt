That's what one of the girls said at the end. <br /> <br /> Is playing football a metaphor for a qualifying game between girls (or, more broadly, a free-thinking group) and power? "To Germany" means the future of hope? <br /> <br /> This is one of the most unforgettable film experiences I have ever had - despite raw cinematography and plot and gentle action (though I like casting - they are loved and far above the expectations for amateurs). This absurd situation is well captured. I feel the deep frustration that is denied to the game (being a woman and a football fan) and I can not stop thinking how to make a convincing disguise. I wonder why there is no women's section to protect against dirty language and bad behavior - overcoming defective reasons for refusal. <br /> <br /> The movie is very cleverly made - an amazing title, filming during the game itself, spontaneity and various methods to introduce viewers in the shoes of the heroes - a game that is so important but unavailable (not shown), tempting light and cheering sound from the stadium, closing the van and its uselessness when people inside connect with the crowds outside. I feel the comfort of radio, drinks and food, and of course goodness and attention from every character to others. During the final credits I am amused that no character has a name - he is just a "soldier" and she is just a "girl" or "sister".
