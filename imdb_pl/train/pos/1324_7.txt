You sit there for half an hour and watch the story, believe it all, and then watch another half hour of the same story completely unraveled ... and then you meet again. Brilliant. <br /> <br /> One of the most exciting feature films at the San Francisco International Film Festival is a documentary. I do not know if - apart from Andrew Jarecki's "Capturing the Friedmans" - there was never something like "Forbidden Lie $" by Anna Broinowski. It contains, exposes, defends, reveals and questions everything related to Norma Khouri, the author of Honor of Honor, the best-known 2001 bestseller on honor killings in Jordan. <br /> <br /> What's amazing? the film is so unique that this "exposure" of Khouri is made with the full participation of Khouri. <br /> <br /> In the beginning of the film, Khouri presents her story about the alleged murder of her friend Amman, the history of the book. It sounds completely credible, convincing. <br /> <br /> Then her story is dismantled, revealed by eminently credible and convincing people, such as women's rights activists in Jordan, investigative journalists there and in Australia, where Khouri lived for a while. <br /> <br /> Khouri returns and denies the accusations by doing a successful lie detector test. Another segment of devastating exposures is arriving - indefinable here, because it would reduce the value of shock ... and then Khouri returns and faces accusations (not all but important in the book). /> <br /> And Houdini's act lasts, with round after round in this hard, swing fight for the prize, surprise after surprise - and there is no "happy ending" in the sense of resolution. Excellent.
