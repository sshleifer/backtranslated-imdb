This movie (with the alternative title "Martial Law 3" for some reason) introduced me to Jeff Wincott for the first time. And that was a great introduction. Although I had never heard of him before, he seemed a perfect warrior. The action scenes in this movie are GREAT! By the way, there are many of them. The recruitment fight in the Staff of the Peace Missions is particularly good. There's something about one guy who hits people's shit, which is really fun. And for the rest of the cast: Brigitte Nielsen was a good choice for the villain. Roles like this match it (but others do not). As always, Matthias Hues did a good job. He is a great fighter and macho-like figure and he was a good rival for Wincott in this movie.
