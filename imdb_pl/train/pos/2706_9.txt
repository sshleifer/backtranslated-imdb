I saw this movie at the International Film Festival in Brussels. I also met the director of the film. I heard that Ed Wood wrote this story in 10 years! I am sure that he thought that his work would be his masterpiece - his triumph. <br /> <br /> Well, if you're taking the movie seriously (like Mr. Wood), it's really one of the worst movies you'll ever see. And that's cool. The big joke from Woke Up Early The Day and Died is that it does not even try to be a decent movie. <br /> <br /> It makes the movie very, very good. The screenplay is full of nihilism and anarchism - a lot of black humor. Billy Zane's role is absolutely perfect. You see, it's either high art ... or low trash. <br /> <br /> **** / *****
