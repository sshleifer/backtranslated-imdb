What can I say, I grew up watching Hum Saath Saath Hain, Hum Aapke Hain Koun and Maine Pyar Kiya. Soraj have always been different. Films are part of our lives in times of evolution Soraj creates something that is difficult to find. Love and a common family that loves and great. Vivah is a journey for a couple who organizes a marriage that includes organizing and loving marriage. Shahid did a great job. Anupamji as always brilliant. Amrita Rao gave up on others, although I felt that somehow the latter did not suit me. We saw her in Ishk Vishk and Ab ke baras and Main ho on Na. So give up another role that does not exist. She was excellent at Main ho na Na and ishk vishk, but maybe she could put some more into this role. In any case, Barjatya's great job. This film renews the values ​​we forgot about. Sweet movie of the year. Great music and lyrics. I'm not sure if it's a remake, but it's a genius story that's original. Soraja's films were brilliant all the time, so we always expect something different from him. Great work of all cast members and everyone. A beautiful family movie in which you can enjoy with your parents, siblings, friends and loved ones. I give 10 out of 10.
