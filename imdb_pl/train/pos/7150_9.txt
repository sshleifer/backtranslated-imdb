What a great movie! It's like the great Disney movies from the '60s and' 70s. I was so pleasantly surprised that after the last 20 years of absolute detritus, Disney's production crews appeared live. <br /> <br /> This movie is an absolute joy. Children's stars were just that; professional high-quality actors. I am impressed by the quality of this film. <br /> <br /> Sigourney Weaver was a complete sykofantyczna * insert, leading camp for wayward boys. Siobhan Fallon was great as a mother of the star. <br /> <br /> I will not tell this story because there is no point in doing it once again, but the story is great, the direction was extraordinary and the quality of the game was great! This job reminds you of what it is like to be a child, not being sweet or too gloomy. Deleted scenes from the DVD version were really best removed. They were too strict for this film and they took so much of it. While the abuse was suggested in the finished product, it was not shown to some extent. That was the best way. <br /> <br /> It was an absolutely great movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Get 9/10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
