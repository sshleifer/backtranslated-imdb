For years I had to see it several times. I was about fifteen years old when I first saw him at B & W at the local PBS station. <br /> <br /> I bought a DVD set so that children could see it and have him watch it. They do not teach history at school, and this explains the most critical event of the 20th century. It extends their critical thinking. <br /> <br /> Impressively, with participants from all sides, explaining with their own words what they are doing and why it contains details, which led to war and the war itself. <br /> <br /> Buy for your kids, along with America's Alistair Cooke. Watch them with them and make them understand. You will be very happy that you did it.
