The Williams family lives on a ranch located in the middle of a distant desert. They are in great danger when the place is suddenly thrown into the vortex of time in which the past, present and future collide in a terribly chaotic and unpredictable way. Director John "Bud" Cardos begins the film with an incredibly mysterious note and gradually makes things become stranger, crazier and more exciting when a crazy story unfolds. What's more, Cardos fills the screen with a lot of dazzling visual effects and does a good job creating a real sense of admiration and admiration. Wonderful honest acting from the game qualifies as another big plus: Jim Davis as cordial Patriarch Grant Williams, Dorothy Malone as his cheerful wife Ana, Christopher Mitchum as interested Richard, Marcy Lafferty as his charming wife Beth, Natasha Ryan as sweet little girl Jenny and Scott C. Kolden as a brave Steve. Functional special effects offer an inspired combination of fierce miniatures, shapely monsters of stop-motion animation (these creatures include a tiny spindly hairless man, a large, uneven beast with fangs and a skinny lizard guy) and nice dull paintings. Richard Banda's striking full orchestral score really strikes a thrilling place. John Arthur Morrill's clear, sunny cinematography is also successful. A fun movie.
