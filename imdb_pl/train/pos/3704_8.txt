In general, it is difficult to evaluate these "cut and paste" films. Some segments may be quite good, while others lower the rating of the entire product. In this, for example, the scene for girls in the Doctor's office was quite exciting ... one of the best in the history of watching (limited) this viewer. Then there is the Asia segment ... the lady is always fun. And the story that connects the whole was an interesting concept. The exchange scene that closes the offer is not bad either. Technically production values ​​are quite high. Recommended.
