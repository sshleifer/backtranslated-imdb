Four prisoners share one cell: a dominant transvestite, Marcus (Clovis Cornillac); Marcus's idiot savant buddy, Paquerette (Dimitri Rataud), who will eat everything in sight, including pocket watches, cockroaches and his younger sister; Lassalle (Philippe Laudenbach), an intelligent librarian who murdered his wife; and Carrère (Gérald Laroche), a new guy who has been caught in corporate fraud and is now focusing on escaping. After the brick falls from the cell wall, men discover a hidden diary written by the serial killer "Fountain of Youth", which occupied the cell in the 1920s. Is this journal the secret of their escape? Or maybe there is something more sinister behind it? <br /> <br /> I was a little tired of entering the movie because the only other experience with Eric Valette was the horrible One Missed Call (2008), which was the worst theatrical release I've ever seen. However, much of what was wrong with One Missed Call is probably attributable to the horrible Klavan script because (as I remember) the direction of Valette was not the worst part of the movie (unless he decided to include the child). In any case, Maléfique was a good way to regain my respect. . . it's a French movie (of course something I like) and takes place in prison (which is my second favorite place of horror after the asylum). It's two points for him before the movie starts. Fortunately, Valette had me after the movie ended. Maléfique is a rather deep, rather complex, quite convincing story of obsession and desperation. . . desire and need to introduce fantasy into reality. Although it is not a frightening movie in the traditional sense, the singularity of its power makes it terribly frightening. The period between the culmination and the end was one of the best movies I've seen for a long time and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a decent psychological thriller with a pretty cool gore. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 8.5 / 10. Enough of some respect gained by Valette. <br /> <br /> Note: Paramount has taken away the rights to the American remake (surprise). This is due to appear in 2009. I'm not sure why, to be honest, because it does not seem like something that would be a great money maker in the States. But earlier I was surprised. <br /> <br /> Vive La France! <br /> <br /> -AP3-
