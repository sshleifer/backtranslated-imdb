This movie has great potential. The script is sharp, the dialogue is (usually) excellent (although it may lose a perverse voice), the direction and photos are surprisingly good, although some experiments simply do not work. The main problem here is David Duchovny. I used to be a geek-boy, always a geek-boy; and the sad, simple fact is that he can not play anything except Fox Mulder. He poses, tries to be slippery, poses, tries to be macho. In the end, he's just too old. He defeats his character, exaggerates with lines, and simply plays it in every sense, Timothy Hutton and Angelina Jolie, each of whom is in the class above him in terms of acting skills. Timothy Hutton was (as always) really good. There was a moment when he sprinkled his role, but you could say he had fun. He looked like a part and became a figure both physically and atmospherically. Angelina Jolie was really good too. She did not have a great role; in fact, although she could have used a much stronger one ... her character was not sufficiently developed, though she did well with what she had. And the chemistry between her and Hutton was obvious (oh, maybe that's why Uma left him ...;) In total, she was rough on the edges, but a solid effort from a good cast and excellent supporting roles. If David Duchovny did not tear his role to pieces, it would be much better. 7/10.
