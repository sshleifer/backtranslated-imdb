The main aspect of this movie, which most people long for, is that Luhzin lives his life as a game of chess. So many people have seen this movie and it just did not get it, and I do not understand why. While watching this movie, I was taken on a private journey that kidnapped me. I will try to explain it without any spoilers, but be prejudiced, I'm talking about things that happen in the movie. <br /> <br /> **** Possible spoilers **** Be Forewarned! **** <br /> <br /> His life is "big moves" and "small moves". He chooses Natalia for the queen, and he and she behave the way his aunt first described the king and queen and their movements when she introduced him to the chess as a boy. Listen carefully to this description. <br /> <br /> When someone asks him a question, he returns to the past, as if reviewing previous movements. (Incidentally, the memories are beautifully lit.) Retrospectures are also very interesting because they give not only their point of view as a child, but also the point of view of the other character. It's stunning. <br /> <br /> Different heroes become either his helpers or enemies, pawns, bishops and knights, their actions enlighten you, whose side they are. Even putting them in the scene is crucial to understanding what is happening. Beautifully done. <br /> <br /> I will not comment more on what is happening with Luhzin, but I hope that this will brighten up what is happening at the end. <br /> <br /> This movie is constantly working on many levels, that's why I support it. It was a feast and joy to watch. <br /> <br /> If you like this movie, I would recommend a movie called Fresh. The only way these movies are similar is to use chess and heroes treated like pieces. <br /> <br />
