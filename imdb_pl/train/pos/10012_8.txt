The Night Listener is probably not one of William's finest roles, but he creates a very interesting character in a somewhat strange but very different film. I can guarantee you that you've never seen this kind of movie before. Some people may not like the slow pace of this movie, but I think it's a big plus for the movie. This is definitely one of the best films that appeared in 2006. He has an intriguing performance in the film with great content, dramatic feeling. This is not an Americanized movie. It is also not a predictable film. You just feel it is a movie that has secrets that are difficult to determine what the result may be. This is not a perfect movie that has everything, but hell, it's a damn good and very original movie.
