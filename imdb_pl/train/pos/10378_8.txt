This movie is an hour of good entertainment and really authentic moments. I loved Matt and Malutki. They seemed to be the most engaging and funny characters and certainly the most interesting. Matt is very good (just as he is not his good cousin), and the policewoman and blonde motorcyclists provide a nice eye. I must say I saw striking similarities between Matt and other Australian actor Eric Bana. My favorite part was the brothel scene, I loved it. In conclusion, I liked the film, which will score 8. However, I have been disappointed. It was a side curling iron, not the right laces. <br /> <br /> Of course, I'm kidding. :)
