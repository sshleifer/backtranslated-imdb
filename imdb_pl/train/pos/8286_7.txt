Larry Fessenden was beaten by most of the comments in this forum. The worst mistake, of course, is film marketing and the way the DVD could have been the target. Of course, this is not a real horror, at least for people waiting for something that will be bloody and immediately rewarding. <br /> <br /> "Wendigo" is basically a movie that seems to be told by the young Miles's mind. Things that are not easily understood by children tend to remain in their young minds and ultimately dominate their fears and dangerous worlds that they can not understand. It is obvious that Kim, the mother, is a psychologist, but she has no idea what is happening in her son's mind. It is also a story of alienation. It is clear that father, George, is a distant figure, maybe a workaholic who seems to live in a different world. <br /> <br /> Miles' concerns reach the critical point during the week in the country. This part of the state of New York, with its winter landscape, barren trees, destroys the imagination of the boy. It does not help that he meets a strange figure in the city, creates even more doubts in his young mind. Ultimately, Miles's world falls on him, and he can do nothing, even invoking the spirit of Wendigo. <br /> <br /> The movie is at a good pace and works. Patricia Clarkson is perfect, regardless of where the movie is. Jake Weber is perfect as a distant father who has a chance to get closer to a son he does not understand. Erik Per Sullivan, as Miles, transmits internal confusion in him. I thought it was extremely effective, because the whole movie is a record of Miles, what's going on around him. Finally, John Spredakos is perfect as a menacing Otis, a man who has a grudge against the world for how it turned out. <br /> <br /> Instead of postponing the film for later, future viewers should approach him with an open mind.
