This early shortcut to Biograph was so cool to watch. The second on the D.W. Griffith's "Years of Discovery" DVD set (highly recommended) contains three great performances of the main characters and it is interesting to note that Henry B. Walthall (The Little Colonel, Birth of a Nation) as a camp musician gives the Count the eye and other things). <br /> <br /> The Countess's husband gets mad at his wife's betrayal and has her walled up in a small room with his lover. It's unbelievable that they did not hear the wall rise, but hey, maybe the wine had something to do with it. Here, Mr. Johnson (father of the silent player Raymond Hackett) gesticulates wildly and this adds to the melodrama, but in an unexpectedly comical way. The best moment comes at the end. When the lady comes out of shock and fear, when she realizes that she is doomed, Henry raises his instrument and "cheers" her over her. The way he did it was so unexpected and strangely sexy that I just lost it and laughed. The expression on his face! From that moment, Henry B. Walthall charmed me.
