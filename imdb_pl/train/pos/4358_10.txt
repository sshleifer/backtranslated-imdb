Okay, this movie probably deserves 7 out of 10 stars, but I voted for "10" to help balance the misleading assessment of a handful of god who gave this film a zero or one star review. Each of the segments of this anthology shows enormous potential and promise to talented artists ... three of them have achieved significant success in Hollywood's great productions. The performances range from harsh to absolutely impressive, with remarkable turns of Bill Paxton, James Karen, Vivian Schilling and Brion James. Martin Kove can be a great melodrama as a psychotic hypnotist with a bizarro-strobe lamp, and Lance August seems deliberately eclipsed as a unsuspecting lab victim. But overall, he has some great laughs and some really terrifying moments. It's definitely worth seeing, so judge for yourself!
