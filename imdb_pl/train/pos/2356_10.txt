Pushing Daisies was a great show. Like Dead Like Me and Wonderfalls, it can be said that it was created by Bryan Fuller. I can understand how upset people are who do not have much love for theater, movies, musicals and the like. This is not a typical television program, and fantastic for some is too much. These people seem to need a slightly more linear and muted tone to make them happy. This program explodes in color, winks at old movie scenes, humming with amazing music and talented performances. There is nothing random in the choices made from the costume to the leitmotif. This story has many twists and turns, but all of them are very accessible because conversations concern love, honesty, courage, loss and many other things that we struggle with every day. The only unfortunate aspect was the ending of the show that was cast because Pushing Daisies was canceled. Do not approach this as a typical television program. Think of it as an evening in the theater, then sit back and enjoy!
