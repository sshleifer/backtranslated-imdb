Just well written, directed and played ... The best of Woody's 2000, if not his best since the 1980s !! Hugh Jackman was the perfect choice for his roll. The longing of Scarlett Johansson with Woody proves how well the actress she became. <br /> <br /> Refreshing is that there are no affairs with the main lady. The game of a perfect dark magician. <br /> <br /> There have been several malicious reviews for this video. Do not let them stop you from watching a wonderfully made movie. The people in the crowd with whom I saw it laughed so loudly on some lines that I missed the next line. If you like Woody Allen movies from the 70's, you'll regret it. <br /> <br /> I suggest you watch this movie with an open mind, if so, you can go out smiling.
