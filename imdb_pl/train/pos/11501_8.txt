I can barely remember this program, a bit, but I remembered it was great! My oldest brother reminded me recently about the concert and I saw an ad for the D.V.D exhibition. The network, again fucked up, pulling it out of the air so that they could put what else in this place? It should be at least 3 seasons. Why not, right? I think that sometimes network executives believe that they are the "gods" of the world of entertainment. But they can not guess and lose a good place from time to time. Let's say that they have much more flaps than "hits." It was one of the weak decisions to cut off from the warehouse. Anyway, I get it for my collection.
