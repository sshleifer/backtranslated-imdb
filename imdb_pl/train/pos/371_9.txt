I remember when this movie was ready for the Oscar and did not win in any category. Throughout my life I can not remember what happened to it, but one thing I can say: it was one of the best films I've ever seen. And the fact that Steven Spielberg directed the film did not convince me a bit. <br /> <br /> Basically it's about the trials and suffering of a black woman who grows up from girl to woman. There are many innuendos that are disturbing and frightening, but all are needed to see how much this woman endured. On the way, we see other women who had to endure their hardships and go with them to redemption. Whoopi Goldberg gives her the best performance in this film. Danny Glover should have at least nominated him for the role in this film. <br /> <br /> And the best part of this movie is that it treats its subjects in a humane way, not like some freak shows, such as the newer "Beloved." I encourage anyone from any race to watch this movie. 9/10
