Ride with the Devil, as later Brokeback Mountain Anga Lee, is a film of aesthetic and historical importance. Film lovers should see it at least twice, because its artistic nuances are worth understanding. <br /> <br /> An excellent work of art, surprising depth of humanity. I really do not remember the next war movie, I will catch you, I will change your previous conception of history and politics, I will restore your faith in humanity. After seeing so many killings, so many sufferings, you do not feel numb, but you value the bond between people. Actors' performances haunt your heart, music directs your mind. Some shoots are not just some photos, they go themselves, becoming the vision of the soul. This is the true meaning of a film that is a genre of art. <br /> <br /> This type of movie does not need long comments or reviews, everything that he says himself. Ovation to the cast, including Tobey Maguire, Jeffrey Wright and Jewel Kilcher, cinematographer and composer of beautiful and lyrical music, what an achievement!
