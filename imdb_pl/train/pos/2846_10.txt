I'm not a writer or critic ... I'm just a student who saw this movie a few minutes ago .... And I want to thank the people who worked on creating this movie! the most .... but it touched my heart ... why ?? I would like to understand it myself ... it's easy and accessible .. it's a movie that makes you feel good after a bad day without regret It's about love and care for the life we ​​have, but sometimes we miss it because of material things ....... Look at all the time we have, but we miss him. ... why fu * k do we do it? We must live as they die ... we care for every second and remember: if we do good things - good things come back to us! Happiness is real ... and it has a special taste in New York ... I love this city and the world in which we live !!! Thank you very much for the movie and I apologize for my mistakes (English is my second language) ...
