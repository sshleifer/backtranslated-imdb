Although I like the EE book "Doc" by Smith and the book by Lensman David A. Kyles, the anime based on books is quite fun and quite innovative. <br /> <br /> Although the story may seem familiar to Sci-Fi / Fantasy lovers, just like a kid on an isolated planet inherits mystical powers and takes revenge on the death of his family, yet it is quite entertaining. In addition, Lensman was the first animated film that used hand-drawn and animated CG simultaneously. Of course, it may look a bit outdated, but it is still an innovation. Were it not for Lensman, nothing like this ever happened (personally I think that computer graphics look better in animation that works live.) <br /> <br /> It's a pity they only released it on DVD / VCD a few countries in worls (mainly in formats that are quite foreign and others). I would just like them to release the Lensman movie and series on DVD / VCD in EVERY part of the world, not only in some parts. <br /> <br /> P.S. Rules for Worsel! I just think that it is so amazing and looks good.
