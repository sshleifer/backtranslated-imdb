A very good film about martial arts and Jet Li is the best from the master Bruce Lee. Li is perfect as a low librarian / policeman who saves all the time. It has a presence and a look that is thrilling and credible like a kung fu king with whom you do not bother. charm at the same time, which I found unforgettable. The villain, the man with sunglasses and long hair was also very good, but I can not find his name in the subtitles, can anyone help me with this? Thanks ! Enjoy the Hak hap or Black Mask, good entertainment in any language!
