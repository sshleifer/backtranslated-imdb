This is not as violent as I expected, which makes the brutal scenes seem all the more brutal and effective. <br /> <br /> There are many twists, shifts and double intersections that make it difficult to know which side a particular character is on. <br /> <br /> The plot is great, with good dialogue and character development, and gives an interesting view of the Triad gang's functioning. <br /> <br /> Violence, when it is coming, is brutal, there are no weapons or martial arts scenes with special effects, it is credible in your face violence and throughout the dialogue you can never forget that the Triad is a brutal criminal organization . <br /> <br /> The ending is surprising, but completely consistent and reliable.
