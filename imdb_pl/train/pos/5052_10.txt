It's an excellent movie. As a Canadian who grew up with a rural lifestyle, most of them are known for winter, canoeing, traps, hunting and so on. It is easy to take it for granted, but after watching the movie several times it has grown up on me. <br /> <br /> The story of Gray Owl is well known to many Canadians for the merits of director Attenborough and screenwriter Nicholson for expanding the story. <br /> <br /> Brosnan presents a complex man well, a very good performance. Annie Galipeau is adorable in her first major role. The rest of the cast is solid.
