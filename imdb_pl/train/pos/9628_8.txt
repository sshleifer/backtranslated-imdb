Some of my favorite films, Laurel and Hardy, have a very, very small story. Instead, they give them a pretty mundane situation and let them be funny! Movies like HELP MATES and BUSY BODIES are among the funniest, as you can see boys working or cleaning the house. Here at DIRTY WORK, most of the movie is similar to these two other films - Stan and Ollie are chimney sweepers and most of the film is trying (quite unsuccessfully) to clean the crazy chimney of the professor. Seeing Ollie falling from the chimney, the boys make a total mess out of the house, and Stanley's crazy behavior works together to create a very nice movie. <br /> <br /> However, in a strange phrase there is also a really strange story that begins and ends the movie. It seems that the professor is a really crazy scientist and he is working on a formula that will make things younger. At the end of the movie you see how he makes a duck into a duckling, and even a duckling in an egg! Given that then he leaves the boys alone in the room, is it a surprise, what happens next? Although this thread was unnecessary, it worked well enough. The central part acted exceptionally well. Give the boys nothing interesting to do and you will be surprised by funny results. One of the better videos of the band and almost earns 9.
