Many people are wrong to throw on this series, but some of Guinea Pig's films are quite entertaining. In particular, Devil's Experiment has really fantastic effects - not only the infamous stage of the eyeball, but also a very realistic piece of skin on the foot, and breaking the hand of a blacksmith's hammer is very realistic - especially for the film and its low budget. <br /> <br /> Let me start from the beginning for those who do not know: this movie is an "extreme" film about torture / false snuff that appeared in Japan in the mid-1980s. This plot is simple: a young girl is held by several men and forced to undergo a series of violent tortures to see where her breakthrough is. This involves brutal violence - all effectively realistic effects, including those mentioned in the last paragraph, as well as the painful appearance of hot oil on the shoulder of captivity and placing worms in the next flaky wound. <br /> <br /> The least effective sequences are at the very beginning of the film and consist of an unconvincing session of the cheeks, in which three men take turns patting the girl when her head falls and the second sequence in which three men alternate to kick a girl and pushing her to the ground. These two scenes are of course staged and deplete the realism of the rest of the debate. <br /> <br /> The actress who plays the victim of the "experiment" is quite convincing that she suffers and takes a lot of abuse and raw things in the camera. Her reactions, when she has headphones attached to her head and loud sounds played for hours, are cool. Some of the other abuses he uses are suspended from the tree only when he is resting. There is also a disturbing scene in which the giggling hijackers fall into her innards and another disgustingly dingy scene in which she spins in an office chair and is forced to drink a bottle of Jack Daniels until she vomits. you did not see this series I hope I helped you decide if you want to give this episode a chance. 8.5 / 10 for Devil's Experiment.
