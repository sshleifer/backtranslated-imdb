This low-budget digital video has strengths in the right places - writing and acting. In addition, digital photography is the best of all.

It is a bottom-up film, at its best, leading a playful dialogue with the story of a cowboy "Midnight Cowboy" about griffons doing everything to survive in urban San Francisco.
