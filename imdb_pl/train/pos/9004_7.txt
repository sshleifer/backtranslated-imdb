I had doubts about another love story in which people with disabilities find meaning and redemption thanks to honest communication. And it's still not on top of my list. But the performances of Helena Bonham Carter and Kenneth Branagh and exemplary, almost stunning and saving it before the next tearing. Carter's picture of the victim of ALS is strong, perhaps even exaggerated (sometimes her dialogue dissolves into indistinct mutterings). But the overall effect is praiseworthy and satisfying. Branagh can be a perfect complement to her performance. <br /> <br />
