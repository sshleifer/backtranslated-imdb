Originally, it was supposed to be a movie that would play Gene Kelly, but when the creators could not get it, they got the "biggest actor in the world" and the result is quite good. Basically, Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) has problems doing what he does best by setting a high-stakes game because he needs $ 1,000 to get a seat. To get the money he needs, he has a $ 1,000 bet with an old friend Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando), who can not force Sergeant Sarah Brown (who won the Great Expectation) to win the Golden Globe and BAFTA nominee Jean Simmons Havana. In the meantime, Nathan has problems getting rid of a woman who wants her to ask for her hand in marriage, Miss Adelaide (Vivian Blaine). Robert Keith as Lieutenant Brannigan, Stubby Kaye as Nicely Nicely Johnson and B.S. A pulley as Big Jule. An interesting comedy musical in which Brando sings all his songs, and Sinatra is smooth and cool. He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Artistic Director - set designer, best cinematography, best costume costume and best music for Jay Blackton and Cyril J. Mockridge, he was nominated for the BAFTA Award for best film from any source and won Golden Globe for Best Film - musical / comedy. Frank Sinatra was number 43 for the 100 Best Pop Culture Icons, Marlon Brando was number 30 on the Top 100 Movie Stars, he was 11 out of 100 Best Sex Symbols, he was number 4 out of 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, Sinatra was number 35, and Brando he was number 1 in The Greatest Actor in the world, "Luck Be a Lady" was number 42 on 100 Years, 100 Songs, the movie was number 23 on 100 Years of Musicals and was number 36 on The 100 best musicals. Very good!
