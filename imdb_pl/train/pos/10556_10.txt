I was not sure what to expect, but I'm glad I went to see it. An intelligent, slightly twisted comedy that makes you think. I was not quite sure how the director could create "nothing", but leave it to Mr. Natalia and the genius in C.O.R.E. create a different set of low budget that looks real (as real as nothing can be). If you have the opportunity to see it, it is worth spending your time and money. You'll be glad you did it.
