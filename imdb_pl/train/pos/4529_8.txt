As is known among long-haired youths who are extremely interested in the quiet prints of this Herr Graf, during the summer the aristocrats like to travel to exclusive and prominent places to avoid the heat and hordes of rude people who are easily approaching them. Such bizarre journeys around the world also take place in "Three Ages", a charming and elegant piece of silent work guided by old hands, namely Herr Buster Keaton and Herr Eddie Cline. <br /> <br /> Of course, this German count liked the most first segment focused on the Stone Age because of the affinity that the aristocrat feels in connection with this ancient time. preferring this from the second segment that takes place during the glory of Rome (This should include the cause of the fall of the Roman Empire, that is, barbarians, or the same, Germans). Of course, the third segment takes place in modern times, but this Teutonic aristocrat believes that even 100 years ago should be considered modern. <br /> <br /> The theme that moves Herr Keaton and his companions to travel and endure strange and funny events in three different periods is the quest for love, a very complicated topic to understand for aristocrats who prefer searching for money and their own interest. Every time when "Three Ages" is shown in the Schloss Theater, it is always nice to watch a funny, humorous silent movie (even for a serious German), a work full of gags and gadgets, puns, pratfalls and acrobatics, visual and amazing technical tricks, absolutely quiet delicatessen that are perfect to endure various harsh years. <br /> <br /> And now, if you allow me to do this, I must temporarily leave, because this German count must flirt with an old Teutonic heiress who does not look like his age. <br /> <br /> Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com/
