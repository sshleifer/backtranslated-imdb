One night I happened to find "Bait" on the cable when it started, and I thought, "Eh, why not?" I'm glad I gave him a chance. <br /> <br /> The "bait" is not perfect. He suffers from an unnecessarily brilliant direction and sporadic stupidity. But overall, this movie worked. All elements were set right to the right and they pulled something that could be quite an ugly movie. <br /> <br /> I think most of this comes from Jamie Foxx. I do not know who marked Foxx at the head, but whoever did it was a great favor. Faith and amazing sympathy, Foxx slides through the film, smooth as butter and funnier than hell. You can say that he works on instinct, and his instinct does not disappoint him. <br /> <br /> The plot, albeit unimportant, is in fact very much connected with each other, and even the figure in which Foxx's character grows as a person. Again, they would be able to slip without it, but it just makes things much better. <br /> <br /> I am surprised by the low rating. Maybe I just caught this movement at night, or vice versa, but I would give it 7/10. Bravo, Mssr. Foxx.
