As I've noted with many IMDb comments, some reviewers seem to demand that every video they see has cunningly intelligent threads that go into its cunning. I'm not one of those people. If I'm watching an action movie, I want to see explosions, shooting and heroics. If I'm watching a comedy, I want to have tears of laughter in my eyes. You have an idea. Therefore, watching the horror, first of all I want to be scared. Grudge is a very scary movie, both in well-made "jumping" scenes as well as frightening images. I've been a fan of horror movies for many years and I'm talking about masters like Dario Argento, not about the directors of some of the horror movies on the treadmill that are currently being produced. If you want to be scared, watch this movie. More frightening than the original Japanese "Ring" (which I also think is a great movie).
