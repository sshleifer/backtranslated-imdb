I love this movie. Songs and stories are great fun. and the song "say goodbye" always moves me. What a wonderful thing to revive puppets in a way that really takes care of these things made of fabric, fabric and everything else. great voices and great talent. why all the other muppet movies that came after this movie were much less interesting, moving and fun? is it you? is henson omitted so much?
