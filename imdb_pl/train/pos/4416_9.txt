Harvey Keitala's best results so far in the new century. Very nicely photographed, a beautiful appetizer from pre-Castro in Cuba. The story revolves around the nephew of a local crime boss who makes a friendship with an American from Hollywood. It really is about the moment when the boy wakes up to the fact that the small circle of people he knows lives in a much larger, more complex world that he does not understand yet. it's sharp. Above all, a really professional work that fits well with the tradition of Latin American cinema. The only weakness is the decision to shoot in synchronous English rather than Spanish - probably to improve sales in the US. Unfortunately, this only makes the movie less convincing. But if you see something more, you will find a heartfelt journey to another world. Recommended.
