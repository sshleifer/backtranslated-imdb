This is the best series of this type I've seen all year round. I can not stop thinking that it's only my happiness - the series I love, gets 6 episodes (and more next year), and a continuous stream of stunning cops never ends in episodes. <br /> <br /> I think the reasons New tricks go well. Scenarios are good, and a mix of great characters, Acting is the best flight, and the combination of comedy and drama is a feast. Stories are not that memorable, but this is not the reason why I watch such programs. <br /> <br /> The song is a favorite song and we were disappointed that it is not available in any edition. Great things, BBC - the triumph of the senses over sex appeal (apart from the young constable, there is no one there, and even if it is, it can still work!).
