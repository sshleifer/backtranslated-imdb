This is one of the few movies I can watch over and over again. If you have never seen him, give him a chance. Richard Dreyfus and Raoul Julia are wonderful together, and although the movie is very entertaining, it reminds me of the premature end of Julia. This is a good opportunity to sit down and laugh at the international intrigue that is too much in this period of terror and fear.
