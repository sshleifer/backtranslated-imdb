This is Tom Hanks' first film, which I got for the privilege of watching in the theater, although it is my favorite. When I heard that he was going to play a hitman, I was a little stunned thinking, "Can Mr. Hanks distract you?" And he did it in fashion. The film from the Depression era of the 1930s is loyalty, redemption and one path that you do not want your children to stumble on. Tom Hanks leads an all-star cast as Michael Sullivan. Being a family man and the secretive life of a contract killer for Oscar-nominated Paul Newman. This Tom Hanks movie is more based on reaction and outlook than dialogue, which ensures a knockout. <br /> <br /> One night, one of his works, Michael's son Jr., played by the newcomer Tyler Hoechlin, a witness to a hit. And partner Michael Sr. in crime, actor actor Daniel Craig can not have this information. So he wakes up son and wife of Michael Sr., with the exception of Michael Jr. So they both go to Chicago to get Conner Rooney (son of Rooney Paul Newman). it really thickens from them when the father tries to fix the situation, even though the son is on a ride. During this deadly journey, someone hired the hit of Michael Sr. The killer would be the photographer of the late Harlan Maguire, played by the insolent Jude Law. <br /> <br /> The movie will feel old times. And with the beautiful and persecuting Oscar nomination of Thomas Newman, you can not underestimate this film by Oscar winner Sam Mendes. Sit back and enjoy the wild ride.
