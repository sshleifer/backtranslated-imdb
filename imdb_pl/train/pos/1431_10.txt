It's simply the most amazing movie you'll ever see. I thought it was just another document, but it's really something else. He is not trying to teach you anything, he shows how life works in nature. <br /> <br /> I will not talk about the quality of photos, because of the other comments, of course, you know that it's second to none. <br /> <br /> Earth is funny, tense and sad. It can make you laugh that you can cry. Sometimes both at the same time. This is the first movie that made me cry, not because you feel sorry for the animals, but because you realize how fragile our planet is and how the treasure has blessed us, but we do not appreciate it a bit. /> <br /> This film should be shown obligatory in schools. It's the greatest movie you'll ever see, so go and see it. Who knows, maybe the last time we can see our planet in this way ... <br /> <br /> 10/10, but I could easily evaluate it if it was possible.
