Adam Jones has a genius sense of humor. In this movie, I did not like anything. Cross Eyed was beautifully filmed. Adam does a great job, not only developing the main characters, but also smaller characters. <br /> <br /> Cross Eyed gives hope for any low-budget movie. That you do not have to spend a lot on creating something worth seeing. Everyone has something to offer. If you've had a terrible roommate. if you've ever picked up dork in high school. if you've ever parked anywhere in the city. if you have any sense of humor, you will love this movie. This is the type of film that will appear for a long time, and then it will appear again on the surface when Adam makes a bigger name. I am looking forward to future projects of Adam.
