I took this arbitrarily from the library that night, having no idea about the cult, the influence of the movie or about the fact that it is currently being staged as a musical. sad and yes, a bit of exploitation despite the best intentions of filmmakers. The extended edition of Chriterion is a must for anyone who loved it when it appeared. <br /> <br /> I think that in a small Edie you can see the fall of a class that has disappeared, you can also hear it in old films by Jackie O; people do not say that anymore. I think, as a documentary, it would be interesting to get more information about how the house went wrong, Old Edie at least still seems to be aware of what is happening to some extent; could not see how once the spectacular house was falling apart? <br /> <br /> However, the theme of the film is the life that both women have created for themselves, the real life of Tennesse Williams. Worth your time.
