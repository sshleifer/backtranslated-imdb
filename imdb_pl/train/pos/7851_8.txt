The cameraman's revenge is an unusual abbreviation not because of the subject (adultery) or because it is animated (Winsor McCay introduced Little Nemo to the film by that time), but because it presents errors to tell the story! Ladislaw Starewicz originally wanted to film real insect battles, but he could not force them to do it on the camera because of the hot lights they suffered, so he took the dead and started using stop motion techniques to manipulate the movements to his satisfaction. This abbreviation shows well the human characteristics of small creatures such as riding a motorcycle, painting, filming, kissing and dancing. Starewicz would also make Frogland (1922) and The Mascot (1933), but his first noteworthy job would be this. If you are interested in this and other short shorts, check out the local DVD library. Revenge of the cameraman and other fantastic tales of entertainment.
