I rented this movie because of my interest in American history, and especially the somewhat strange history of Mormons. This film tries to explain how Joseph Smith could change his "vision" into the main religion of the world. First, he focuses on the problems the Mormons had in their settlements in Navuoo, Illinois. Presents the Joseph Smith process. During this process, Brigham Young talks about his conversion to Mormonism and his faith in Smith's spiritual message. Then Smith is murdered, and Young has to deal with his own doubts whether he was chosen to lead the Mormons to the new land. Despite serious doubts, he perseveres and finally has a vision (that Utah is a place for his colony), which gives him faith in the rightness of his leadership. Later, when crops are destroyed by crickets, he again doubts whether he was really chosen - but there is a miracle that cement his place in history. <br /> <br /> I discovered that performances are moving the story is convincing and interesting. I would like to know if the Mormons believe that this is an accurate portrait. Polygamy is part of this story, but there are no reasons why it is essential for LSR. The problem is not underlined. <br /> <br /> I'm sure that people stay away from this movie because of its religious themes, but he has a great cast and will keep you interested all the time.
