Hi, I'm from Taft California and I like this movie because it shows how people from a small town love our sports football, which is the most important thing in Taft, and this video shows how important it is to personally think that they should do another, but instead of the actors using our children to play games, we show our determination to beat Bakersfield in every game for the last 6 years, and because I'm next year senior, my last chance, and then his university, where we had runners, leads the state and I'm next, if you want to meet me I'm kyle Taylor and on average seven to eight yards to wear, and about five times the game will break down at 75 or around, so check us out on our website and go to our sports site
