When I watched this movie, I began to feel very nostalgic. As a child growing up in the countryside, I felt like I was a child again! Swimming pond (in Middle Texas called "tank"), running through the village like a wild ghost! The story was very credible and I completely lost it and cried at the end. Through the pain we are going through in life ... life goes on and there can be forgiveness.
