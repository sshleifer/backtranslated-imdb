I'm a fan of Jodie Foster since we were both kids since Disney. I loved her fussy antics in movies like Candleshoe. <br /> <br /> The "foxes" were such a great departure from all this. <br /> <br /> Where other young actresses of that era turned to sex humility disguised as a comedy ("Little Darlings, whoever?), Jodie went on a depressing and tragic tale of teenagers drawn into death by the powerful charm of temptation and addiction. <br /> <br /> It was not Disney. It was not Porky. It was not "Halloweed." It was a dark and powerful story about the destruction of young life. Unfortunately, this is a story that is still taking place every day across the country, this movie can be played (with the current soundtrack) and still be completely accurate. <br /> <br /> This is not the best movie ever made, in some parts it is tired, not all performances are particularly outstanding. But Jodie Foster still showed her chops as a real adult actor (the trend started when she was very young in Taxi Driver). <br /> <br /> 7 of 10 Barky
