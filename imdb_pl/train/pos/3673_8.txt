In 2004, I saw "True", Tom Tykwer's contribution to Paris Je T'aime. When I saw it, I loved it and I was delighted. It became my favorite short film and I appreciated it very much. Of course, I wanted to watch the whole movie, and even see who was attached to it, etc. <br /> <br /> Yesterday I finally saw him, courtesy of the internet. <br /> <br /> The first of all I have to say looks amazing. Photography is BEAUTIFUL in every short and shot, in the worst case it is not a special thing - but still brilliant and clean. Later I read the curiosities here and maybe this is how scanning in 6K gives more justice for all DP work. My special favorites are the first scene of "Quais de Seine" (it's sunlight!), Sin City Squadron (but better for me) "Quartier de la Madeleine" and "14th Arrondisement" - but you know what the hell, I like everyone : "Pravda" or "Faubourg Saint-Denis" still annoys me with these wonderful colors (my eyes, tremble!), And "Latin Quarter" is gold trapped on silver. Beautiful. <br /> <br /> Yes, these are BEAUTIFUL short films. <br /> <br /> Now let's get to the content. Very (and I mean VERY MUCH) I like eclecticism, which is so effectively felt. You never had the same motifs or treatments between two short pants and I think the formula is restrictive enough to let all these artists discover beautiful and deepening things in shorts. I loved to change from a simple love story into a crazy-Chinese-musical-in-Paris-Barbet-Schroeder-in social commentary into a comedy of terror in a modest monologue. I love surprises! And this movie has them! It's great that they took the opportunity to let all these directors present things that are not typical of the mainstream cinema (which I despise). This is not experimental, but I can breathe the space that these people had. <br /> <br /> I like this little time and I love acting. I love simplicity and love love. I like simple feelings and beauty and eclecticism, and generally it is a very nice movie that can be seen alone or with someone. Just feel. I felt very good. <br /> <br /> There is something serious about it ... that's so sincere ... <br /> <br /> What I did not like? Well, for me there are two shorts that are not the best - "Quais de Seine" (which is good, certain, and maybe even necessary, but seems too similar to advertising?) And "PÃ¨re-Lachaise" which, although I love acting , I felt that the motives are forced. But this is only me, of course. "Tour Eiffel" I did not love either, but I think probably because of my different sensitivity from the sensitivity of Sylvain Chomet? I do not know if this film is particularly interesting for people who already know actors and directors, so they can enjoy their interaction, surprises (beware of Alexander Payne in a funny role) and basically what "that or this director will do with this ? "A great question. That's how I liked it. <br /> <br /> I repeat now: most of the shorts that I loved and all together create a beautiful and energetic mix. I definitely recommend it. Definitely!!! So watch if you like Eclectic Beautiful Love!
