First of all, saying that he is not a fan of this genre, "The Bourne Ultimatum" is a breathtaking, virtuoso, great action movie. <br /> <br /> Secondly, this is a stupid cartoonist from superheroes. br /> <br /> Thirdly, the film carries with it a complex, important point in which criminals become criminals. There are no references to Abu Ghraib or the indignant internal attacks of the Executive Branch on constitutional rights, it is not necessary. <br /> <br /> So, the newest in the "Bourne" series in the hands of Paul Greengrass (from 2004 "Bourne Supremacy" and last year's "United 93") is a significant achievement, perhaps held back, but in fact not diminished by the inevitable excesses of the genre. <br /> <br /> "Breathtaking" above means both a complementary adjective and a description of the physical experience: for more than an hour from the first frame the viewer seems to hold his breath, pushed back into the chair by the force of constant, global trotting, completely tense action . There is no profession, there is no variation of rhythm and attraction of the film, but it never becomes monotonous and tiring in the way that some related music videos do after just a few minutes. <br /> <br /> Oliver Wood is your face photos best reflect the scenario of Tony Gilroy from the novel by Robert Ludlum in 1990 (which does not fit well with "Bourne Identity", written a decade earlier). <br /> <br /> Matt Damon is once again unavoidable, irreplaceable Bourne, the most deadly CIA fantasy agents, this time taking over the whole agency in search of his identity, his past and the mysterious agency program that turned him into a killing machine. Nothing like his silently heroic Edward R. Murrow, always a wonderful David Strathairn, is a nasty head of the agency, opposed to Bourne, trying to hide some of the illegal "do not take prisoners" and brutal procedures. <br /> <br /> Joan Allen plays what seems to be a good policeman against Strathairn's Bad One. And Julia Stiles as an agent once again comes to help Bourne; The combination of Greengrass's direction and Stiles' acting is resulting in a surprising influence mainly of the silent form, its lack of communication and an empty expression more intriguing than miles of dialogue. <br /> <br /> "The Bourne Ultimatum" is so good that he avoids the old piece "one man into the world", this time extending to absurd excesses, because Bourne defies the limitations of geography, time, gravity ... and generally physics. (Can you fly back from the top of the building by car? Why not - looks great.) All this "real" magic - jumping from country to country in a few seconds to reach an unknown location exactly as and when needed - they outweigh the improbabilities of special effects and cartoons of superheroes. And yet only an unconscious pedant would allow the "facts" to disrupt the entertaining ecstasy of Bourne's fantasy.
