089: Footlight Parade (1933) - released on September 30, 1933, viewed on 05/05/2007. <br /> <br /> Ice cream was invented in New York. <br /> <br /> KEVIN: After a long and hard-working break, we hit another Busby Berkeley musical from Warner Bros. This time it is a very fast Footlight parade, in which James Cagney performed as a scenic producer of Chester Kentucky juggernauts. I'm 100% sure that Cagney gave Berkeley his performances of unbridled Kent, who has to come up with new ideas for performances every minute. Joan Blondell is also excellent as a secretary with a passion for acid. Podplot Ruby Keeler / Dick Powell this time is not so important, but no less pleasant. One of the things that surprised me was Berkeley's performances, which seemed too extravagant and complex to be performed on any stage, let alone a scene that would later show the film. Busby, of course, does not allow a small thing, such as history, to disturb him in compiling the most exaggerated musical numbers he can summon. I enjoyed the whole movie almost to the end, with the shamelessly offensive number "Shanghai Lil", which, as you can guess, is more or less the same as the stomach when racially disgusting performances appear. <br /> <br /> DOUG: Six films in three months. There must be a new record. In any case, it ends Warner Bros. musical trilogy from 1933, preceded by "42nd Street" and "Gold Diggers from 1933". I definitely recommend watching all three in a row. I wonder if James Cagney was Busby Berkeley's channel when he played in this movie at Chester Kent, or the role that was written was inspired by Busby. I hope it was so; it seems to make sense that Berkeley is the type of guy who would see complicated dances every day, just like Chester does. The funny thing about Cagney was that he did not really look like a man in the traditional sense. He was 5'7 years old, he was square and talked to a strange New York accent. But the guy was quite versatile, going from poisonous gangsters, through which he became so famous among the fast-talking producers we see here. Basically he was the top man in the character's body, the rest of the cast has familiar faces, Joan Blondell returns and nearly steals the show as loyal and lustful secretary Cagney, Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler play a sweet couple, but it seems that he has less time on the screen than before Billy Barty reappears as a mischievous imp. The film is typical of more racist and adult oriented pre-code musicals, unlike those of the '50s and' 60s that were more family orientated, this is the perfect highlight of the Warner musical this year (the number 'Shanghai Lil "He can not stand it, and Keeler does not look like a Chinese man). <br /> <br /> Last movie: Dinner At Eight (1933) Next movie: I'm No Angel (1933).
