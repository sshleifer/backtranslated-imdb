Acknowledgment for the writers of this film for creating an extremely addictive drama. Interesting character development indicates a diverse and well-trained writing team. A member of the audience can not help but feel that he has to make difficult emotional decisions by sticking his brain in the libidinal. The viewer has the opportunity to develop the characters independently, although his predictions are rarely confirmed. <br /> <br /> Credit is also a merit of filmmakers who breathed life into their surroundings. The wood shop is transformed into a unique personality, as the film develops, with its own features, disadvantages, a variety of highly charged relationships and, of course, fate relentlessly associated with the fate of other directors. <br /> <br /> Make sure you get it at the local art house.
