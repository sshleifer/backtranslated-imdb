This film has very good acting practically by the entire cast, thrilling story with a cool ending, great music and excellent visual effects without significant special effects.

This is happening with a rather prominent list of science fiction classics: "1984", "2001: A Space Odyssey (compare your space station with our International Space Station) and" I Robot "by Isaac Asimov (invented positron brains in the nineties).
