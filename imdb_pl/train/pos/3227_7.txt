Kurt Russell is strong and (mainly) silent in this futuristic action thriller Paul Anderson (Event Horizon, Resident Evil.) Set on the planet trash dumps, Soldier plays like the intersection of Rambo and Shane, and Russell barely says the protagonist, "outdated" genetic soldier left to die. Cast colonists, including Connie Nielsen, Sean Pertwee and surprisingly noisy Michael Chiklis, are able to. They spend most of the film afraid of Russell, and the rest flees from life. Russell's performance is one of the best he has ever given. He speaks almost without words, communicates emotions, feelings and meanings with glances and glances. It is almost the performance of mime. When the action sequences start spinning, they kick ass - and in a strong, quiet, matter-of-fact way. There are disadvantages. Jason Scott Lee is brutal as a "better" genetic soldier. Jason Isaacs makes the big impression of Frank Burns with M * A * S * H ​​as a kindly officer, and Gary Busey beats the gut (and almost beats the belt) as Todd's mentor. It is an underestimated and excellent science fiction film, recommended for anyone who wants a second visit to the universe of Blade Runner - David Webb Peoples wrote both scenarios.
