This is one of the greatest movies, maybe even the best movie ever. For about 12 years I forgot about the movie. Until I saw the ADGTH add-on on TV, and brought back to me fond memories of how I watched him when I was a small child. And when I watched it a few nights ago, I became addicted to the movie. Usually, I do not like animated family movies, but this one is unique, it is an ideal family movie. <br /> <br /> The ending of the movie always touches my heart and makes me very sad, but it just makes this movie astonishing better than all the rubbish that is going out on today's children's films. I mean, the movie has a class G and there are about 2 dogs involved in gambling, the movie is a lot of smoking, drinking, murder, death and hell. Which I Believe makes the movie from good to great. I mean movies today that do not bring reality to children in this film. <br /> <br /> RIP Judith Barsi & House DeLuise
