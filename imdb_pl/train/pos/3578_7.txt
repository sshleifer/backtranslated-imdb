12-year-old Arnald Hillerman accidentally kills his older brother Eugene. His feelings are stopped by the fact that his family can not contact him (or feel that it is not right). His ONLY shelter is his grandfather, who is THE ONLY who seems to have compassion for him. Realism captivates lovers of the film "real life", but it will not satisfy those who want action and emotions.
