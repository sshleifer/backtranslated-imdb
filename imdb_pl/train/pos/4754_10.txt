One of my favorite episodes of Twilight Zone. And the next day we were at the Hollywood Blvd supermarket. and La Brea, my father and I, and guess who was approaching us in the aisle! Barney Phillips, but without a hat - at least I do not think he has a hat on his head. <br /> <br /> We asked him about his third eye, and he said something as if he had left him at home, and everyone he met that day asked him about it. <br /> <br /> A friendly guy. In those days, we saw all kinds of character actors in Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> By the way I was a teenager and it was a long time before I defeated the "three hands" of the other stranger! <br /> <br /> Robyn Frisch O'Neill <br /> <br /> Coming from Hollywood and living in 1947-1963.
