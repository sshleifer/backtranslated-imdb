Yes, it gets a full ten stars. It is obvious that this day is brilliant. The universe sent Trent Harris to a young, wonderfully strange man one day, and Harris caught him on the tape, in all the real unmatched glory that you simply can not pretend. It is a pity that this ended with a tragedy for a young man, if only one could write an alternative ending to the history of this man. The other two stages of the trilogy tell the story, and Sean Penn and Crispin Glover in the role of young men, respectively. The world is expanding, and the strangeness is contextualized by retelling, giving us a broader view of growing strange in vanilla America. Recommended for everyone and everyone!
