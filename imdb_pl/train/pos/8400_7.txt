I chose this movie in my local library. After meeting with the director at the film festival at the end of last year, I was curious to "check" his work. I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> The film presents a fresh perspective on familiar topics, love, infidelity, friendships, jealousy. Sometimes it can be a little 'talkative', but never so much as to completely immerse the film. I liked watching a love story with characters that PURE belong to each other and watching how they make informed decisions, instead of accidentally "falling in" something as important as love. shoot-em 'up black film is quite clear. Check it out. If you're lucky, your copy will contain a copy of the soundtrack, like mine. Good stuff!
