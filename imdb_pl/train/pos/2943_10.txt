I think it's still the best routine. There are others, such as "bring pain" to Rock and "Men are Pigs" by Allen, which are fun; "Damon Waynes' last stand" is also funny in a tearful way - but this procedure does not contain any mistakes. All jokes are funny, and the 70-minute time limit is perfect. Long enough to last 20 years. I just love it, as it allows the audience to be completely self and unlimited. I'm a fan of the classics, and for a guy who watched Jim Carrey growing up, watching a more laid back comic is pretty cool. I do not put categories with Ellen and Newhart, but something you can observe if you're bloated. Thanks, Eddie, God bless you.
