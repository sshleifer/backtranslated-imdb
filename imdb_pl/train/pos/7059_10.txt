I was shocked and surprised by the negative reviews I saw on the web. I thought that Cinderella 2 (and also 3) is a very sweet and fun continuation for everyone - children and adults ... like me, I'm 22 years old. <br /> <br /> I also find this and very informative film, it shows the lessons of being faithful to myself and following my heart. I thought it had great animation and the voice was very good; songs made by Brooke Allison. Because this movie has been divided into three flashbacks / stories, my favorite of the three is history, when Jaq became a human mouse for the day thanks to Fairy Godmother and her magic.
