This is one of the best animated films of all time. What's more, practically all serious rivals for this title came from the same creative mind Hiyao Miyazaki and his Studio Ghibli. In particular, other great films include "My Neighbor Totoro" and "Kikki Delivery Service". Spirited Away is quite good, but a bit too scary for a typical family tariff - better for teenagers and adults. The only thing that distinguishes "Laputa: Castle in the Sky" from Miyazaki's other films is that it is a much more tense adventure journey. <br /> <br /> Why is this movie so good? Because it is a complete package: the animation is very well made, and the story is really addictive and fascinating. <br /> <br /> Most Japanese anime is ingenious, but definitely dark or cynical or violent; and the animation itself is often uneven, stylized and underage. None of these problems afflicts the Castle in the sky. The imagination is burning, and the characters are well drawn, if slightly exaggerated versions of realistic people. (None of these trench coats poses) There are lots of adventures, but not blood and blood. The animation is fluid, detailed and consists of a cinema ally - there are not many flat shots. The backgrounds are wonderful. <br /> <br /> The voice appearing in the dubbed English version is the first class, especially the two leads, Pazo (James Van der Beek) and Sheeta (Anna Paquin). Sound engineering is great too. Use studio sound if you have it. <br /> <br /> One of the aspects that I particularly liked is that most stories are unexplained. Laputa was once inhabited and now is abandoned. Why? We never know. We know as much as we need to know, and then we have to accept the rest, which is easy to do, because the imaginary world is fully realized. Indeed, it is fair to say that the world is fully realized than most of the smaller characters, who are mostly one-dimensional characters (eg, a rough general, stupid helper, bizarre old miner, etc.). for people from 6 to 60 years old!
