In my opinion, it remains one of the best performances of Superman on TV, as well as one of the most faithful in a given comic period. <br /> <br /> This series was a tribute to Superman's films from "The 1970s / 1980s" and Comics series "Superman" from 1986 ("Man of Steel", "Superman Vol 2", "Action Comics "," Adventures of Superman "etc.). Initial scoring and titles were based on the John Williams result from the films, updated on Saturday morning. Marv Wolfman, one of the main creators of the reboot of comics (author of "Adventures of Superman"), was a great choice to take part in this animated series. In general, the series was more mature and at the same time was very child-friendly. <br /> <br /> Superman was presented as credible, strong and cult. His recurring nemesis was Lex Luthor in his megalomaniac / CEO incarnation. The characters of Daily Planet Lois, Jimmy and Perry have been well presented. One of my favorite performances was Wonder Woman, and the story revolved around her home island Themyscira ("Paradise Island"). Both her project and the design of her mother Hippolyte were in line with a similar series of Wonder Woman comics from that era and it seemed that an equally well-made animated series could be developed for her if treated the same way. > <br /> One thing that is hard to believe is that it has not been released on DVD / Blu-ray! He deserves it.
