It was great fun! I have never read these Chester-Gould comics, but you do not need to know them. Maybe there were some jokes that I did not understand, but what the eye can not see can not sadden the heart. It's such an ironic, colorful film, and the actors are good-natured. The setting is similar to that in "Batman" movies, but it is not so dark and gray. Okay, the story is not so original, but there's a conspiracy (which is not obvious) and a more or less surprising ending. <br /> <br /> In this video you can play an interesting game if you watch it with your friends. Do not watch the subtitles at the beginning, and then check who is the fastest to find out who the famous actors are under their make-up!
