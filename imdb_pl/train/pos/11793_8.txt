I watch the series as soon as possible. I'm trying to watch all of Star Trek's stuff. This is already 3 months, and now I am in the third season of TNG and I have already gone through DS9 in its entirety. Star Trek is the largest television phenomenon ever achieved. <br /> <br /> "Shades of Gray" is the first episode summarizing in the TNG series. After watching the shows, these clips were fresh in my head, but I noticed how a few of them were re-made because the movie looked better. Season 1 always seemed dark and ugly - and the actors looked stupid, as if they did not fit their own skins. <br /> <br /> The show consists essentially of the biggest hits of the happiest and the saddest moments in Riker's life on the Enterprise up to this point. The Date and Riker scene in the holopok≈Çadzie is a classic moment of a new friendship. My second favorite is that the second officer on the Klingon ship challenges Riker's authority when the first officer and Riker defeat the live CRAP from this Klingon. Then the admiral copies his money, but good. The whole episode is a piece of reminder that many crazy, wonderful things have already happened in just 2 seasons, with 5 others to do and a handful of movies! At this point, the series really begin to develop emotions that bind Riker with Deanna Troi as Imzadi. Until then, they were mentioning this fact, but they have not used it yet. Let the record show that ST Wiki - Memory Alpha claims that Imzadi means "first" and means that she had a close relationship with Riker, and also remains very close to the emotional one. This episode proves that for a long time will be tense romantic interest in yourself. <br /> <br /> Here's an article: http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Imaddy By this point in the series, the value of production is on time, and Star Trek TNG decides to become a sci-fi hero, what he was supposed to become. Watching it again as an adult, I see now what the GREAT ACTORS of Star Trek Universe assure. They must create a new ST show after all presentations. The DS9 film would also be nice.
