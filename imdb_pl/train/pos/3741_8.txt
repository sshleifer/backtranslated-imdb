A war drama set in Louisiana in 1971. He follows a group of recruits through basic training, followed by Tigerland - an accurate picture of Vietnam on American soil, before it is sent. He focuses on two men - Booz (Colin Farrell) and Paxton (Matthew Davis) ... how they meet, become friends and deal with the squad leader (Clifton Collins Jr.) and the border psychologist (Shea Wingham). br /> <br /> A surprisingly non-commercial movie directed by Joel Schumacher. He uses a handheld camera for most of the movie and uses digital video for battle scenes. It works very well - the film looks rough (as it should) and uncomfortably realistic. <br /> <br /> Farrell successfully hides her Irish accent and adopts a pretty convincing southern accent. His performance is simply great - he is an extremely talented young man. Davis, unfortunately, is not so good. He is tall, muscular, very handsome - and very bland. The rest of the cast, however, is simply great. <br /> <br /> This movie was kicked out by the studio. There are no stars in it, a famous story and was considered as "another war movie". He only played a week in Boston! It's worth catching on video or DVD. <br /> <br /> Farrell and Davis also have a long, naked stage.
