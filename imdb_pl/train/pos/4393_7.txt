Ang Lee apparently likes to catch a movie, catch the action, characters and hoofing when they appear. This is an ideal approach, involving the accidental ending of the American civil war through the accidental actions of a young militia, unformed in the mind or masculinity. The film turns out to be about shaping personality, adulthood and relationships. Lee also shows beautiful panoramas of the mid-south as a silent hero, enduring a fight like a strong parent. <br /> <br /> The script by James Schamus is probably the standard carrier of this film; just behind him is a series of well-prepared performances that carry him perfectly. Even the name of Jeffrey Wright could have transferred this film to me. It is brilliant here, but in a free burning role: instead, we are treated to very good (if not revealing) performances from a large, often recognizable band. <br /> <br /> A noble, optimistic movie. One, for example, if you do not like stronger, more bittersweet Cold Mountain or The Claim. 7/10
