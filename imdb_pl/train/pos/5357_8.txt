This comic-style movie is funny, has a nice action and a great futuristic style. The writer Steven de Souza, who also wrote Commando, gives Arnie many poems to give: "Send me a copy", after signing the contract and punching in the lawyers' pen; "What a neckache" after suffocation with subzero barbed wire; "He had to separate" after cutting the body between his legs; and finally, when Killian hits the billboard with his own face, Arnie concludes: "Now it has hit this place". The funny thing is that it has some resemblance to a complete reminder, another science fiction film starring Schwarzenegger.
