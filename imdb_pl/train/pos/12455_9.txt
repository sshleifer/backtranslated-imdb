I watched this program when I was a little girl. Although I do not remember much about it, I must say that it was quite a good performance. Besides, I do not think I'll see every episode. However, if you ask me, it was still a good performance. I do not remember the theme of the song. Everyone was perfectly manned, the costume was great. The performances were also top-notch. I only hope that one day the network will restore this series to be able to see each episode. Before I discuss this, I would like to say that I will always remember this program in my memory forever, although I do not think I have seen every episode. Now, at the end, when and if this program is ever brought back live, I hope you catch it one day before it disappears for good.
