I did not have a problem with the movie, which I thought was quite good. This is a real movie from the crime scene in LAPD, which worried me. I wonder if Lion's Gate REALLY thought that viewers from around the world would want to see people brutally beaten to death and blood all over the place. I'm sorry, Lion's Gate, it was AMAZING BAD IDEA !!! <br /> <br /> Returning to the movie: the cast was excellent, especially Val Kilmer as the late John Holmes. John Holmes was hopeless, he abused women in his life (Lisa Kudrow as his wife, Kate Bosworth as his girlfriend), and is hopelessly deep in drugs. His relationship with Eddie Nash (Eric Bogosian) creates a spiral that led to the infamous murders in Wonderland. How much was Holmes involved in the murders? Perhaps we will never know the whole truth of this story (Nash is still alive and a free man), but still the movie does a pretty good job.
