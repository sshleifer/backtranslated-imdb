I really liked this movie. Most reviews were bad, but most critics think that the movie should be like a drama with ideas. This movie has a bit of a drama, but the rest is just pure fun and very funny. Forget that Julia Roberts is Pretty Woman, Emma Roberts is a beautiful young lady and there's nothing more about her than just that. Emma had a great time playing the role of Nancy Drew. It's good to see a new face. I believe he will go far. <br /> <br /> Nancy Drew may not be based on books, but history is still good. There is also a good mix of other actors and supporting actors, such as Pat Carroll, Barry Bostwick, Rachel Leigh Cook and Chris Kattan - they were not awarded. I'm surprised that Disney did not release this movie. Some people may not like this movie because they do not contain sex, violence and profanity. It's a good family movie, which is rare these days. Take your family, see this movie and judge for yourself how good it is. I can not wait to continue.
