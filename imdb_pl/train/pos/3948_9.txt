In the end, I know that it exists. Along with other British authors on this subject, I saw what MUST BE - it was only a show in Great Britain in the 1970s. I remembered the title, but I did not mention it anywhere. It mutilated me (this is 2 'r), but when you go to bed with death jumping around your brain and listening to everything about impending fear, is not this what's going on in the REAL classic horror? I can barely remember the intricacies of this film, but what I remember is a trembling body and heightened senses. Can anyone confirm my suspicions that it is black and white? Again, if anyone has any information about how to get a copy of this, please contact us ...
