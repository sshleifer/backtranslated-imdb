I just watched the movie by mistake. What a little gem. This 1956 movie looks and looks like a movie from the late seventies. And it is in fact better, more restrained and correct than, say, Blue Soldier. Environmental, anthropological shades are ahead of their time. Modest cinematography is excellent and terribly realistic. Much more than Dances with Wolves, The Last Hunt manages to convey the look and feel of Buffalo "killing fields" from the late 19th century. Probably because those in the movie were real killing fields. The film was shot during the legal logging of the buffalo, so the animals you see are really curly, the bones are real. To sum up, a very underrated western masterpiece, superbly played, directed and shot.
