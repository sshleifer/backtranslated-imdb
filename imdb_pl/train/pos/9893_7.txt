Poor geek Marty (Simon Scuddamore) is terribly burned because of the cruel feat of April Fool's Day, which went very badly. A flash forward for ten years, and those involved (including Caroline Monroe, known to the horror fans of her turns in Maniac, Faceless and The Last Horror Film) in the pranks are excited for the upcoming 10-year meeting in high school, not realizing that the court killer masker is hiding in a (now closed) school and is looking for revenge. <br /> <br /> Wake up to being guilty, I knew it was a bad movie. It has all the features of one. But there is something about it that makes me feel compelled to watch it from time to time (preferably with a beer in my hand). I am even inclined to overlook an absolutely terrifying ending (which, I must say, I hate). I think I like it because it has a nice atmosphere and pretty cool killings. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy (for men): Josephine Scandi and Donna Yeager obaj have topless <br /> <br /> Eye Candy (for ladies): a free shot of Simon Scuddamore at the beginning of the movie <br / > <br /> My Grade: B- <br /> <br /> Lionsgate DVD Extras: Optional trivia track; trailer of this movie; and trailers My Bloody Valentine (1981), Monster Squad, Dirty Dancing
