I love Kristen Dunst, especially in Elizabethtown. I think she is an actress who is better off working on the camera, but just be yourself. She did it and she looked so natural in Elizabethtown. However, in this movie she tried to add a more artificial performance, especially in the first half of the movie, so that she looked more like a sober editor. Being in the second half, she completely retreated to her daily routine, and I just could not tell her to be an editor. That is why her performance in this film is not permanent. <br /> <br /> The whole movie attracts and inspires. Young's character is full and reasonable. Besides, the film tells a great and sophisticated story. <br /> <br /> The only major disadvantage is that it is not the turning point of the hero's love story. I am completely confused when they kiss at the end of the story, because it is rather vague for two people.
