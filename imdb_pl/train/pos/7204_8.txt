If you're looking for a special effects monster, click BACK in your browser. <br /> <br /> The deadly trap was written by Ira Levin (Sliver, The Stepford Wives, Rosemary's Baby). It's a stage game, adapted to the screen. 95% of the film takes place in the beautiful home of playwright Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine). He is the author of a fabulously successful Broadway game, but his last 4 efforts have fallen - terribly. <br /> <br /> The aspiring playwright, Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve), who took part in a writing workshop for writers in Sydney, sent him a copy of the art he wrote. Sydney tells his wife, Myra (Dyan Cannon), that the game is fantastic - to hit the fire. But is it enough to die? Time will tell. <br /> <br /> A smart dialogue and numerous twists and turns make this movie funny from beginning to end. The whole cast seems to be having fun. It's like another funny mystery of Michael Caine: Sleuth. It's worth watching. <br /> <br />
