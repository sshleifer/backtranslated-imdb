ERROL FLYNN had one of his favorite roles as the brash glory of an Irish family who became world heavyweight champion while John L. Sullivan (WARD BOND) circled around claiming that "he can defeat every man alive." Both Flynn, and Ward Bond give what is probably one of the best performances on screen. Raoul Walsh directed a colorful story with a solid style, capture family life, as well as scenes that are warmly cordial and full of good humor. All Warner contract players create a great cast - including always credible ALAN HALE as the perverted father of Flynn, proud of his son's fighting abilities and ALEXIS SMITH, who fully uses his role as a pugnacious girl from society who likes to take Flynn with a pussy liners dealing with his presumptuous manierami. <br /> <br /> The whole atmosphere of the eighties The nineteenth century was captured in the glorious B & W, although it is a pity that the Warners had no more faith in Flynn to make the film in color. He then entered the rocky phase of his film career, engaging in a widely publicized rape process in which all tabloids dealt with the sorting of things. <br /> <br /> The fight scenes are among the best in the history of choreography on the screen, with Flynn of course in great shape and very little using the debel for most of the action. And the scene in which Bond turns his score board to Flynn at a social gathering is one of the greatest moments of Ward's long career as a character actor. <br /> <br /> In summary: keeps you interested all the time, whether you're a sports fan or not.
