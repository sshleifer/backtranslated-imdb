Good for evening entertainment - but the plot was unconvincing. Garrison's Romance with the First Lady was unreal and devoid of passion; The president was an excerpt from cardboard. Who were the real villains? Nothing has been developed or explained enough. I still do not know why they wanted to kill the President or how the mole got involved. The villains were unnamed and undeveloped, so you never felt involved in their conspiracy. Michael Douglas and Kiefer Sutherland did everything in their power to introduce a reality to history - pursuit and confrontation were good. But Kim Basinger and Eva Longoria were unbelievable in their roles, Basinger was completely lacking in character, and Longoria could not be a Secret Service agent. It could have been a very good movie, but somehow missed the road with too many unanswered questions. Disappointing whole despite very good scenes. Did they use the West Wing set for White House scenes? - I expected CJ or Charlie to appear!
