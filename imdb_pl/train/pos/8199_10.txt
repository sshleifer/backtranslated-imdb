After what was considered the official trilogy of Dirty Harry from The Enforcer (1976), it was the last chapter in the series. Dirty Harry is back, older, more dirty and more dangerous than ever since the classic 1971. <br /> <br /> Dirty Harry killed in the past the killer of a psychopath, policemen and veterans from Vietnam. But now he's after a new killer, a killer who wants to pay off by shooting the attackers. <br /> <br /> A sudden blow brings a new meaning and a darker tone to Dirty Harry. Callahan is in a case for a new murder that goes back to the woman (played by Sondra Locke) who was brutally raped along with her sister, who was injured. Ten years later, there is revenge, shooting down assailants. At the same time, Callahan is in trouble with his superiors after he provokes the mafia boss to attack his heart, which is also what the mob hunts for him. So, in order to let fall in the city, Harry is going to go on holiday to the seaside town, but at the same time the victim is raped in the city, hunting down the attackers in turn. Harry is in the middle of the investigation and thinks that the killings are very similar because he is on the killer's path. <br /> <br /> A sudden hit in my opinion must be one of my top 10 revenge movies, and be the second best movie about Dirty Harry, much better than both The Enforcer and The Dead Pool. Sudden Impact has what the original Dirty Harry had, a dark tone of entertainment value. <br /> <br /> So you feel happy, punk?
