"The whole world is a stage and its people are actors" - or something like that. Who the hell said the theater had stopped at the bottom of the orchestra - or even at the theater door? Why audience members do not have theatrical experience, in the same story? <br /> <br /> This movie was a great experiment that said: "Hey! History is you and needs more than your attention, I need your active participation. " "Sometimes we bring you this story, sometimes you have to go to the story." <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, nobody listened, but that does not mean that you should not talk about it.
