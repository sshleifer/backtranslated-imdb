For the first time I got acquainted with "Eddie" by friends from "across-the-pond" who know that I like intelligent humor. I prefer comedians who are able to stimulate thinking during play, such as George Carlin and Dennis Miller. In "Dress to Kill," Eddie delivers the same kind of humor to social observation, which constantly stimulates your thoughts on a given topic, while at the same time dividing your side. There are many topics in this stand-up and are simply hysterical. The song about how to decide on the stage name of Englebert will leave you at the seams! <br /> <br /> Thanks to Andrew and Catherine! ... and "Do you have a flag?"
