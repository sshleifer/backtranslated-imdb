I really liked this Summerslam because of the appearance of the arena, curtains and just the general appearance was interesting for me for some reason. In any case, it could have been one of the best summers in history, if WWF did not have Lex Luger in the main tournament against Yokozni, now the time has come to have a powerful fat vs strong man, but I'm glad times have changed. It was a terrible main event, just like every Luger match is terrible. Other matches on the card include Razor Ramon vs Ted Dibiase, Steiner Brothers vs Heavenly Bodies, Shawn Michaels vs Curt Hening, this was an event in which Shawn called his big monster bodyguard Diesel, IRS vs 1-2-3 Kid, Bret Hart after first deals with Doink, then accepts Jerry Lawler, and things with Harts and Lawler have always been very interesting, then Ludvig Borga destroyed Marty Jannetta, Undertaker faced Giant Gonzalez in another horrible match, The Smoking Gunns and Tatanka took on Bam Bam Bigelow and the Headshrinkers and Yokozuna defended the title of world champion against Lex Luger. This match was boring and had a terrible ending. However, it deserves 8/10
