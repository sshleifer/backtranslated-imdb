It's hard to say more about this film without breaking it. I liked it because I did not expect what I saw but plain sex-drama, so ... It's a psycho-sexual thriller in which nothing is as it seems. It contains Emmanuelle Seigner, a stranger of the genre (and nudity) in which her husband, Polański, managed it. And a terrifying performance (I said creepy / yes CREEPY) from Toreton (actor Bernard Tavernier). It seems that Pascal Bruckner meets Roman Polański (better than Bitter Moon), as Chabrol went on the path or the thriller of Clouzot (I saw someone mention Les Diaboliques), but closer to Georges Franju's Les Yeux sans Visage godfather Phillies and more ). Gem! I'm afraid they'll turn it into a Hollywood remake like Nighwatch and The Vanishing.
