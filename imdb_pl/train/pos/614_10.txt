What a wonderful, fanciful movie "Stardust". <br /> <br /> I could easily finish it with one statement and just say that it can be considered a very strong recommendation to see it. <Br /> <br /> At a time when Hollywood seems focused on forcing modifications and sequels down our throats, "Stardust" makes us remember why we go to the cinema first and foremost - to escape from reality for a few hours and discover another life , other times or other planets. Ironically, "Stardust" takes us to all three places effortlessly and we all miss the children's joy. <br /> <br /> "Stardust" is full of all characters that we remember as children: princes, witches, pirates, ghosts and villains. She has a lady in danger, a hero, rogues, obstacles, spells, antidotes, spells, and even a little speed of light to make him quasi-modern. <br /> <br /> "Stardust" is a man from the city of Wall, conveniently located by the wall separating their city from the magic kingdom. The only way out of the wall is the castle, diligently guarded by a sloppy old encoder (played splendidly by David Kelly). One day a young man from Wall named Ben Barnes out maneuvers the old guard and escapes through the castle. It happens in an enchanted kingdom called Stormhold, where he meets a chained (and very sexy) young lady named Una. She is kept captive by a witch and kept in a leash by an inseparable chain. When the witch is absent, Una seduces Ben and sends him on the road. Ben returns to Wall without incident and continues his life. But nine months later he is called to the wall, where an old guard gives him what to expect - a boy. <br /> <br /> A boy named Tristan grows into a miserable young man (Charlie Cox), who is enchanted by a girl from his league, and also engaged to another. Nevertheless, a young lady (named Victoria and playing Sienna Miller) comes out with Tristain once and confesses her love to her. After paying attention to the shooting star, he tells him he can have it if he regains his star and brings it back. He agrees and embarks on an expedition that will take him to the other side of the wall. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the old king dies in the kingdom of Stormhold (perfectly played by Peter O'Toole). He calls on his remaining sons to tell them who will be the heir to the throne. His sons' names are Primus, Secondus, Sextmus and Septimus. Other sons who were killed by other brothers in a humorous competition to see who lives to win the throne. <br /> <br /> In any case, he casts a ruby ​​charm in the sky and Voila, what brings the star to the ground. <br /> <br /> The star breaks in the form of a beautiful woman named Yvaine (Clare Danes), and of course she is wearing a charm. Little, however, knows that now Tristain, the princes, and an aging witch named Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer), who wants to cut the hearts of the stars to regain their youth, convince her. <br /> <br /> Complicated? Yes. But all this happens together with the development of the adventure. <br /> <br /> Tristain was the first to find Yvaine, but he is so blinded by his dedication to Victoria that he does not recognize the growing bond between him and Yvaine. His initial interest is only to bring Yvaine back to Victoria as proof of his love. But first he must pass the princes and Lamia. Princes are not such a big problem, because they are constantly trying to kill each other - and like in "Pirates of the Caribbean" - death has never been so much fun. <br /> <br /> But Tristain also meets a witch who has enslaved his mother (though he does not know it's his mother) and a team of flying pirates under the leadership of Robert DeNiro. <br /> <br /> His is the most important character in the movie, and DeNiro plays her in a T-shirt. He steals the film with his hardness and soon we get to know the secret secret that will laugh the audience on the floor. Although his role is small, DeNiro is extraordinary! <br /> <br /> Michelle Pfeiffer is wonderful as Lamia - sexy evil witch. Claire Danes is the most suitable as a confused and worried Yvaine. I'm doing the perfect lady. Jason Flemyng, Adam Buston, Rupert Everett and Mark Strong add the perfect dose of lightness as fighting princes who die returning as ghosts of "Blithe Spirit" and "High Spirits". <br /> <br /> In addition, director Matthew Vaughn, whose only other director's experience was "Layer Cake," entangles a charming story that everyone will be happy with. <br /> <br /> "Stardust" may be too complicated for young children, but anyone over the age of 13 will want to see this movie many times. That's good. "Stardust" is what films should be. Perfectly written, perfectly planted, perfectly directed and perfectly working. In other words ... perfect.
