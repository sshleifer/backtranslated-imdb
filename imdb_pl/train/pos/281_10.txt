This game was really great and quite a challenge. It has a great, terrible story, and the graphics are very good. I recommend this game to all Horror fans and is very addictive from the beginning to the end. The only problem with this game is that I would like more weapons, but it's just me. <br /> <br /> A really great game for RPG fans and Shoot'em'up. <br /> <br />>
