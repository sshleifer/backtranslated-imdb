This movie was watched by my wife and I when it appeared in 1978. This was a revelation for us. We thought we were the only gay and lesbian couple who ever married and had children. Of course, we were wrong. Love can come from what you do not expect or you do not want. But we have chosen this love anyway. <br /> <br /> And no, it never changed our sexual orientation. Such things are for Christian wackos. <br /> <br /> When we were young, we had an affair, but never with the opposite sex. When we aged, we stopped having extramarital affairs. <br /> <br /> This story is not far-reaching. However, the suggestion that they have become heterosexuals seems to me quite unreal. My wife and I have been sleeping together for 40 years. We're still gay. The end of the story.
