Yes, this is a movie with horror anthology and it was great fun! This is because although the film was clearly terrifying, some stories had a light spirit - and sometimes even a few laughs. This is not bad at all, because sometimes the horrors are a bit stuffy and too serious. Because of this and because all four stories were pretty good, this is one of the better movies of this style that I've seen. <br /> <br /> The motive that connects each story is the house itself. Four different stories concern people who rent a home or study what happened to tenants. <br /> <br /> In the first segment, Denholm Elliott appeared as a horror writer who has a writing block. So, to change the scenery, they rent this house. Almost immediately, Elliott's block disappears and works constantly on the story of the serial killer. Amazingly, soon after his block disappears, he begins to see his fictional character! Time after time, a psychotic killer appears and then disappears - giving the impression of losing his mind. This may be the best story, because a nice spin ends with the revival of history. <br /> <br /> The second, though not bad at all, is probably the weakest. Peter Cushing plays a bachelor who is trying to find a friend who died some time ago (although her picture looked very modern). When he enters the chamber of horror movies in the city, he sees a waxed figure that reminds him of his lost woman and is fascinated and afraid of it. Later a friend visits him (Joss Ackland) and he also sees the character and is delighted with it. All this leads to an ending which, to be honest, was a bit disappointed. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lee is soon to play the harsh and raw father of a pathetic girl. For most of this segment, Lee seemed like an idiot, but in the end you can understand his behavior. Although slow, this ended very well. <br /> <br /> The fourth segment was the dumbest and aimed at the parody of the genre. Jon Pertwee (the third "Doctor" from the television series DR. WHO) is a very temperamental actor known for his performances of Dracula. However, according to him, nothing is right in this movie and in a fit of piquancy he jumps out of the set to find better props for this vampire film. It's really interesting that he played this role because it seemed natural to Christopher Lee, who played Dracula or other vampires in billions of times (give or take a few). I liked the Pertwee line when it basically said that all Dracula's incarnations and other Dracula's recent incarnations were nonsense compared to Bela Lugosi! Maybe that's why Lee did not take this part! In spite of very stupid moments it was very funny and fun - maybe as good or better than in the first segment. <br /> <br /> Given that the movie started and ended so well, he had excellent acting and writing, it's hard not to like this movie.
