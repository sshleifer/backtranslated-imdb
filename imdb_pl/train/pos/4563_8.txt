It's hard to imagine that this movie is based on a real story, and how Christy managed to do this miracle is so exciting. Daniel Day-Lewis is a chameleon, it's really hard to imagine how much effort he has made to create this disabled character. Watching it on the screen is a shocking and breathtaking experience. <br /> <br /> The film is not as pessimistic as I thought before, the story is quite clear and intriguing. Christy is not despised by the normal, his life is also colorful and delightful, although we can be aware of loneliness and painful fetters in his eyes. <br /> <br /> An important factor in Christy's success is his mother's support which seems to be more moving, and the unknown actress Brenda Fricker also deserves an Oscar for this role, this fat little middle-aged woman uses her all to fulfill Christy's dream. So happy for Christa! And Hugh O'Conor is also perfect as a young Christy, what a performance for a child! Christy's love story is very well made, full of trust. Christy wants love and nothing can give him the right to love, his crush on the beautiful Dr. Eileen Cole (surprisingly played by Fiona Shaw, I'm deeply impressed by her role in the Harry Potter series, the repugnant Aunt Petunia, so her appearance in this role is really out of my mind, but in any case, every woman has her own youth ...) is paranoid and offensive, I have compassion for him, love is a double-edged sword, happiness and agony are next to everyone else. <br /> <br /> Btw, Jim Sheridan's works are good (IN America, THE BOXER etc.) except GET RICH OR DIE Trying, God knows why he decided to manage this nonsense! It's really a pity for him, it's a pity!
