witty. funny. intelligent. incredible. I skipped channels late at night. I stumbled upon it and a fire started. every night I sat late and recorded it for everyone I know. a few. like 3 people from almost 100 people I watched, I do not think it's as amazing as me. others laughed so loudly that they cried and thanked me at the same time. do yourself a favor. run, do not go. watch it and enjoy it. intelligence and humor. it's a win-win situation. I would like to be able to have an afternoon tea with him and meet a really rare comedian whom we need as a society more ... sanechaos.
