Usually I really like movies like "Chances Are", but for several reasons I was not happy about it. The first half was pretty good because Alex Finch died and was resurrected in a new body (played by Robert Downey Jr.). He meets with his wife (Cybill Shepherd) and a friend (Ryan O'Neal) and his daughter, who is already an adult. The scenes in which they meet again, and Downey, discovering again who he once was, are well done, and when Shepherd finally believes that her husband is really reincarnated, there is a lot of emotion and happiness, but from there the film goes down . There are several sex-related scenes that totally discourage me, especially Downey and Shepherd, who want to meet again despite the difference in age. After that, however, the film ends in the most satisfactory way, taking into account the circumstances of the plot. I was disappointed because I did not expect the film to become so immoral until the end. This story had great potential, and the scenes in heaven are well done. There is a good theme song sung by Peter Ceter and Cher, but ultimately the movie is not great. For a better, similar movie, try "Heaven Can Wait". Decent, but I really do not want to see him because of the scenes in the second half. <br /> <br /> *** with ****
