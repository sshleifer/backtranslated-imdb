But how can you stand at the head of a baseball team that can not win. For George Knox, it is not easy. When the movie opens, Roger Beaumont (Joseph-Gordon-Levitt) and his best friend J.P (Milton Davis Jr.) ride their bikes around the stadium of angels. When they return home to a foster mother, Roger is surprised by his father's visit (Dermot Mulroney). His mother is dead! And when he asks his father when they will be a family again, father jokes: "I say when angels win the division championship." So later, Roger and J.P are hiding in the tree to watch the angels playing baseball. When the manger George Knox (Danny Glover) takes out his pitcher, the pitcher gets mad and gets in a fight with him, and soon the team of angels gets into a fight, thanks to which Knox gets kicked out of the game. That night, Roger prays because the corners win the championship. When his adoptive mother, Maggie Nelson (Brenda Ficker) agrees that Roger and JP are going to baseball, Roger sees real angles in the field and helps the left fielder (Matthew McConaughey) make a catch that leaves the manger and play-by-play man ( Jay. O Sanders), how he did it. Roger learns from the main angel (Christopher Lloyd) that only he can see the angles because he was the only one who prayed for help. <br /> <br /> 10/10
