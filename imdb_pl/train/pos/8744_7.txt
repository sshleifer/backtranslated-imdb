It is a low-budget film with a cast of unknowns and minimal images from the location. Filipino substitute for Thailand and no one actually goes to Hong Kong. The shot of a Cathay Pacific jet landing at an old airport makes the transition ideal. This movie proves that you do not need megabytes or celebrities to create a perfect movie. It does not contain any gaffes or excesses that young filmmakers often come across. Robust performance by people who know all aspects of film making and understand the trade-offs between art and cash. Excellent work!
