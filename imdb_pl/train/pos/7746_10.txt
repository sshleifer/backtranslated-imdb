Those of you who know the dEUS group know the lead singer of Tom Barman. He directed the movie a bit as if he was making music, it was a combination of everything. It is a comedy, although in the majority absurd and cynical drama, none of the main characters have a happy life, at least, and really have no purpose. <br /> <br /> The film starts from Friday morning in Antwerp, Belgium, with the scenes of several people, some of them have nothing to do with each other, but they will contact each other during the day and night. There are several main characters: a teacher who writes books that no one reads, a young researcher with a morbid taste of death and his sister, a gallery owner, two young men constantly in contact with the law, a man who works in a cinema and two young women. The whole film is followed by a man who has something to do with the wind. All characters have problems with family or friends or only with life. <br /> <br /> The movie takes place in Antwerp and shows several beautiful shots of the city and the port. The events of this day are not easy to explain, I advise you to just watch a movie, there is just too much to tell. But I can say that, Bartender has an excellent camera use and uses a lot of music (mainly dance music, not really rock music) to set the mood, especially the party is filled with excellent music. <br /> <br /> This film is an experience in itself, it will not leave you wiser about life, maybe only that you will have to experience it and not to waste it or have false moral truths. see it is definitely worth it!
