Drodzy Czytelnicy, <br /> <br /> The last battle between Rebellion and the Empire. The Second Death Star is coming to an end, and when it is completed, it will mean the destruction of the Rebel Alliance. Luke Skywalker, now a Jedi knight, returns with Tatooine with Han Solo and Princess Leia, now revealed as the twin sister of Luke! They agree to attack the shield generator on the Moon Moon in Endor, while Lando Calrissian attacks the Death Star. Little is known that the most ingenious trap was created for them, and the Emperor Palpatine personally supervises the construction of the Second Death Star. <br /> <br /> The return of the Jedi is my favorite from the original trilogy. It has action, drama, romance, great battles, fantastic acting, amazing fighting scenes and John Williams' amazing music. Mark Hamill is already fully mature in the Jedi Knight, the na√Øve farmer has gone, and in his place is a calm, relaxed Jedi determined to save the galaxy. Leia is still cool in this movie, like Han and Lando. 3P0, R2 and Chewie play the role of T, while James Earl Jones is still the greatest villain of the cinema: Darth Vader. Ian McDiarmid is also a perfect villain as the cruel and brutally merciless Emperor Palpatine. The action sequences of this movie are incredibly amazing, and the swordfaces are serious and severe. The score of John Williams is still great and enriches the film by several levels. <br /> <br /> Signed, The Constant DVD Collector
