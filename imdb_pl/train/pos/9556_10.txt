When our local TV station took off for the first time, it filled many of its schedules with old British programs. "Close your daughters!" it was broadcast properly and I - rocked for the first few seconds of the movie - ran into an empty tape. The best thing I've ever done. <br /> <br /> The actors are beautifully fitted to their characters and bring them into a wonderful life with the right accents (Foppington Christopher Plummer will leave you at the same time as Hoyden and her family). Double enthusiasts abound, the role-playing circles in circles mix and match characters, lively gags lurk in every scene, and regular comments appear regularly. <br /> <br /> I showed the movie to my friends years ago, they called the song "lost treasure" the same for the cast as for the story. To this day I can think about the dialog box. If this gem ever finds a way to release a DVD, I'll be at the beginning of the line.
