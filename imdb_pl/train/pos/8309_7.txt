It's always a nice surprise when a movie made for TV turns out to be fun, like Little Richard. This is a very visual movie about Rock and Roller, Little Richard, played by an actor named Leon, whom I have never seen before, but does a very good job. Like most TV movies, it's a bit of a tamer than cinema, which is a shame because I'm sure we can see a lot about Little Richard who was controversial. Instead, we see a lot of religious nonsense, which is the only thing that spoils the movie and ultimately spoiled a very promising career. All in all, this movie is good, and acting is above average television film. 7 out of 10.
