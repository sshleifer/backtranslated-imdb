Philo Vance (William Powell) helps solve many murders among the rich after the dog show. <br /> <br /> I usually hate too intricate secrets (like this one), but I LOVE this movie. He moves very fast (only 72 minutes), is beautifully directed by Michael Curtiz (he uses tones of the camera that simply speed up the narrative), has a very ingenious story (including the solution of the murdered room, which was just amazing) and has a very good cast. <br /> <br /> Powell is very polite and great as Vance - it seems that it does not work - is Vance! Mary Astor does not have much to do but adds class and beauty to production. Everyone else is also very good, but Eugene Pallette is best as Detective Heath. He is a very good actor with a very distinctive voice, and some of his lines were fun. <br /> <br /> Essentially, the great mystery of the Hollywood murder of the 1930s. Worth to see. <br /> <br />
