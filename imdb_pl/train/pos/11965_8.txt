Reading the wide range of Scoop reviews in the last few days, I went into the theater prepared for Woody's bad performance. Fortunately, I could not be more wrong. True, Woody's performer slows down, but Woody, the screenwriter and director, is in great shape - and he has found a reliable way to integrate his 70-year-old into history. Judging by laughter and joy, the audience ate one and allen's dialogue in a way that I have not seen for several years. <br /> <br /> In a film landscape dominated by software-approved feature arcs, twenty-year flavors and tariffs for assembly lines for kids, it is both a source of satisfaction and inspiration for Allen to realize his very personal and still winning path.
