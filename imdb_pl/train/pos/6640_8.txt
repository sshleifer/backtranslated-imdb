This one minute movie is probably the first movie ever made. Other inventors previously filmed actions - such as Edison's motion photo from sneezing - but the Lumiere brothers developed equipment that greatly developed the medium. At the time, of course, their "cinematograph" had to surprise their peers, including their subjects. In the first case, the brothers write employees who leave the factory, some of whom understandably try to hide their camera awareness. Lumieres is trying to make the film more fun by introducing animals and bicycles, but "La Sortie Des Usines Lumiere" does not match the ingenuity of their later films. The most interesting aspect of this short film is the brothers' choice of the familiar ritual of the working class as an object. Their selection is the first evidence of their curiosity for all people in the world, which makes watching their experiments extremely satisfying and fascinating today. <br /> <br /> Mark: 8
