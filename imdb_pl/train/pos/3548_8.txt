I just saw the movie version of Frank Loesser's Boys and Dolls for the third time with my mother who had never seen it before. She was pleasantly surprised by the singing of Jean Simmons and Marlon Brando. And she thought that the Havana sequences in which Simmons and Brando were dancing in the storm were perfect. These were also impressive for me and were usually the most important moments of the film. The film directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, which was created as the story of Damon Runyon, takes some time with the slow pace of non-musical scenes, but it draws you in a moment. The second story with Frank Sinatra and Vivian Blaine was not so convincing for me, but she still had her charm especially during the "Sue Me" issue. He also loved the "Sit, Take a Cruise" by Stubby Kaye and the performances of Sheldon Leonard and B. S. Pully. In the whole theater, Guys and Dolls is not a great movie musical, but certainly very good.
