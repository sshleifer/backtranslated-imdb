I expected it to be the same kind of schlock as the previous Modesty Blaise movie, which is why I left it unnoticed for such a long time, but I was very pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> Far from succession, stupid battles for guns and chases of cars / boats, it was an almost thoughtful analysis of how a pretty girl becomes as hard as nails, and nothing is overrated or overly rationalized. <br /> <br /> Probably, the budget limitations really helped this: less time and effort was devoted to looking for stupid ways to make stuntmen pretend to die, and more dedicated to making the movie worth watching. Hell, the biggest weapon battle is out of the screen - and the scene you hear is all the better that the background noise increases the tension - who wins? Who dies? <br /> <br /> Alexandra Staden may not be as great as Monica Vitti, but few are, and she certainly has every ounce of class and fire that is needed for the character to work - and the shape of her face, hair and high , the slender body could be picked up straight from comics graphics. <br /> <br /> Nikolai Coaster-Waldau was the perfect choice for the evil guy Blaise, that made the character interesting and pleasant to watch - even sympathetic (and I doubt if I would consider accepting many brutal, psychopathic murderers as buddies to drink). I can not think of one of Hollywood's "former waiters" who could break away from this role. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Blaise baddies always dies, in the end (there are no spoilers there!) is really a good thing, because all the girls who would spend their time fainting such a disgustingly handsome and interesting piece, can now pragmatically satisfy us, ordinary Joes.
