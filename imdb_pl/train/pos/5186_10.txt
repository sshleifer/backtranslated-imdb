I was delighted to finally see the Amazing Stories release of the first season on DVD. I forgot about the excellent cast of actors and directors working in this series. The only longest way to see this amazing series is to collect VHS 2 or 3 episodes or when Sci-Fi re-starts episodes. However, when Sci-Fi hosted replays, they usually stick to the same episodes. In the first season there were some great episodes, such as The Mission, which they did not repeat. Does anyone know exactly how long this series lasted? He talks about 1985-1987 at the summit here at IMDb, but I thought it lasted more than two years. If you love Twilight Zone, Night Gallery and Outer Limits, you'll love this series and you will not be disappointed with the purchase.
