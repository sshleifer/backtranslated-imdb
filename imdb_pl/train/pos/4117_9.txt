"DÃ´ desu ka den" is the first colorful film by Master Akira Kurosawa, and surprisingly does not apply to samurai, ronin, warlords or battlefields. He is in a very poor community in the slums of Tokyo, where the residents are homeless drunkards, beggars, tramps, abused women, losers. I do not know the reason why Kurosawa chose this tragic theme and surroundings to put colors, but in reality these are very sad stories, some of them break the heart. Personally, I like the touching story of a boy and his father who dreams about their own home and the house they built; the story of a delayed boy who believes he is piloting a train; a story about a man who brings up five children, as if they were their own sons and daughters; and the story of a young woman used by her stepfather. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Dodeskaden? O Caminho da Vida "(" Dodeskaden? The Way of the Life ")
