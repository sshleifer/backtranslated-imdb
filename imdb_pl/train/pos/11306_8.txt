The disastrous social situation triggers: Zuboza≈Ça Giovanna found herself in the gutter, but still has an ace in her sleeve: beauty and youth. Bragana, the leaseholder of a fat gas station that has been working for many years, picks her up from the street and offers her bed and house with his clumsy feeling. But the physical contact to which Giovanna is now exposed only gives her a sense of disgust, and consequently does not see in him a benefactor, but a tormentor whom he must get rid of. <br /> <br /> The arrival of Gino, a young migrant worker, finally provides her with the longed-for opportunity. And you do not have to ask her twice: at the first meeting he gives him a sense of physical desire, and a little later allows him to seduce her without any resistance. <br /> <br /> Developing a partnership, however, must comply with the strict rules developed by Giovanna. Gino's longing for freedom is suppressed, his desire to leave the place with Giovanni and start a new life away from the fatso is pushed aside. Giovanna aims at a different goal: to kill Bragana, inheritance, and also to collect the insurance premium. In her hands, Gino degenerates into a self-sacrificing tool. Being totally at the mercy of this woman, she turns into a cold-blooded killer. <br /> <br /> But unlike Giovanny, he questions the crime committed on a moral level. Just taking over the place of Bragana, which involves sleeping in a dead man's bed, causes a profound dislike of himself. Later, after he learned about the upcoming payment of insurance money and he seems to have reviewed Giovanna's crafty plan, he also performs a physical separation from his lover and finds comfort in the arms of a prostitute. <br /> <br /> If Visconti's film ended at this point, it can easily be classified as a condemning portrait of a cool, calculating and unscrupulous woman with a slight touch of social criticism. But then the last sequences make this carefully constructed construct of ideas fall apart. In the end, Giovanna feels guilty about what she has done, and thanks to the uncompromising revelation of her innermost feelings, she manages to rekindle Gino's love. Her violent death by an absurd road accident not only leaves him helpless at the mercy of fate. This also applies to us, we realize that none of the acting characters can be responsible for their disaster. The perpetrator is simply the state of society, which from the beginning determines the path of the individual invariably. <br /> <br />
