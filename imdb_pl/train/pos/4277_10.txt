"Ko to tamo peva" is one of the best movies I've ever seen. The tragicomedy with very deep implications for the fate of humanity is shown through the eyes of seemingly very simple and ordinary people from God's abandoned Serbian province just before the beginning of World War II. I saw it in a small cinema in Russia, where the film had a very limited distribution and since then I have not had the opportunity to meet it. It is a pity that this great movie is almost forgotten. I searched for copies of VHS or DVD many times and unfortunately - I could not find any. I would be very grateful to other fans of this little gem of film making for suggesting how to buy copies.
