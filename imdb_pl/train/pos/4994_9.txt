Man's Castle is a great example of a movie before the code. Includes realistic events with truly pleasant and imperfect figures. Spencer Tracy plays Bill, a free penniless soul in his pocket. He earns his odd job and travels to a new city when he gets bored with his surroundings. One night he meets Trina, a beauty by any standards, which is cold and lonely. She refused to resort to prostitution, so she did not eat for a few days, but they both are doing very well and forming a relationship. His free spirit tempts him to leave her, so life is rocky, but there is a real spark between them, even if they live in a hut on the river. <br /> <br /> Tracy is one of the great actors on the silver screen. His characters are amazing and relative. We see his thoughts on his face, which makes him easily identifiable, even if we believe he is behaving badly. Young is great in pre-code movies. Her character is very sweet, but far from perfect, making her more likeable. <br /> <br /> Elements of the pre-release code include skinny immersion, pregnancy before marriage and crime.
