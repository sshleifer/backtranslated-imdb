"The Groove Tube" was initially shown on video, in the first "video theaters" in Boston. In one room there were television monitors on high stands, with old places to the cinema, in small groups facing the monitors. There were old fridges fitted with Pepsi and baskets of York Peppermint Patties. In the second, smaller room there were no seats, only large pillows. It was a room "for smokers", i.e. People up there. This act added only joy to the film. <br /> <br /> I was a "frequent viewer"; the scenes that I liked best and which I remember to this day are: Koko The Clown, Kramp Easy-Lube Shortening, Safety Sam / VD PSA, Chevy Chase hitchhiker on the run through the forest, Finger Ballet on what eventually turned out the naked body of a woman. The last item was very similar to the late, amazing Ernie Kovacs. I've lost many readers under 48 ("who is Ernie Kovacs ??"), but trust me, these are fun things. <br /> <br /> One of the reasons why I was a "frequent viewer" was that my friends and I would bring other virgins to "Groove Tube". We sat and slyly watched the faces of the "virgins" as the PSA "Safety Sam" plays. When the camera slowly approaches "Sam", we wait for "OH!" Recognition on the face of the "virgin". Each time he was more funny than the last one. And then this "virgin" would bring a friend to see the performance, repeating what we did. To get this joke, you need to watch the video. <br /> <br /> Yes, some of them are dated, but most games, movies, TV and now video are. Just look at any movie from the 80s. <br /> <br /> I saw "The Groove Tube" in the theater as a movie, grainy transfer from the original movie. It was cut out and some original scenes with a high point were missing. <br /> <br /> The first program of "Saturday Night Live," in which Chevy Chase appeared, provoked immediate comments: "This is the guy from" The Groove Tube "", so he was the forerunner of Chevy. <br /> <br /> I can not look at the shortening box without hearing a teacher, "cover your hands with a lot of Kramp Easy- Shortening Lube ..." and thinking about the recipe "Kramp Holiday Loaf". I always laugh at the "Baking Need" passage in the grocery store. <br /> <br /> The early 70's were sometimes dark; "The Groove Tube" was fresh, new and really "got" the humor of those times. It offers a "hip generation" humor that was not available in any other format / medium. MJH
