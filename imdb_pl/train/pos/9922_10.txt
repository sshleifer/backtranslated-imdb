This is the latest addition to the new wave of educational documentary films such as "The Corporation" and "Fahrenheit 9/11." His commentary is clear and unwavering, just like the breathtaking movie style of this well-made feature. Film manages to impose a powerful sense of how uncertain our world is as we drive towards an ecologically unstable future with the speed of lightning - showing us the terrifying beauty in striving for progress. <br /> <br /> A truly extraordinary achievement that must be seen by anyone who cares about the world that we leave to our children. Bravo! <br /> <br /> Note - this is also the only movie (from 8) in Varsity theaters (Toronto), where you can see a sticker that reads ... "... another proof of the popularity and importance of this jewel. <br /> <br /> My plant ... Academy Award nomination for the best documentary. <br /> <br /> OB101
