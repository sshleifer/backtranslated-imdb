So your bairny are in a night's sleep? Does your wife visit her mother-in-law? You, however, are at home. Is the dark and stormy night and there is no football on the TV, and the dishwasher needs stacking? So what are you going to do now? <br /> <br /> I'll tell you! <br /> <br /> Go make old-fashioned cocoa (preferably Frys!) Grab some ginger nuts and sit in front of the DVD. Now choose and play in Arthur Askeys world war two thriller / horror The Ghost Train, come back to this comfortable sofa and enjoy the night! <br /> <br /> Ghost Train is a real British time of war! Arthur Askey with his side kick, Stinker Murdoch, entertains you and I suspect that the cast, to high numbers, emotions and spills, the spy thriller. It is embedded in old rural England during the Second World War. He focuses on a patchy group of people who must stay overnight, thanks to circumstances beyond everyone's control, in the old railway waiting room they discover, haunted by an old train. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds nicely and accurately and is the merit of the whole cast, it is humorous in parts, and sometimes really frightening! <br /> <br /> (The story was written by this old boy, Godfrey's fame with Dads Army and he's smart) <br /> <br /> Arthur Askey is funny and he prepares his procedures very well for you and the cast also shows that he can play a little! The cast is never on stage, even the railroad porter and the parrot help give gravity to the film. <br /> <br /> Oh, and when it's over, remember to put the dishwasher!
