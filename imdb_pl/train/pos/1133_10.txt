It's a great movie that's so exaggerated that my wife, daughter and I think it's irresistible. The plot is simply crazy, but it "rings" to the world of telenovel in all its scandalous impossibility and impossibility. <br /> <br /> I particularly liked the performances of Kevin Kline and Sally Field. I do not have anybody better than Kline playing THICKheaded. Field's really desperate need for attention and affirmation - and almost bipolar mood swings - sounded nice against the background of the famous Field (infamous?) "You like me! Oskar's exclamation. People who are able to embrace such a large grain of salt are too rare in this world. <br /> <br /> I think it's the only movie in which I was not impatient because of the characterization of Whoopi Goldberg; I thought she was "in place" in every note she hit. Robert Downey Jr., Teri Hatcher, Cathy Moriarty and Elizabeth Shue were also excellent. Just a great movie if you fancy a ride and LAUGH!
