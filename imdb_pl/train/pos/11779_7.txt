After reading the book, I was a little disappointed with the series, but all in all it is quite informative. Reading other comments, it is comforting to know that "culture warriors" work hard to see "attacks" on "Western civilization" under each rug. <br /> <br /> Is Diamond preached a little? Sure. Like many scientists, he considers his theory to be the most important in history. He uses the phrase "pistols, germs and steel" on the surface of every occasion during the series. We get it after about the first 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> Is Diamond a bit simplified (in series)? Sure. The part about the Spaniards in South America is especially fun, condensing a very long, complicated story up to "smallpox, swords and horses", ending the entire conquest of South America in about 15 minutes. But the question remains important - these things have in fact contributed (but not completely) to the reasons for the Spaniard's success in relation to established cultures. <br /> <br /> Is he in any way preaching * against Western civilization? No. Not a word. Not to my ear. He only says that happiness has played a big role in determining which cultures are moving faster, not * that happiness is the only reason. <br /> <br /> In the end, if you are looking for something that confirms your own sense of superiority, then this series is not for you. But if you are interested in all factors, and not on how societies succeed or fail, this series presents a useful interpretation of historical evidence.
