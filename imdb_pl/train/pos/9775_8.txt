Tears of Kali is an original but defective horror, which delves into the actions of a cult group in India made up of German psychologists who have learned to control their will and their bodies to such an extent that they can make others "healed" radical techniques (which can cause nightmarish hallucinations and physical pain and torture) to release suppressed demons in them. <br /> <br /> The film is shown as a series of vignettes on the Taylor-Eriksson group - the above-mentioned cult group. The first segment is slightly slower than the rest, but it serves well to set the premise for the rest of the movie. The rest is played like a mindf @ ck movie with a few key staples thrown into the mix (nakedness full of the front, a little bit gore) to make you happy. <br /> <br /> I say this. It may not be spectacular, but its concept is quite neato and provides the right place. 8/10.
