A soldier may not have Lucas' academy actors or special effects, but he definitely does it for me. I will not tell you what's going on, I'm sure you've already read the summary. It's a great, future-oriented action / science fiction movie. Kurt Russell does not say much, usually has a strange or drone facial expression, but it fits the character. There are great action and fighting scenes; some of the scenes are unrealistic, but Hollywood makes us believe that we should escape the normal life. I did not see Soldier 2, but it's one of my favorites. I am lucky to have a wife who copies movies for guys; We both love this movie and recommend it to anyone who likes hard-fiction / science-fiction movies.
