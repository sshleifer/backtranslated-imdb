I realize that many people hate this movie, but I must admit that this is one of my favorites. I happen to like him better than his predecessor and I'm happy that he will like him better than many movies. <br /> <br /> First of all, I think that people never give any credit history, just like Return to the Future, Time Travel is difficult to write, and in this movie there are, inter alia, Time Travel and Spiritual Journey. <br /> <br /> I also feel that Keanu and Alex were on the best performances in this film, they looked cooler, they acted more fun, and he said more fun things. <br /> <br /> The set design is also amazing, the sets are sometimes quite detailed and massive and it's hard to believe that these sets were created for the movie with two teenage donuts who can hardly spell ... but it's not a genius of the whole series, making these two idiots greater than the heroes of life who are responsible for the entire utopian future of the earth. <br /> <br /> The costume design was great. Bill and Ted look really cool in Bogus Journey, where, as in the Perfect Adventure, they look more like, as they would put it, FAGS !!! <br /> <br /> Even the music in this movie is amazing, the result in particular. I can say so much about this film because I love it. But this is one of those movies in which I grew up, and every time I liked him, I could understand why people hate or just think about God in comparison with the Perfect Adventure (which I also love by the way). <br /> <br /> MAKE YOUR BAD SELF !!!!
