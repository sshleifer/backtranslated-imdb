At first glance, Who's Singing Over There seems to be an absurd and perfect comedy? only with unusual, quiet and slow motion: what a mistake! <br /> <br /> Starting with two singers in a desert landscape, then a bus and a great group of actors, there is a jewel! <br /> <br /> A complex story and a false rhythm make you think, yes, it's comical, but it just lets you guess that it will be a gentle kind of movie. <br /> <br /> Not at all: very funny immediately, dark subtle cynical in relation to others, its development surprises throughout history? Very cleverly and cleverly presented, all characters are important, and the actors give them a full life. <br /> <br /> And amazingly, it's based on deep observation, great camera control and is of great importance and really everything, the general direction and the way of presenting details that you just forget that it's a movie: it's like that if you were watching a human society that you do not know yet, shot by a friend behind the camera. <br /> <br /> And you are after him. It is simple and simply unique! <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong; in no way it would mean a scenario, image quality, the note has a kind of amateur way, no, no! It's great art! <br /> <br /> Because it flows like a river? Up up, down to the sea, with the different types of terrain and peregrinations that the real river is heading to on the way to the sea? from a tiny thing to the mainstream. <br /> <br /> This metaphorical image I have used is the best way to find all the charm that Who's Singing Over There has. For me, I'm taking the hammer again: simply exceptional ... <br /> <br /> I saw that the director is the one who did Chat Blanc / Chat Noir, who, as I know, is a calm famous? But since I have not seen it yet, I had no idea about this gentleman. <br /> <br /> Other reviewers have written dithyrambical comments about this movie, I fully agree! <br /> <br /> The European Eastern cinema is not well known, because it rarely translates, but I am lucky to have this example language in the original language, with good English subtitles. All in all: deep, tasty and unique ... <br /> <br /> For fast and empty types of exploding and special effects, avoid them at all costs, it may be too subtle and good for you! > <br /> But if you're interested in different genres and / or classics, I think you will not regret this, and if you buy, he will have good company in your personal DVD library, with no less than well-deserved big names like Billy Wilder , Lubitsch or Sacha Guitry among some of my favorite directors. At least for this movie! <br /> <br /> *** The movie is never really good, unless the camera is the eye of Orson Welles's poet ***
