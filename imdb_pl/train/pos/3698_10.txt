I had no idea what the movie was until I read about it in the weekly L.A. Generally, I agree with reviews at LA Weekly and decided to get a ticket for this movie. film stars molly parker (from my favorite Deadwood television show) and Lukas haas - I suspect we will see more in the near future. The film is funny, nice, offers great acting and beautiful photography. I do not know if the movie has distribution, but I hope that soon - or will be - soon. this is to be a real gem of india. he even has the music of my favorite band, the silver jews! the only disappointment was that Molly Parker was not on show. even without her ... it was the best movie I saw at the festival.
