"Gunga Din": one of the greatest adventure stories ever! The story of a legion of British foreigners in nineteenth-century India and a modest "water carrier" named Gunga Din, a local resident who aspires to be similar to his military counterparts; three British sergeants whose mutual loyalty and friendship go far beyond the limits of ordinary patriotism. Their mutual friendship is real and lasting, and everyone would be willing to sacrifice their lives for the good of others. Gunga Din also wants to be a soldier, especially Bugler, but he can never reach this rank because of his subordinate social position. However, the heroes are not created according to their social references, they are ready to sacrifice for the greater good of others. Gunga Din tries to prove his advantage at every turn, but will he ever reach the rank he is so passionately looking for? .... "You are a better man than me, Gung Din"! One of the Hollywood classics and excellent 10 !!!!
