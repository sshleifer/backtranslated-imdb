When the US joined the First World War, the government forced Hollywood to release propaganda films. THE LITTLE American is probably the best of many because it plays Mary Pickford. <br /> <br /> Pickford plays a young woman torn between two men: Jack Holt (Germany) and Raymond Hatton (Frenchman), but her decision is delayed because of the war, when both men enlist. <br /> <br /> When the Pickford ship is sailing, it is sunk by the Germans (think Lusitania) because it carries ammunition, Pickford has a great scene when he stands on a lifeboat and yells at the German commander. Later, of course, he runs into Holt and Hatton when he is being held as a prisoner of war in the castle. <br /> <br /> Director Cecil B. DeMille provides one really great scene in this movie as Pickford and Holt wanders through a bombed village. A destroyed church is passing, in which there is only one wall. There is a very big crucifix on the wall. When they stand and look, the wall collapses, but the figure of Jesus remains suspended in the air. This is a very surreal moment in a film that is otherwise very simple and non-artistic. <br /> <br /> Pickford is, as always, a pleasure to watch. She was always a very natural actress who avoided waving her hands through many other actors that day. She is also very pretty. Holt is very good at being the leader. Hatton is fine. Among the actors' names in the "additional" parts are Wallace Beery, Ramon Novarro, Colleen Moore, Ben Alexander, Hobart Bosworth, Norman Kerry, Walter Long, James Neill and Edythe Chapman. <br /> <br /> It's not a great movie, but it's interesting to see American propaganda at work.
