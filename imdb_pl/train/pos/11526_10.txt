I hired this movie from a hit on a whim .. I like the alana ark and the cover caught ... I read in the back and I knew it would be the best or worst film I've ever seen ... I think I'm lucky .. I was laughing from the beginning to the end .. alan arkin brings a great character to this movie. Since then I bought a used copy of the rental to my collection and I watch it all the time. I have recommended this movie to many people and everyone liked it the same way as me ... I see complaints about the menu and DVD features .. but this does not answer the movie .. the disk was written for Blockbuster exculsivley, so they did not let you skip the preview ... otherwise not you should allow DVD functions to discourage you from watching a great movie.
