I watched the movie a few days ago in a small independent cinema in Paris. It was my last evening in the French capital and the best farewell I could have chosen. These twenty episodes made me relive the impressions I had gathered in Paris, in a cordial manner, without going into kitsch or sentimental schmaltz. Each episode is full of surprises, strong emotions and suggestive photos, and each short movie is directed according to the rules of good story. For me, this kind of film requires a lot more talent and features of the director and author of the script than any epic two-hour drama, and all managed to do the job perfectly well! The stories have been carefully selected in terms of matching arrondissement and perfectly express the right style. Each episode was viewed from another cube, had a different theme, a different style, and yet twenty stories create a harmonious orchestra of films. The most unusual advantage of the concept of episodic film is in my opinion based on the fact that you can switch between a large variety of feelings and moods without the danger of overloading, vice versa: melange of sadness, melancholy pure joy, despair, anger, anxiety, curiosity or passion give the film a unique freshness and harmony. And do not forget about the whole theme of love! Love between heroes, love between heroes and Paris, as well as the love of directors and actors / actresses for this project. I do not want to delve into the details of the episodes, because there are so many of them, but I have to emphasize a number of world-famous actors and actresses from around the world and their approach to this project. Some played with their image, some completely interrupted it, and some interpreted the stereotypes associated with their home country or roles they played earlier, so intertextuality was given throughout the movie. All in all, I can absolutely recommend this great collage and I am looking forward to it being released on DVD.
