I really have to disagree with the guys who (if they saw the whole movie) would see a stunning Scottish scenery (some of the best ever shot in Skye) and found a movie with a difficult beginning. really a whole. <br /> <br /> This is not a big budget movie. It is rather a film with a strong sense of the community. <br /> <br /> I can not say how many "standard" films I've been bored with - pushing the same polished things over and over again. Seachd does not mention it at all. It seems that he is trying to offer something more real and certainly more Gaelic than any other Scottish film. <br /> <br /> OK, so acting is not like a hit. This is because the actors are seemingly real people. Actually, I thought that the key roles of the boy and his grandfather were really convincing - and sometimes amazingly beautiful. <br /> <br /> Seachd really has a second look, because there are many threads that become clearer the second time - it really contributes to the ending. <br /> <br /> In general, the combination of music and (sometimes) stunning visual effects, as well as the attitude of the community to the acting and abnormal structure made Seachd quite a characteristic and unforgettable movie. More of them please!
