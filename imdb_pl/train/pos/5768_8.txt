Collapsing at a nuclear power plant causes most people to turn into deadly, rotting zombies, shaky zombies that are naturally crazy. A handful of uninfected people do everything to survive this grueling attempt. Director / co-writer / producer Todd Sheets presents an extremely sincere love and passion for a live and macabre horror "straight from the throat": it maintains an undisturbed, fast tempo, fills the screen with madness from the wall to the wall of action and, fortunately, maintains a terrible dialogue at a pleasant minimum. What's more, Sheets certainly do not outdo themselves in glorious graphics and excessive splash: this image provides a tasty weight of the melted body, gutting, a lot of crunching intestines, one guy has a ripped heart, and there is even pleasant excitement on the tree branch. Sheets gain extra points for maintaining a bleak and nasty tone at the literal bitter end (for example, almost all major characters become zombie chow). It's true that this film has a lot of disadvantages: a frayed assembly, several pathos attempts on the rails and, to a large extent, horrible actions from the rank of no-name cast, leave much to be desired. The best distinctions for the nice and lively Kasey Rausch for her exceptionally brave portrait of the resourceful Daria Trumillio. Frank Dunlay is also doing well as a rugged army veteran, Ralph Walsh. Most importantly, Sheets's understanding of the contagious slambangu, which is the constant urge to move forward and the obvious affinity for the genre of horror, makes it a total explosion to watch from the beginning to the end.
