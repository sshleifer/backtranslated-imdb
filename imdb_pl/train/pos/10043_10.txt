This movie has rewritten the story of the film. Nobody cares about what anyone thinks about this film because it goes beyond criticism. Every flaw of the film is easily overcome by many amazing things that the film made. It is an amazingly beautiful film and I doubt that many of us will see something similar. I have seen it more times than I would like to count, and each time I am fascinated by a feeling that is difficult to describe. One for ever.
