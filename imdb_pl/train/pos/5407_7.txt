I have always liked Pokemon films. Yes, I know, they are all trivial, average in some areas and certain, even if they are directed to young children, are too adult in some areas to be able to guard them with the statement: "Hey, brighten up, it's a children's movie," but besides, are not these still good pieces of entertainment? In my opinion, they are so and I like them very much. This one is as nice as the previous three and certainly nicer. It has some really sweet and moving moments, because it is an introduction to the beloved, fresh Pokemon Celebi. This is not the best Pokemon movie, but I enjoy it more than the third part, even though the third one is not bad, and the whole series is simply fun, harmless, family popcorn fun and should not be anything more, nothing less. This film has high intensity and interest ratings, especially around the climax / ending point, like all the installments and characters, although a bit more colorless than the previous three, I thought, they are still nice and humorous. This film is the lowest rated and the most criticized of the four film length adaptations and does not deserve it.
