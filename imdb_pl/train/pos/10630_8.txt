I think it is unfortunate that the leading comments on this film include the words 'Clueless and appalling nonsense'. I think it is a very funny movie and great entertainment. You have to suspend your disbelief that homosexual and lesbian can fall in love, have a baby and live together happily ever after. But it's always great to see how the film is played and warm up the heart. Is this impossible? There are many more unlikely events described in other movies. Acting is good, the script is fun. The only negative comment is that history could end well when the family leaves their original home, instead of examining whether the man retains the remaining homosexuality.
