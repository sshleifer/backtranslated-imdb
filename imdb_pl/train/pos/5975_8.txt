Every film critic and metal boss hated the film, but I liked it. I saw it as a child on television and I was amazed at the scene where Sammi enters the stage and plays Trick or Treat by Fastway. <br /> <br /> The movie itself was typical of the 80's, the guy was pushed by the rascals and calls supernatural help to defeat the rascals, but he goes far and must be destroyed. <br /> <br /> Matt from Melrose Place chooses Skippy from family ties, so Skippy gets Tony Fields' record from Gene Simmons to cheer him up and hell breaks the loser, the main attraction is where Tony sings (synchronizes lips) and dances for a metal song before the shit hits the fans. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of mistakes and things, but the music and the overall picture were enough for my fists to pump 8 out of 10
