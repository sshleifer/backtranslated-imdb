Deodato brings us some shocking moments and a movie that does not take too seriously. Absolutely classic in its special style. This movie provides a refreshingly different look at the barbarians. If you have the chance to see this movie, do it. Most of the time you'll have a smile on your face. Not because it is funny or something mundane, but because it is so bad that it goes the other way and becomes good, though it may not be clean, fun.
