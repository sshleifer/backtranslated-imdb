This movie does not make any pretentious efforts to hide your true genre - Campaign Movie B. That's what you'll initially tell the definition of campy. He should also give the adjective meaning of cheese. But they both meet in this movie in a way that makes you leave: "Hmmmmm ... it's so stupid!" And then you laugh. For example, in the "sixteenth-century Japan" appears a scene that shows a pair of samurai walking in the foreground of the temple. In the background of the temple there are several tourists looking in the distance in slippers and shorts. Hmmmm ... hahahah! I could not stop laughing. And the acting goes from decent to bearable, oh my Lord, but that's what makes it funny. You'll see some decent actors, and then you'll find other really scary people. But I have to go a little bit because I saw Stephanie Sanchez in a few plays and it's amazing. Her time in the film was quite short. During my visits I also saw Bryan Yamasaki in several plays on the islands and he is also better at the theater than in this film. In any case, it is an entertainment film, if you have nothing to do in the evening on weekdays.
