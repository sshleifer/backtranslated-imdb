This film is available from David Shepard and Kino in "Przed Hollywood" was Fort Lee, NJ, although this is a shortened version with "only behind-the-scenes movie sections. I'm not sure if Blackhawk Films had only a printout of these parts, or edited other scenes. The original version of Blackhawk has been changed to A Movie Romance. The full feature has survived, but the preprint for this version had a nitrate distribution, and several sections looked bad, so maybe because the Blackhawk version was edited. <br /> <br /> Directed by Maurice Tourneur, the film features Tourneur himself, or rather a caricature of himself, and apparently director Emile Chautard and future director Joseph von Sternberg also noticed. <br /> <br /> The national Mrs. Mary (Doris Kenyon) longs for a romantic man who would take her off of Marza's feet about the troubadour who will charm her, but he is continually interrupted by the only available local boy, Johnny Applebloom. <br /> <br /> Average Hile, a film company from New York (actually New Jersey), spins a western in the countryside. Mary sees an Indian woman (wearing a full headdress) and raises an alarm - it spoils the scene the film company is shooting. She is immediately attracted by the amazing movie star Kenneth Driscoll (Robert Warwick). He encourages her to leave the house and try to become an actress in a big city. <br /> <br /> When he comes to the studio, he discovers that everything in the movies is false. Doors and walls are simply apartments that are quickly assembled into the set. This skinny walk of a western hero or a happy hero jumper also works. Sets are on a large rotating stage, so you can even manipulate the angle of the sun. A black assistant in the studio signs all photos autographed by movie stars. The signs on the wall say "Positively No Smoking", but everyone smokes anyway. Even the movie titles (which are nicely illustrated) emphasize everything that is false about making movies. <br /> <br /> The movie star Driscoll is just as disappointed with the buzz of everyday movie making. He makes a temporary break with girlfriend Vivian (June Elvidge) to pursue this "exciting" country girl. His plans are interrupted when Mary's screen test is stinky. We do not see the real movie, but only the painful reactions of the audience to him. <br /> <br /> Mary is devastated, but she does not want to admit to everyone that she was a failure, so she still sees Driscoll and we have lunch with him in the study canteen along with other accessories dressed as policemen, soldiers, cowboys etc. . <br /> <br /> Mary decides to stay with Driscoll. At the party with their "friends" in the film, he agrees to marry him, although there is not much love between them. Her mother appears surprisingly, with cake especially for Mary's birthday. This causes Mary to assess her future again. <br /> <br /> This movie has all fascinating scenes from studies, film sets, dressing rooms, editing rooms, etc. If you've always wondered what's going on behind the scenes where the silent movie was made, this movie looks behind the curtain.
