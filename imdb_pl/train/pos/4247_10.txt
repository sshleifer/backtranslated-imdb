GIRL FROM MISSOURI arrives in New York, knowing exactly what she wants: to achieve something solid through marriage to a millionaire - without losing her virginity. Thanks to the good appearance of passion, he quickly catches the attention of the playboy, son of the tycoon, but remaining faithful to her virtue, will also discover true love? <br /> <br /> Jean Harlow sizzles in this great little comedy. With her platinum hair and beautiful accessories she is dazzling. But her beauty should not obscure the fact that she was also a very good actress. She rightly deserves a place at the top of the Dutch pantheon. <br /> <br /> The excellent cast gives Harlow excellent support: Lionel Barrymore as a cunning old mogul, wise in Harlow's ways; handsome Franchot Tone as his son, afflicted by love; harsh Patsy Kelly, stealing her scenes as Harlow's assistant; debonair Alan Mowbray, as a well-behaved English Lord; older Clara Blandick as the hit secretary Barrymore; cordial Hale Hamilton as a rich man with an eye on women; muscular Nat Pendleton as a lifeguard who catches Kelly's flirty eye; and Lewis Stone, unforgettable in the small role of a bankrupted businessman. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that this film was produced shortly after the introduction of the Hollywood production code. A comparison with the RED-HEADED WOMAN, made two years ago, would be fascinating - in which Harlow's character goes for the same purposes, but uses very different means.
