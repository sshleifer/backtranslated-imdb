I think that the review by Alan Jacobs is very accurate in relation to the film, but I had the opportunity to borrow a DVD from the hit with a commentary from the curator BYU, the archives of films by James D'Arc. At that time, LDS Prophet Heber J. Grant approved the film, understanding deviations from historical content for dramatic expression and telescopic events. For example, the movie showed Joseph Smith in the process. despite the great oratory of Brigham Young in defense of Joseph Smith, he was condemned. Then JÃ³zef was killed. Historically, Joseph Smith has never been convicted of anything. Brigham Young was in Boston when Joseph Smith was arrested for this particular trial. Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum, where both died before the trial.
