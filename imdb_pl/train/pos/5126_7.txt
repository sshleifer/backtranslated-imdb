For Urban Cowboy, John Travolta plays on one of the stronger alpha males that have ever been shown on the big screen. He is a decent young kid who leaves his parent's home and goes to the big city of Dallas, where his uncle Barry Corbin promised him to find a job in the petrochemical industry. In 1980, a boom began, and Texas was definitely a growing place in the US. <br /> <br /> Travolta is doing well to get the audience to take care of his character, who, when you get to her, is a sexist pig. She meets and marries Debr Winger, who is from the same environment, but has some ideas that women should not be shadows of their men. And when he hits him in Gilley's mechanical bull, a man's game, that's all for him. <br /> <br /> Scott Glenn, who is a former convict, works at Gilley, and this film was his breakthrough role. He is a real snake in Urban Cowboy, he gets a Travolta goat with a simple look and enters Winger. Travolta, in turn, deals with a rich girl, Madolyn Smith Osborne, who drool at Gilley's. <br /> <br /> Despite the heroes, Urban Cowboy was really one giant commercial for the self-proclaimed greatest honky in the world. Gilley is no longer in the suburban community of Texas in Pasadena, but the memories continue. And the best thing about Urban Cowboy is the wonderful score of the country / western songs that are in the movie. I'm not sure if some of the songs were written specifically for Urban Cowboy, but that's the only reason I can think why the Film Academy ignored the musical aspects of the movie. I especially liked Johnny Lee Looking For Love, if it was written especially for this movie, it's a shame that he was not nominated for Best Song. <br /> <br /> I liked the character of Debra Winger the most in this film. He does not lose the trace of femininity, but defends Travolta and does it in style. This review is devoted to an unknown woman who will one day become the first woman to ride a bull in the "Professional Bulls" competition.
