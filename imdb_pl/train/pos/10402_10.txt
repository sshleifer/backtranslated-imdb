I saw the Thief as a child for the first time, which makes me almost as old as Jinn. Like every child, I was delighted with the imagination, ingenuity and energy of the film. A few years later, I realized how much satire and wit from the script I missed when I first saw it. I've never given up the opportunity to watch it over the years. In addition to the scenario, production goes beyond the fantasy genre. This is Korda, the storyteller at its best. When you see a Thief as a child, you know that you had a great time. When you see a Thief as an adult, you know that you have seen the masterpiece. It is as timeless as the story it treats. An amazing job. <br /> <br /> Thomas McCarthy
