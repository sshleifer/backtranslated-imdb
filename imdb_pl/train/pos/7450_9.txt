This is the best series of high quality "Faerie Tale Theater" by Shelley Duvall. The ugly half-sisters are comedy in Broadway quality, and Eve Arden is the epitome of the wicked stepmother. Jennifer Beals does a great job as a simple Cinderella, especially on the garden scene with the Charming Prince Matthew Broderick. Jean Stapleton plays the fairy well, although I'm not sure if I liked the characteristics of the "southern lady" in some lines. The comic relief of Steve Martin as the Royal Orchestra Conductor is Martin's quintessential, but a bit out of place in the series. <br /> <br /> As usual in this series, for older children there are some harsh comments at the age of 15 and more). With a few minor inequalities, the program flows well and lives happily ever after. Children up to 8 years old will continue to watch them after the parents finally get tired - three times in one day it turned out that it is a bit too much.
