A bus full of passengers got stuck during a snow storm. The police closed the bridge - claiming that it is dangerous and stuck in a small cafe until the road is cleared. However, after some time their boredom begins to worry, because it seems that one of the passengers was NOT originally on the bus and could be strangers !! This leads to a conclusion that is ironic, but also quite funny in a low style. <br /> <br /> This is another of the funny episodes of The Twilight Zone. Instead of typical twists or social comments, this one does not have a permanent message. However, it is also very visible, so who cares ?! Exactly WHAT will happen, you will have to convince yourself. <br /> <br /> By the way, this star is John Hoyt - a face that most of you will recognize from countless old TV shows and movies. In almost every case he played a real grudge (like Charles Lane in the same age), but the boy loved to see him - he perfected a grouchy personality and at the same time was funny.
