The hap hook (Black Mask) is something that I would like to call a ballet with fists and explosions. Sure, the conspiracy has already been tried and heard, (a biologically designed soldier who is part of the superman's elite superman's fighting force, who decides that he feels that killing and brute force are not a way to settle everything and become pacifists, but when he learns that the rest of his group is trying to get an antidote that will keep them alive by taking on the police - his best friend is a policeman who becomes a black mask.) The style in which the movie goes, very visual, works and at least is fun for me . I love movies about martial arts that are spectacular. People flying lighter than air and reclaiming a fraction of a second after impact keep the pace and action without interruption. But that's what this film is all about, the business card Jet Li does what he does best, and it's spectacularly showing his skills, which, at least, are at the highest level. As with most fast-martial movies, ala. Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung, who for the first time present themselves here in the states, are low-profile and highly rated by amazing physical feats. But I have to say, even if there are big holes left in the department (how do we see it safely in our apartment, when only one scene has 20 people who are no more than 15 feet away from it with a sign of escape? Who knows? The scene just cuts it in a flat ....... ohh, a good suspension of faith, I think), the film remains interesting to me. Only in the last 20 minutes the movie seems to be a bit shorter. But still around a great action movie.
