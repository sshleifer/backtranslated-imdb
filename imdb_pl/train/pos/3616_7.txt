Casting an unknown Michelle Rodriguez as Diana was a stroke of genius. She is perfect. Her lack of experience actually works in her favor. We've never seen her before, so it really reminds her story. She also brings real strength. It works against her because we never doubt her. You never have to cheer on her to win because she never fights with any player she can not beat. So, as a boxing movie, it fails. <br /> <br /> It's not a boxing movie again. How to make a movie about a girl who wants to be a boxer who is not a boxing movie? You do not. Still, Karyn Kusama. Like many independent films, "Girlfight" defies classifications or species and stands in its own right, because folklore can harass you in real life. <br /> <br /> Diana is bad at school. She beats people she does not like (for example, all other girls in school). She does not fit. Her father compels his brother Tina to learn to box, so that he can defend himself when everything becomes difficult. He gives Tina money for her boxing sessions and gives Diana nothing, as if she had no need to defend herself or anything worth doing in her life. Tiny wants to go to art school (cliche, yucca), so she gives up the boxing allowance for Diana, who really wants to pack. Things get complicated when Diana falls on another boxer Adrian (Santiago Douglas) who wants to become a pro. From there, history approaches the inevitable ... they both meet in an amateur fight for the title. <br /> <br /> What froze me was that I never found anything so interesting. It's all a bit too reliable. Children with difficult lives grow up in difficult urban areas. Many professional boxers arose from these circumstances. The mental and physical endurance required by this upbringing is suitable for a game like boxing in which anger is your friend. So this time it's a girl. A big deal. <br /> <br /> Or there is another position to do: finally a boxing movie about a girl. Boxing women for a long time. The brutality that we usually see in boxing movies is replaced here by discussions about their lives and feelings. The whole struggle is used as a platform for painting a larger picture. Respect. Overcoming adversity. Self-discovery. <br /> <br /> I recommend "Girlfight" because it has a good spirit and is an example of the great work of the first director. Dialogue never rises above the quality of a soap opera, but the story itself has changed my view of some things. Yes, the world seems a better place now. The movie did it. <br /> <br /> Class: B-
