Why this film almost disappeared in oblivion is an absolute crime. "Conan" is probably the only movie of Sword and Sorcery. Brutal violence, cool character designs and good stimulation make it one of the best fantasies. It is certainly the largest animated film directed to the more adult audience I have ever seen. This is not similar to Bakshi's usual crazy style. It's quite a departure for Bakshi, and in my opinion his best job. I hope this film will gain the recognition it deserves.
