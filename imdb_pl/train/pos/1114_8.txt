I remember that during this time the film was surprised and amused. I called it the most important movie I've seen in ten years, and I came across people who said similar things. <br /> <br /> Bernhard has an extremely perceptive behavioral notebook. And she shaped the bitter, youthful personality that we all had, into the corrosive worldview of adults. These two elements are a surprising mix that can be too nervous for some viewers. (Hi Skip, I'm sorry you were not my brother, so I could have *****!) <brh> <br /> <br /> Bernhards are looking for themselves after returning to Los Angeles from New York, which results in involving people differently (all of which fit poorly) for our entertainment, but enough of them require action to appeal to the "black imperative" system, whose real barometer is whether black culture accepts it. (It's been some time.) Nina Simone comes to mind. And she has an impressive, solidly built black lover in the film. A pretty black girl attends concerts and seems to allow Sandra's artificial blackness, but eventually rejects her. <br /> <br /> Just as Catholics consider themselves lucky people suffering for Christ, here Sandra presents herself suffering from the hands of a black culture in which she wants to place; as if she were cultivating her dignity and rejection. It is the only value system associated with the world of films, beyond the artistic confusion of Bernhard. <br /> <br /> For a nation whose main problem is racism and money, it is refreshing to see one of the 2 themes addressed in an unusual way.
