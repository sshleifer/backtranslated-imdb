If only Eddie Murphy was born 10 years later. Then we all remember it. But even I was only 4 when it came out. If you have not seen it yet, hire Dr Dolittle, Showtime, And Spy, Pluto Nash and all Eddie's comedy movies - and then watch it. Without a doubt, you will laugh 90% of the time. The remaining 10% wipes tears from your eyes. <br /> <br /> It really has to be watched more than once to understand all the jokes. From primitive humor to a joke for children! (If you saw him, you will laugh) - you will love his things. If you (or you are a big fan) try to download clips from Eddie's files. All the concerts are different than you can imagine, and he has even more funny jokes. <br /> <br /> But this is like Eddie Murphy's "X-rated", if so. <Br /> <br /> And all I can say is, please, do not watch Delirious, if you do not like comedy, you have no sense of humor or you do not like to play. You'll just put away that great classic of Eddie Murphy and maybe you'll make someone miss him. <br /> <br /> If you want to know how Eddie got a Beverly Hills cop and he became famous for him - that's Delirious.
