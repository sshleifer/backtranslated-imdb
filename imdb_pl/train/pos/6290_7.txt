Using Buster Keaton in the twilight of his career was an interesting choice. Perhaps he was the most talented comedian in a mute age. It gives him a chance to show these talents in a short journey history. He is attached to a guy living in modern times and it becomes obvious that it is best to leave us in our time. Keaton is able to look very well. I heard his voice already. I believe he did some of these movies at the Beach Party, playing in uninteresting characters to earn a few bucks. Serling seemed to have respect for him and presented him in this way. This is not a bad story. It shows how we react when we want something that we do not have and we get that wish.
