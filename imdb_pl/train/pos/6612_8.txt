Like Final Fantasy brought CG to a whole new level, it is a revival for traffic capture. This film is neither a movie nor a cartoon, but it looks like a tribute to Noir, Akira, Sin City, Blade Runner and a new generation of European cartoonists. You see Paris as it could be, the characters seem as real as you and me. They blink, stumble, tremble like real actors in ways never before achieved. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this in the hope of finding a twister of mind. You will probably find out before you find yourself in the middle of the movie. The screenplay is certainly too simplistic compared to the famous thrillers, but it is definitely bliss for the eyes.
