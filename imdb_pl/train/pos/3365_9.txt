SPECIAL DAY (Ettore Scola - Italy / Canada 1977). <br /> <br /> Every now and then you will come across a movie that really moves your nerves. This offers a very simple assumption, almost flawlessly made in every respect and incredibly moving at the same time. It is surprising that Ettore Scoli's "Una giornate particulare" is relatively unheard of, even by some critics. Time Out calls it "garbage", and Leonard Maltin, a bit milder, "pleasant, but small." I do not agree, not only because this film is deeply moving, but in its simple history it shows us more insights about everyday life in fascist Italy than most of the films I've seen. The cinematography is clearly uninteresting, even a bit bland, and the story is simple, which may explain the relative unpopularity of the film. Given the late seventies, the audience was not spoiled by great Italian films, it's even stranger that it did not really get along with the critics. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a ten-minute collage of archival recordings from Hitler's visit to Italy on May 8, 1938. Against this background, we first meet Antonietta (Loren), a lonely housewife in love with six children in a Roman apartment building. One day, when her Beo escapes, she meets her neighbor Gabriele (Mastroianni), who seems to be the only one in the building not participating in the ceremonies. He is well-mannered, cultured and soon attracts him. During the whole film we hear a fascist rally from the porter's radio shouting through the courtyard. Scola uses the camera playfully to become part of the proceedings. After the opening scene, the camera moves in the courtyard of the modernist (then hypermodern) block of flats, apparently looking for our main heroes, which we have not seen yet. <br /> <br /> Marcello Mastrionani and Sophia Loren are unforgettable in two leading roles, all the more surprising because they are cast entirely against the type. Born in Canada, John Vernon plays Loren's husband, but he is only on screen in the first and last scene. I think his voice had to be named because, in my opinion, he was not of Italian origin and he never lived there, so I can not imagine speaking in Italian. If his voice was named, I did not notice. On the contrary, it is completely credible as an Italian, even more so than the rest of the cast. The story is simple but extremely effective, the performances are excellent, the ending is just perfect, and the framing is not too pretentious, but it works completely. Do not miss it. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 9/10
