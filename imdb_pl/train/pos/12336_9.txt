A perfect melodrama of murder from the era in which Fontaine successfully played against her earlier naive type Wallflower, in a role that Olivia DeHavilland allegedly refused. Okay, because Fontaine is great. The screenplay was written by Charles Bennett, who wrote for Hitchcock in the 1930s, and later wrote an excellent script for the classic British horror movie Night of the Demon. The opening scene in which Ivy visits the sinister soothsayer played by the wonderful Una O'Connor (the vampire of James Whale's fame), is the tour de force, and the film retains interest in numerous sinister machinations. I hope one day I will see this movie on DVD, but it's despair because it seems to be an undeserved movie. Fortunately, I had to see it at AMC about seven or eight years ago, but I have not seen it since. Catch it if you can!
