I liked the movie, but I hated it because I wanted to help this guy! I'm over fifty and I have many friends in the music industry ... who are still trying to become adults ... there are no more fans, groups, money etc ... and have difficulty adjusting to normal life ... seeing new bands etc. . which are on the edge ... it's almost like they have to start again ... this movie is testimony to how many old rockers from the 70's and 80's are going now ... and that's where the movie goes he is sad and depressing. BUT describes the life of an old rock star, abandoned and lost - in a credible way. Hollis maclaren (Outrageous) ... and she is one lady in the movie you will be cheering for. This movie is a must for people aged 50 who saw the rise and fall of bands, people who knew members, and saw how it hurts over time, and the popularity fades. .ad but somewhat positive .... due to whales. YOU MUST SEE!
