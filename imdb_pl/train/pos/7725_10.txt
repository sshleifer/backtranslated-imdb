I saw the movie for the first time when it appeared. I was about 9 years old. old and I think that this movie is very funny and very scary and unlike other movies that I've seen until then. <br /> <br /> BASIS: The expedition is sent from Earth to the fourth planet of Altair, the great main consequence in the Aquilae constellation, to find out what happened to the colony of settlers who landed twenty years earlier and from whom it was not heard from time. <br /> <br /> THEME: A lower civilization (namely ours) comes into contact with the remains of a highly advanced alien civilization from which Krell has been removed for 200,000 years. The "grain" of destruction from one civilization is passed on to others, initially unknowingly. The subject of this film is very good compared to Evil. <br /> <br /> For the first time I saw this movie with my brother when it appeared. I was just a boy, and the tiger scenes really scared me, as did the battle scenes with the invisible power of Creation. I was also surprised by how real things looked in the movie. <br /> <br /> However, what really exposes my attention as an adult is the truth of the movie "forbidden knowledge" and how important it will be when we do it (if at all) it will come into contact with an advanced (foreign) a civilization much more developed than we are today. Advanced technology and responsibility seem to go hand in hand. We need to do the work for ourselves to gain knowledge together with knowledge of how to use advanced technology. This is, in my opinion, the great moral of this film. <br /> <br /> I learned in high school that "knowledge is power" is incorrect at best! Knowledge is "potential" power depending on how it is used (... if it is used at all). [It's not what you know, but how you use what you know!] <br /> <br /> The overall impact of this movie can be realized in the future of humanity. I mean knowledge is not enough in itself, we must, MUST have wisdom, that knowledge depends on the real control of our destiny OR we'll end up like Krell in the movie - it just disappeared. <br /> <br /> Thanks to those who have replied to previous versions of this article with comments and corrections, everyone is very welcome !! I hope this story is as fun as the last 40+ years .... <br /> <br /> Rating: 10 out of 10 stars
