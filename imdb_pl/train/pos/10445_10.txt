First of all, let me say that before sunrise, like all films, it is NOT a film for all tastes. It seems that some people are less intelligent to admit this fact, but it is extraordinary that they contemplate the kind of overt reluctance that this small harmless movie evokes in some people. For me, like most people here, before Sunrise hit me with a deep chord, I was really stunned, moved, inspired by this. It's a movie that ultimately uses more than one view. It creates some of the most amazing unforgettable feelings and emotions imaginable. It is impossible to imagine this world without thinking about the inspirational feelings that I drew from it. <br /> <br /> The film acts as a communion of two fragile souls that are beginning to get to know each other. He is very intelligent and inspiring, not so much in the way one conversation is necessarily related to the next, or in the meaning of the discussions of Jesse and Celine, but rather small nuances, perfectly articulated responses that provoke from each other. It captures sincere, romantic but fleeting human emotions that begin to bloom in an incredibly sublime Viennese environment; he convinces us that their fading relationship can be the greatest compliment in the world. And what happens after this night is open to debate, but I never doubt that it is not mutual anymore. <br /> <br /> Easy comments from RockytheBear and the following user are hopeless examples of a dissident who does not want to accept and respect those who love this movie. <br /> <br /> See this and it can change your lifestyle.
