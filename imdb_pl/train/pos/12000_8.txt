I think the film is educational. However, he does not treat the issue that caused so much controversy: polygamy. In addition, the film does not reveal what the LDS church is talking about. A great opportunity was omitted to tell the world what they really believe. I could not understand what the views of LDS on religion are. <br /> <br /> I have many friends from LDS and they are nice. It would be nice to get a clearer picture of how they view the more controversial statements of the prophet. Perhaps these statements are too controversial to be treated in a movie format, but it would be great to hear the whole story of the truly interesting life of Joseph Smith. In the end, he gives an insight into the American idea of ​​religion in the eighteenth century. I hope they will make a few documentaries on this fascinating topic, allowing historians to comment on Smith's life. One day, we can have a Mormon president. Finally, Smith ran for the president.
