I did not intend to watch this program. But I'm glad I did it. The critics do not understand this! This is one of the funniest and most entertaining things on T.V at the moment! Although, when interviews were conducted with ordinary people, they probably seemed useless; but put them in the mouths of animals and insects, and this is laughter. I laughed so hard, I had tears in my eyes. A pig with sucking babies and her mother is priceless. Birds of husband and wife talk about health problems, and the bird itself shit after my wife said she has constipation, broke me completely! Creature Comforts is the most ingenious program I've ever seen! I hope he will come back next summer when this race is over.
