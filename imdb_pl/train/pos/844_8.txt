Accidental meeting of the seller and attacker changes their lives. It's a strange movie that works, an impressive effort for the writer and director Shepard. In a boldly uninteresting role that is far from James Bond, Brosnan is surprisingly effective as a lone striker who begins to get stressed by the stress of his work, but is unable to connect emotionally to anyone who could help him. Kinnear is as good as a salesman, a decent man with emptiness in his life. Davis is okay as Kinnear's flirtatious wife. The film is primarily a character study, it is satisfying because it seems a fresh and unpredictable, extremely dark comedy.
