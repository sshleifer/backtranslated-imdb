Does anyone find it interesting that Ood looks oddly similar to the "Great Cthulhu" from the HP Lovecraft yearbook? hmmm? <br /> <br /> A great couple of episodes (not referring to Billie Piper as most seem to be doing!) in The Impossible Planet and The Satan Pit. <br /> <br /> Also a link to "Legion" I Think also that he used in Who before and also referred to Satan in various novels after the era of exorcists ... <br /> <br /> Big episodes tensions using elements of fear and faith. A new band for those who are great at working on television. <br /> <br /> It certainly creates new fears and feelings "hide behind the sofa" that have not been seen for many, many years in the continuation of the great BBC series (It's a pity the BBC confirms that Billie Piper resigns - maybe not permanently - after completing series 2): O ((((
