This is one of the most amazing stories I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> If this movie was directed by Larry Clark, then this story about a school shootout would probably be shown through the eyes of a murderer and everything that led the person crazy. <Instead, the story focuses mainly on the consequences of school shooting and how it affected the victims who survived. <br /> <br /> I've seen Busy Phillips in other movies before, but she's definitely the best in this movie. The only other movie that I saw with Erika Christensen is "Swim Fan", which made me almost never wanted to watch this movie, but she made a very good performance. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few movies I've seen that were able to make me cry. Trust me, when I tell you, it does not happen very often. <br /> <br /> The house is a beautiful movie, and that's all that is ...
