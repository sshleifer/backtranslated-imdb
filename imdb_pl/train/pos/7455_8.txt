Goldeneye will always pass as one of the most legendary games in the history of VG. There is no doubt about it. But this game, although completely different, can be a modern Bond champion of his time. <br /> <br /> It was not a game about bonds based on material from another medium. It was completely new; scripting game. Who even had his own song! (he would not be without it, haha!) The gameplay was perfect, and if you're a fan of both games and movies, you'll like it. <br /> <br /> Unlike some / most games, these cast members presented themselves, in contrast to fictional games. Which gives it a more cinematic character. Thanks to the very "plot" story, you feel like you are in the game the same way you get lost in the movie. <br /> <br /> Pleasant in all aspects, from beginning to end. Even after defeating the game there is still much to do. Thanks to the ranking system and unlocks and multi-player missions, this is a distinctive game. Although it is already quite old, in the years of video games. It is still a good game that you can play and play whenever you feel the need to get some more Bond in your life. Even now thinking about it, I got stuck in the head in the song. Such a great cast and well-written plot. <br /> <br /> The story comes alive on the screen, almost as if the actors were in front of you, and it's just as fun as the game itself. Perfectly done, in a real relationship. Which can only be called Awesome, Completely Awesome. <br /> <br /> I must now play this game. If you have not played yet, you lose!
