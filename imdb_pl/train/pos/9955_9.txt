I saw this movie twice at social shows and I really loved it. I work in the Jane Finch community and feel that the film really captures the essence and taste of the community - gravel, determination, enthusiasm, creativity in your face with a dose of desperation. Writing, dialogue and acting are solid and I really found myself in the story of a young woman who is trying to pursue her goals and not lose herself in the process. Great dance sequences and not only the bodies move smoothly and electrically, but the camera also moves with great fluidity and intelligence. All characters are multidimensional - none are good or bad, and the characters of women are wonderfully strong. It is a movie that has a strong heartbeat and celebrates the unrestrained spirit of youth, hip hop and communities like Jane Finch.
