* several spoiler√≥w * <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised that severe criticism (acting, outdated dialogue, obscure plot) was unfounded. Belafonte is great as Brandoesque, a menacing, cursing spirit who must earn his wings, but is realistically ill-prepared from his previous life. He learns too late, how empty his noisy, materialistic life was without love. Mostel is also wonderful as a tormented man with his dying wife, Fanny. Despite praying for a miracle, his bitterness prevents him from accepting (or believing) one thing. The two social worlds that represent the heroes alternately collide and complement each other, which makes it comically and touchingly sad. <br /> <br /> The embarrassed ending is actually consistent with the rest of the movie. After looking around for Belafonte, Mostel looks at the falling feather and feverishly reaches for it, as if he finally wanted to believe in angels and miracles. But Belafonte could not finish the miracle (neither to restore Fanny's health, nor faith in Mostel), so he never got wings. The feather lifts sneeringly at Mostel's grip, a metaphor for both men: it's too late and you will not get a second chance. Like "This wonderful life", this movie is magical, wonderful, funny, but terribly tragic.
