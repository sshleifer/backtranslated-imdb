Well, actually not. This movie is very funny. I went and saw it with my girlfriend last night and had to use the routine "I think something might be in my eye." The film is a perfect combination of comedy and a typical romance. Jim Carey is great as a reporter who is fortunate to change himself and the city in which he lives. In fact, all characters are great. The film is not too funny or pathetic, a good movie to see my wife. <br /> <br /> All in all 8/10 .... Note * I'm not an easy grader. That's everything from BigV!
