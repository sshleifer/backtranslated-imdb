I thought the movie "I Do nich Do not" was fantastic. In the past I watched Rob Estes in "Suddenly Susan" and "Melrose Place", and also Josie Bissett in "Melrose Place" and loved to meet them again in "I Do They Do not". They have great chemistry with them (I think that a wedding in real life helps!) - in the film they are both widowed children and careers, and fall in love and try to connect their already busy chaotic families without dropping the ball. Of course, they stumble, but they stick together, what's at work and bringing up the family. So many people are talking about this movie - all right! - and the film left us willing to do more. It would be a great series - attractive for many ages! - It would be nice to see real family life, such as the one that presents the reality of so many of our present lives - instead of the so-called "Reality TV" all stations are overwhelming us these days. Someone told people from the ABC family that they have the beginning of a new series here!
