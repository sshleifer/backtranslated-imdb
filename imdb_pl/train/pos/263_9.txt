It was a strong Poirot / Suchet, a television selection of secrets. The characters were alive and well preserved. The plot and main setting - the dorm - were perfect. Japp was nothing special, but for me it did not distract history. The important point is that many Poirot observers do not recognize good performance or good performance. I also think that they are quite harsh in their assessments of some of Poirot's secrets. Finally, I read some of Christie's novels - none in recent years - and I find it annoying that so many viewers are upset about the changes in the novel. Please, viewers, think about what is presented to you in the film, not what you should be there. Poirot secrets vary in quality, but not as much as you would think reviewers and experts. With the exception of The Five Little Pigs, which was fantastic in the story, character and subject, longer Poirot's films are neither good nor bad. For the record, I've seen all the longer films of Poirot / Suchet. Finally, movies without Lemon, Hastings and / or Japp are neither good nor bad because of their absence. Presence, however, is intrusive (almost always with Japp) or unimportant to Hastings. Lemon is in the middle.
