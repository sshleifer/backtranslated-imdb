I saw this movie on the cable, it was really funny, from the stereotypical police chief to the stereotypical big bad guy, jay leno and Mr. Mayaga from the karate kid star in this good comedy about the prototype car part. I compare this movie to "RUSH HOUR", in which a local policeman must work with an Asian police officer to solve the case. The pursuit of farmers on the market in the center of Detroit brings back memories. Pleasant soundtrack, good script, I give it 10/10.
