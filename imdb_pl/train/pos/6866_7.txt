************** Possible spoilers ********** There is only one reason why I saw this movie and it is because I have great affection for Richard Belzer. (I do not know much about humor.) There were parts that were fun, like Barbie and Ken Spoof, the seller and the president's sketches, remember that sometimes it's filthy (Dare I speak primitively?) It was sometimes fun, but it could Probably, if they spent more time in humor and less on undressing women, the movie would be more fun, some skits make you want to gag and others to nibble, others make you laugh and think strange. Unfortunately, this movie is outdated. If you have a crazy liking for Richard Belzer (it's worth it), it's worth checking out and seeing the chevy chase.
