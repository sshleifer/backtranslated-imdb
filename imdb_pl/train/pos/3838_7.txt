FOURTH MAN (Paul Verhoeven - Netherlands 1983). <br /> <br /> A film based on a novel by Gerard Reve, who works best as a thriller. This is quite surprising, given that Reve roughly needs a hundred pages, because only a small twist and tension is the last thing I think about reading his work. <br /> <br /> "Fourth man" is very heavy in symbolism. Paul Verhoeven is generally very busy proving something mostly hostile critics and I'm never sure exactly what he's trying to prove. Usually, he does not appreciate his audience and tells his story in such a subtle way, he quickly deviates from the original idea or story and almost forgets what to see on the screen and what to omit. In "The Fourth Man" it is not so clear when it comes to describing the plot, as well as sex and nudity (which is plenty), but, as in most of his films, it seems that he is afraid that the audience will not get it and a story will be pushed home with overt symbols mixed up with supposedly shocking scenes of nudity and graphic sex. There is no scene without sex or full nakedness, most of it so wildly free and on your face, it undermines a good story. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, if you cope with the rather obvious satirical approach of Verhoeven, it is quite a funny thriller sometimes with intriguing twists and good performances around the world, in particular Thom Hoffman and Jeroen KrabbÃ©. > <br /> Obscura camera --- 7/10
