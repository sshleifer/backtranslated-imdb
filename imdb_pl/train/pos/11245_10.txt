I first saw "Breaking Glass" in 1980 and thought it would be one of the "Movie Classics". This film is a great look at the music industry thanks to the great cast of performers. This is one movie that should be included in the collection of everyone and everyone who wants to enter the music industry. I can not wait to be available on DVD.
