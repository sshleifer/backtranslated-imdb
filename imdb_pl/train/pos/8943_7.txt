TV series from the 1960s. "Bewitched" owes its idea from this film. This is a movie that Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak did right after they were cast together in Vertigo by Alfred Hitchcock. This one is not as obsessive as this one, but Novak is equally captivating. <br /> <br /> This was the tenth movie of Jacek Lemmons, who is good here, as well as Ernie Kovacs. The film has many good things in it. Hermine Gingold is very good in this film, almost as good supportive as in The Music Man. The cast is very solid. <br /> <br /> This movie has a New York climate from the late 1950s and a cat that is as shocking as any cat in any movie. It is worth to watch this because it is a love story with all emotions and some magic too. <br /> <br /> This is not a dizziness, but I think that because it came after this movie, viewers then do not rate it as well as it deserved - I'm certainly happy that William Asher saw it, so the series from the 1960s was created. I'm not happy with what Will Ferrell did on the big screen, this movie is much better.
