If you like Star Wars / Trek, come see where they have all their ideas and film devices. These are my 2 favorite movies of all time, another world-futuristic and psycho-thriller. The intensity of the source material (Shakespeare's "Tempest") is not overshadowed by a bizarre trick (later Lucas). And only because it was created in 1956, do not assume you can "see the strings" holding a flying saucer. This was the first movie you CAN NOT. The miracle that was created on the "A-movie" scale, economy and tastes at that time were hard to contrast. And the previous "hit" of director Wilcox is "Lassie Come Home". Until I checked it out, I assumed that "Fred Wilcox" was a pseudonym for a director who was already or later became famous, but at the time he did not want to be associated with sci-fi, which was strictly the "B" genre then. It was either very VERY visionary production, or very casual "mistake" from the people who gather Hollywood. <br /> <br /> There are massive scales with live action almost microscopically inserted that Lucas used extensively. There are intelligent machines that go beyond the stereotypical "user interface"; "Computers", because in later works they are presented much less futuristic. Star Trek's "Transporter" is there, visually, almost unchanged by Roddenberry 10 years later. And if Trek / Wars technology turns you off, FP's scientific references are not exaggerated and are accurate even today. The "ship" kit is versatile, sparklingly realistic, as good as anything you've seen since then, and more convincing than anything "Trek" has done on television or film. We did not spend as much time there as I would like. <br /> <br /> If you've ever wondered how movies competed so cosmos, watching FP will explain it all. It is definitely not "Wagontrain to the Stars".
