The story is told fluently. There are no gaps. Flash backs are seamlessly woven into the present. Casting was great. The young Ya'ara looked very much like Ya'ara, who would look at this age. Her portrait of a blind person has been convincingly made. Director Daniel Syrkin did a great job, encouraging various actors to collaborate in this story. The cinematography is very good. You feel that you are with Ya'ara and Talia walking towards the ocean to the edge of the cliff. English subtitles follow the Hebrew script very closely. It is worth noting that although "Out of Sight" is not a direct translation of "Lemarit Ayin", both names are very suitable for this story.
