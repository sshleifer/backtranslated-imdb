I saw this movie for the first time ten years ago and thought it was really fun. It was not as bad as it turned out for some critics. The fact that it was written by the usually reliable John Hughes shows that you can at least expect a funny dialogue. (By the way, I also think that Weird Science is pretty good, which was also written very quickly by Hughes). <br /> <br /> The film has a very vivid look at all the primary colors - red, yellow, etc. - which makes it look quite unique. The cast is also quite good. Prudish Bunny Packard and possessed by the devil Delores Salk stand out. <br /> <br /> The movie certainly dated a bit, but personally I prefer it to all other "Lampoon" series.
