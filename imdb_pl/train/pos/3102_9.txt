Last summer, I saw The Bourne Ultimatum with a friend and, wow! I've seen the first two films and liked them, but I loved the Ultimatum. <br /> <br /> Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne, amnesia of a suffering CIA agent on the run, trying to find out who he is. br /> <br /> As I said before, I loved the movie from beginning to end, with no holes in the storyline, slow scenes, everything was fine and fit well with other movies, but it was much better in every respect. <br /> <br /> The best acrobatics, car chases, actors and effects that I saw in the action movie all summer (surprisingly thanks to Spider-Man 3, Pirate, etc.) But I was not Just action in this movie, Jason it not only kills and escapes. He has a soul and the audience feels for him, so drama is included. But that does not slow down this process. <br /> <br /> Of all the "three quels" that appeared last summer, it was the best.
