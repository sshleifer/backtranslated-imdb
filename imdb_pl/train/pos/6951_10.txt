I've never been a big television fan until I watched the 24 for the first time. I got to the series very late. Season 5 ended before I even saw my first episode. It was a series 3 episode that was on my recorder DVR (digital video recorder) when I was at home for the weekend. Such an episode was for me a hook line and a burden in the world of Jack Bauer. And I hooked the boy !! I watched six consecutive episodes without blinking an eye. The next day, I went to Blockbuster and signed up for an unlimited monthly pass for twenty dollars and I do not have to add that it was the biggest hits I ever spent. I watched the first three seasons in three weeks. That's 72 forty minutes of episodes !!! I will say that determining what happens next is easier on DVD than waiting all week. I can only imagine waiting for the Season 6 to be watched week after week !! I think it's lightly tortured and cruel, but I'm going to try and watch it like the rest of America !! The recorder is set and you can bet that I will be chomping on a bit !!
