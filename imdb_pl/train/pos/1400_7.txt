Bogmeister and others almost nailed it. Shore Leave is really the first TOS test in a light sci-fi (which will later be improved in the classic Trouble with Tribbles). This gave both Enterprise and television viewers the necessary respite from the universe-threatening consequences, such as The Corbomite Manouever. <br /> <br /> Looking for a place to relax, the Enterprise happens on the seemingly idyllic M-class planet and sends an exploration team to take a closer look. Soon all kinds of absurdities appear - some seemingly dangerous - but everything seems stupid of human emotional extremes taking place in a strange mixture of fantastic mystery (McCoy crossed the glass), psychological thriller (Kirk is persecuted by a tireless tyrant from his past) and comedy romantic (no comment). <br /> <br /> TOS was the least serialized of all series in the Trek series, so it's easy to forget how many episodes in the First Season were focused on a heavy, potentially disastrous drama. Unlike the later authors of the franchise series, the TOS production team was not afraid to literally go where no TV series was before. And Shore Leave is an example, despite sporadic problems. My only criticism of this episode is that the cast (especially Shatner - ironically taking into account his legendary sense of humor) does not seem to know how to deal with this new wrinkle on ST topics. The last scene is probably one of the worst scenes I remember from the entire course of TOS - both compositional and acting. <br /> <br /> 'nuff said. My recommendation - see this, watching the entire first season, as it was supposed to be visible - this is an order.
