It's been 16 years since the original version was made, I would count on the fact that a "creator of marketing" would now promote the version of this classic actor live, or at least try to re-release the original 65 episodes. I can not understand why the science-fiction network or cartoon network has not yet done so. Galaxy Rangers had well-thought-out threads and even better scripts. The animation was above average in its time and excellent compared to the conversation of the Japanese animation slide show today. This was preceded by a heavy tie on the market, it may also have sealed his doom. I would be happy to spend the cash on a DVD GR if it is available.
