Absolutely great drama and Ros is at the highest level ... I highly recommend this movie. Her performance was, in my opinion, material for an Oscar! The only sad fact is that Universal did not make sure that this movie was ever available in any video format, whether on tape or DVD. They ignore a VERY good movie. But Universal has little respect for his DVD library, which is sad. If you have the chance to see it somewhere (you do not know why it rarely works on the cable), see it! I do not go into this story because I think most people prefer to have an opinion about the movie, and too many "reviewers" spend hours writing about a story that's available everywhere. !
