This is one of the few movies that I've seen twice in the theater. I love this movie for its atmosphere and the story of the life of the tragic hero Esteban Trueba. He makes so many mistakes, but he gets a chance for redemption. Is not this a rather comforting thought? <br /> <br /> When I watched it for the first time, I thought that after the election, the film would end - I did not know the book. So I was wrong when the dramatic climax was coming! I was literally kidnapped by the power of the last half hour of the movie. <br /> <br /> Many people here do not like this movie at all. I can not understand this one piece. Perhaps those who read the book for the first time are - as often with the screening of the novel - simply disappointed that so many things remain unspeakable, invisible, unexplained. But as a film telling a moving story - a family story, the rise and fall of a man, the deep compassion of a woman, the power of love and the madness of hatred (and conservatism) - this film is simply great! What's more, the soundtrack is incredibly good and the cast is also great - especially Winona Ryder and Jeremy Irons. <br /> <br /> Certainly one of those movies for which the cinema was invented!
