Cosimo (Luis Guzm√°n) is informed in prison about the perfect assault. Because he is behind bars and can not do it himself, he must leave it to his girlfriend Rosalind (Patricia Clarkson). Soon there are five guys organizing the crime - five guys Brothers Anthony and Joe Russo are the directors of Welcome to Collinwood (2002). This is a crime comedy that is often very funny. You can not help laughing when everything goes wrong with these guys. actors playing these characters. William H. Macy plays Riley.Isaiah Washington is Leon.Sam Rockwell is Pero.Michael Jeter is Toto.Andy Davoli is Basil.Gabrielle Union plays his love interest Michelle.Jennifer Esposito plays an interest in the love of Pero Carmela.George Clooney (also a producer) game George, a tattooed guy in a wheelchair. It's a very funny movie. I certainly recommend it.
