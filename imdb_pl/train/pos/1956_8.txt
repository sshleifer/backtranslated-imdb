I really think that this movie is more an example of an easy goal than a really bad movie. In fact, the film is done very well in many respects and is very funny. <br /> <br /> Yes, the script is a bit tricky, but it's a genre. The film has a noisy atmosphere centered around femme fatale. Like all old classics noir, it also has a script that turns you on, so you do not always know how to do it at the beginning, and it can be dragging if you think too deep and try to put all the parts together. It's this species. In general, the script has enough surprises and phrases to allow the viewer to guess and, in turn, be surprised, without abandoning the viewer. <br /> <br /> Sharon Stone is also an easy target. The truth is that it looks great, and she speaks in a nice way with her nice dialogue, in such a way as to let him go into something mysterious, sexy and funny. <br /> <br /> The direction is more than satisfactory, because let's look into the eyes of this - you have to keep the audience interested in "whether she or not?" question for two hours. In addition to the twisted scenario and fun performance of Stone, this takes place effectively through the direction, thanks to the creation of a noisy atmosphere that is both dark and very raw and modern, with simple industrial lines that match Stone's sexy curves. The frame is always beautiful - press the pause anywhere and there is something interesting to look at. <br /> <br /> The movie also relies on things that were tricks in the first movie and turns them into something more real, especially sex. "Katherine Tramell is bisexual ... how shocking!" She is treated more matter-of-factly and usually the sexuality of the film is used for a better effect. It's still exciting, but it's not as easy to get shock and buzz as in the first one. I will not say that this is not a trick yet, because let's face it, this movie is supposed to be fun. <br /> <br /> And this is a funny movie. It may be an easy target, but if you look at it, then what it is: noirish, femme-fatale driven, shot, sexy, did-she-not-she-she-dunnit, you will definitely be happy (no pun intended) .
