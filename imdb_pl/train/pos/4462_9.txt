One of the first of the best musicals, Anchors Aweigh, is a few unforgettable musical sequences, such as Kelly dancing with the mouse Jerry, Kelly dancing with 7-year-old Sharon McManus, singing Sinatra with Jose Iturbim playing the piano, Kathryn Grayson singing with Iturbi conducting and many more. Technicolor is perfect, with some innovative camera work, such as watching the piano played from below, through the transparent keys and Grayson's singing, seen through the viewfinder of another camera. The plot is thin, but you are involved in the enthusiasm of Kelly and Sinatra. Sailor is on vacation, have to take home the running boy (Dean Stockwell), and Sinatra falls for his aunt. To set him up with his aunt (Grayson), Kelly suggests that Sinatra may get an interrogation with Jose Iturbi. But the young and na√Øve Sinatra, in this and in his own sung words, falls in love too soon. When they try to contact Iturbi, who is never available, another girl starts to fall (Barbara Britton); but Kelly is now falling with Grayson. Anchors Aweigh is most often remembered for the combination of live sequences with cartoons with Tom and Jerry, but there are many more to see. I give him nine stars because, although not as good as the best musicals - Singin 'In The Rain, The Music Man, Oklahoma - this is one of the first of their great Technicolor productions (perhaps Meet Me In St. Louis was first) and better than most others.
