I am from Romania, I will try to speak English. All I want to say about this movie is that it is and will be my number one all time. You see it over 30 times and you will see it for many years. He has all the little things I like about the movie, it's very touching that makes me cry. It shows a whole lot of twisted love things and questions about love and reality, as well as real things that matter to different people. It happens to me that it has the most meaning, the love, the soul of a man, is an inner being, and this is what I see in this film. Perhaps it is more than just a movie for me, it is proof in my belief that it can really exist and that you make the best use of every moment in which you live with your soul mate. It's a long way from reality to science fiction, but ... what if. What would happen if all capitalism disappeared and the economy collapsed, would it collapse? We are all worried about other things and I think that on the deathbed the greater thing you remember is not wealth, not adventure, not the countries you visited and people who remember you. But true friends and your true love and the hope that after your death they will all be damned perfect, and people will be good and more caring. WATCH THIS FILM and will probably guide you through your life the way I did it :) I come from Romania
