<br /> <br /> So, being a poet, I have no real way to convey the beauty and simplicity of this document. Goldsworthy's trouble-free movement, which shapes the beauty of nature in his own work, is enchanting. Watch how they keep the cane together in a network hanging from a tree for a few minutes when talking about their work, and then they will receive a payment when the camera retreats to a wide angle. Be amazed at the ease with which it works, and then be aware of the futility when a light breeze knocks down the entire network. <br /> <br /> Genius Goldsworthy apparently knows no bounds, because his inspiration is nature itself. This is a fundamental change of nature in which his work, although complete in his own sphere, is realized.
