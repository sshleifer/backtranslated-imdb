THE SUNSHINE BOYS is a fun filming of Neil Simon in 1975 about a retired vaudeville band played by Walter Matthau and George Burns, who had a very bitter disintegration and were asked to reunite in a special TV show or something like that. The problem is that these two hate each other and do not want to have anything to do with each other. Richard Benjamin appears as Matthau's nephew, a theater agent who was given monumental responsibility for the realization of this unification. This warm and winning comedy is a charming Valentine for a forgotten form of entertainment ... vaudeville and works mainly thanks to one of the better scenarios of Neil Simon and the outstanding work of Matthau, Burns and Benjamin. Burns won the Best Supporting Actor award, but I think Matthau is leaving the movie with his flawlessly funny performance as Willy Clark. Matthau was nominated for the Best Actor Award, but he did not stand a chance against Nicholson for HIGHEST HIGHEST ROOM; but in another year it was a spectacle deserving of an Oscar. Matthau controls the screen and there is no false note in this beautifully set time. The scene in which he interrogates potato chips advertising and can not get the product name is classic. THE SUNSHINE BOYS is the warm and winning comedy of Neil Simon, which shines with unmatched chemistry between Matthau and Burns.
