I never heard about this film before watching it, I was wondering if it was an independent film, and I was right, but thanks to a good cast I decided to do it. Essentially, Michael Williams (Nicolas Cage) is in the city of Red Rock, Wyoming, looking for a job, and the owner of the meeting bar Wayne Brown (JT Walsh from Pleasantville) receives a large sum of money, mistakenly for the hit man he has employed to kill his unfaithful wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle). He does not correct him, he does not take the money and goes to warn Suzanne, and after he makes him a counteroffer, he decides to leave. When Wayne knows his true identity, he chases Michael firing a large weapon until he gets into the car with Lyle from Dallas (Dennis Hopper). But things get complicated when Michael realizes that Lyle is the murderer he made a mistake for and he quickly withdraws. He returns to Suzanne and, knowing that both of them are in danger, plan to leave the city together and add another complication, falling on himself. Before they leave, however, Suzanne insists that they steal big money in the safe. Of course, things will not go smoothly, and Wayne and Lyle will catch up with them, and Lyle forces them, and they have now bound Wayne to go and bury the money. After all, Lyle and Wayne get what they deserve, Michael and Suzanne get on the train together, but it's obvious that she cares more about money and she gets what she deserves. Starring Craig Reay as Jim, Vance Johnson as Mr. Johnson, Timothy Carhart as deputy Matt Greytack, Dwight Yoakam as Truck Driver and Robert Apel as Howard. The performances, apart from perhaps lame Boyle, are fine and elegant, and have quite a good cinematic sense in the thriller of black comedy. Very good!
