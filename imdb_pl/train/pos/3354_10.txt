This movie is finally available on DVD in Italy (completely restored). I've seen this movie so many times and I think it's even real these days (2003) when Italy is again suffering from the brainwashing dictatorship (or the US). I am glad that there are outcasts, such as Mastroianni in this film, who can sing with a melody; maybe they can teach Sophia Lorens of this world how to be strong and fight to be recognized as a human being. <br /> <br /> Returning to the movie: as most people have already mentioned here, the game is great, but the audio background is amazing. I must assume that unfortunately something is lost if you do not understand the Italian language, but I can assure you that the show of machismo, the distortion of reality in this always present chronicle of Hitler's radio visit in Rome can really shake! <br /> <br /> A masterpiece! <br /> <br />
