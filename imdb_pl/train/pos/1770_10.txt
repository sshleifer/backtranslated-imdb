In the announcements, "The 40-year-old virgin" praises the image of immature sex with a 40-person Lonely Guy who suddenly feels the need to do something just because he did not. Too many past bad experiences have weakened his enthusiasm to such an extent that he avoids women altogether. And then it happens unexpected: he falls in love. What's more, there is a movie about it and it's called a "40-year-old virgin". <br /> <br /> The virgin title artist is Andy Stitzer (Steve Carell), who is actually 40 years old, works as an e-shop employee and collects antique action figures that are displayed throughout his nice studio apartment so that everyone can see them. He has a beautiful home cinema system and watches "Survivor" with his two good elderly neighbors. It is quite a picturesque definition of a lonely guy who has to go out and talk to more women. <br /> <br /> Now there is a real novelty with this image: it is an impossible task to actually address its object in a sweet, mature way. It is a film that could very easily turn out to be completely different in the hands of a more transparent team of filmmakers. It could end up with endless sex and jokes, but fortunately this picture never bends so low. Sure, there are sexual jokes here and there, and even a few prods are directed to the gay community (which in no way are to be treated as a fight with gays), because two characters exchange insults with each other during the video game ("Mortal Kombat: Deception ", no less - the final fight against testosterone for men). <br /> <br /> As someone who quickly approaches 20 years, collects action figures McFarlane Toys and he never did the deed, I found this film as funny and touching in a way in which a film with similar themes could never be. I was able to refer to the character of Andy Stitzer more than anyone else in the theater, because I was the only teenager present at this show; everyone looked like they were all 40. A bit arrogant, I know, but are you (you're italic) still able to relate if you were the only teenager present in the afternoon show "The 40 Year-Old Virgin"? <br /> <br /> Of course, Andy has never had sex and wakes up every day with "morning growth" (do not ask), and his friends are under pressure to try bizarre methods of gaining the opposite sex. When he first discovered that Andy is a virgin, at the age of 40, his three buddies and colleagues from the electronics store David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romany Malco) and Cal (Seth Rogen) initially assume that he is gay because he was never with a woman who could not be further from the truth. The truth is that Andy loves women, but the past traumatic experiences (revealed amusingly one by one in the sequence of retrospection) made him, for good, out of the way. <br /> <br /> David, Jay and Cal, everyone is starting to get Andy, so help them all. But you know that such escapades end only with a catastrophe, as evidenced by one date with Nicky (Leslie Mann), who puts Andy in the worst experience of drunk driving, about which I think nobody would like to go and has a rather scary meeting with Beth (Elizabeth Banks), a pretty girl who works in a bookstore and eventually turns out to be a total sexter. <br /> <br /> Things brighten Andy when he meets Trish (Catherine Keener), a friendly woman working in a store across the street that sells things on eBay to people. Hmmm. With this nice collection of action figures, you can guess that in the end a large financial payment awaits him, that is, will he ever "do deed". <br /> <br /> After all, it's the sex we've been waiting for. He deals with a very real issue that many lonely guys probably pass through, and not that something is wrong with being a virgin, but let's look at the big picture: how many of us "lonely guys" want to be a lonely guy forever? The important thing that we learn in this photo is that Lonely Guy must be himself. I do not think he has to go through the waxing of the body, as Andy does (to be honest, it splits into parts, and according to this site and various other news articles, it was real, just like the blood on Carell's shirt)). <br /> <br /> The "40-year-old virgin" was directed by Judd Apatova and co-written by him and Carell, which was created as a sketch in which Carell performed. Carell is sweet and human because his character is not a layman who is approaching with his eyes closed. This is probably one of the most intelligent romps I have ever seen and is not offensive (a lot) because his characters are treated with dignity and respect. Even Carell's colleagues, who give bad advice to hide their insecurities in the relationship, can be connected at a basic level. <br /> <br /> The way the 40-year-old virgin plays is really a funny end, but I will leave it to you, the viewer, to observe. Certainly, if someone can go through things that Andy does and still has the strength to attract a woman as sexy as Catherine Keener, it's true: it's never too late! <br /> <br /> 10/10
