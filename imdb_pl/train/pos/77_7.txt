The film begins with Vincent Price, who will soon appear as a magician. However, in the middle of a very successful show, the police come and close it. It looks like his old boss betrayed him with the tricks he created Price - even the ones he did in his own home. As a result, Price rightly kills the evil man. The problem is that while the viewer understood why Cena killed, and most likely thought it was a GOOD thing, because Price was a bit furious, he just could not stop (something like Lay's Potato Chips). <br /> <br /> The film was full of very creative and spectacular magic tricks (including a huge circular saw and crematorium for shows), great twists and exciting action. One thing that can not be said about this movie is that it is boring. Although it is also far from subtlety, it is fun, but it's worth watching. <br /> <br /> If I had never seen the version of Vincent Price's HOUSE OF WAX, I would probably like THE MAD MAGICIAN more and win 8 or 9. This is because THE MAD MAGICIAN is a great movie, very similar to a movie that preceded (HOUSE OF WAX). The bottom line is that since HOUSE OF WAX has been so successful, the formula has been changed again in the supplementary film. Both have been made in 3-D, both have a storyline in which Price has all the excuses to kill, but he can not stop when he makes first and both are great to watch. The biggest differences, and there are not many, are that HOUSE OF WAX was in color and was more of a horror film, and THE MAD MAGICIAN was definitely more mysterious. <br /> <br /> My advice is to see this movie AND HOUSE OF WAX (only version Price). Both are great horror movies from the 1950s.
