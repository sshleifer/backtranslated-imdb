It's very funny. You know, just like a comedy. It also looks very good, how should the Hollywood spectacle be. So what more do you want? What do you say for a very VERY good Sally Fields. It's a lot better here than anything else I've seen in it, and it looks so damn good. This movie is everything you need to understand why it is a Star. Those eyes! Like a silent film star, but better. In fact, everyone's eyes are so good. With my girlfriend I used to pretend to be a bad soap actor. We would do it when you look really fast from one eye to the other partner. They do not do it in the soap dish at all. Great. Eyes have it! (sorry) <br /> <br /> There are so many wonderful performances, and the fun just waits for the appearance of each of them. With Kevin Kline, the whole workshop takes place on how to subtly act. Do you understand? Yes, he's damn good. Like Robert Downey, Jr., who has since summarized his career at Slick, Slimy Executive. Cathy Moriarity, although she is not the most talented actress, is so charismatic and thrilling, especially when she is angry. And even Whoopi Goldberg is decent, her natural timing gives here a little flat delivery of some Zing. OK, no Whoopi Bashing, I can hear you. <br /> <br /> And then there are hair. Soap dish was made at the end of BIG Hair Eighties, so funny things are in themselves a great character. They become bigger and stupid, just like yours. Yes, we have photos. <br /> <br /> Soap dish is better than I thought, better than I wanted it to be. I have enough of movies that tell me that I have to take care of shallow, self-focused, semi-talented egomaniacs, ie TV soap actors. The soap dish seems happy that I am laughing at them. Thank you.
