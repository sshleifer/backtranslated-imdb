I must admit that I have not read the original story of M R James, although I have read many of his other supernatural stories. I also saw most of the previous BBC Christmas Ghost Stories, and this one, in my opinion, surpasses most of them, equating only Signalman. <br /> <br /> I really can not be wrong. A View From a Hill - Direction and "mood" is perfect, as well as acting, lighting and of course, story and writing. I liked it very much and I hope for more of that quality from the same director and production team. I understand that the BBC is planning to do more (not necessarily based on James R's stories), so it's promising. <br /> <br /> 10/10
