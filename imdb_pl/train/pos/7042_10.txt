First, someone mentioned here that because it was released in a "limited" quantity, it means that it SHOULD be bad ... exactly what the "big five" Hollywood studies would like everyone to think they could "go through" or " ignore "" features that are not desirable without losing face or imagination by directly censoring them. to the point, this production was released "limited" because some people consider it "unpatriotic". <br /> <br /> now I absolutely love this function; I think it's better than "Charlie Wilson's War", even if it's a "fictional" account of what "never" happens, but it's always OBVIOUS.this goes to everyone and anyone interested in or affected by current American politics foreign, "home" or "on board". the "turakistan" and "emerald city" countries definitely try to resemble Iraq and Baghdad just as the "Tamerlane" corporation follows "haliburton" (with vice president Dan Aykroyd playing Dick Cheney, LOL). calm down the moments in which the movie is DEAD SERIOUS, not even sarcastic (the main example is how John Cusack deals with depression, but not only). <br /> <br /> I discovered that ALL characters can be associated with something / someone or specific stereotypes. now a word of advice; if you are not politically active, especially with regard to aspects of "globalization", you probably will not enjoy this feature too much, because most of its content and inside "jokes" are focused on certain "personalities" that are not "visible" to the general public of society in everyday databases (the main exception would be Hilary Duff, who plays a well-known materialistic pop star, I have to say the name (S)?). on CORE, this feature is an anti-globalization event, period. the message is undoubtedly delivered with comical revenge. Joan has a poem at one point, which is like this: "and here we have a book written by you, you know who, how I conquered the world and solved my dad's problems." PRICELESS ")) <br /> <br /> sister and brother Cusacks play well together as always, just like in "Grosse PointeBlank" I would say a bit more "mature". Marisa Tomeihere does not show her ass and breasts to "impress" us (just like "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" lately), but instead she has a very serious role and manages to calm her down. <br /> <br /> many critics do not understand it (they can not do it or do not want to). This is NOT a regular movie, but a more comic document. this function is supposed to deliver news, NOT get Oscillations, or have "visuals" that will make the viewer buy the latest "HDTV Experience" TV sets ... I even noticed in my local newspapers that this movie is getting broken - Reviews because they are not " artistically, while war films PRO Iraq have good thumbs for being "balanced" apparently and "engaging." he wonders how all the mainstream global media are concentrated in the hands of the gang. ... <br /> <br /> I bet this feature will be a hit overseas, just like in North America. as I mentioned earlier, it is a satire about American foreign policy and how it was kidnapped by groups of "special interests" ... insulting a "regular" American soldier in the corporate logo of "Tamerlane" on his battle dress BUT EFFECTIVE in showing the reality of what IS or soon it will be like things will go that far. <br /> <br /> some BEAUTIFUL PICTURES: after "liberation" the country is attacked with commercial advertisements; a funny scene about how future journalists will most likely collect "news" ("everything must be better than those with an X-Box"))); soldiers dealing with their "frustration"; <br /> <br /> generally, I do not recommend this type of "conservatives" or "hard" patriots of some kind. This function is not intended to reach the "minds of souls" of people (as the mainstream propaganda and commercial interests always try to do). instead, it contains a well-defined message for the realists and, to the ideological goals, apparently "always" incomprehensible.
