I am a big fan of Jane Austen, and besides being a full-length movie (a real fan wants to see the smallest part, and this can only be achieved in a mini series), it was really great. Gwyneth Paltrow really captures the somewhat unconscious but rich intent of a rich girl, and Jeremy Northam IS. Knightly with his mastery and nobility. I was not delighted with Ewan McGregor, although I liked him very much as an actor, but I did not feel that it ruined the film at all. As I said, as a fan of Jane Austen there were things that I would like to see in what was not, but it would make the full-length movie much longer than acceptable, and because it did, I felt that they really made history good. I saw every adaptation of this book and thought it was the best!
