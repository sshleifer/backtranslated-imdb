At the moment, listening to the soundtrack, the images come back with a clarity that makes my thirst for a dry eye very strong (to be able to write it). I have seen it twice so far and I should be ashamed that I saw him * only * twice. <br /> <br /> I have seen all Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli films and they are nothing more than masterpieces (except perhaps Nausicaa, which was, even in the original version, too premature compared to the nec-plus-ultra manga). However, their strength sometimes becomes their weakness, because they tend to be too naive / positive (Chihiro) or, with greater nuance, a bit too pronounced / moralistic (Mononoke). At least compared, for example, with another Ghibli master, Takahata (Grave of the Fireflies / Only Yesterday / Raccoon Wars). But not this one. <br /> <br /> At Laputa, Miyazaki spills all the wonderful stories that narrators of stories have accumulated and refined over the centuries, combined with a bit of morale, but nicely entwined with not only a completely transcendental atmosphere, but also humor and amusement, for example, Totoro. Each main character is perfectly presented with their doubts and fears and features that help them overcome difficulties. The stimulation is so perfect that I know nothing but a black hole that would be able to exert such a gravitational influence on your entire being. The story is presented as an action with secrets, but when a girl falls from the sky, unconscious, floating with a stone, and the main motif appears in it, you can see the great mystery you will discover, but the story falls and gradually, through several carefully selected action scenes and cheerful beauty, builds an unforgettable climax of melancholy, hope, beauty - as after dark days, finally seeing the horizon on a bright morning, knowing that the path was walking, seeing the distance ahead, but smiling at the mere fact that I can see it. <br /> <br /> It's like exploding white light in your skull, which if, when the loans start to shake, you keep your eyes dry and numb, you should see the therapist. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that in technical terms some new Miyazakis may be more overwhelming, it remains his undisputed masterpiece. If you devote a fraction of a second to realize that it was done in 1986, you can come to the conclusion that Hayao Miyazaki is a genius like a star that appears only once in 200 years. This, of course, has been suggested earlier, but for me it is his only film that can fully illustrate this simple fact. If you miss it during your life, you will die with a huge gap - which would be a pity, because the coffin costs the same.
