I watched the movie for a few days, and the final effect was only two scenes in the film. The location was Sylvan Lake in the Black Hills. Bring the wagon, stop the car, etc. So the Dakota youth could not wait to see the movie. The local buffalo herd was slaughtered, so the shooting scenes were real. (yes Doris, the animals were injured while filming) I think the ending was copied by Jack Nicholson in Shining? A great western / social comment from the 50's. This should be in the same class as High Noon in a real western drama or used as a social statement, such as Blackboard Jungle or Rebel Without A Cause, for young people from the 1950s.
