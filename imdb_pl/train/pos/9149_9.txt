I've never seen Richard Thomas playing a bad guy. I was not sure if I would like him so much. And I was not sure if he could do it. But it amazed me. He sent shivers to my spine and made me look closer at the street people. The film is captivating and fast. Bruce Davison is convincing, but everything he can really play is a nice guy. Thomas is a real talent here. The ending was a bit clumsy, but maybe that's how real people would fight ... If you're a fan of Thomas, you MUST see him here in his best, bad condition!
