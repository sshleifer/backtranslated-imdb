Although George C. Scott is the only actor in this ACC version without a British accent, he is more than making up for it with his top and timeless interpretation of Ebenezer Scrooge. <br /> <br /> Particularly effective when he confronts Bob Cratchit in his office at the end of the movie. When Scott stands in front of a large window, sunlight shines on him a glowing coat; all you see is his silhouette. Strengthened by Scott's voice, with a heavy growl, the effect is galvanizing ... just like the first scene of Marlon Brando in APOCALYPSE NOW. "Horror" indeed! <br /> <br /> However, as they say, what works can also work against you. Because Scott displays such a joyful wildness throughout the film, it turns out to be contagious. In other words, "before" Scrooge is almost as charismatic as "after", even though it really should not be. What you can call the "Doctor Smith" effect, because Jonathan Harris used a very similar approach, playing this role and many other heavy ones (both on the stage and on the screen). <br /> <br /> Actually, do not think that Scott is angry. But other purists of "Christmas Carols" can. See the movie and judge for yourself.
