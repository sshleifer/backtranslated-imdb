And I'm a fanatic of Nicole Kidman. I would pay to see and hear her read the Moscow telephone book, which, as far as I know, she could do when she spoke Russian in this film. <br /> <br /> All four directors are great, but the film itself is a series of good images and better scenes combined with nothing. <br /> <br /> While one is always ready to suspect disbelief while watching a movie, this one is asking too much to the viewer. <br /> <br /> It could be very funny (which is in part) or quite scary (which is in one scene), but the director did not seem to know which way to go.
