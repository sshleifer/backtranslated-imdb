One of my favorite programs in the 70's. As I recall, on Friday (or probably on Saturday) he went to the air at Nine Network (?) Here in Australia. Darren McGavin and Simon Oakland were wonderful together. <br /> <br /> Each episode reached a climax when Kolchack had to fight with his hand in the hands of a supernatural opponent. Admittedly, the authors have made a joint effort to escape from the usual round of vampires and ghosts as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> I remember one episode in which the opponent was the spirit of an ancient Indian chief who / who "came back" as a huge electric current that started killing people in the city hospital. The final game showed that Kolchack tried to connect the "beast of power" amid the explosion of sparks and undulating flames. Well ... you had to be there, but it was an interesting idea. <br /> <br /> McGavin always brought a lot of energy and enthusiasm into his roles and that was one of his best. br /> <br /> Definitely deserves a place in the "Hall of Fame" on TV. To quote Tony Vincenzo ... "Kolchack, you are THIS" ... Or, in the case of the Hall of Fame, "IN it"!
