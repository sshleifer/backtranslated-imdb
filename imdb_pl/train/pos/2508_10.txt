This movie is amazing. The plot was just ... wow. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised by the performance of Gackt and Hyde, after growing up in the American world of actors who can not sing and singers who can not play. <br /> <br /> In this video, young Sho (Gackt) encounters vampire Kei (Hyde). Over time, they create an amazing friendship. Kei is suffering from the way he is forced to live off others, the half-life of a vampire. <br /> <br /> It's a sad movie, but not very happy. The plot was very unique and contrary to the typical vampire movement. The plot was thick with twists and very delightful. <br /> <br /> The only drawback I would say that the film had, despite the lack of a happy - though peaceful? Ending, there would be many languages. I had the version that was not released (I'm lucky that I understood all this, but some of Cantonese), so I recommend something with subtitles. <br /> <br /> All in all, the movie was just amazing.
