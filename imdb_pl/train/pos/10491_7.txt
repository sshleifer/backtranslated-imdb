A wonderful, delicate comedy gem, up to the last five minutes, which turned into a farce of British television. The last five minutes cost me 2 points in my opinion. Despite this great plot and blemish, it's worth seeing the performance of the actors and the unique setting in Cornwall. A lot of little things to taste, like tense eternity, which we all wait for the bank's approval after the clerk moved the credit card ... more spicy when we're not - quite sure - that the card is not maximum.
