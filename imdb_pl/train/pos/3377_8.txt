Soylent Green is a classic. I'm waiting for someone to do it. It seems that today they are transforming science fiction classics (ie War of the Worlds) and I hope that some director / producer will do Soylent Green again. Thanks to today's computer animation and technology, it can be a great picture. Anti-utopian films may not be so far-fetched. The human race is born like cockroaches without external influence to limit it. We humans have the option of placing a kibosh on the procreation of smaller species if they get out of hand, but there is nothing that controls the breeding of humans except ourselves. Despite all diseases, wars, abortions, birth control, etc. The human race is still multiplying like bacteria on a Petri dish. The classic Malthusian economy states that every species, including man, will reproduce over its means of subsistence. 6 billion and growing .... it's indecent.
