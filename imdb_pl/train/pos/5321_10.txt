This film really surprised me. Initially, I had doubts, but the film was getting better every minute. <br /> <br /> This may not be for the public seeking action, but for those who like a clear portrait of a very strange criminal, a man, a lover and a husband. If you're not a fan of bad language or sexual content, it's not really for you. <br /> <br /> The plot is sometimes difficult to follow, but in the end it seems to me that everything has become better. The ending was unexpected because you were almost faked to think it would end differently. <br /> <br /> When it comes to acting, I think it was good. It will not wait long for an Oscar award, but at least it caught my eye. The portrait of the prison man Gil Bellows is not always perfect, but he is very funny. Shaun Parkes, a portrait of Bellows' prison friend Clinique, is wonderful and extremely powerful. On the other hand, I think I will introduce to Mark the portrait of Esai Morales. <br /> <br /> Take my advice and watch this movie, you will love it or you do not like it!
