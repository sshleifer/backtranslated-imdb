I will keep this quite short. I believe that this is an extraordinary movie. I see other reviewers who commented on the effect that it is badly written, poorly filmed, has a terrible soundtrack and, worse, that it is not real in presenting life. Okay, so maybe it's not quite reliable all along, but this movie carries a message of hope that some people seemed to miss. I hope it is not too late to save people from the terrible things that have happened in so many lives. Violence in Gangland is real, right? Is it good, no! This film carries an important social message, which cynics may not like, but which, however, should be praised rather than denigrated. I watched the movie with great pleasure at least eight times, each time with equal pleasure and each time with the feeling that maybe the world can be better and is not save (or at least until 2008). 9 out of 10 for me. In my opinion, it is almost perfect. JMV
