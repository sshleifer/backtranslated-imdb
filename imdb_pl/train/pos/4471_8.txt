Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra, Kathryn Grayson and Jose Iturbi play in the film "Anchors Aweigh" directed by George Sidney. <br /> <br /> Kelly and Sinatra are Joe and Clarence, two nails on vacation in Hollywood. They meet a small boy (Dean Stockwell) and take him home, meet his aunt (Grayson). Clarence falls in love with her. He wants to interrogate Jose Iturbi. They are trying to help, but there is confusion. <br /> <br /> This is a very energetic musical with great dancing and singing of Kelly and Sinatra. Kelly is dancing with Jerry the Mouse in a wonderful sequence. Grayson sings Jalousie and My Heart Sings. Not one of my favorite voices, but he's doing well. Iturbi's piano work is beautiful. <br /> <br /> Sinatra shows his versatility and why girls swoon over him, with those big blue eyes and a boyish face. For Kelly it was a big break for him at MGM. <br /> <br /> A great movie, very resilient.
