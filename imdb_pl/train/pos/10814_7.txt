Considering the opposite circumstances of 2009, in which the reality is that we have a black president, this film takes on quite significant historical significance. For the entertainment value, I find this movie captivating and repulsive. Of course, I was withdrawn by gross racism, but also music and dance were amazing. It's also great to see Sammy Davis Jr. as a very young actor. A game of Rufus Jones, a young boy whom his Mamma comforts. He was told "Why can you be president one day?" It was so funny in 1933 that they were ridiculed and thought to be charming, charming and funny. Most of the movie is a fanciful sequence of what the government would look like if it were led by a black man. They depict places of government as a reviving Baptist church. <br /> <br /> It was a fact that when I came across this movie, he pulled me in one day. I believe that if we look beyond racism, we will see this movie for everything that will bring us. In fact, to realize that having a black president is not only not funny, but that it's normal, it just makes the movie more appropriate. Clearly marks the moment in our collective consciousness.
