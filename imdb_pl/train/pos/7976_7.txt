Revenge is the subject of this thriller, Denzel Washington, who offers his share of action, chaos, murder and terrifying blood-letting. The most important is the mission of searching for and destroying the bodyguard, because his protégé, young Dakota Fanning, is kidnapped from school, which Washington has just hired to prevent. Locations in Mexico City are as chaotic as the plot moves towards a predictable, violent conclusion, with twists and turns on the way. Washington, a former CIA agent with a drinking problem, receives good references from a former fellow agent who launches the plot outline. Washington and Fanning have great chemistry between themselves and after a troublesome start the bodyguard and his protégés become best friends. Christopher Walken, Rachel Ticotin, Radha Mitchell, Giancarlo Giannini and Mickey Rourke are a good cast of two stars.
