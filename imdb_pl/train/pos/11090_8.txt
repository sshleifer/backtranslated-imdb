Successful, independent married businessman Harry Mitchell (excellent steel performance by Roy Scheider) has an adulterer who throws herself with a young stripper Cini (wonderful Kelly Preston). Harry is being blackmailed by the triumphant miserable hoods - the mad director of Raima's porn theater (the brilliant slimy John Glover), the ridiculous owner Leo (played well by Robert Trebor) and the crazed pimp Bobby Shy (frighteningly intense Clarence Williams III) - who recorded his romance with Cinim. When Harry does not want to pay, the hoods kill Cini and make it look like Harry did it. This, in turn, triggers a dangerous battle of wit and will between Harry and the hoods. Director John Frankenheimer, adopting a difficult scenario based on the crime novel by Elmore Leonard, expertly maintains a fast pace, provides a lot of immersive tension and effectively creates an irresistible, dingy atmosphere. All the leading roles are uniformly excellent, with distinctive performances of Ann-Margret as the bitter neglected wife of Harry, Barbara, Vanity as the bold, tired prostitute Doreen and Lonny Chapman as Harry's loyal business partner, Jim O'Boyle. and. An intriguing plot keeps viewers on their toes. The wickedly profaning dialogue, the gleaming photos of Jost Vacano, the rousing score of Gary Chang, the sharp, amoral tone and thrilling ending are also on the money. As an added bonus, both Vanity and Preston take off their clothes. A very strong and satisfying small number that is worth checking out.
