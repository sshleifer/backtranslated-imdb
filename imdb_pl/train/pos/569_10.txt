The river runs through it. It is based on the true story of two flyer brothers, Norman and Paul (Brad Pitt and Craig Sheffer), whose Reverend father (Tom Skerritt) is a stern man whose two passions are his faith and fly fishing, - for him and his sons there is a thin line between them. This story describes the slow development of brothers' lives and their lives on two different paths. This is a touching film telling director Robert Redford, who plays an older Norman and wonders about long gone times and people who have been dead for a long time. <br /> <br /> Some motifs return in the movie, such as memory, death, eternity and dreams. Most of these topics focus around the tragic hero Paul. He is a talented, charming and brave man, but he has his disastrous flaws. <br /> <br /> The final lines summarize the "point" of the film: "Then in the arctic canyon's twilight, all existence disappears in essence with my soul and memories and sounds of the Great Black Foot River and the four-digit rhythm and the hope that the fish will grow. finally, all things merge into one and the river flows through it. The river was cut by a huge flood in the world and runs over the rocks from the basement of time. On some of these rocks are timeless raindrops. There are words under the rocks, and some words belong to them. I am haunted by water.
