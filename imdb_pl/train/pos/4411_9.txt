Easily 9 out of 10 on the director's film will continue to evolve to admire. But do not watch this movie, which is to be "entertaining". Ang Lee looks at the objectively unexplored aspects of the civil war. What's beautiful in this movie, like all Lee movies, is that it does not "stand on the side" of its heroes. He creates characters, epitomizes them with life, problems and ambiguity ... and gives them a reality that often hits much closer to home than what many feel comfortable with. This movie has an action, but it is not for the action lover, because violence is deeply disturbing and far from free ... that is, like heroes, it's real. And as you can expect from one of the most terrifying wars of humanity, violence is terrifying. <br /> <br /> But as an exploration of the larger human ambiguity that certainly lived in a civil war, it is a masterpiece. Is the war on slavery and the abolition of the death penalty? Lee seems to be very eager to blur this line, so popular in performances such as Blue and Gray. However, this is not about idealism, as you can see in Gone with the Wind. It's about freedom, about wanting something that belongs to you and fighting for it. As you watch the characters, you ask yourself "how can they fight for slavery?" The fact is, I do not think it really is, and the film shows the problem of why so many were involved in the war of secession. <br /> <br /> It seems clear that many of the characters we learn about are struggling with the senses of loyalty to the "home", although they may never investigate what the house represents or if they really support its values. The letter scenes are very moving and subtle at the same time. Jake and Daniel are other examples of loyalty reaching borders. And when the tension finally falls apart, and these heroes suddenly become "free" ... we see the birth of new people. <br /> <br /> All this mixed up with Lee's beautiful inclusion of an environment of humanity with breathtaking views and frames. Lee has a style that is somehow European in his "art" (slow camera, unruhed), Asian in an epic age and history development, yet known and readily available to so many in North America. /> <br /> Relax, discard your prejudices about what the Civil War is, what is "western" as a genre, what a war movie should be ... and let Ang Lee take you into a world so fragile, so difficult, so real that few of us can see this comfortably. <br /> <br /> In this, Lee continues what he did in the Ice Storm. Again, the movie is slow and there is no clear "direction" ... a sure sign of Lee's ability to drive without "putting" himself on the story or screen. His direction is strengthened by what he extracts from Jewel (yes, the singer), hitherto unproven actress who performs an amazing performance. <br /> <br /> A movie for those who love the movie and are not lovers of the standard Hollywood epic.
