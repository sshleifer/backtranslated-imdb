this movie is totally funny. in fact, the plot revolves around a serial killer who in some way caused by a chemical accident from film B was turned into a snowman. then he goes to the city and starts terrorizing the locals. it's up to the local police chief and some other characters to try and stop him. it's made in a small budget and certainly shows, but the great thing about this movie is that it knows it's rubbish. The improvisation of Styrofoam and polystyrene imitating the giant snowman-killer are classic and this is clearly the intention - this is one of the few films where the main selling point is the budget. there are other great comedy moments next to the comic stickiness - listen to the very beginning of the voice over the father who scares his children to death, and the funniest rape scene ever shot. fantastic cheesy fun
