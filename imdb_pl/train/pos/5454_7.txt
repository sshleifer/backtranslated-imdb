This is one of the most daring and important of the so-called "Pre-Code" films produced in Hollywood in the 1930s. Unlike some pre-modal movies, which sometimes dealt with topics that would never have been allowed after 1934-5, the movie completely immersed itself in a very dirty but funny story from beginning to end. The conventional morality of the late 30's and 40's was definitely not visible in this film, because the film basically talks about a woman who falls asleep at the top - and without any apologies. This "wide" both enjoyed sex and used it in every person who could help her become rich - something that you simply would not see in movies created only two or three years later. <br /> <br /> The film starts with Barbara Stanwyck working in her father's bar. In addition to being her boss, she is also her pimp and encourages her to sleep with a local government official to allow the illegal bar to act with impunity. Although it is not very clear here, it looks like Dad "rents" his daughter's body for a long time. <br /> <br /> However, after almost rape and attack on this man by breaking up a bottle of beer his skull, Barbara has enough and goes to the big city. It does not hurt that it still broke out and killed my father, but her sense of being silly and having nothing to show turned out to be a stimulus to move. <br /> <br /> Despite depression, Barbara uses sex to get a job in a huge megabank. He starts in quite a fighting job as a receptionist, but in just a few weeks he sleeps his way from one job to another, until he sleeps with the head of the bank and his future son-in-law !!! All this ends in a tragedy, but Babs does not seem too shocked by the death of these two men. In fact, some time later, he is able to enter NEW CEO's life and once again he is at the top (perhaps in a more than one way). <br /> <br /> So far, this is a great movie because it was so rough and contrite. Barbara played a 100% sociopath - a woman without morals and without conscience - just a desire to squeeze out of life as much as she could, no matter who hurts in the process. However, the brave writers and the producer "snorted" and believed that it was important to assign the ending of redemption. Considering that this woman was so angry and promiscuous, her change of heart at the end was a great disappointment and weakened the film. In many respects, this reminded me of the end of JEZEBEL - as once a wicked man "sees the light" and changes a very convincing conclusion. <br /> <br /> My advice is: try to see the RED-HEAD WOMAN and SHELVES. RED-HEADED WOMAN is very similar to BABY FACE, but at the end there is no magical transformation - the main lady is really skunk! In DOWNSTAIRS, a movie very similar to the RED-HEADED WOMAN, the roles are reversed, and the man (John Gilbert) plays a similar figure. Both are classic and a bit better than this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is an amazing work of a short period of often very dingy Hollywood movies and in this light it's worth seeing it for Cinephiles. Also the fans of The Duke pay attention - John Wayne plays a very small role in the film and very rarely you can see a very young Wayne playing such a conventional role.
