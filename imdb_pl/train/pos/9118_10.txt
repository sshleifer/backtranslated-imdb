I saw this movie with a special show of Owen Alik Shahadah's work. It's interesting where this guy comes from. Now he is probably the most important independent African filmmaker in the world. And I'm not talking about black filmmakers here. I'm talking about filmmakers rooted in culture. The idea, if it testifies to the diversity and diversity of African themes, with his film 500 years later is an African question. But Idea does not fit this form. Shows artistic diversity. The film is entirely African, but the theme is a human subject that most of us can relate to. I just love this gentle comedy. And Bark Tunde Jegede is simply amazing, it's a real gem.
