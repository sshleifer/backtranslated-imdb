It is a slow movie, slowly building up the story of a former stripper who begins a new family life with a complete stranger. The viewer slowly feels that something is wrong here ... <br /> <br /> I really loved this movie, even though it finally leaves a bitter taste. He is smart, well-composed and works very well. Both Philippe Toretton and Emmannuelle Seigner are deeply interested in their characters. <br /> <br /> The little son "pierrot" is also very moving. <br /> <br /> a thriller that does not seem like that. A very unconventional movie, a very special atmosphere throughout the film, although a few scenes can cause you trouble. <br /> <br /> I'll give him 8/10 !!
