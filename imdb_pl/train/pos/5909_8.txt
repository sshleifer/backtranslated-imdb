I remember when I was five and my parents thought it was just an animated movie ... except when the bras and bullets started flying. I must agree that this movie will make everyone and everyone get angry because it is discriminating against everyone and everyone ... but the truth is that it's funny as hell, it's deep. I recommend it to anyone who likes iconic classics. Also try Fritz, cat and NINE Lives Fritz Cat. If I'm right, Ralph Bashki did the movie too. It's about a cat that's going through hard times with family, streets, work, etc. When I was old enough, I rented all these movies. Because Coonskin was an offensive title in that era, he was also labeled Street Fighter. Ralph Bashki also did Cool World with the participation of the very young Brad Pitt. Heavy traffic was another cartoon that concerned the street life of a young man.
