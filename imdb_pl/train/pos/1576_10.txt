It was a great movie. How these women tried to save their husbands. I thought the actors' performances were great. For a long time I had to think about the movie. I think every student should see this movie so that they can think about war, relationships, friendship and love. I liked the movie because he said and showed me how strong love can be. I would like to be as strong as a woman. I really liked it because he told me about relationships and that's what I like to watch in the movie. I think you can compare the film with the Der Untergang pianist. If you combine these three films, you will have a great view of what happened during the war. We should remember something like war forever.
