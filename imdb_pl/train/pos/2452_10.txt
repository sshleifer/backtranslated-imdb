It's a good concert and I find it funny. In the end, bad Latin stereo types are over! ¡Gracias, Señor Lopez! I love this program and started watching it about three months ago. The whole concept of the Latin television series really amazed me. I'm surprised that Latinos finally have good pictures to watch on TV. This program is probably one of the best I've seen, it's funny, nice, touchy and nice.
