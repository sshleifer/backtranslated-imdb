My brother and I have Pokemon 4Ever on DVD. We watched it several times and it was the best. Too Bad It A New Pokemon did not talk this time. I'm getting used to it. <br /> <br /> The iron masked marauder was quite mean when he caught Celebi with his dark ball. Good Thing Ash and Sam managed to get him out of control. <br /> <br /> Finally, only one song ended. His name is Cele-BRATE by Russell Velazquez. <br /> <br /> Pokemon 4Ever He was successful because three previous films and people will always love this movie.
