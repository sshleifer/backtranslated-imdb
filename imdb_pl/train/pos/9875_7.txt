The presentation of Lily Mars (MGM, 1943) is a charming film, but in my opinion it could have been better. Judy Garland is great as usual, but some scenes in the movie seem out of place, and the romance between her and Van Heflin is growing too fast. <br /> <br /> I mean, she's ready to beat her ass one minute, but she falls in love with her the next minute. I believe that this production, film editing and script (although the photography was great, the scenery was nice, and the costumes also nice) could have been a bit better. It seems that the production was too hasty. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast was also good, especially the little Janet Chapman as the second youngest daughter daughter Rosie. At the age of 11, she looks really cute and it's a shame she did not turn into a teenage cartoon actress. It's a lot better in this movie than in previous movies like Warner Brothers in the late 1930s (except Broadway Musketeers 1938, it's really good in it) when they tried to make it a hybrid of Shirley Temple / Sybil Jason. In general, this movie could be better, but in the end Judy did her best.
