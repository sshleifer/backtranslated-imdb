If I just saw the pilot of this series, I would rate it at 10. I immediately became interested in this wonderful new world. The next episodes did not fully fulfill the promise, but I will observe and I hope that it will get better and better. The production values ​​are amazing and the operation is of the highest quality. It does not bother me that it does not fit perfectly into BSG, because I am so intrigued by the premise and let's face it, these are two different shows. I am excited that both Esai Morales and one of my all time, Eric Stoltz, have returned to my life (even once a week) because I missed both of them. It's a program that requires a bit of thought from the audience and it's always a good thing. In a sense, you have to cover some aspects of the series; things are not always what they seem, and certainly there are shades of gray, both literally and figuratively, in feature lines, characters and of course different virtual worlds. We all know how it ends, but the journey looks like a great ride.
