Wonderful costumes by Edith Head, who painted them on Liz Taylor at its best! <br /> <br /> SFX are very good for a movie of his age, and stunt doubles looked like actors, even to the type of body, a rarity in the movies of this year. <br /> <br /> A cozy movie with amazing panoramas - even after cutting into panoramas and scanning.
