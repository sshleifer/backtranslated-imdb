"GEORGE LOPEZ", in my opinion, is an absolute classic ABC! I have not seen every episode, but I still like it. There are many episodes that I liked. One of them was that Amy (Sandra Bullock) entered a mobile machine. If you want to know why, you have to see it yourself. Before I discuss this, I would like to say that everyone always gave a good performance, the project was spectacular, the costumes were well designed, and the writing was always very strong. In summary, although you can now see new episodes, I definitely recommend catching them in case they disappear from the air for good.
