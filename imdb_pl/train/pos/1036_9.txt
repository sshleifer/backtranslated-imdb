Watch on the Rhine is one of the best anti-Nazi propaganda films created during World War II. Paul Lukas certainly deserved an Oscar. Bette Davis shines great as a great actress and the beauty she was. I recommend this film to people interested in this era and, of course, the fantastic films of the late, great, Mrs. Bette Davis.
