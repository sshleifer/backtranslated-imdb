I have a six-month-old child at home and fights very badly from time to time. One morning she had a special difficulty sleeping when the song Doodle Bops appeared in T.V. She stopped crying almost immediately, and the rest of the series was happy. I sat in her flexible chair and watched her kick her legs, waving her hands and laughing at the performance. He entertained her and enjoyed her all the time. I also got a film so that sometimes when my toddler is upset, I have something to calm her down. It's true that late at night, when he wakes up with a colic to stir the doodle, they are not her cup of tea, but it will be useful when I need some time to do housework, etc. The biggest surprise in this case is that my child does not even like watching TV She would rather be on the floor playing with a toy or our little play box than watching T.V. I do not know if she will still like them in the future, but for now she is attached.
