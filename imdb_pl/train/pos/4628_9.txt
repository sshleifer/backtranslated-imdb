One of the best parts of Sundance is watching movies that you will almost certainly miss. If you're not a true admirer of art, you probably do not catch a lot of documentary films. Only a handful gets any recognizable distribution. Fortunately, Sundance has increased its commitment to documentary films in recent years. <br /> <br /> Shakespeare Behind Bars is a powerful documentary about the dramatic production group at the Luther Luckett Correctional Complex in LaGrange, Kentucky. Each year a group of prisoners presents Shakespearean art. Director Hank Rogerson and his team follow the band because roles are chosen independently, interpreted, practiced and ultimately performed. <br /> <br /> The film is full of fascinating revelations for those of us who were not exposed to prison conditions. Despite the labels we know (convict, criminal, murderer, etc.), we soon began to appreciate and respect these people as thinking people. Interestingly, the art chosen for the year of filming was Burza, with its keen focus on forgiveness and redemption. All actors are struggling with the meaning of art in their lives, finding patterns and similarities with their characters and the meaning of the drama. <br /> <br /> For a documentary, like a book, the best we can hope for is that we will experience something that will change our lives. Shakespeare's bars were a personal revelation to me. "For a brave new world that has such creatures in it."
