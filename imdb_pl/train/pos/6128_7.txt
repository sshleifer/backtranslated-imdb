Yes, it's a B-class horror. But at least the producers, directors and cast do not pretend that this movement is manna from heaven. The plot is a banal, psychotic serial killer on the way to the execution is sprayed with a genetic acid that changes it into a snow man. Snowman a.k.a. Jack Frost then murders to find the sheriff in a small town who eventually arrested him. With a limited budget, the crew had to deal with limited special effects, most of the money seems to spend on a snowman costume. Small difficult shots are managed by comics or distant shots (shots in which the camera moves away to hide details). <br /> <br /> This is not a movie for children and should not be confused with the Disney movie of the same title. If you do not let your children watch pg-13 movies alone, parents should not let their children watch this movie. This film has two claims to fame. 1. Beautiful Shannon Elizabeth (American Pie) made her first major role in the film. The scene in which Jack Frost attacks Shannon Elizabeth is worth watching a few times. 2. This movie has the worst joke of a snowman. The joke is so bad that the directors attribute the credit list to the cashier.
