Must see for everyone who loves photography. stunning and breathtaking, it leaves you in icy weather. I saw it twice in the cinema and now on the DVD. it's good on DVD, but it was something different on the big screen. <br /> <br /> I took two daughters to see it, and they loved it, my oldest one cried at the end. But she wanted to see it tonight, when she saw it in the video store. It is well said about how easy it is to say about the child's love for nature, and especially about the fox. in some respects it reminded me of a bear who told a story, not a document. which works very well for children. it is very important that we should not be preached. You are developing your own mind. <br /> <br /> But the stars of this movie are the operators, how they did what they did. amazing just amazing.
