This is probably one of Brian De Palma's best-known films, but this is not his best. Body Double, The Fury and Carrie are better movies, but this movie is better than Blow Out and Obsession. De Palma is heavily influenced by Hitchcock, and this film is a start for Psycho. Angie Dickinson is a bored housewife who thinks about a love affair, and after her psychiatrist, Michael Caine, rejects the offer, Dickinson meets a man in an art gallery and she sleeps with him. After this point, it's best not to know what's going on, but there's a murder and Nancy Allen is a girl who looks at the killer. Dennis Franz is a detective in a case that really does not trust Allen and must find the murderer herself. It's a pretty good movie, but it's not the best De Palma movie.
