This movie is amazing for several reasons. Harris makes an unusually awkward document and turns him into appropriate social commentary. Groovin 'Gary is a small town that is (assumed) very popular because of its many incarnations. When he decides to play Olivia Newton John in a local talent show (for which he is very passionate), Gary's actions show that he is in conflict with the conservative social environment in which he lives. It causes that he makes various justifications for his actions so that people do not think that he is actually a transvestite or other social outcast. In the second installment, Harris uses the struggles of Gary and Beaver in a novice attempt to narrate the original document. The third and final part of the trilogy is really amazing for Harris's extreme sensitivity on the subject. In contrast to the second part, "The Orkly Kid" shows Gary as a truly restless character. He tries unsuccessfully to get acceptance in his own community. His secret passion for dressing up like Olivia Newton John further distances him from people who consider him a social outcast. The film is so realistically presented that, like reality, it is suitable for many reactions. Certainly you can see Gary as a ridiculously pathetic hero, but he can also identify with him as an outcast.
