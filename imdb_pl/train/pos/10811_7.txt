This movie will take you to a different time when there was a different pace in everyday life. We have an idea of ​​how families had to deal with the war and how quickly we sent young men to fight. A very moving look into the past and a reminder that victims of war do not happen only on the front. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, many of us have never had to go through what our great-grandparents, grandparents or parents passed during the war. I think this movie is a small thank you. Peter Outerbridge looks amazing as young Peter O'Toole and Russell Crowe, who is absolutely charming and can be Australian. It's definitely worth listening to while reciting "High Flight" and wonders what he can do with Shakespeare.
