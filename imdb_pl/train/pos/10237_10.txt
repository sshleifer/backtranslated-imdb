This is one of the best films that came out of the "New Wave" of Hong Kong, which began with "ZU: Warriors of Magic Mountain" by Tsui Harka. Tsui set the tone for New Wave's approach to the martial arts film that almost all the directors of the New Wave (Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, Wong Jing, Ching Siu Tung, etc.) have adopted as a given; namely, the approach to such films from now on would require more than a little bit of irony, if not even comedy. "Burning Paradise" put an end to this and revenge. <br /> <br /> It's not that there is no humor here; but it's purely human humor, like an age-old Buddhist priest at first, who somehow deals with a young prostitute, hiding in a bundle of straw. But it is like people, even Buddhist priests can not be saints all the time. <br /> <br /> When irony finally appears in the film, it is the worst possible, emanating from the "abbot" Red Lotus Temple, which is a study of pure nihilism, which has never been recorded on film before. He is the incarnation of Satan Milton from "Paradise Lost": "It's better to rule in hell than to serve in heaven!" And if he does not reach Satan's hell shortly, he will turn the world around him into a hell that he can rule. <br /> <br /> This motif emphasizes the brutal violence of most of the pictures here: It's not like the abbot wants to kill people only; he wants them to despair, they feel completely hopeless, to accept his nihilism as an overwhelming reality. In this way, in the scenes of the Red Temple pervades a particular sense that beyond the Temple itself there may be no other reality - it has become all that exists in the universe, and the Abbot, claiming that he has the mastery of infinite power, is responsible. br /> <br /> Of course, the film does not end there. Although there are losses, in the end the human will overcomes being an ordinary man. (If you want to know how, see the movie!) However, there is no doubt that watching this movie, we visit hell. We hope that we are not witnesses of our consequences; but we certainly feel scorned by this experience - and somehow better for him.
