I grew up on Doc Savage and became stoned by green death as a child, but even then, as now, I think it is very funny. , admitting that they mostly think I'm weird, but you're there. "I do not know what Doc is about, but he always gets girls" must be the final line when you look at his sad group of men. This movie is a classic parody of the whole genre of superheroes and it was well ahead of time, not to be taken seriously, to move around after Austin Powers. Ron Ely is God. It is a pity that this movie was not released on DVD in the UK. I do not think it's been reworked and bastardized, as I said it's classic, you can not do it without Ron (like Italian work without Mini and Michael Caine). I give it 10/10.
