Butch the Peememaker? Apparently. After the violent beginnings with Spike, Tom and Jerry waving at each other, Butch triggers a stop and wants to know why. That's a good question. <br /> <br /> "Cats can get along with dogs, right?" Tom asks, who nods in agreement. "Mice can get along with cats, right?" Jerry nods "no" and then he sees that this is not the right answer. <br /> <br /> They go in and Butch makes a "peace treaty" (along with professional graphics!). Most of the rest and most of the comics are three of them that are very nice to each other. What a refreshing change of pace. I was pleased to watch. I can have a million of these cartoons in which everyone beats each other. <br /> <br /> In any case, you knew that the room would not last. A large piece of steak means the death of the "peace treaty", but on the way it was a nice change and still had some clever humor Tom & Jerry.
