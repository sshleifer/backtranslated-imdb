This is one of my favorite films, PERIOD. I can not come up with another movie that combines so many nice movie features like this one. This movie has it all: Action, Adventure, Science Fiction, Good vs. Bad, and even Romance (without even an innocent "peck" on the cheek between Pazu and Sheeta). Perhaps it's best that you do not have to be in the Mensie to "get" and enjoy the movie, as with other Miyazaki movies (I do not know about you, but I watch movies to rest thinking). It's just a nice movie that will appeal to everyone, so do yourself a favor and buy it. The only sour note is American Dubbing. I think Vander-Geek is just annoying. But everything is not lost, the original Japanese version is on the set with two discs and it's spinning! Who cares if you do not understand spoken language? If you can read at the second-class level, watch the original Japanese recording with English subtitles. You will not regret.
