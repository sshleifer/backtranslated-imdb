In response to the person who commented on how the film is drawn and who believed that the role of brother Jess makes no sense here, my answer: <br /> <br /> The role of brother Jess lies in providing a form of dramatic irony in history. Craig Sheffer / Norman could have foreseen the problems of a full life, looking at how Jess's brother turned out. There are different cases in which Brad Pitt and his life run parallel, for example, when Brother Jess takes Craig Sheffer to a chaotic bar and later finds Brad Pitt there a few days later. The dramatic irony was that the character of Craig Sheffer would have more emotional distress at the death of the brothers, knowing that he could do more to prevent it and then create a more convincing mood in the film.
