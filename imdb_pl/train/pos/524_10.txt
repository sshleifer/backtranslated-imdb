I saw this movie years ago on TV late at night. In those days he won the title of "Stairway to Heaven". Already as a young boy, I remember that I was deeply moved by history and amazed by the visual effects of the trial (those who saw that they knew what I was talking about). Such imagination! The perfect combination of romance, drama, humor and fantasy, this movie is right there, with the biggest classics ever made: Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Gone with the Wind. This film is very highly rated by IMDB voters and rightly - over 51% of voters rated it 10 out of 10; over 84% rated it as 8 or more in 10th. I was surprised that it was not on the list of the 250 best films until I realized that few saw / rated this movie compared to those on the list. What a pity. I hope this movie will be released on DVD for Region 1 (North America), so 1), I can buy it and 2), others will discover this hidden treasure.
