TV reporter in Los Angeles Jennifer (beautiful Barbara Bach from "The Spy Who Loved Me") and her two assistants Karen (attractive Karen Lamm) and Vicki (pretty Lois Young, who not only gets killed first, but also reveals her delicious bod in a tasty, unpaid naked bath scene), go to Solvang, California, to take part in the annual Danish festival. Because all the local hotels are booked, three charming ladies are forced to look for a room and board in the elegant but bad atmosphere of a distant mansion belonging to the bizarre Ernest Keller (deliciously played to scientific perfection by late, great Sydney Lassick) and his gentle sister Virginia (solid Lelia Goldoni). Unfortunately, Keller has one very nasty and deadly secret of a family living in his humid cellar: agile, pathetic, hooded, born from an incest Mongoloid male child named Junior (alternately moving and frightening portrait of Stephen Furst; Flounder in "Animal House" " ), which naturally relaxes and wreaks havoc. Directed by Danny Steinmann, with a consistently good cast from a strong cast, captivating plot, Craig Reardon's perfect make-up, a terribly frightening atmosphere, a wonderfully wild climax, slow but steady pace, nice well-drawn characters and a surprisingly groundbreaking final freeze frame ( the topic of incest contains an unexpectedly strong and moving blow), this unjustly overlooked psycho sleeping in the early 1980s is worth checking out.
