Rock 'n' Roll High School was one of the best films ever! I think the only reason he was so amazing was The Ramones! You could not do the same movie and put something like Sex Pistols or The Clash in place of The Ramones, it would not be the same. dey young, clint howard, Vincent Van Patten, Mary Woronov, Paul Bartel and fitters from the room, just added to the movie. The whole movie is about The Ramones ... especially Joey! So everyone showed that Rock 'n' Roll High School, if you're a big fan of real PUNK. Do not mumbles new nonsense ... but loud and fast. The only thing Ramones could do. R.I.P (Rest In Peace) Joey Ramone 1951-2001. Dee Dee Ramone 1952-2002!
