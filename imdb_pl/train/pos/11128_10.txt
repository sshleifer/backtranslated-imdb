First, let me say how great. It is amazing and sometimes shocking. At least I'm 11 years old and this is my favorite movie, I can definitely become a boring movie, but it's not boring. It is like a journey through humanity. His raw realism manifests itself in this monumental masterpiece. It is a painful story about two and outers (VOIGHT AND Hoffman) who build mutual friendship. Joe Buck (VOIGHT), a naive Texan stud, arrives in New York to enrich him by entertaining women. Soon he meets Rico "RATSO" Rizzo (HOFFMAN), who is a poor man who is barely able to pay the rent. Ratso becomes "manager" Joe, but soon both men can not find a job Joe, which leads to the theft of food. When you try to survive on the streets of New York, we realize how difficult it is. They can not make Joe a girlfriend until they meet a woman at the party. Joe earns a little and soon Joe takes Ratso to his dream location in Florida. The last five minutes are a breakthrough in the heart and at the same time one of the biggest moments in the film. FROM THE NORTHERN RAILWAY we get a raw and sometimes disturbing urban view of life.
