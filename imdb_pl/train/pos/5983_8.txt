I saw this movie for the first time as a teenager. It was a time when the world was ruled by heavy metal. Trick Or Treat has every element of the film that rock. With a cast that includes Skippy from Family Ties, Gene Simmons of Kiss and Ozzy Osbourne as Preacher, how can you go wrong? Reverse bad messages played on vinyl! Yes, that's right, they use the records in this movie. In one scene, Eddie (Skippy) listens to messages from a bad rock star on his record player when they start doing terribly. Monsters begin to come out of his speakers, and his stereo becomes possessed. As a teenager, I tried to play back my recordings, hoping that it would happen. Almost 20 years later, Trick Or Treat is still one of my favorite movies.
