The first movie ever made. Employees coming from the factory, some are cycling, most of them are walking, moving to the right or left. Together with Melies, Lumieres are both a starting point and a starting point for the cinema - with Melies, the narrative plot, cinema, fantasy, artificiality and spectacle begin; with pure Lumieres, no ornaments, no observations. Truth. There are many intellectuals who regret the ossification of cinema from the latter to the tired formulas of the former. <br /> <br /> But I think it's short again. There is nothing "objective" about it. The film is full of action - static, inhuman scene comes to life, activity, and the calm harmony of the frame is torn, decanted from the back to the right or left (but never, of course, in the front, where the camera). And yet the camera stands still, contains energy, possible diversion, subordinates it to its will. A cinematograph can be a revolutionary invention, but it will be used for conservative purposes - for mapping the world, editing, limiting it, limiting it. <br /> <br /> the historical reality of the film is worse. These factory employees are Lumiere employees. The bosses are spying on their workers, an invisible eye about his nameless servants. The film thus describes two types of imprisonment. Behind the gate workers are locked in their workplace. Opening the gate seems to be a picture of freedom, escape, but they face another wall, the fourth wall, limiting them even more. The first film is also the first example of CCTV surveillance, the image of an invisible, omniscient authority closing its servants. A frightening, too prophetic movie.
