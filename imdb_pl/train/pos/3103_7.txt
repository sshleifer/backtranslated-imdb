"Maybe we can organize a meeting." "Where are you now?" "I am in my office." "I doubt it." "Why would you doubt it?" "If you were in your office now, we would talk face to face. <br /> <br /> Bourne remains street and elusive. Only his inhuman resistance leads the film a little too far into fantasy. The conversation is macho, to the extent that only fragments of bubby Bond humor. Everything about the action. <br /> <br /> The feeling that something is happening at a different level in the world we live in is what the trilogy combines so well. The scene in Waterloo with the Guardian journalist does it with great effect. There is no meeting of worlds - you are in it or simply unnecessary body. <br /> <br /> If the shaky camera does not bother you too much, enjoy this movie and hope it will somehow keep the franchise.
