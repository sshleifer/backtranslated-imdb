I must say that I wanted to see this movie for a long time and I was not disappointed. Dominik Monaghan's acting is simply fantastic. As part of my insomnia, I can refer to how this story develops. I have never experienced anything like it, but some awakened moments coincide with sleep and can be frightening. It was a great movie, worth every penny. I hope that one day I will be able to work with Tess, it would be an honor and not only. I can recommend it to everyone. Maybe not small children, because they can be scared. But if you are sleepless like me, you will understand the world, secrets and fear. You will love it. <br /> <br /> F.
