The Woman in Black (1989) is a TV adaptation of the modern classic tale of the ghosts of Susan Hill, published only a few years earlier than the film. Unfortunately, this movie was not released on DVD, and as far as I know, it was removed to VHS. Its availability is in direct contrast to its popularity among horror writers. The story revolves around events in the coastal community at the beginning of the 20th century, where his lawyer is sent by his company to end the case of a recently deceased widow who died in her isolated swampy area. What he considered a routine and probably tedious task turns into a nightmare, when he discovers that the old woman was haunted by death and that the spirits of her past are not satisfied with the rest. The story is told in a subtle but concise way, it is never indulgent, loud or overly exposed. Undoubtedly, a tight budget could have contributed to a senseless approach, but this is exactly what history needs and why it works so well. What you can not see scares. Having said that, there is one particularly frightening scene that is based on graphics and works to perfection. I watched the movie during the day, and it still gave me nightmares almost a week later. If you like being scared, do what you need to get and see a copy of "Women in Black."
