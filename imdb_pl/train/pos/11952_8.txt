Scoop *** with **** Woody Allen is definitely not my favorite director, but I liked Match Point. It was a great thriller about romantic darkness, which fortunately did not play Woody Allen. He had a beautiful Scarlett Johansson inside. <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is Woody Allen's latest film and although it appears in it, it's OK. It also includes Scarlett Johansson, and they both work together well. <br /> <br /> Johansson plays Sondra Pransky, a young college journalist. Joe heard a flamethrower on the boat with a grim reaper and a group of other souls the Reaper picked up. One of these souls is the secretary of Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). Joe says Peter can be a serial killer on the streets of England. Joe with the measure of his life returns to the living and transmits this information to Sondra during a magical act. Sondra is on some magical show with Magician Sid Waterman (Woody Allen.) She becomes a volunteer to enter the disappearing box and, when in a box, receives a visit from Joe. Not knowing what to do, he uses Sid Waterman's help to help him deal with this matter. <br /> <br /> This movie has a pleasant, light feeling compared to "Match Point", and yet it works. Johansson and Allen work great together. Allen's humor fits perfectly with this story and role. Hugh Jackman is great as Peter Layman, the "suspect" serial killer. <br /> <br /> This is a funny video to see if you're ever looking for it. The cast team works well together, and history goes on and sometimes you forget that watching Woody Allen is yourself. I say give it a chance because you might like it.
