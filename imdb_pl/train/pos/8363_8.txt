This is one of Edgar Wallace's best classic movies from the German series - it contains all the basics for a very pleasant Wallace criminal film from the 1960s: Although his majesty, Mr. Kinski, is missing, you still have the young Joachim 'Blacky' Fuchsberger, appearing once again as a typical clever American "womanizer", he has a young Eddie Arendt in his best (and equally typical) role in history - a cool, sophisticated British butler - and you have (not so young already) Lowitz as melancholy, but very " dry "ironic (and therefore: very funny) policeman. What's more, behind the mask of the frog you will get a weird and very dingy "evil guy" (hence the title of the movie!), You will get a crazy, noisy soundtrack, classic movie action scenes b, partially filmed the wildest perspectives (please recall the time of its creation!), Screaming screams queens, and so on ... All these ingredients are shaken in the sweet cocktail of pure German Edgar Wallace campyness - highly recommended !!
