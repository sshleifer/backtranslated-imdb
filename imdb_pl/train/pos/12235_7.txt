"The Incredible Melting Man" is a fantastic, kitschy and energetic Z-class production, which every self-respecting freak from the camp must just see for yourself! The perfect way to describe this low-budget jewel from the '70s is like the shameless copy of Hammer's "The Quatermass Xperiment" ... only a thousand times as dirty! Astronaust Steve West is the only survivor of a catastrophic space mission, but he is the carrier of a terrible disease that makes him radioactive and ... causes him to melt! In shock after seeing his face in the mirror (can you blame him?), Steve jumps out of the hospital, leaving a trail of sticky oil and falling body parts in the back. Doctor Ted Nelson must urgently find him because this disease causes Steve to have an insatiable appetite for the human body. The premise may sound stupid, but this move is extremely funny and has great makeup effects from Rick Baker's hands. The face of a melting guy looks like a rotting pizza, and his heavy breathing makes it sound like Darth Vader! Another big advantage is that the script by William Sachs does not waste time on painstaking scientific explanations or emotional speeches. Repulsion starts right away and lasts until the last moment of the movie. Just enjoy this stupid gem of horror and try to disable your brain activity as much as you can because if you start to consider a lot of foolishness in the script, you'll miss out on campus fun!
