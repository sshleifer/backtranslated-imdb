There were far too few mainstream films in post-colonial Africa, and the ones they have are mixed up. This, with its altruistic pretensions to reveal slavery in the 1970s, shows Africa's best and worst values, which do not turn out to be too different from the value of all humanity. It also has disadvantages, given the excessive influence of Western African concepts, especially Arabs. <br /> <br /> Dr. Anansa Linderby, a beautiful African-American wife of the English doctor David Linderby, is captured by Arab slave traders, along with a teenage girl from Sanufu and a young boy. The main slave trader, Suleiman, is Arabic on stage, with his flowery and sometimes humorous rhetoric and gestures to match - which would not be out of place in "Carry On Follow this Camel", but these are not the standard standards the film deserves. Peter Ustinov, of course, had more than enough skill to deal with some of the shortcomings of the script, and saved what could otherwise have been a pathetic one-dimensional figure. <br /> <br /> Continuing the stereotypical theme, all three Arab employees of Suleiman are unintelligent, and one has pedophile tendencies to the boy, which fortunately are not presented on the screen. <br /> <br /> One of David's first connections is a local policeman, a stereotypical pompous and incompetent African bureaucrat. David then meets with two stereotypical white ex-pats, an Englishman (Walker, played by Rex Harrison) and an American (Sandell, played by William Holden). Sandell is a mercenary with "conventional" views about mixed-race relationships that initially refuse help, unless David provides payment in advance. Cursed by David's love for Anansa and aware of his inability to find love, he agrees to take David to the helicopter to help find Anansa. They believe that Suleiman and his prisoners cross the border and are not able to pursue them in the neighboring territory - as a result of Sandell's hesitation and David's lack of firearms, his helicopter is shot down, but David survives. <br /> <br /> Then we see David introduced to Malik (Kabir Bedi), an African who lost his family to Suleiman, and now he is only vengeful. They find a girl of Sanufu with a group of Tuaregs and know that they are on the right track to find Suleiman. <br /> <br /> In one of the most heart-rending scenes, they kill a group of slavers only to find it was not a group of Suleiman and had no choice but to send their prisoners to the Tuaregs they had met before. <br /> <br /> Later, we discovered that the raped boy is a shaman and a perfect scene with supernatural undertones, he uses his knowledge to kill one of Suleyman's followers. Anansa - and despite the boy's skepticism - manages to develop the collapse of two other Suleiman employees. <br /> <br /> At this time Suleiman and his slaves are within a few days of entering the slave market. /> <br /> Suleiman, now undoubtedly Anansa is "trouble", trying to sell her obscenely rich Arab prince (Omar Sharif), who is corrupt but intelligent. Realizing that Anansa is an American working for NN, the prince rather unwisely decides to continue negotiations without taking into account the consequences. The scene in which two men haggle is one of the best in the film. <br /> <br /> In a slave market, a young boy is sold to a middle-aged German pedophile, and we must guess whether the boy will still be considered a "wunderbar" when his owner ends his witch skills. <br /> <br /> David and Malik finally confront Suleiman and are bitterly sweet at Malik's point of view. <br /> <br /> Finally, David and Anansa are reunited again, and Malik, whose life is in ruin, can comfort himself seeing the task he has done. <br /> <br /> The overall plot of the film is excellent but loses its importance due to the stereotypical representation of almost all major characters. The loan must be addressed to all leading actors who have dealt with many scripting disadvantages.
