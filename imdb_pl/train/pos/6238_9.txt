An uncompromising look at the suburb of the 21st century Vienna mixing the stories of six groups of heroes by a former author of documents U.Seidl is a provocative, minimalist and intense piece of observation cinema. <br /> <br /> After the global dissemination of Big Brother reality shows, Hundstage takes contemporary voyeurism to a disturbing, deep level. Difficult to believe, but the inconspicuous work of European artistic cinema may seem cruel and dingy, and at the same time boasts the nihilistic alienation of modern society in a glorious manner. <br /> <br /> A must for lovers of world cinema.
