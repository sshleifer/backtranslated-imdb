I felt this movie - all the time. I was impressed by Russell Crowe's talent to develop his relationship with Lillie, a typical Australian blend of a mildly soft approach, somewhat self-sufficient and very persistent. I really loved photos and direction. Pace was right, and the performances of almost all the characters were impressive. <br /> <br /> Wow, or Russell's talent even in 1993. He did not shine! ... and I have not seen Gladiator yet.
