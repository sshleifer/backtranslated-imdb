I was looking for this movie in a typical fan obsession. I wanted to check it out. I did not expect anything. After all, a musician, actor and screenwriter? It is not possible for so many talents to live in one person. Well?? <br /> <br /> Wrong! Apart from obsession, she quickly became one of my favorites! The plot and characters are not lost in the typical Hollywood special effects. History kidnaps your emotions and draws you. As the subtitles appear, you suddenly realize that you've been glued to the end. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the game seems a bit exaggerated. I think, however, that this is done with a comedy intent and a very fit character. Otherwise, I would not expect the level of acting to be a witness. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing more than once. I feel that I am laughing hysterically or impatiently catching my breath on something that I have missed, or forgot about it the first time. <br /> <br /> I totally recommend this movie. You have doubts, but I'm sure he will find a place on your shelf.
