Of all the breakdance / hip-hop movies released between 1983 and 1986, Beat Street's 1984 film is without a doubt the best. The story follows a DJ, his younger breakdance brother, a graffiti artist and a failed promoter of show business for one winter in which they try to break free from the ghetto, using their "street" talent. Acting is not always equal and the characters are not fully drawn, but they are more than compensated by mundane dialogue, credible history, fantastic dance sequences and the timeless soundtrack of hip-hop. It should be noted that this movie was shot at the birthplace of breakdance ("This is not New York, this is the Bronx!") And has performances by breakdance fathers, Rock Steady Crew dance troupe and rapper Afrika Bambaat. Rock Steady Crew is the best scene in the movie, when they dominate in the dance battle in Roxy, a breakdance club from the early 80's. Must see hip-hop lovers.
