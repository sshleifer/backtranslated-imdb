I watched the movie over 100-200 times and I love it every time I watch it. Yes, it can be very trivial, but it is also very funny and enjoyable. The camp shown in the movie is a real camp in which I participated for 7 years and is really presented as a camp, a great place to spend the summer. Anyone who has ever gone to a camp, wanted to go to a camp or sent a child to the camp, should see this movie, because it will bring great memories for you and your children.
