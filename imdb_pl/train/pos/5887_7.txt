So Mary and Rhoda were aging - who was not? I was a teenager when Mary premiered, and a "young adult" when he left the air. Yes, it was great to see Mary and Rho together, and yes, maybe the movie did not support the comedy from the original series, but there were enough moments to remind the spirit of the series to make this tribute right. Example: A producer who employs Mary and then dictates an idea for a new series on "old people". Is not this typical of the mentality of modern Hollywood bean and television counters? It may not be THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW at its best - but it's a hell of a good look at one of the best concerts we've grown up in the '70s.
