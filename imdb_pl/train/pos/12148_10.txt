This movie has many comedies, not dark ones, and Gordon Liu shines in this. He displays his comic page and it was really strange to see how he was beaten. His training is "unorthodox" and who would have thought that tying knots could be so deadly? Many great stunts and choreography. Very creative! <br /> <br /> Add Johnny Wang in the mix and you have an amazing final game! Do not mess with the Manchu bandits; they are ruthless!
