Honestly, when I saw this movie years ago, I immediately wanted to turn it off. When I sat there for about 10 minutes, I realized that the actor playing Navina had stolen the show. His mimicry and comic attitude make him shake his head, why he was not in more comedies. He has "Martha Feldman" for him, but ALMOST, MUCH more talent ... he does not take anything away from Marty. The film really shocked me how close the original Jerk was, but on the other hand it was MORE MORE. I really think that if this movie was released first, and I saw Steve Martin's movie in second place, I thought that the second one was cheap. I know it sounds like BOLD, but it's true. I really like Steve Martin, but his performance is second in relation to the actor in The Jerk Too. I would like to get a copy of this in my collection. I urge you to see it if you find it.
