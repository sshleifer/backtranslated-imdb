I must admit that, despite Angels in the Outfield, it's a pretty good movie. I like it, as it teaches children, how to always have faith and never give up, because miracles can happen. Unlike other baseball movies, this one particular movie stood out because of its amazing special effects and well-arranged soundtrack, which was very interesting. Although I liked the movie, it had some drawbacks, such as lack of self-confidence (ie In the end, when Ray Mitchell hits homer, he does not get on the plate, so it would not be a result, but it's just boring.) I I must say that I was really impressed by the presence and morality of this film: just have faith, do not give up.
