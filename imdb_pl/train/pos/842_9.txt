Matador is a witty, dark and tense melodrama that rises above mediocrity thanks to two very engaging and passionate performances by Pierce Brosnan, who has never been better than here, and always reluctant Greg Kinnear, who has his best role playing the gay neighbor Jack Nicholson in As Good As It Gets. A big plus is writing. Clever and sometimes very nasty dialogue is provided with enthusiasm by Brosnan, and the slow friendship between these two different people is completely convincing. History has a few unexpected turns and makes the viewer constantly guess where he will go. <br /> <br /> Nice artistic touches of the director, such as good use of music, clever editing and some unconventional photos sometimes set a nice tone of the movie and for a long time you do not quite know how to mark a movie. But it is also thanks to a very well written script that keeps the viewer (me and so) on the edge of your seat.
