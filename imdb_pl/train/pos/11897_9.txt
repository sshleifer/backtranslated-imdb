It's a nice little horror movie that fans of indie movies will appreciate. He has good acting, lots of blood and a decent story. Films like The Hills Have Eyes and Pumpkinhead are similar. It's obvious that the budget was not so big, but the movie really makes up for it with the atmosphere and solid performances of actors who seem to be missing in many of today's large budget effects films. The film really moves and is the perfect direction and good camera work. There are no wasted scenes, so the length of the movie is a bit short. In addition, it seems that the ending leaves open to the sequel, which would be very interesting. So, take some popcorn, turn off the lights and enjoy it.
