I never watched the movie and enjoyed the singing and dancing of Cagney and other cast members, namely: Dick Powell (Scott Blair), who had a great tenor voice and Ruby Keeler (Bea Thorn). James Cagney plays the role of Chester Kent, who writes musicals and ultimately deals with the production of Prologues, which are shown between the feature films shown in the cinema in the 1930s. Chester is in trouble with people who are trying to steal his ideas for his performances. It's a very funny movie with lots of comedy and lots of laughter. Joan Blondell (Nan Prescott) gave a great supporting role, who was also very young and pretty. Dick Powell was great as a singer and dancer and was just starting his long and successful career on screen. Enjoy.
