I have never danced flamenco before, but somehow I feel that this movie was perfect. Colors, how bright were the dances, Gypsies and all rivals put together made a movie that seemed to end too early. I've seen other films by Carlos Saura and I agree that this movie may be his best production. I believe that the best features of his previous films have been combined and adapted to the creation of Iberia. I appreciate the use of mirrors in revealing activity behind cameras. Watching this movie, I felt like sitting in a small restaurant in Madrid, comfortably watching the dancers hit the wooden board over a delicious fruit cocktail. For me, this film fits like a glove. I do not know how I can get a copy of this film in the US in the next few years. I recommend this film to anyone who attracts other cultures. It is safe to say that this movie is certainly on my favorite list.
