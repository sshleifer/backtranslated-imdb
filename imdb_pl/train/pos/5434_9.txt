The movie was shot in Movie Flats, just off Route 395, near Lone Pine in California, north of the road to Whitney Portals. You can still find stains of cement and iron beams on the rocks where sets were built. And you'll recognize the area from any Randolph Scott movie. <br /> <br /> I will not worry about the plot because I'm sure it's covered elsewhere. The film features three athletes - Fairbanks fils, who had to learn a lot from their father - Grant, acrobats in their youth - and MacLaughlin, a professional boxer from South Africa. Their physical skills are visible. <br /> <br /> You should not take any moment of this movie seriously. It's about Thugees, a sect in India, where our English word "bandit" comes from. I can not trace all the advantages of this film, but I should probably point out that the director, George Stevens, was a polemic with the background in the films Laurel and Hardy - see his choreography of battle scenes - and went on to the infinitely long dissolution of Shane and The Diary of Anne Frank. Dynasties arose and fell. Geologic eras came and went, and Liz Taylor and Monty Clift kissed in "Place in the sun." Here, in his comic book mode, he excels. <br /> <br /> This is a story of a male relationship and it would be easy - too easy - to read homoeroticism in it, how many people do with Howard Hawks. Or hatred of women. But it is not so. Sometimes things shown on the screen do not deserve too much heuristic attention. Men will create bonds by working together in a way that women do not. (Women share secrets.) Read Deborah Tannen, no one knows about anti-feminist. Well, when you think about it, that's what evolution should have been doing. For most of human history - about nine tenths of history - hominids were hunters and gatherers, and men tend to hunt, and women to collect. Hunting is more effective as a team enterprise. Men who were not very good at joining were Darwinians, leaving men with a lot of team spirit. And Grant, Fairbanks and MacLaughlin have it in check. <br /> <br /> I apologize for thinking about evolution, but I am an anthropologist and this is a professional disease. Did I ever tell you about a horse in Vaitonga, Samoa, who slipped into the cement and fell into the bath with me? You must watch the hooves. <br /> <br /> Joan Fontaine is really beautiful. I met her only in later years and I wondered why she was in so many films. I lived in Saratoga, California, where her sister Olivia DeHavilland grew up and went to a convent school. Nice place. <br /> <br /> If you miss this lively, fragile chronicle of British Empahh at its height, you should never forgive yourself. He is so famous that he is parodied in Peter Sellers' movie The Party. Yes - the colonel must know.
