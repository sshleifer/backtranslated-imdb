I'm watching this movie all the time. I watched it with my family between the ages of 3 and 87, and everyone in between; Everyone liked it. It really shows the real scene that the dog has, and the love and loyalty you get from the animal. Just beautiful. <br /> <br /> Great for lovers of comedy movies, tear videos or even pets. <br /> <br /> The music is great, the animals are spectacular, the scenes are really well thought out and the characters are perfect. What I liked about the characters are real and nicely mixed personalities: Shadow (the oldest, Golden Retriever) Is smart, full of wisdom and attitude of every dog, Chance (puppy of American Bulldog) is basically a puppy witty side, comic character; And Sassy (Kot Hymilayan) This is a real cat who shows what a real cat will do for her owner, a real girl.
