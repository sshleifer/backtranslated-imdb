One of those beautifully intense films that attract us so much that it will end soon! Than they looked at the screen like "No, no!", Lol. Good performances around! Acting is great with Emily Blunt simply outstanding! I knew that he would give a solid, convincing performance, catching Victoria's youth, temperament and sensitivity throughout the film. In addition, production is unique in every respect: style, substance and sensitivity. A remarkable glimpse at an extraordinary time in Britian history, told through the very personal and moving biography of the school-age princess, until her reign as the queen, later married to Prince Albert, than the end of the birth of their first of nine children. He had a well-written script and flawless edition. Rupert Friend as always a patient and compassionate young Prince Albert competing for attracting the attention of the young queen, and not ensuring her love before Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany), was busy watching. Equally addictive was the relationship between teenage Victoria and her mother, who sometimes was furious, as was the case with her mother and King William (who also did not like her mother). Acting and scenes were enchanting, very emotional. <br /> <br /> I recommend this to every interested historical and political situation existing in that era, and even to anyone who loves the fascinating true romance story
