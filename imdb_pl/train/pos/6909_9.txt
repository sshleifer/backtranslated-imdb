... and if you are very, very good, it will look like Moon Over Parador. <br /> <br /> This movie had a bit stupid story, but in the end it was a fantasy, and the cast and acting were in place! Dreyfuss was perfect as an actor / cheater, full of all the little neuroses and vanity that you imagine actors. You see how actors are behind the scenes. <br /> <br /> It was one of Dreyfuss's best roles, just as his character has his best role in impersonating a dead dictator! And a farewell scene: really something from Casablanca! <br /> <br /> Raul Julia was wonderful as the Paradorian Chief of Secret Police. He gets really funny lines, some of which are tributes to other films, like "Round up ordinary suspects!" <br /> <br /> And Sonia Braga was great as a friend - except that she was a really hot number: "You should get an Oscar for this evening! "<br /> <br /> Let's not forget that Johnny Winters is a CIA agent and some guest stars who play alone: ​​Sammy Davis Jr., Ike Pappas, Dick Cavett - everything is perfectly done. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, an unforgettable rally under the Paradorian moon. <br /> <br /> -R.
