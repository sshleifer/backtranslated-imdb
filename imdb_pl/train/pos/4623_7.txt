Despite the rather malicious title, it is a light teenager. If you're not an old coot, you'll probably like her. However, it is not so good in the smooth development of a character or situation. When you watch it, you get the feeling that you are running back and forth into the kitchen, even if you were sitting watching all the time. This is one of those movies that really like characters and are attractive enough. Jennifer Connelly is the heart of many, I know, but I have always liked more obscure Maddie Corman. Teens spend most of their time on the screen without much interference from annoying adults. Is it just me, or the majority of young males look very similar?
