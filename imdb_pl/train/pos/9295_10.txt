It was difficult for me to believe all the negative comments about this all-encompassing movement. I was laughing all over the picture, as did all my family. The movie clearly described itself as a gangster comedy from the old days - the players were hysterical - I bet they had fun when they did. Of course, Goldblum and Dreyfuss were great - how about those sisters Everly, each of the two Falco and all the divine music. Rob Reiner made a great laughing limousine driver, and Gabriel Byrne a funny neurotic. Not to mention Gregory Hines, Burt Reynolds, Sleepy Joe, and all references to the morgue and grave. Paul Anka was his usual entertainment "I", with an additional attraction of running scared after Byrne decided to create a duet of his "My Way", welcoming the performance of Vick at home. he was a comical tribute to Frank Sinatra and friends; Dreyfuss imitated him well. I also think that no one, at any age, would even think about imitating the activities that took place in this film - it's a joke - not a frightening "gangsta" movie. Cars and clothes were impressive, just like the decorative "Place Vic". <br /> <br /> I really think about "Mad Dog Time" as a musical comedy, less harmful than many cartoons, TV series, and talk shows. I recommend a movie for an evening of family entertainment.
