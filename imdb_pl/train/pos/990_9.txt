I really liked this movie. Of course, the idea is largely ... the federal government organizes a tracking device implanted in the jaws of a small thief to lure a more dangerous thief / computer hacker out of hiding. But Alvin Sanders, a man whose federal "volunteered" to implant the device, is a very nice person and it turns out that it is great fun, bumping into his head for a moment. Alvin finally proves that he is more than just a good man, but passive or one-dimensional, when he shows that he is not as easily manipulated as it may seem. It's definitely worth watching.
