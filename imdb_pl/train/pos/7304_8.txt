From time to time, the movie is advertised as frightening or frightening, although it is usually not. Most contemporary horror films fit into this category. <br /> <br /> Then there are those movies that do not cause tension and adrenaline that flow through your veins more than usual. They frighten you to a level you have never experienced. <br /> <br /> "Halloween" is a movie. It requires so many risks that most film producers are embarrassed. But almost all of them work. "Halloween" is amazing in its simplicity and scary as a whole. <br /> <br /> The story is simple. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) takes care of several children on the Halloween night, while the madman is at large after escaping from the psychiatric facility after brutally murdering his older sister 15 years ago. Of course, a madman, later known as Michael Myers, begins to kill the local teen population and eventually comes after Laurie. <br /> <br /> Sounds familiar, right? Another mindless fucker filled with stupid teenagers and gore. No way. <br /> <br /> I think James Berardinelli put it perfectly in his review "Halloween:" "Because of the title, Halloween was often grouped with all the other films that populated theaters throughout the late 70s and early eighties However, although Halloween is rightly considered the father of a modern slasherian genre, he is not a member ... "<br /> <br /> He is right and for many reasons. First of all, it is downright frightening, while the majority of applications for the teenager genre are stupid festivities (it can be argued that many of the last are impudent, but most of them also fail). Secondly, there is almost no violence (very few of them are bloody). John Carpenter knows that violence is not terrible, and he relies on it very little (actually the number of bodies is quite low). In fact, it can be argued that this is not really a horror, at least not according to today's standards for the majority of deaths that can be crammed into one film, each more harsh and more sadistic than the last. It is based on ideas for horror, as well as on skills. Third, while some characters can do stupid things (which sometimes seal their fate), they do not do it because they are stupid. Characters are real people, so instead of thinking that characters are dying because they are idiots, we're scared because they make a mistake. <br /> <br /> One of the main reasons why "Halloween" is so frightening is that it's so easy to believe that it's real. In this movie, nothing is difficult to swallow. There is no supernatural, there are no absurdly creative plot elements, "inventive" murders or nothing. Instead, all songs and camera work (save the opening sequence) are simple. Carpenter simply sets the camera and tells the action. We have the impression that we see the murder right in front of us. <br /> <br /> Horror is probably the hardest film to do, because something must be perfect and ideas never work twice. This is a "hit or miss" game, so if I had to tell you all the good ideas Carpenter has (which I do not have), they would seem primitive (especially that they were repeated with less effect over and over for years). <br /> <br /> It's not a plus here because it does not have to be. It's a film about frightening ideas, not a film about dramatic, conflicting figures. Actors behave like real people, not characters from the story. Nothing more. The exception to this is the one who plays The Shape, or later known as Michael Myers. It can be scary when someone says nothing and simply kills, but it is hard to leave (and it is even harder to stop people from asking why). But the guy pulls it off and the result is terrifying. <br /> <br /> This is Carpenter's movie. He directed it, co-wrote, co-produced and wrote his chilling in his veins. He is a man of brilliance, and his later film "The Thing" supports this statement, although The Thing is not as scary as "Halloween". Unfortunately, its success dramatically decreased, as happens when the lure of big money for less freedom is used by once large producers "recognizing your potential". As good as this movie, it is not without flaws. The famous opening scene is disturbing, but not very frightening. And there are not many horrors in the first part of the movie. It's not that it's bad, there's just no reason to be afraid of "The Shape." Fortunately, Carpenter uses this time mainly to establish relationships between the characters and the audience. Although there is no intimacy in this relationship, it suits the purpose. We are known to be heroes, but not so much that they discourage them when they die. But when the movie reaches Halloween night, then Carpenter digs things into high gears and NEVER stops until you reach the end. <br /> <br /> While "Halloween" may be defective, it is only slightly. It is an extremely frightening movie and you have to see it for everyone who loves scary movies. I warn you, however, that this movie will scare you from hell!
