Returning from a Christmas shopping trip, a battered suburban housewife (Basinger) is in a fight for survival after a misunderstanding with a group of criminal youth who is rapidly turning. <br /> <br /> Suffering insults straight to the DVD release here in the UK, directorial debut Susan Montford may not get the recognition he deserves. It's a shame because the standard of writing, directing and acting is actually very good, and certainly exceeds the quality of the average straight for a DVD movie. <br /> <br /> Kim Basinger gives her the best performance for some time as the oppressed wife of an aggressive husband (Craig Sheffer). While Sheffer has nothing more to do than be a dangerous presence, it is in their short scenes that Basinger connects - showing painful susceptibility, but suggesting rage, which will ultimately come down to her confrontation with the youth. It's really great, low performance, its transformation from victim to aggressor is smoothly played. <br /> <br /> Lukas Haas At first I thought it was wrong because he (along with the other three young) did not seem too much of a threat. If, however, all four youngsters were more physically impressive, later scenes in which Basinger turns tables against them, they would not work at all. The fact that these are the four average men, though somewhat disturbed, is the key to why the film works as well as it does. <br /> <br /> Apart from a few stimulatory problems in the second half of the movie and some bad lines here and there, what we have here is a great thriller that really leaves the viewer something to think about when the movie ends. Some may be discouraged by the slow burning of the nature of the opening scenes or sudden ending. Others through brutal violence. I say give it a chance, it certainly deserves your time more than Saw V.
