Contrary to popular belief, this title, at least for me, is not so bad. In fact. I consider this to be the favorite movie of all time. Welding stories was not very well constructed when you take into account the differences between sets, but you can still watch them happily. As for the feature film of those times, the scenes are proportionate and the characters remain unchanged. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack / audio is my favorite. Almost everything has the correct sound effect and many voices fit the characters much better than their badly filled American counterparts. Synchronization is perfect in every shot. I had some problems with casting for "foreign" voices (forgive primitive names, it's been some time since I saw it). Otherwise the cast seemed perfectly balanced. I feel and believe in the heroes of this film. Duby is often a topic with which I rarely agree. I loved the OSD of those times, but the castings often released the series. <br /> <br /> At this point, I would like to add that it was one of the first animes I have seen in my life. He has historical value for me, but even after seeing the original Megazone 23 he remained stronger and more watched in my collection. <br /> <br /> To my knowledge this title only reached the USA in Texas. Personally, I think it's a great shame. If the correct audience were subordinated, I think that Robotech the Movie would be accepted and would not be stained for years. I'm involved in the anime every day of my life and everyone I showed in this movie thought it was a nicely arranged title. <br /> <br /> Watching the film along its separate components will allow the viewer to see the obvious storyline of the hole between the shows. However, without viewing the originals, the viewer would not notice it. Because the animation is identical in style, there was no reason to question it in its time. Great Britain had very limited access to anime. Laser disks were the most efficient media. Personally, I like the way Carl had balls to at least push the genre. I mean, Harmony will not be ready to publicize the series. <br /> <br /> Despite the few picky mistakes that people had with this movie, the feeling of the eighties keeps me in love. If you watch Megazone 23 now, its original Japanese sound or a new dub, I believe you will be very disappointed with the OSD. Return to the original soundtrack Bubblegum Crisis Dub and imagine the new sound of the eighties E.V.E. <br /> <br /> Speaking all this. The popularity of this film is now rather rare in the open market. He personally gave me a collection. Now I search the world in search of goods from the three components that invented it, and if I ever meet Carl Macek, I will not shake his hand for the effort, and I will buy him a pint or case to introduce me to the anime.
