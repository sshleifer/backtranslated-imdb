Honestly, I watched this movie only because of my pubic needs. I mean, I could not get women my age (I was 9 or 10 years old), so I thought watching Elvira's neckline was a sex thing. <br /> <br /> I ended up having a great time with this classic culture about the comedy of horror, Halloween parties, sassy humor and sexy evil presented by Elvira. <br /> <br /> They just do not make such movies anymore ... It was the feeling of an amateurish effort mixed up with the talk show host style late at night. <br /> <br /> The truth is that it has generated a lot of fans because of humor and the ability to perform Cassandra. <br /> <br /> This is a classic that reminds me of the good days of USA Up All Night.
