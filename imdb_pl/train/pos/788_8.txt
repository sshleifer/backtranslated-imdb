Ok - I admit. I think Kenny Doughty looks amazing in this movie - but beyond his appearance, the movie is carried by a predictable but sensible plot. <br /> <br /> Starting, we present the three main women movie. One director - very concerned about her image and never married. Police officer - with a child and bad ex. The third - hungry for power and state doctor with the desire of recognition and three ex. <br /> <br /> They are almost a "Club of First Wives" and indeed there are many verbal fights involving the former and some "left the behavior of the credit card". Characters set - the movie is underway. <br /> <br /> The character of McDowell, the director, appears late at the funeral - where he is caught by a young organist filling up a regular player (Doughty). What will her two friends say about the resulting mischief? Will they live happily ever after? <br /> <br /> A handkerchief or two is recommended if you are a tearing type - an uplifting end, but maybe not what you would expect. All in all a great movie that stands out from the current choices of action, special effects and jerky horror.
