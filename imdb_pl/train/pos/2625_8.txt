Surprisingly not terrible and well-animated for one of the Disney series straight to the video to throw away. Like the previous sequel (The Lion King 2) I was happy that Disney brought most of the original voice actors, which is a big difference and kept a good level of traditional animation. The story goes on for a while, but we are distracted by an endless series of jokes, from funny to boring. To break the obscene story and jokes, they gave us some stupid music sequences that, like jokes, are different from funny to fast journey into the fridge. Most moments like MST3K are bland and full of unused potential, and they do not really add much more to the movie than acting as an hour-long flashback. The new characters are at least nice, and the old characters are doing their thing, so I can not blame them there. Overall, this movie is pretty good and it's a cool frivolous filler between the more serious Lion King titles.
