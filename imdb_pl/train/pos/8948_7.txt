This is the kind of film that, if created today, would probably play Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant; Actually now, when I think about it, this one is quite susceptible to renovations one day.

He suffers from the almost fatal confusion of James Stewart in the role for which he is 20 years too old, as a result of which there is no chemistry between him and the beautiful Kim Novak. Ernie Kovacs, in the small supporting role of the novice writer, is the only actor in the film whose performance approaches what can be called a "joke". (** 1/2)
