Kopciuszek .... <br /> <br /> I have not watched this movie for about five years when I last saw it. Magic remains. There is something that definitely includes this story with books, entertainment songs and secondary character - everything is fine. The villains in the form of step sisters are perfectly evil and mean. Then he is the most magical of all Disney, mice making a dress and you know the rest well. All in all, all four Disney movies are great, but it's a lovely magic experience, watch and enjoy. And of course Cinderella is great as the main character of the film. <br /> <br /> If you think about it, Disney movies can really lose their charm. Thanks to Elene Wood and others, the movie has such an atmosphere, you just can not help smiles. <br /> <br /> They say that the moral of this story is that dreams come true. Of course, in the real world, some believe, others are hacks. In this film, it's even more magical when its rainbow smiles. <br /> <br /> And of course the rest is ... Cinderella
