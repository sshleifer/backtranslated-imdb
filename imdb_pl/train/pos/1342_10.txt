A captivating, great look at films that inspired great Martin Scorsese. Many of the films he talks about are easy to connect with his works, especially with earlier ones, from silent times. Very pleasant, though a bit long, I thought it was one of the best documentaries. Browsing required if you admire Martin Scorsese and his work.
