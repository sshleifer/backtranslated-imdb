An interesting TV movie based on a real fact, betrayed by the description of one of the main characters, a prisoner. Giovanni Ribisi plays his younger brother, who has a delicate mission to decide whether he will appeal to the court for punishing his brother. But when he visits him and enters Elias Koteas, the problem begins. This has nothing to do with Koteas' acting skills. It looks like a prisoner version of proletarian roots according to "G.Q." magazine with a language too sophisticated for someone who spent most of his life behind bars. This realization came to my mind after meeting an old friend whom I had not seen for almost 15 years, which he spent in several Panamanian prisons. The young man I knew went away, not only because he is older, but because of his exposure for a long time in the penal system. There are prisons and there are prisons, you have to say, but this one prisoner in "Shot In the Heart" definitely does not belong to this world.
