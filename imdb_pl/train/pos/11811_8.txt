Dick Tracy was originally a comic book created in 1931 by Chester Gould. He is a civilian detective who follows a team of villains, from all kinds of original visual characters, such as Flattop to The Blank, to Big Boy Caprice. (These villains became so popular in the 1940s that Warner Bros. created his own look at Tracy villains in such cartoons as Daffy Duck.) Tracy's comics were known for the liberal use of shooting and the latest technological advances (especially the communicator for the watch) who had a great time on the screen of this amazing movie. The music was done wonderfully by Danny Elfman, and Madonna's original songs were interesting, but they were not the climax of her career. It's weird because when you watch the movie and you see the tight moments, the movie reminds Batman because of Elfman's unforgettable sound for his songs. <br /> <br /> I love a hard talking kid, Pacino playing Big Boy Caprice (and that chin!), Madonna on the subject of villainy, and the photos and directing were impeccable. This film was very professionally made and contains a lot of great actors who for some time were known as great actors (Warren Beatty, Al Pacino, William Forsythe, Dustin Hoffman, Kathy Bates, Mandy Patinkin, Catherine O'Hara, Dick Van Dyke). The film was directed by Beatty himself, which was interesting. It's almost like Beatty saw himself as Tracy in a previous life or something because he really matched that part. <br /> <br /> I had to give this movie 8/10 for everything that brought to the cinema, which was overlooked (for any reason). There have been a lot of misunderstandings related to the evaluation of this movie on IMDb and I still do not understand why. The heroes were completely original and elemental, just like the style of sets, wardrobe, lighting and everything in this film. Go buy today. You will not be sorry.
