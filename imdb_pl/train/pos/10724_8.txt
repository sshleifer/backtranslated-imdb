It's one of those that feel good, movies on Saturday afternoon. It's there with other retro movies like Flight of the Navigator. Just a sweet movie with a subtle comedy that brightens everything up. It's nice to see how 20 years changed stars like Kelly Preston and Lea Thompson. Not to mention Joquin Phoenix. <br /> <br /> Personally, I really like such films from time to time. Nothing is too deep or scary. Just a nice story. And I would never have met Mr. Feniks if I had not read the subtitles lately. He was really a kid when he made this movie. <br /> <br /> Kelly Preston was then quite a young beginner actress. She and Lea did a great job in this movie. I agree that this is not a movie about Oscar caliber. But it's very worth watching. Especially if you have children between 8 and 11 years old. Or those who are interested in the space program.
