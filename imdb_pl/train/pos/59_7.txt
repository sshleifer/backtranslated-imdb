While I was a video store, I looked through one dollar rental and stumbled across this little gem. I do not know what this was about, but I just had instinctive instinct and wow, I was right. <br /> <br /> The story focuses on two girls who have just survived the school shooting. One of the girls is Alicia, a teenager who is the only witness to the full attack, and the other is Deanna, who survived the ball in the head somehow. Thrown together by fate, they slowly begin a painful and beautiful show of healing and moving. <br /> <br /> I just hate it when amazing movies fall through the gaps. Because what a performance Busy Phillips and Erkii Christensen, not to mention the rest of the cast! My only complaint is that the DVDs lacked special functions. Oh, some of the jumps in the film were a bit shocking. But all in all an excellent movie.
