With Darkwing Duck this is unjustly canceled. Disney has been in the fall since Tarzan and we need a show to make Disney go well. Ed Gilbert and Jim Cummings were perfect for the voices of Louis and Baloo (sounds familiar?). The theme is also catchy. Of all the villains who are great at their own merit, Tony Jay stands out as Shere Kahn. Louis and Baloo really sound very similar to the voice in the jungle book, which is not bad at all. In fact, it is quite inspirational! The animation was in place, and the script had a lot of wit, which for many years has been lacking in animations. PLEASE RESTORE THE REVIEW! 9/10. Bethany Cox
