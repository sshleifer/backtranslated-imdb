This film has a constant, disturbing pace supported by great acting (one of Chamberlain's best performances) and a story that is revealed to us over time. <br /> <br /> In addition, music sets the mood in full and helps to maintain a restless, cautious and grim tone. <br /> <br /> The Weir story is enhanced by using indigenous people, their stories and tensions with the dominant white population to create a fantastic story that is ominous. <br /> <br /> Although they are not related to either history or genre, I have the same feeling as Ursula Le Guin's "Lathe of Heaven" (1980). <br /> <br /> "The Last Wave" is a dramatic thriller with shocking moments. Remember that "hacking and slicing" does not make the film a horror film, it is a psychological element of fear and anxiety that rests in us all.
