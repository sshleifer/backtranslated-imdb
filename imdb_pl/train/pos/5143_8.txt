Thanks to the quick plugging of scenes of crazy people in asylum, editing / applying images and unclear, intertwined narrations, this is a very difficult movie to imitate. Apparently the man (Masue Inoue) takes a job as a porter or janitor in the asylum so that he can be close to his imprisoned wife and perhaps to save her. But she is clearly furious, huddled on the floor, with an empty expression most of the time and fear, unhappiness and confusion on her face for the rest of the time. The filmmaker sometimes changes his point of view and we see vague images on the side of the pond that melts the child or squeezes the drowning child. Something is bothering her. When the point of view moves on her or other crazy people, the filmmaker uses distorting lenses and such things, showing us what the crazy people see and then how they react. And the place is full of crazy people, laughing, hiding, and in one case dancing madly at night and day. At some point, the man tries to take his wife outside, but the night behind the door frightens her and returns to her cell. Gradually, the man plunges into a nightmare, in which he stopped another attempt to steal her, and he kills the doctor and many helpers, and the whole crazy people laugh and applaud. When he wakes up, he feels relief and soaks the floor. Fascinating shots of Japanese life, streets, buildings in the 1920s.
