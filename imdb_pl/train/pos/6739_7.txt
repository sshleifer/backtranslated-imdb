"Film noir" is an overused word when it comes to describing movies. Every criminal drama seems to be "noir". But "Where the Sidewalk Ends" really is a good example of what this genre is. <br /> <br /> In short, an overeager detective (Andrews) accidentally kills a no-goodnik who works for gangsters. The murderer is accused of his father (Tom Tully) of a woman with whom Andrews meets and falls (Tierney). To save Dad from Old Sparky, Andrews grabs the rest of the crowd and turns into. <br /> <br /> Moral guilty cop is driven by impulses from the past. His father was a thief who died trying to shoot him from prison. But that does not justify his actions after he accidentally threw out a no-goodnik in self-defense. He goes to the phone immediately to report the incident, but hesitates. He is already in hot water with the department and this can end his career. Then, at the wrong moment, the phone rings. It's Andrews' partner and Andrews tells him that the suspect they are tracking is not at home. He hides the body and then gets rid of it by hitting the guard and throwing the body into the river. <br /> <br /> What motivates a guy to do something so stupid? Fine. His work was at stake. But now he has committed many crimes. At least I think they have to be multiple. I counted on obstruction of justice, assault, getting rid of the body without permission, littering, mopers of the first degree and false testimony against his neighbor. <br /> <br /> After all, we do not know if root for Andrews or not. True, the suspect did not deserve death, but it was an accident, because Andrews did not know that he was a war hero and "he had a silver plate in his head". Perhaps it was such ambiguity that the noir was, among other things, a characteristic lighting. If noir would only engage in black and white photography, murder, criminals, mystery and suspicious women, we would have to include all of Charlie Chan's films in this box. <br /> <br /> Andrews is pretty good. He is like Mark MacPherson (from "Laura") who was bitter. He never laughs and rarely smiles, even when he sits at a restaurant table from Gene Tierney, the situation can cause a smile for many men. There is no sense of humor at all. His few jokes are rejected. When he slips a stool into a taxi, the stool says: "Careful. I almost hit my head, Andrew's retort reads: "It's all right. The taxi is insured. " Sometimes Andrews may seem a bit wooden, but this is a role that requires stubborn and humorless determination, and he is doing well. Its underappreciation is perfect for this part. Small vibrations or blinks project his thoughts and emotional states. And I think that the director, Otto Preminger, stopped him from saying the bullet as "BOO-let" and the police as "POE-lice". I never decide Gene Tierney. She's good at the role of Tom Tully's daughter, a model, but she's like Marilyn Monroe because you can not separate manners from real personality traits. Did Tierney really have such an innocent, almost sacred personality? When did she answer the phone at home, did her voice have the same quality of singing as on the screen? Poor Tierney went through bad psychiatric things before there were effective drugs for bipolar disorder. And Andrews, a nice guy, though he seems to be, got into alcoholism before he finally recovered and announced public announcements. <br /> <br /> Peter MÃ¼ller's DVD commentary is unpretentious, informative and sometimes funny. <Br /> <br /> In any case, it's a good movie, and a good example of film noir. Good guys are not good, though bad guys are bad. Maybe this ambiguity makes it a photo for adults instead of a popcorn movie. For kids, only one shot is fired on the screen and no one explodes. Excuse me.
