This is one of the few films in which the film's presentation is an improvement of the original book. The story is clear, available, fun and interesting, and the music numbers are undoubtedly unique. I loved the cyclical interpretation of "The old home guard" and the charming "Portobello Road", a great combination of early animation + real acting techniques, which, although outdated, do not diminish the charm of the song. The background of World War II worked well and was not omitted during the film, which often happens in evacuation stories. <br /> <br /> Often, a film which is too underrated gives joy to people of all ages. The performances of the actors are extremely well made, and the whole text is carefully related and well-designed. I guarantee a smile on your face!
