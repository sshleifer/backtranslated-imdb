I went to see this movie expecting a nice relaxation in the theater with my younger sister. Instead, I had to really control myself to convince her that I was not afraid. In many ways, it is still a story for children, but with a scenario that has a lot of potential. It could be one of the scariest movies if it was planned for a different audience.
