A great film by Thaddeus O'Sullivan with strong performances by many British and Irish actors. The film deals well with sensitive topics and effectively reflects the hopelessness and grim atmosphere of the 70s in Belfast. Surprisingly realistic, he does nothing to praise both parties in this conflict. On the one hand, he shows a young Catholic father who is trying to raise his family without getting into trouble. On the other hand, it concerns a gang of loyalists who intend to propagate violence. Very interesting and thankfully fun. However, do not expect laughter. 7 out of 10.
