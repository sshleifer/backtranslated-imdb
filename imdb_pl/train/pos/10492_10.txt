I saw Saving Grace right after appearing on the video. Since then, he has become one of my favorites! The plot is not particularly complicated, but it does not take away entertainment. It's a chuck full of comedic moments and has a very endearing quality. Characters are what makes a movie so good. Each of them has its own bizarre features that add humor. The two older ladies played by Linda Kerr Scott and Phyllida Law come to mind. The perfect game was made by everyone, especially by Brenda Blythen. She and Craig Ferguson had a great time with each other, downloading some fun moments. If you're looking for a good comedy, I definitely recommend this movie!
