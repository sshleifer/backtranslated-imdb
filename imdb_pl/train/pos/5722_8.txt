It was great. When I saw the Japanese version for the first time, it was probably the scariest movie I've ever seen. It was not blood and guts, it was amazing, moody and frightening. When the ghost mother borrowed a bed in the Japanese version, I almost had a heart attack ... I was afraid that the American version would be diluted, and Buffy would receive the dark scary nuances of the original version. I did not have to worry. The creators of this film wisely kept at hand the same Japanese who were involved in the original movie, and gave the direction of the film to the same man. They also set it up in Japan in the same place in the same house. In fact, the Japanese director tried to convert the same film that was in the original, the only difference was the casting of American actors. In fact, it has been beneficial because it added the element "Strangers in a Strange Land" to general horror. Not only were they haunted by an absolutely terrifying and unyielding spirit, they were also stuck in a completely foreign country, having difficulties integrating with society. This just added to the general anxiety built into the movie and I thought it was a great touch. <br /> <br /> Buffy really does a very good job. She looks vulnerable and knows how to convey her fear. There are no clever remarks that are so common in American horrors, not a single liner that diminishes the overall darkness and the horror of the characters' situation. In fact, it was as good as The Ring, which I liked very much. I hope that the future of the American horror will be closer to the Japanese new wave of horror, which began with the incredible success of the Ring. In the end, we get movies that can be classified as "Horror" !! 8/10
