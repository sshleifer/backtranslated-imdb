I swear that I could watch this movie every weekend of my life and I never have enough of it! Every aspect of human emotions is captured so magically by the acting, script, direction and general feeling of the film. It's been a long time since I saw a movie that caused me to choke away from laughter, reflect from sadness and feel every intentional feeling that comes in this most perfect job! We need MORE VIDEOS like this !!! Mike Binder: are you listening?
