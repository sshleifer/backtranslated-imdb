I was fortunate that I recently received a copy of the movie on DVD and saw it for the second time. The first time was on TV late in the night in Australia over 20 years ago, but I could never forget this strange and bleak movie ... <br /> <br /> Few people like this movie at all because it is so unconventional - the fact that in this move almost no way - we just hear the thoughts of heroes - it's just one unconventional aspect of this. <br /> <br /> Looking for a copy of this movie, I learned that the producer was dead, the main actor was dead, he was not kept in any British television or film archive, he was never released on video or DVD, TV networks around the world they destroyed it after their copyrights expired in the 80's. When it was first shown on television in Australia, there were no recordable devices for consumers. <br /> <br /> During the second watch I last saw why it was unforgettable. Sometimes it is a very tense and unbearable claustrophobia, very similar to playing on the stage of Harold Pinter. <br /> <br /> Again, if someone wants to have a copy of the DVD, write to me, and I'm sure we can do something Regards Adam (whiteflokati@hotmail.com)
