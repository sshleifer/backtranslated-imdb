"Anchors Aweigh", released a few months before the end of the war, is one of Gene Kelly's main musical triumphs in the 1940s? <br /> <br /> Under the leadership of George Sidney, it had the advantages of a nice result, and the best services of Gene Kelly in his first real role in MGM ?? A year earlier, in "Cover Girl" in Columbia, he revealed an innovative approach to dance on the screen, a light but pleasant voice and great charm in "Anchors Aweigh", although he was announced by Frank Sinatra and Kathryn Grayson, laid a solid foundation for the most revealing years at MGM? <br /> <br /> The story of the film, a kind of dry run for "On the Town" four years later, tracks sailors Kelly and Sinatra on land, spend their holidays in Hollywood, where they engage in the affairs of the aspiring singer (Grayson) and her little nephew (Dean Stockwell). <br /> <br /> It looks like Grayson has his heart at audition with the conductor-pianist Jose Iturbi?
