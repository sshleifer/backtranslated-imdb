When I read the history of Armistead Maupins for the first time, I was kidnapped by the human drama presented by Gabriel Nikt and those he cared about and loves. With that in mind, we've received a movie version of a great story and we're expecting to see the Hollywood past ... <br /> <br /> Writer Armistead Maupin and director Patrick Stettner have really been successful! <br /> <br /> With proper restraint, Robin Williams grabs the delicate essence of Gabriel and lets us see his struggles with matters of trust both in his personal life (Jess) and in the world around him (Donna). <br /> <br /> When we become acquainted with the players in this drama, we are reminded that nothing is as it seems and that the smallest event can irreversibly change our lives. A request to review a book written by a young man turns into a life-changing event that helps Gabriel find strength in himself and continue. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that most people will avoid this movie. I say this only because the average American will probably think "Robin Williams in a serious role? It did not work before! "PLEASE GIVE THIS OPPORTUNITY! Robin Williams touches the darkness that we all must find and go through ourselves to be better people. Like his film "One Hour Photo" he appeared as an actor and created another work of art. <br /> <br /> Oh, before I forget, I believe that Bobby Cannavale as Jess steals every scene she's in. the top look of a man in the forties and presence on the screen. It's this hacker opinion that he can now move his own movie !! <br /> <br /> S ~
