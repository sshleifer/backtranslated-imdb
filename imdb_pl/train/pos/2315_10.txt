There are so many values ​​in this movie that it's difficult to know where to start. Let me start by expressing admiration for the perfect performance of Reese Witherspoon. The fact that her performance stands out in a perfect cast is indeed a praise. Robert Mulligan rarely disappointed those of us who admired his work. Each frame of The Man in the Moon is proof that the film is the best.
