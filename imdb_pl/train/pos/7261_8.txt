I strongly disagree with "ctomvelu" about the talent of Jim Belushi. I really like Belushi. Admittedly, I was skeptical when he first appeared on stage because I was such a HUGE fan of his late brother John. But Jim has grace on the screen that developed it - and he developed it well over the years. <br /> <br /> Curly Sue is one of his earlier films - his weight is free (this is not true for most of us?) - and I like this movie. Yes, it's touching and cordial, so if you like car chases, explosions and unpaid sex, you may want to pass this one - it's a warm movie of three lost soles that find themselves. Do not get me wrong, I'm behind the three keys mentioned above for a successful movie, but I also like a nice, solid story like this one. <br /> <br /> And although Belushi and Kelly Lynch provide excellent performances, the real star of the movie is Alisan Porter - who is absolutely charming. <br /> <br /> I do not know what happened to her career, but whoever is responsible for dropping the ball (agent? parents?) should be shot. You can not ask for a more perfect introduction to fame than this movie, and yet nothing has been heard from it. <br /> <br /> Another sad story from Hollywood ...
