It was the best Muppet movie I've ever seen! I know that the fantasy of Miss Piggy to meet as babies was the cause of Muppet Babies. The songs will stay in my head forever. That's just because this stupid Nickelodeon song Hey Dude is still in my head. I'm sorry, a bit of topic. Anyway, what I like is Animal after the lyrics "Bye Bye! Bye Bye! Bye Bye! Bye Bye! It made me laugh so much. My absolute favorite is the game at the end. I was surprised that the characters of Sesame Street appeared at the wedding. I am glad that this movie was very funny. I borrowed it from the library, and now I bought it, because I can not keep a copy of the library forever. In conclusion, I declare that this is the best movie I've ever seen! In my case it's even better than Austin Powers in Goldmember, which was my favorite movie!
