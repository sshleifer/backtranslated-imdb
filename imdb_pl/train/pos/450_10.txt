I am focused on every film that depicts the lush Italian image - in my opinion the most romantic country in the world. Unfortunately, the film was rather short, exceptionally like a piece from the era, and a bit stingy in terms of cinematography. However, an excellent story makes up for it. Four ladies set off for a much needed relaxing vacation with problems in their heads. During the movie, they realize their problems and begin to repair them. They believe that San Salvatore, the castle they are in, has a charming effect on people. "It's a bath of love," says Lottie Wilkins. You can observe their gradual changes from dissatisfied to disasters, because the Italian coast works magically on them. <br /> <br /> All their problems and solutions are reliable. The actresses were great. Background music seemed very suitable for a romantic Italian place. In total, the film 10/10 is for me.
