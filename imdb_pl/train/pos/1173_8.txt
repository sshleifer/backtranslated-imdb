"Night of the Living Homeless" was quite a strong ending of the first half of Season 11. Of course, a parody of various zombie movies, especially Dawn of the Dead, this episode resembles homeless people with living dead, as creatures that feed on and develop rather than slow changes than from the brains. <br /> <br /> Kyle is blamed for a sudden massive explosion of the homeless when he gives $ 20 to the homeless in front of his house out of kindness. More homeless people begin to penetrate into South Park until the city is fully occupied. This is a very strong episode of Randy Marsh, in which he takes on the role of a rifle leader adult who has taken shelter on the roof of the Park Community Center. But before Randy reaches the center of the community, he gets accosted by hundreds of homeless people, while he cries out "I have no changes !!" Unfortunately, the refugees lose Gerald Broflofski to the homeless when he tries to escape by catching a bus from the city and unwittingly rejects the change bus to distract the homeless. Then he becomes one of them, asking everyone to change. <br /> <br /> The boys are trying to find out why there are so many homeless people in South Park and find a man who is a director of homeless studies. They learn that the nearby town of Evergreen had a similar problem with the homeless, so they run to Evergreen to find out what they did to solve the problem. Unfortunately, homeless people break into the man's house and try to get out of it easily, shooting themselves. However, he fails several times when he shoots in the jaw, eye, chest, neck, arm, screams terribly until he dies. This scene could have been more fun if a similar scene did not happen in "Fantastic Easter" two weeks ago. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, a refugee member discovers that due to the problem of homelessness, property values ​​have deteriorated so the bank closed its house, making it homeless. Randy immediately turns away from him, holding the gun in the man's head. When the man finally begs others for a few bucks to help him, Randy pulls the trigger. <br /> <br /> At Evergreen, boys learn that the city's residents have sent homeless people to South Park, and that the passing of the homeless from town to town takes place all over the country. The boys modify the bus that takes the homeless out of South Park and takes them to Santa Monica, California. <br /> <br /> The zombie parallels and the wonderful lines of Randy Marsh make this movie sure to be watched again. 8/10
