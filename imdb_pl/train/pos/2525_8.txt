Tony Hawk Underground appeared at the moment when the series really began to lose its shine, Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4 did not live up to expectations and left a series in the air about what Neversoft and Activision can do with a series that is different and interesting. <br /> <br /> Underground introduced the storymode mode, which was very nice because it created a whole new world for fans of Tony Hawk Pro Skater. Another feature introduced by fans, which many people argued about and who was able to get off the skateboard, which is nice because now you can actually climb, run and do different things. <br /> <br /> The levels are good, Neversoft also improved on the issue that began with Pro Skater 3 and it was the length of the level projects. The first two games on PS1, N64 and Dreamcast were great because the levels were nice and long and some were hidden in some. Pro Skater 3 and 4 have been shortened due to the small number of features that have been added and have really moved the systems too much. In this version, they shortened these functions, there are not so many people wondering on the streets, in fact on some levels there is almost no, and the graphics and physics of skating are slightly subdued, but not much. > <br /> This game has one con, the storymode mode is a little short, of course this is the first time Neversofts doing it with Tony Hawk Pro Skater, so it's understandable. However, with this statement you will definitely end this game in one day. <br /> <br /> Overall, the great addition was very refreshing.
