From what the critics and the audience pointed out, GIRL BIRTHDAY had to be a large fat clinker. Still, because I love Nicole Kidman, I decided to rent her last night. It turned out that it is worth watching. Sure, this is not your basic American comedy, and you do not need a genius to realize that it's a very British movie, but I liked it. It was a change from all the other films around, a breath of fresh air. Sure, there were a few holes in the story, but in general everything worked. First of all, Kidman was fantastic again in a completely different, not very effective, but still quite sexy role. It just proves that it is one of the best talents in Hollywood. Her Russian accent is not only effective when she speaks English, but it happens that she has long conversations in Russian, and if you do not know that it is Nicole Kidman, you will never question her authenticity. Harrison Ford should have paid attention to "K-19". Generally a small movie that works despite the terrible noise.
