Half a dozen short stories about different meanings enlighten us about life in Finland. These stories are intertwined and each contains a scene in which the sound boom is heard. This means that the presented events happen at the same time. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a jumping jump that promises excitement, but early stories are quite weak. The film improves, so hold on to it. Two broken marriages in successive stories provide many dramas, while the scene in the hospital gives us a terminally ill patient begging for pain relief. The last moments with my wife are both convincing and moving. <br /> <br /> While the different scenes of family life take place in Finland, the topics are general, regardless of where you live. <br /> <br /> Story collections are rarely as rewarding as a good 90-minute drama.
