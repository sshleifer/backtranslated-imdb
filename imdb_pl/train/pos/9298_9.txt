Just one of the most amazing movies I've ever seen. This is a parody of criminal life, a parody of everything that Chicago represents in 1930. - There is no need to disregard this film because the rating is below 5. His opinion of mass and mass is hypnotized. Whoever decides to watch it - will regret, Who will decide not to watch it - will regret more.
