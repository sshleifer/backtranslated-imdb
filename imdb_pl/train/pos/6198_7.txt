I'm one of those people who crawled through the broken glass to see Hal Hartley's movie. From TRUST and IRIS to HENRY FOOL and (my favorite Hartley) WITHOUT THEREFORE, Hal's unique movie brand is an acquired taste. Inspiration of the mystery / spying of equal parts comedy seems to be his strong point. Comedy is not necessarily in your face and often goes through the whole scene before it will bear fruit. And this is the case of FAY GRIM, the continuation of Henry Fool. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey plays Fay Grim, an abandoned wife of Henry Fool and the mother of Henry's only son, Ned. Fay lives in peace until he comes home one day to find a CIA agent in his kitchen. His name is Fulbright (Jeff Goldblum, MAN OF THE YEAR) and he wants Henry's notebooks. There are many notebooks by Henry Fool and all previously thought to contain only crazy wanderings. Apparently there are many more. Secret weapon research or path to terrorists? Who knows, but Henry. Agent Fulbright tells Fay that her husband is dead, but it is quickly assumed that this is a trick to lead Fay out of the house and look for Henry (and it works ... but not as they think). <br /> <br /> Fay fights many spy rings to collect Henry's notebooks and find him. She also signed a contract with the CIA to bring her brother Simon (James Urbaniak) out of jail (he helped Henry escape from the country in the original film Henry Foola). Multiple overlapping events occur in a short space of time: spy rings shoot at each other to death, discovered that Henry is being held in "safety" by jihadist, Fay releases his brother, but unknowingly risks his son's life, and the CIA has its advantages for exposing Fay to danger. <br /> <br /> Hal Hartley obviously loves to play with themes. And he does it to the end. Even character names (Grim, Fool, Fulbright, Fogg) have their own hidden meanings that are quite fun. Excessive spy movies are also often displayed on the screen, because guns blaze in time-lapse sequences, never hitting our heroine, even if it's on the firing line. <br /> <br /> Now that I praised the work, I will say that Punch's excessive play by Fay Grim is not the best part of the movie, which is a shame considering how long the screen is on. I realize that this is probably what Mr. Hartley wanted: an impassive woman with gestures of hands to the Italian extreme. But watching sometimes was painful. <br /> <br /> Despite this, fans will probably fake Fay Grim and they will beg for more. Although it was not my favorite Hal Hartley movie, I know I'm ready.
