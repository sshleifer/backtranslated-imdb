Richard Widmark is a contaminated figure in this movie. Is a professional pickpocket. He was in prison three times, but at the beginning of the film he's trying to do four of them. Thelma Ritter is a hardworking body that sells information to almost everyone. Jean Peters is amazing as a girl set on fire by Widmark. <br /> <br /> It is a piece from the era in the McCarthy era, in which Red Scare ruled politics and is nicely incorporated into this story. What is extraordinary in this film is that Peters and Ritter are victims of brutal beatings in times when women were rarely more than sexual objects in movies. This is what noir film does, because women often play different roles in this type of movie. <br /> <br /> The film has only 87 minutes and was of course made by Fox as a subordinate to the dual functions in the theater. Sets show that it is a movie with a limited budget. The script made J Edgar Hoover go crazy, because patriotism is shortened. Hoover wanted it to change. <br /> <br /> Instead, it became the letter B under the card, which was a hit in 1953. The script and playing in it are better than other great features of this year.
