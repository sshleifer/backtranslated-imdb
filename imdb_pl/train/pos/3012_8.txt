This is one of those movies you did not want to watch before - so you can see it again "for the first time". Van Dine's books still bring pleasure - but many are called overly flowery. This film is by far the best film adaptation of his works. William Powell is William Powell - do not say anything more. The plot is complicated. History moves too fast because you want it to last. Enjoy.
