White man + progress + industrialization = BAD. First Nations + Nature + Animals = GOOD. A simple formula. In fact, in the last days the same kind of propaganda has been used to defend the status quo; now it's used to attack. However, as has been said, I think that the film manages to overcome persistent politicization, because it plays the role of freedom and originality in a way that appeals to everyone. Perhaps you do not mind the irrelevant revisionism of the film about winning the West, the loser. But everyone can feel longing for days when horses can run freely on the western plains. (In the film, he also conveniently bypasses the fact that there were no horses in America before the evil white man brought them there). In any case, I liked it. The quality of the animation - especially the opening - is amazing.
