The main problem I see in this movie is its result, which shouts with every note: "This is a cheap movie." There is nothing more to say here. The result is simply nothing. <br /> <br /> The second problem, which I consider quite serious, as well as the unwinding of the plot at the end of the film (one of the shots for money, if you will), is the dialogue between Martha (Adrienne Barbeau) and a sunflower man ( Richard Ziman), in which Martha turns out to be the leader of the experiment. Throughout this dialogue, the viewer is very aware that he is listening to a film dialogue. In other words, suspension of disbelief is suspended here. The integrity of a credible dialogue between two people is devoted to the greedy, ineffectual push of information that filmmakers want to convey to the public. <br /> <br /> The third problem was casting Adrienne Barbeau. Although I sincerely believe that she is a great actress, I feel that this part could have been too big. The main point of her performance, which did not seem to fit, was the specter through which the character passes through the film, from the loving mother of a restless family to the almost Rambo-like woman on the mission. This aspect of the script would of course be a section for every actress, and therefore you can not blame Barbeau too much. To the extent that she competently played her part, I would call it a moderately serious problem for the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film did a great job in the first half of the building, the creeping factor flashes, especially during his horror movie. I feel that the film would benefit from a greater involvement in these flashes as a mechanism to prevent extinction of the crawling factor in the second half of the film. <br /> <br /> So what is my holistic way of judging this piece? I would give her a solid C + to B-, depending on how many points you are willing to give the producers for producing this movie in a limited budget. Even with two serious and two moderately serious problems, the film is based on a solid plot of the Jungian side of Nazi mysticism. I do not see any problems with plot development or cohesion; dialogue, with the exception above, is simply brilliant in places, especially throughout the important key scene between mother and daughter at the beginning of the film; as already mentioned, the crawling factor was well prepared, although it was slightly saggy in the second half; and Nicholas Brendan, who also associated the produced, gave a great performance. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is definitely worth a look --- see it with the Nazi you love. :)
