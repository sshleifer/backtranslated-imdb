There is a different world outside the home, and the family struggles with striding between the dads' power and their hopes and dreams. <br /> <br /> The period is captured; Bakelite lights, Georgian floor, picture rails, wallpaper, short skirts, insolent boys, Mini furgonetka, lśniące nowoczesny mangle .... <br /> <br /> The place is captured; The icy wind hit the rocky landscape, the walls of the local stone, the community, freedom. <br /> <br /> But there is much more; Childhood, happiness, sensuality, pride, values, freedom, authority, rebellion, violence (in the deepest sense), love, struggle, maturation, naivety, morality, trust, faith, deception, machismo, manners, maturity, loss, poverty, sacrifice , horror, acceptance, revelation, comedy and parenthood. (And in no particular order!). <br /> <br /> This film is a richly woven expression of family tensions that are just as topical as ever. The fact that some of them are not solved directly is in itself a testimony to the attitudes of the day, but the fact that they are all here is a testimony of acting skills, history and direction. <br /> <br /> If there is something wrong in this movie, then the fact that it's deeply rooted and wonderfully played voltage is slightly swept at the end. Maybe I do not understand - the annihilation and darkness experienced by many teenagers really disappears, if they deal with it (**) - maybe the movie also tries to send this message - it is worth doing. <br /> <br /> What Does the movie try to say? Children: Parents were also young, parents are also struggling, everyone is making mistakes, everyone is learning, things are changing, the fight can end happily. Parents: Do not try too hard! Try to remember that your support is the key to their well-being. <br /> <br /> It sounds simple, right? Sometimes the movie also feels like that, but then you notice how much is questioned and uncovered. <br /> <br /> The film is a classic. <br /> <br /> (**) - No problems with them.
