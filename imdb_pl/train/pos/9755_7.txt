The last time I saw this movie, I was about seven years old, so my opinions may be blas√© with time. At the time, I enjoyed filming, which changed between animation and live action. At that time, I was sad because of the camel and his sad life. I also felt joy when, after Captain Contagious, he kidnapped the heroine (princess or shepherdess of toys) on the tables he was returned to. Unfortunately, producers have never decided to transfer this movie to VHS, so I have only twenty years of memories. I am sure that if I saw the movie again, I would consider it slim and juicy, but at the time I really enjoyed the film.
