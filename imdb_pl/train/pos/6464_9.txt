Wow, I loved this movie! It's about a normal life in a small village. About hypocrisy and honesty, love and surrender. Great! It's about things that everyone's got in life. You must do things with passion. But some people will not appreciate your passion and try to stop you. There are people who consider the opinion of others and "what the neighbors think", more important than following their heart. Do not let anyone express an opinion that you will not fulfill your dreams and passions. I loved the fact that all the actors were really normal people, that could be my family. No great beauty, but all the people you fall in love with in the movie.
