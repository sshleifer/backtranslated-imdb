SHIRLEY TEMPLE A short topic. <br /> <br /> It can become extremely difficult at Buttermilk Pete's Cafe, when the local contingency diaper WAR BABIES will come to their midday break for milk. <br /> <br /> A primitive little movie - a parody of military films - gives you a few chuckles, but not much more: tiny talks can hardly start smoking in a short time. Shirley Temple, playing a two-faced hip-hop French miss, does not have much to do in this pre-Christmas performance. Underlining: true signs of a toddler's temper when several babies unexpectedly absorb milk well. <br /> <br /> Often omitted or neglected today, short and one-piece topics were useful for the label as an important training ground for new or developing talents, both at the front and back of the camera. The dynamics of creating a successful short theme was completely different than in a full-length film, resembling rather a short story rather than a novel. Economical in production both in terms of budget and schedule, and enabling the presentation of a wide range of materials, short themes were a perfect complement to the studio's feature films.
