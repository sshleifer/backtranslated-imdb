Mother Night is one of my favorite novels and I'm going to see it. I was expecting a great disappointment. Instead, I got a movie that perfectly captures the irony, humor, elitism, and above all the crushing sadness of Vonnegut's novel. <br /> <br /> This is certainly the best Nolte performance so far. Captures the failure and self-sufficiency of Howard Cambella Jr. consistently from the subtle intonation of his speech to the tears he held behind his eyes. <br /> <br /> Alan Arkin is absolutely hilarious like George Kraft. Sherryl Lee persecutes himself in isolation from reality as a young lover of Cambella. John Goodman is underestimated and more than effective as the "Blue Fairy Godmother". <br /> <br /> This Pinnocioesque story about Cambell is trying to be his ideal hero and unknowingly becomes his perfect tragic villian, he is a mature and lively look of what we are as people. Besides, this is one of the most romantic movies I've ever seen. Cambell is the incarnation of both stupid and wise love. And with the movies of hideously painful conclusions, he finally finds out what it means to be a real boy because his godfather's blue fairy gives him his wish. And he realizes that ... well, look at the movie and you'll see. <br /> <br /> Mother Night is undoubtedly one of the best movies ever made. It is a beautiful poetic tale that deeply penetrates our emotions and is completely faithful to its original author.
