It was one of the best episodes of all time. Officer Sean Cooper was murdered in his police car in '68. A dying prisoner in a state prison reveals that after a shootout he stole a heroin block from the car. His case resumes with the assumption that he was corrupted as a policeman. <br /> <br /> Further investigation into him as a police officer and a man reveals a war veteran involved in forbidden love. This kind of love was considered shameful and at least hidden at this time. <br /> <br /> Although this is not the kind of love that I personally support, he was still a policeman and a man and he should not have died for it. The soundtrack was perfect (it allows me to watch DVR), and the selective use of black and white mixed with the color to emphasize one object or give a particular scene was particularly attractive. I will be watching this in a replay!
