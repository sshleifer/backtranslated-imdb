Rob Roy is an underestimated epic of passion and action! SOME MILD INSIDE SPOILERS. Liam Neeson gives a great performance as Rob Roy MacGregor, one of the best in his career. Jessica Lange is perfect as his wife Mary. They have the greatest passion and chemistry I've seen on the screen. the best snotty performance of the aristocrat. Tim Roth presents one of the great villains on the screen. His rape against Mary is abhorrent and shocking. He really is a wonderful bastard in this movie. Written screenplays and director Michael Caton-Jones is impeccable. 10 out of 10.
