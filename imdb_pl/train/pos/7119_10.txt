My father, Dr. Gordon Warner (ret. Major, US Marine Corps), was in Guadalcanal and lost his leg to the Japanese, and also received the Navy Cross. I was pleasantly surprised when I learned that my father was a technical advisor to this film and I hope it influenced the film, recalling how it was then, as I read in the various comments made by viewers of this film that seemed real. My father is a fanatic of facts and figures and he always wanted things to be seen the way they were, so I would like to believe that he has something to do with it. <br /> <br /> He currently lives in Okinawa, Japan, has married my mother for over 40 years (ironically, he is Japanese), and a few years ago he received one of the highest praise from the Emperor of Japan for his contribution and actions for the return of Kendo and Iaido to Japan because McArthur banned them after World War II. <br /> <br /> My father was once a naval soldier, but I know that once you are a sailor, you are always a marine. And that is exactly what it is and I love and respect it very much. <br /> <br /> I would like to be able to watch this movie if someone has a copy of it. And I'm happy to give it to my father for his 94th birthday this year!
