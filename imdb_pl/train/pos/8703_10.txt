I went to this film after reading that it was a drama about a man with a supernatural gift that was transformed into a monster by society. Suffice it to say that I was expecting something completely different from what I have. But it was a happy surprise. My friend and I thought that the movie is very romantic (the fact that male lead does not look bad, it certainly helped), and that there was enough plot, action and even humor (that it takes them to the third part of the movie to she had a name laughing all over the movietheatre to provide entertainment and invest in history, in short: not what I expected but a very good surprise, I will definitely buy this movie when it appears on DVD.
