Look, it's probably one of the best movies America has to offer the rest of the world. The hatred for this film is the hatred of freedom itself. I remember that the early 1980s were a time of uncertainty. The economy was weak, communism threatened us all, and nuclear damage was almost certain. A hero, Stroker Ace, came out of this confusion. Ned Beatty's performance in this film showed that he would never be cast as one dimension in the desert again. His triumph is an inspiration for everyone. The chemistry on the screen between Burt and Loni shows obvious comparisons with Brad and Jennifer. Jim Nabors is a poet. Go see this movie tonight!
