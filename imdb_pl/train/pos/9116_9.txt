The idea is a very intelligent title that has a serious language. But it is so subtle that you do not know how to read it! Are these guys doing a full comedy, is something else going on? The small dialogue that the film has is not too delicate, and that adds to the power of the film. If all the sound had been turned off from the movie, it would not take anything from the movie. Physical activity or the art of showing is so strong that it carries the whole story in itself. <br /> <br /> I am a blessing and thanks to the blessing there is shame. For the first time I am talking about this film as part of the "black" film festival. After watching the movie I was very impressed with the work. But then I asked myself what to do next? Where can someone else see this work? A common association of art without a purpose can not be found here. You can see the intention in the project from beginning to end. The use of African music in a style in which casting seems planned and for a reason. Character development is amazing. I think casting is the strongest aspect of the movie; characters are easily defined within 2 minutes of 6 minutes of the actual movie. <br /> <br /> We need to see more of these kinds of movies, we really need more support for the development of short films in the whole array.
