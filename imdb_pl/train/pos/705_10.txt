I came across Nightmare An Insomniac, looking for unconventional independent films and I'm glad that it did NOT let you down. This crazy half-hour drive made me wonder all the way, and the ending was perfect - one of the SOME moments that really stay with you. I showed it to many people and it seems that everyone agrees. The little ghostie girl was very talented and I think her performance stole the show. It frightened me, I can say so much. Nanavati did a great job, combining it briefly. All the songs just go together and you can say that she is a great writer from what she did with this script. So well written. This is undoubtedly the strongest part of the movie. The direction was great, and the acting was pleasant, but the most important factor is the power of the script. Good job for this girl, I can not wait to see more!
