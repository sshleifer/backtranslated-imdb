The Perfect Son is a story about two 30-person brothers, one of whom is seemingly "perfect" and the other is basically screwed, often landing in drug rehabilitation centers. After the death of their father, both of them are gathered after a long absence and the usual competition of siblings appears. It is only when the "perfect" brother issues a surprising revelation that he has AIDS, an irresponsible younger brother finally taking a step towards ordering his life and taking responsibility. <br /> <br /> The film is doing a nice job of chronicles the "return" of a younger brother, although it may seem a bit stretched at times (drug addiction is never so easy). What makes the film more fragile is the treatment of AIDS, a theme that has become a bit more exciting in the cinema in the last 5-10 years. And the development of the almost sweet relationship between the two formerly controversial brothers is very credible and well made. Both main actors were very competent, if not terribly charismatic. <br /> <br /> A solid first feature film by director and writer Leonard Farlinger, whose own brother died of AIDS. The ending is also nicely made. <br /> <br />
