Ti% s and As *, lots of tits. Some great characters, the fun filled with pranks and combined the action of teenagers in this movie of the Amercan Pie series. It seems to be a really OLD SCHOOL. I feel a bit like Porkys in the 2000s. A few great funny characters combined with very funny situations makes it a real surprise for me. <br /> <br /> While the original cast is almost absent, except for one, this movie was really funny. Do not get too excited, you have to take it for the comedy that it is, but for what it is, it stands out. The characters are friendly and funny, girls are hotter than hell. Games and games are fun, with some things I've never seen before in comedies, they make me tired, but I also laugh. <br /> <br /> So, ignore the haters and give everything you think. Do not expect a classic American Pie, but expect something that should make you laugh and get your attention for about an hour.
