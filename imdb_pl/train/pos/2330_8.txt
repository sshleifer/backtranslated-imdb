This program is good. I like acting, fun pieces and the sweetness of it. Actors, Lee Pace, Ann Friel ... etc., They all did a great job on the show. The concert started off well with the funny, illogical idea of ​​bringing dead people back to the first series and to be honest, as people said, the first few episodes of the second series were a bit disappointed, but later came back so well. And now I really hate that it will be canceled. Why will not ABC just let it end until all the episodes are over? I really want to know what the story will be like. I think you should give a chance because there are still so many viewers who love it.
