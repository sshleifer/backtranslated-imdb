I won this title by chance from Grindhouse Vol. 1 a collection of pure Euro-trash movies. But this movie has a nice sign of approval and should deserve better transfer than what is there. Stupid is not ... satisfying! Watching this movie, I could not resist thinking ... how was it that Sergio Martino did not make this movie? It has its signature everywhere and interrupted by Edwedge Fenech (unfortunately not as good as it should be, but got a good scene at Hostel II). Double crosses and triple crosses and cementing this film from beginning to end with Lee Van Cleef, which gives off a coolness under pressure from the first second. Did this guy have to go to Italy to finally reach his potential, did the studio system let this guy slip? In addition to Lee's more recognizable films, film viewers should try it out and see, as if Sergio Leone would lower his epic scale at once in America to half-time (and 1/4 of the budget) as it turned out. Refreshing, it should be taken during the day at home and make it a sofa on the couch
