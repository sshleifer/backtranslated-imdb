The things that are to come are indeed the classic work of speculative fiction; both an essay about the destructive nature of war and the fear of progress. This is a surprising, accurate presentation of the war that was to take place a few years later, but it is pathetically na√Øve in its utopian ideals. although drama is played more as a stage song than a movie. There are great, though slightly stiff speeches, often pronounced as if the actor tried to reach the back of the theater. However, there are some deep words. Is technology the savior of humanity or the tool of its destruction? The film is a visual feast if you can break away from the age of effects. Of course, Hollywood is more sophisticated today, but rarely as ingenious. For the imagination, the third act is a feast: a world with underground cities, massive deco bombers, space cannons, gyroscopic helicopters and secret organizations of saviors of scientists. It has all the advantages of the science fiction adventure, but instead uses traps for philosophical exercises. <br /> <br /> The things that come and the metropolises are the hallmarks of the Neolithic Hollywood science fiction cinema. They are operable in scope and visually inspiring. Technology has long left them, but their ideas are still exploding. There is an artistry that has more heart and emotion than today's computer generated mass cinema. These films are products of craftsmen, not industrialists.
