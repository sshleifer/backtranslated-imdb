My guess is that the reason why this movie did a good job at the box office is of course Eddie Murphy. I think it was his first movie since 'Beverly Hills Cop', so he was hot then. Considering that one of them produced more than two hundred million and it was R, and that it produced about 80 million and that was pg, it is said that it was not so popular. I've never been a huge fan of Eddie Murphy, so that's probably another reason why I did not care. He has Eddie as a seeker for missing children. He must find a golden child or the world is in terrible danger. The plot is very bad, but as bad as it is not comparable with special effects. I've seen better things done in the 70s than some of the things that this one offers, Ray Harryhausen did better. Still the main reason why you see such a movie is Eddie, unfortunately he is not too funny in this movie and it seems stupid to put him in scenes like "Raiders of the Lost Ark". I think they were hoping for a fish from the water effect, but it just did not work for me.
