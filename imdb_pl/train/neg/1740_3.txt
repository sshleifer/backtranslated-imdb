The film was a huge disappointment. Especially since he was led by Priyadarshan, it was sad to see such grim standards. Poor script (almost non-existent) and song sequences with bad songs every minute and in the most bizarre moments, they killed the humor that the film could offer. some of the scenes were fun, but they were probably only five minutes long. The edition was pathetic. Gloomy! overall, the movie failed because the lack of history was too obvious. In fact, only a few people remained who watched the second half of the movie after the break. <br /> <br /> Nobody would miss anything if you do not watch the movie. It's not worth spending valuable money on this movie. wait until it appears on TV ...
