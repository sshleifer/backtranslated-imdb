This movie really shows its age. The print I saw was awful because of the age, but it's possible that there are better prints there. However, this was not the main problem with the film. The problem was that although the film was made in 1933, it was basically a silent movie, in which only the lightest dialogue was dispersed (only a few sentences) in the most amateurish way. Sometimes the heroes' backs were reversed or talked with their hands on their faces - all in a pitiful attempt to cover their mouths and "cleaver" (?) Hides the fact that the film was dubbed. It's true that this Czech film would have to be dubbed in many languages, but doing it in this way was really stupid and obvious. It just looked cheap. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie looked low and stupid. It's really a shame, because there was a good story - a young woman who marries an elderly man who is either gay and / or not interested in women. But in the 21st century, few people would really like to sit in this archaic mess. EVEN with a few flashes of the naked (and somewhat massive) Hedy Lamarr, it is not worth all the confusion that accompanied the film when it debuted. Even according to the standards of 1933. This film was poorly made. The only interesting thing about this movie is to see how different Lamarr looked in 1933. In comparison to the spectacular image Hollywood created when it came to America - it looks like 2 completely different people. incompletely looking and technically worse film, I do not understand how it got such enthusiastic reviews. In the case of technical problems, the film itself can not evaluate 10 or anything nearby.
