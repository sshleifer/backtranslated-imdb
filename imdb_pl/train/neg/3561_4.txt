Stephen King's adaptation (script written by the King himself), in which a young family, newcomers to rural Maine, learn about a cemetery for animals near their home. Father (Dale Midkiff) then finds out about the cemetery of Micmac outside of the cemetery of domestic animals, which has the power of resurrection - only of course everything that has been buried there returns not quite RIGHT. it starts awkwardly, insultingly and ineptly, and lasts for some time, the absolutely worst element being the worthless performance of Midkiff. At the end it gets a little better, with a really worrying finale. In fact, the whole movie is really disturbing and that's why I can not reject it altogether - at least it has SOMETHING to remember it. A decent performance by Fred Gwynne as a wise older neighbor and Brad Greenquist, as Victor Pascow's disfigured spirit is not enough to really make the film. br /> <br /> Then the continuation of the sequel directed by Mary Lambert (is it strange that since then she has not worked in the mainstream of the film?). <br /> <br /> 4/10
