It is an extremely stupid and unseen film about slavery in West India, in which Puddy from the series "Seinfeld" plays! Patrick Warburton made his film debut in this imaginary film and is clearly thinner here. Oliver Reed got the highest bills, but he's not in the movie at all. Warburton plays a white slave and it's fun to see all the young and horny wives of wealthy old men bidding him, because everyone wants to have sex with him. Eartha Kitt plays the owner of bordello and there are so many nudity in the film. If it's not the drunken orgies at Bordello, his young wives have a turn with him. Then, of course, the slaves revolt towards the end and there is a bloody impasse. The lack of a real political message, such as the movie "Burn", but another imaginary story device to transfer the story. They made a great sequel, and Warburton and the rest of the cast came back! I hope they got a lot of cake, because this first movie is very bad. Nudity makes it observable, and the lack of Warcenton in any accent makes it sometimes funny. A very bad movie, but I must admit that I want to see the sequel.
