I totally agree with the other comment that somebody should do with the fear of this movie. <br /> <br /> It must be one of the worst French films I've seen in a long time (actually together with Brotherwood of the Wolves, 2 scary movies in too short a time). <br /> <br /> It's really sad because the cast is really interesting and the original idea is fun. Antoine DeCaunes in particular and Jean Rochefort being among my beloved, I was bitterly disappointed to see their disgrace in such a bad film. <br /> <br /> Lou Doyon is quite angry, as always, which proves that a pretty face and well-known parents can introduce you to the cinema, but they do not necessarily give you talent. <br /> <br /> avoid this movie if you want to laugh, watch instead Alain Chabata or some nice piece of fun LA FILLE DE D'ARTAGNAN.
