Oh, Sam Mraovich, we know that you tried so hard. It's your magnum opus, a great example for the rest of us, definitely deserving of the nomination for the Academy of Art and Film Science (as you will find on the website from the era of 1998). Unfortunately, it is better to be silent and be considered a fool than to speak and remove all doubts. With Ben and Arthur you do just that. <br /> <br /> Seemingly assembled with no instruction or education, the script of the movie leads us to a really weird one with every new scene. This is a crazy excuse for the story, which can also be the best ally of the film. Starting with summer homosexual titular characters, Ben and Arthur are trying to get married, even going to flight for this purpose, in the shade of the best Vermont palms. But all this is only an introduction to BLOOD. Then more BLOOD and MORE AND MORE BLOOD. My point is that in the last third of this movie there must be at least $ 20 for false makeup. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is a technical blunder. From sound to editing, from music, which consists of a single indistinct bass note held on the keyboard, it's a miracle that the film sticks even on any medium on which you view it. It's such a shame that some decent amateur performances are wasted here. <br /> <br /> It does not matter, Sam. I'm sure you've made five figures in this movie in lending or anything that drives poor souls (like me) to watch this movie. Unfortunately, we are not laughing with you.
