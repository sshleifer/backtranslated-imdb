I read the entire book "A wrinkle in time" and then saw the movie. The film contained all the elements of the book, but since the book had 190 pages, and the film had 2 hours, he felt really crowded with too many effects and bad actions. A girl named Meg, Charles Wallace and Calvin must work together to find Meg's father and leave the island of Camazotz. <br /> <br /> The beginning of the movie is really smelly. Acting is terrible, the direction is ridiculous, and so far situations are not necessary. I was really crushed seeing the same person Madeleine Engle, who wrote the book and created the movie, made a great book and a horrible movie. Acting is worse than any video game right away. Yes, I have to admit that there were cool effects. But seriously they were all done terribly and not serially in any way. If you read a book, you will be crushed by a movie. I would like to give him 0, but unfortunately I can only give him 1. Half could be useful.
