I have to say that the first time I watched this movie about 6 years ago and then I really liked it. I recently bought a DVD and after the second look I wondered why I like it. Acting was terrible, and as usual we have stereotypical clans in their false costumes. Acting was terrible at best. Tim Roth did a good job, like Liam Neeson, but I have no idea what Jessica Lange was thinking about. <br /> <br /> The plot was good, but the execution was simply poor. I'm tired of seeing Scotland as portrayed in movies. Braveheart was even worse, which is just a saving film. But seriously, people did not say that in those days, why should all actors have Glaswegian accents? Another film that tries to capture the essence of already tired and irritating stereotypes. I noticed that the only people who say that this movie is good are the Americans and to be honest, I see why they like it, I know they have men infatuated in Kilts. However, if you are thinking about buying a DVD, I would say that you will spend money on something else, for example a better movie.
