Once again, like Charlie's Angels, Inspector Gadget and Thunderbirds, the television series turns into a full-length movie and is ruined for all hundreds of people watched. Basically, Duke's cousins ​​Luke (Johnny Knoxville) and Bo (Seann William Scott) in Hazzard County spend a lot of time on fast-riding in The General Lee. But they must act together and stop the destruction of their family farm together with almost the entire city by the nasty Hoss Boss Jefferson Davis (Razzie appointed Burt Reynolds) to make room for a huge coal mine. They get help on the way from their sexy cousin Daisy (Razzie nominated Jessica Simpson) and uncle Jesse (Willie Nelson), being chased by equally vile sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane (M.'s Gainey) and the police. Starring Joe Don Baker as Governor Jim Applewhite, Jack Polick as Deputy Cletus Hogg, David Koechner as Cooter Davenport, Michael Weston as Deputy Enos Strate and Lynda Carter as Pauline. I think the only reason why I give the film an extra star is some impressive car feats and of course the great body of Simpson (I admit that her legs are not quite Catherine Bach, but still!), But otherwise it is quite boring. He was nominated for Razzies for the worst painting, The worst director for Jay Chandrasekhar, The worst remake or Sequel, The worst screen couple behind Simpson and her "Daisy Dukes" and The worst screenplay. Pretty poor!
