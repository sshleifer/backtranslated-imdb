This film is a disgrace to the Major League franchise. I live in Minnesota and I can not even believe they threw Cleveland. (Yes, I realize that the real Indians were quite good and the Twins took their place at the bottom of the American League, but they were still consistent.) Anyway, I loved the first Major League, I liked the other one and I could not wait for the third one when the Indians finally reach the series. You can not tell me that it was not a plan after finishing the second movie. What happened? In any case, if your real Major League fan will do yourself a favor and you will not see this trash.
