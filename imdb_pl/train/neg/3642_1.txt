Unfortunately, the film is more interested in creating a bad social commentary on a real event, but there is no ball to legally document what happened. Constant rhetoric about how you can not blame violent video games (I have the impression that Ben Coccio is an avid gamer), or whether media and music are completely devoid of influence, is an obvious message (we even get a funny scene of two boys recording ALL CDs, talking about subtlety!), but the movie avoids it only because it is "fiction." Nice try. Yes, it's a great idea to free the media from influence, but how do we know that the children who actually planned and performed the school shooting were not influenced by the media? or video games? We are not doing this and we are used to this movie because once again these kids are smart enough to completely give up the media and yet stupid enough to burn the Nazi symbol on the ground? haha I do not think so. <br /> <br /> The movie hits you with your representation of the normality of the families, almost damaging the thinking that there were no serious blemishes in the family of dynamic children who actually left and shot their schoolmates. Why do everyone so anxious that the killers seem "normal" when they are not? Completely false and false performance.
