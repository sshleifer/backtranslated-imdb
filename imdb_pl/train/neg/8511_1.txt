I could not, for my life, follow, discover or understand history. As the plot progresses, it also remains unintelligible. I'm guessing and I will say that there was a pre-production plot / plot problem that has never been resolved. Producers have never been able to separate the many details that a novel or any novel has, time and space to create from another idea, which was to make a film about a serial killer and a murderer by the police. It ended up with too many events in the forbidden time limit of the feature film. It is a pity only because they had a solid cast, a director who knows how to move things and perfect cinematography. In fact, a well-made movie with which you can enjoy and rest for a few hours.
