****** SPOILERY ****** <br /> <br /> A dishonest host of radio shows, Kyser and his average team, are a pretext for Lugosi, Karloff and Lorre to pick up the payment in this bland, sporadic watch haunted house parody. Lugosi is a mystic whose s√©ances reveal himself as a dishonest attempt to win the fortune of an heir; Karloff is a clerk, and Lorre is a professor who reveals false media, but it turns out that both are in a conspiracy with Lugosi. <br /> <br /> Of course, Kay Kyser and his team of 30-year-old "children" discover the truth with minimal possible humor along the way. I do not recommend to anyone except absolute horror.
