As far as I can tell you, despite previous comments published by other commentators, this video is currently available on DVD. I found this just a few weeks ago. <br /> <br /> It's on the Value DVD label and I paid a total of 98 cents plus tax. I found it in a 98-centimeter store among stands with plastic bowls and disposable chopsticks. Are not you, the people who have issued the beau coupe bucks on the superduper of the Swedish limited edition import, do you feel like you have? I thought so. <br /> <br /> This movie was really worth 98 cents. 99 cents, I can start arguing with you. But clearly worth 98 cents. And remember that talking about what you pay for. Only for filmmakers.
