This movie was so ridiculous that I did not even watch it. I thought someone created their own version and baptized it on a DVD from a movie store. This movie made me sick not because he was bloody, but because I wasted 2 50 on it !!!! It looks like my brother and I went home and did the film ourselves and edited the slaughterhouse material for it! I am so scared, even The BTK Killer deserves more than that it was not even accurate I mean that I go on the head of a cow was obviously made of dough or BUBBLE GUM. DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM !!!!!!!
