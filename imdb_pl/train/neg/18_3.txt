It is an artistic film that was made in 1969 or 1972 (the National Film Preservation Foundation says in 1969, and IMDb says in 1972). Regardless of the exact date, the movie definitely seems to be very indicative of this general period of time - with some camera and pop-art stylizations that are clean in the late 60's and early 70's. <br /> <br /> The movie consists of three simple images that are distorted using various strange camera tricks. These distorted images are accompanied by music and there is absolutely no dialogue or plot. Of course, it was almost like a form of performance art and, like most performances, it is interesting at first, but it quickly becomes tiresome. The film, more bluntly, is boring and would not speak to anyone but those who created this film, his family and friends, and maybe a few people just too fashionable and "with it" to make us understand mortals.
