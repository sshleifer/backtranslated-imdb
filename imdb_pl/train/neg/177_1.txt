If you plan to see this movie, consider again. I usually do not post my comments about something that I saw on television, but this one was so wasteful of my life that I had to do something productive to remove this bad taste from my mouth. It would take too much time to criticize this video because there are many errors in it. I will just say, please, never watch this movie. It was a complete waste of my time and it will be your loss. Anyone who wrote a positive review of this movie is one of two things; totally inept or working for the company that produced it. Again I guarantee that you really regret this movie!
