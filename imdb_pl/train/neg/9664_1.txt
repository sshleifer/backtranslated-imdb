This movie based on the book is really horrible and disappointing. We've been waiting for this move for a month. Many film reviewers have hoped for that. It made sense in the newspapers and on television as well. When it comes April 29, many people regretfully noticed that the movie is really terrible. Why? First of all, the story was so monotonous. There were many undefined scenes, sometimes it is difficult to understand what is happening. Actresses from Hulya Avsar were not harmonized with their roles, especially with Vildan Atasever. Works better in comedy movies. In this film, the kind of drama, she could not get rid of her previous role. Finally, the film is too short, only 66 minutes.
