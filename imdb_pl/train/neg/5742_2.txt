When I borrowed this movie from a friend (luckily I did not buy it) the package (which really looked bad and ugly) was printed "The ultimate vampire horror". After watching it, I thought that the marketing campaign was probably more expensive than the film itself. "History" begins when a teenager (surprise!) Is chased by some vampire / zombie-creature. <br /> <br /> Lighting, sound and everything reminded me of my first attempt to make a holiday video for a ten-year VHS system, if not worse. I gave the film 2 out of 10 and only because the promotional shirts looked pretty good. I do not want to generally deactivate film students or splashing videos, but I've seen Braindead and I've seen a student movie about $ 20, which was ten times better than that shit.
