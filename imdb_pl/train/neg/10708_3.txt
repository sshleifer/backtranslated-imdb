This film had the potential to be really good, considering that some plot elements were borrowed from the science fiction action of THE HIDDEN. And Dolph always gives him poor references to his roles. But someone somewhere really threw the ball at it. <br /> <br /> Dolph plays a monk kicking the ass (!) who travels to New York to retrieve the key that opens the door under his monastery that imprisoned the antichrist for 2,000 years. He must fight a servant who is a ghost who jumps from body to body, like HIDDEN and JASON GO TO HELL. The minion, of course, wants the key to let him release the antichrist. While driving, she is an annoying female archeologist and together she and Dolph are hunted down by bodies possessed by servants. <br /> <br /> If I make this sound funny, forget about it. Stimulation is very uncomfortable and slow, at best, the actor's shortcomings, and the battle scenes were bad. Dolph sleeps through his role and speaks the worst dialogue in his career. <br /> <br /> The cheese factor really rises at the end when the servant fights with the army of monks with machine guns in the monastery, but the rest of the movement is a snoozefest. <br /> <br /> It's a pity, I really wanted it.
