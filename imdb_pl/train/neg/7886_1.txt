I do not mind religious movies. I think religious people need something to watch on a Saturday night. But what really scares me off is the fact that writing on the DVD case does not indicate this to the potential viewer. Rejecting religious propaganda as entertainment is NOT cool, bro. <br /> <br /> And even if I was a religious person, I would have to agree with most other posters here, this movie was a mess. Poorly directed, badly played, badly edited, and the soundtrack was fun. The false accents were horrible, the characters were mainly stereotypes, and the continuity was outside the window. The only reason we sat through this poor waste of time was that it was too late to watch another movie. I should have just gone to bed. <br /> <br /> There's absolutely no way to redeem this movie, unless you're a religious type who will immediately support anything that preaches your beliefs to non-believers, even if it's a pile of rubbish. If not, avoid it at all costs. Do not be fooled by the description of the mailbox.
