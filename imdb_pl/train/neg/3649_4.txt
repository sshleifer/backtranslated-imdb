In fact, there is not much sex appeal in the series. What I notice is that the stimulation is not really tense in a typical way. There is a lot of humor at this concert. Sometimes it's just unpleasant to get to the climax. The theme from this series comes to the present MAD MEN show in terms of style. It is not that David Chase writes Mad Men, but the people who worked under him in The Sopranos, definitely imitated and inherited his seriously comic tone.
