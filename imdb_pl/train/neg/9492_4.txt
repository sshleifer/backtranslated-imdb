One star for "storyline". One star for the actor. One star for dubbing in an American squeaky voice. Five stars for Monika Broeke and Inge Maria Granzow, with their tendency to take off all clothes. And ten to ten for the divine Emmanuelle Béart, two years before the creation of "Manon des sources". Béart also undresses several times, but even her fully clothed presence is enough to make the film extremely visible. Watch out for the scene in which she tells her friend about the three "first times" for the girl. It is banal, but still much more erotic than quite funny choreographies "love scenes" with the participation of Broeke, Granzow and Patrick Bauchau. By the way, the pictures are not great; the cadres for the final points are a better indicator of what David Hamilton is capable of.
