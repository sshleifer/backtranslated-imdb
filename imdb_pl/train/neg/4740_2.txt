I am so offended by this movie, it is not even funny ... I thought that "Mulan" was unbelievable! No matter how low my expectations for Disney became, I never thought they would do something so stereotypical. There is no respect for any real Chinese culture, only the Hollywood tradition of random martial arts. <br /> <br /> I appreciate that they tried to make Wendy a normal teenager ... But fortunately, the most normal teenage girls - especially Asian teens - are much less obsessed with such shallow aspects of life. From the cultural point of view, it is almost impossible. Yes, there are girls who are very popular and fashionable, but they are quite rare. And even those who are still quite decent scholars. Maybe a different stereotype, but quite real. That's how Chinese parents work. That's how Chinese values ​​work. If they wanted to be genuine, they would make Wendy an ironic girl with glasses and loving hatred with her family. <br /> <br /> It only increases my frustration with American movies. Asian culture is not about meditation and unclear, nature-oriented phrases that sound wise. We do not go all the time smiling enigmatically all the time and we do not all know some form of martial arts. We are PEOPLE and I would appreciate it if someone wrote an Asian part that does not present us as a sad caricature.
