Why is this movie GOOD below standards? Ultimately, the answer lies in the poor, humorless scenario. Sluggish / medium-looking Travolta (looking rather elegant in black must say, even with HUGE color) and Gross behave very well as a pair of young "cute dressed," but still nervous New Yorkers eager to open their own nightclub. Besides, the rest of the movie is boring to watch. It's so boring that it's really not worth knowing what's happening at the climax of a movie at any level. Kelly Preston evidently exudes sex appeal, and a sexually charged dance with her future husband Travolta is one of the few pleasures in the film. Charles Martin Smith is quite funny when he looks at the KGB hockey player "Bob Smith." Personally, I think that the movie would have been better if the plot had been changed a bit, so that the settings would not change from NY to "Indian Springs, Nebraska" (meaning in the former Soviet Union?) - understand, if you see this movie ... Apparently this movie has been filmed in 1986, ready for release in 1987. I suppose Paramount got stuck in the film by January 1989 because of the unbelievable plot. It was reported that they considered it "impossible to recover". However, this $ 6,000,000 video earned just over $ 163,000 in revenue, as it was released only in BRIEFLY in places like Texas and Colorado before it went straight to the video. This shows the overall poor quality of this film.
