When it was released, I thought it was one of the most blasphemous movies ever made. However, thanks to Martin Scorcese and several other filmmakers like him, they were the main movies inferior, more linguistic than this .... but this is quite a brutal attack on the ears. Hey, I can do a lot, but it was funny. In the first six minutes I heard in vain half a dozen of the Lord's name and innumerable f-words. I wonder how many people came out of the theater watching it in 1990? I could not be the only one. <br /> <br /> No wonder some of the actors are Jennifer Jason-Leigh, Burt Young, Jerry Orbach and Rikki Lake. Since the film, Stephen Lang seems to improve his image, at least playing Godly "Stonewall" Jackson in "Gods and Generals". Lang's role here is completely opposite: perhaps the worst shoddy person in the film and a character who falls in love with a transvestite at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Depressing, grim, semi-pornographic, repulsive: these are just some of the adjectives people have used - even some liberal critics - in describing this story, which is even worse in the novel. Of course, some well-known critics, all of Libya's rulers, praised the film. However, they were the only ones. Most critics were disgusted, as were almost all paying audiences. It's unbelievable that anyone could praise dirt and such garbage. <br /> <br /> Trust me: there are no good, nice characters in this whole movie. It's a bad, sick movie: one of the worst "modern times". This means that if you do not like child abuse, drug abuse, teen prostitutes, indefinitely - two simple hours with the exception of cruelty and ordinary bad people. No thanks.
