Well ... I'm shaking, the original started in 1990 and I think the movie is quite pleasant to watch. however, they began to tremble II and III. Trust me, these movies began to fall right after they finished the first, I mean, assholes ??? Now only God alone is able to answer the question "why would they create one of these diving garbage in the name of God?" Tremors IV can not be considered a bad movie, in fact it can not even be considered the personification of a bad movie because it lives more than this. When I tried to sit down, I noticed that my eyes were bleeding and I hoped the girl from the ring crawled on the television and killed me. did they really think that dressing people who looked at other films as if we were from the wild west would make the movie (with exactly the same events) better? Honestly, I would never suggest buying this movie, I mean there are cheaper ways to find things that are good.
