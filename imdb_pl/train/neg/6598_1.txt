This "movie" is a parody. No, wait - abomination. NO, WAIT - this is undoubtedly the worst movie ever made with the beloved characters created and created by other actors. <br /> <br /> I thought "Inspector Clouseau" with Alan Arkin (!) Instead of Peter Sellers it was ridiculous and sacrilegious, but even the audacity of "remake" Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are stupid and earn money. <br /> <br /> Mr. Laurel and Mr. Hardy have been dead since 1957 and in 1965. Why would anyone even imagine that the appropriate updates for L & H will be in the person of Bronson Pinchot, and Gailard Sartain is beyond me. I set myself on full expectation that I would be terrified and embarrassed and certainly not disappointed. Everyone involved in this pathetic, moronic disgrace should be deprived of everything and everything related to Hollywood and the movie. AVOID THIS FILM AT EVERY COST - YOU HAVE NOT BEEN ALLOWED.
