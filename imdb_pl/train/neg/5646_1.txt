A completely predictable, stupid representation of a man who killed his wife, mowing her while driving and claiming he lost consciousness. Why did he still drive a car? Why do you still feel able to drive a car, killing your wife with one? This question did not come to writers. The story is about a psychologist and her failed marriage, which is associated with a failed marriage that kills the driver's wife. The all-knowing mother and one-dimensional child are thrown in for good, and the whole is based on a predictable solution and breakdown of the finale. Are the police so easily accepted? A dead letter with which the actors do everything in their power, but are doomed to fail. This is on par with Romance Harlequin. Do not waste time watching this unless you like it.
