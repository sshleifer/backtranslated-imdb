I saw this movie in New York. I waited for the bus the next morning, so it was 2 or 3 in the morning. It was raining and I did not want to wait in the PORT AUTHORTY. I crossed the street and saw the worst movie in my life. It was so bad that I decided to stay and see the whole movie. I have not seen anything else since. He was 69 years old, so call me crazy. I just stayed because I could not believe it .........
