Observing this, I noticed mainly the advertising space. DHL, Aquawhite stripes, Rockstar and others. This is one place after another. It is quite obvious how this film received funding. Acting by Jessica Simpson is ridiculous. Every Dick should never get a job because he plays the same lame figure. "History" is just the background for this very long advertisement. I can not believe that this movie was even taken into account in the cinema distribution. The longer you watch this movie, the more you are ashamed of everyone involved. The only small saving grace is Larry Miller and Rachael Lee Cook, who have almost no screen time as Jessica's cousin. I'm embarrassed that I watched the whole thing. I recommend avoiding this.
