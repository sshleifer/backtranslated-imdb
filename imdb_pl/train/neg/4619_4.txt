Let me first say that I love stories from westerns and civil war. I also think John Ford is a great director. I also have the same high feelings for the acting abilities of John Wayne and William Holden. <br /> <br /> I do not remember if I saw this movie when it first appeared in 1959. <br /> <br /> As for my 4th rating, I can say that I did not like the movie. <br /> <br /> Now I will try to tell some of his flaws. <br /> <br /> John Lee Mahin, who wrote the script from Harold Sinclair's novel, was a very talented writer and wrote many great scripts. This script is badly written and badly researched. They mention the terrible conditions of the prison in Andersonville. Andersonville did not work during the film. They also use rifles that were not used then. <br /> <br /> John Ford has directed films for over 40 years and won 4 Oscars. He must have been sick while doing this. He lacked the usual style. It may have been a movie in the south and east, not in Monument Valley. <br /> <br /> He usually had a player company that he used in almost all of his movie, but this time he missed MOST. This time only small cowboys Hoot Gibson and Ken Curtiss have roles and of course Anna Lee has a small role. There were no other face friends except for 3 stars. (see below) Mr. Fords's joint-stock company made most of his films the classics they were; Unfortunately, it was missing here. <br /> <br /> Now we come to the main stars of John Wayne and William Holden. The prince also had to be sick, he seemed out of place. This kind of role matched his style perfectly, he was just right here. Wiliam Holden did what he could, but nowhere was he as good as usual. <br /> <br /> An actress was required in this film. Here in her first main role (the second movie) is Constance Towers, a very beautiful person, but she is not really an actress, she still has roles on television. Let me be polite and say that she had a long career, more based on her appearance than her acting talent. Also in caas as a servant Towers is Tennis Star Althea Gibson. I'm glad that she kept to tennis. <br /> <br /> The rest of the production was far from the usual high standard of other John Ford films. several military songs allegedly performed by a marching cavalry, not very good at all. The action scenes were good, but they appear at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Ratings * 1/2 * (out of 4) 47 points (out of 100) IMDb 4 (out of 10)
