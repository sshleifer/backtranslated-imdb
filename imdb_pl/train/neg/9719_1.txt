Ummm, forgive me, but you did not lack more than half of the character? In the original novel, Valjean is a man imprisoned for 19 years for stealing a loaf of bread, and then a few attempts to escape. He breaks parole and is constantly being hunted by police inspector Javert. There are MANY characters along the way that were not in this version. It is worth mentioning Fantine, Cosette, M & Mme. Thenardier, Eponine, Marius, Gavroche and Enjolras. The only character with the same name is Javert. Throughout the movie, I was confused and frustrated trying to see how it was in any way connected to Victor Hugo's epic novel.
