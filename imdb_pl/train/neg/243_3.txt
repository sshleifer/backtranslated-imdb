The main character of this movie is William Russ. He left his family to come back and pay off his debts. But he tries to stay away from his family. This is the place where Peter Falk (Colombo) enters, playing several different roles to convince him to return home. <br /> <br /> The story is average and they managed to get the former star (Peter Falk) and use it quite well. But William Russ was not really a star. However, it seems that his acting is still OK. <br /> <br /> I think delivery and history are very bad in how everything is predictable. In fact, for the last 20 minutes I could almost dictate word for word before it happened. A good movie should never be like that. <br /> <br /> In all, it was a sub-par movie. In the grading system, she would receive "D".
