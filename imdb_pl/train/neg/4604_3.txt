I need to pat my back for watching this movie because it was really painful. Incapable painter becomes a fully capable murderer? This film abounded in the absurdities that I mentioned that I would give out a movie. Norm Peterson, also known as George Wendt, really must be in the rut to agree to this movie. Acting was deplorable, and the story was even worse. As a rational and rational individual, I could not understand where the writer came from or where he was going with this film. Each main character was inept, he was a string of unfortunate and funny events, and then the movie ended. One absurd act after another with dialogue does not create a movie, it only causes a talkative wreck of the train.
