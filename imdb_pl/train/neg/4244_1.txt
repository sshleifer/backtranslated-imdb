Against my principles, let me first come to the conclusion, because I just saw this piece of "art" and I am still under strong impressions. The reader is asked to forgive my stronger vocabulary. <br /> <br /> Well, this movie is absolutely horrible and I would never bother writing a single word about it, if it were not for the fact that "44 minutes" I got sick to death, which is rare for me. The fact that I paid for it does not make me feel better, and also the fact that the film deserved a high rating here. <br /> <br /> So what's wrong with the movie? It has a fashionable title - "44 minutes". First you think about "15 minutes", which by the way is a much better movie, but they are still bad in my book, and you can actually compare them to some extent. But, thankfully, the things they share are their worst features. Both have Oleg Taktarov, who with his strong Russian accent clearly meets popular expectations and prejudices. Its purpose is to appeal to the mind of the Cold War. Ah, we miss the good old times. Now I am not suggesting that he is a bad actor, I have yet to judge his real performance, but he is not simply a real unit, he is rather an archetype. How one can afford such things is completely beyond my comprehension. We can recognize contemporary American xenophobia here. The point in the film in which Taktarov explains to his companion that Romanians are not Germans and that they are in America is really funny. Should we assume that the greatest desire of a wretched duo is to become "real" Americans? <br /> <br /> Then there's the media issue. Yes, it seems that the majority of what we learn comes from cameras, interviews and reporters. The director should make us feel the 44-minute guessing rhythm. Instead, we're bored with interviews throughout the movie, like on a cheap TV show, trying to rediscover the wheel. Within 15 minutes, the issue of media is a central issue. The point is presented in such a way that the teacher turns to the dull student, but it deserves a separate comment, we are now focused on 44 minutes. I tried to identify the purpose of this movie. What is this? To ensure good time for the public? Praise the weapon? Should you glorify the police? Introduce violence? Oh yes, the officer gives the Bible to underage criminals. So in the end, he must promote peace and understanding? I do not think so, but do not ask me. I only know that I did not like it. <br /> <br /> Ah, Michael Madsen. I admit, I am a big fan. I was hoping it would be a bright spot, but I was wrong. However, it is not his fault. <br /> <br /> As a last remark, comparing "firepower" with "willpower" at the end of the movie was one of the worst lines I've ever heard. <br /> <br /> In summary, I give it a clean, unadulterated one on a scale of 1-10.
