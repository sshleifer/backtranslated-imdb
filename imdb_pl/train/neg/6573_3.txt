I read the reviews and, not expecting Ryan's savings, I was expecting a movie about a substance. <br /> <br /> The film begins on both sides from the usual intro of history and from how the unit was created. But immediately it is 1944 and you are not sure where everyone is. Accents etc. They are very weak, because this unit is supposed to be Hawaiian / Asian, but everyone speaks very poorly about the Japanese Harvard English imitation. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 3 out of 10 because after 10 minutes I could not see it anymore. The figures were 1 dimensional, and although they were most likely based on real people, I did not have feelings for them, and I did not care. Very poor direction of a very average TV movie that will be shown at midnight on some cable channels. I would avoid and look for better efforts. <br /> <br /> It's a good story, but it deserves a better story. You have a feeling that the director saw a band of brothers and thought it was enough to sell his movie. My advice, avoid and watch a team of brothers, fliers Tuskegee, Glory or other movies, as when the trumpet disappears ...
