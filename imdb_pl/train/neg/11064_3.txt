Well, it's hard to add a comment after reading what's already here, but I feel I have to say something. I did not look for a "splatterfest" exactly, as someone says, and even "blood and guts". I have respect for relatives of the victims, although I really felt that the filmmaker was NOT. - They were nameless, without faces and meaningless. Only a vessel for the sexual pranks of Dahmers. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie with such morbid curiosity that makes me think, "What makes a guy a serial killer?" as well as wonder about the specificity of Dahmer's story, about which I know very little. People here think that the film did not have to include events from Dahmer's history. his story, what happened when he was caught, consequences etc, but THIS IS IMPORTANT! You see, I assume if you're an American, KNOW everything. We do not all live in America. In order to tell this story about such a man as he was obvious, he REQUIRES that at least SOME of history and events should be told / shown. This does not mean that blood and guts are ways to show the terrifying things in the movie through implication or clever filming without resorting to the top. Not even touching what he did (I found out more about him reading the comments of users on this site!), The film seemed empty. A moment of time with a very small amount of substance. I would like to know if there is a movie about REAL Dahmer, because of the lack of direction, VERY slow pace that NEVER changes, A strange portrait of homosexuality and VERY unfortunate lack of any ending attempt, this movie is POOR. I do not recommend to anyone that they are wasting the time needed to watch. Definitely 1 in 10 (for an actor!)
