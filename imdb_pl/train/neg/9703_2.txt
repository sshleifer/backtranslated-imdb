For those who are too young to know or for those who have forgotten, Disney almost fell into decline in the late 1980s. People have NOT watched their films anymore and the company did not produce ordinary healthy material ... at least not what people expected. The main problem: vulgarity. <br /> <br /> Yes, Disney's idiots in this decade have produced films with curses - including the name of the Lord in vain, if you can believe it - intertwined movies in these "families." "In fact, it happens twice in the first 20 minutes! <br /> <br /> This film, apart from language problems, also has a nasty tone, which made it unlike almost from the very beginning. Fortunately, Disney woke up and produced many great materials since the decade movies from the 80s. ("Touchstone" is Disney, under a different name.)
