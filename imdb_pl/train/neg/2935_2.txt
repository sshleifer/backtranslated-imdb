(Rating: 21 by The Film Snob.) (See our What-To-See-Next blog for detailed information about our rating system.) <br /> <br /> Here's a video that will make you hook your own face an attempt to get relief from the boredom of the screen. <br /> <br /> You will not twist your hands, roll your eyes or sigh to popcorn. Not really. For the movie * this * sleep, only the claws on your face will do. <br /> <br /> When you start scratching your face - if you have to, you have to start! - start from the bottom. You will need your upper part, with handy tear ducts, intact for the tearing third action that can lead you to your knees if you can not get away from the whole theater anymore. <br /> <br /> In the season celebrating Joe Six-Pack and Hockey Moms as the new Golden Standard for leadership and foreign diplomacy, if the film of boredom is accepted as a thing that everyone can create. * Watching * is however a much more dangerous undertaking. <br /> <br /> Here's our story ... <br /> <br /> Sidney Young, London's fourth-tier celebrity and entertainment publisher, will soon see his magazine end. He needs a miracle and he gets a phone call from New York in the USA. <br /> <br /> The editor of Sharp magazine, Clayton Harding (played by Jeff Bridges) says: "Come, work for me! With your own employees faxing in your apartment / office in the background, saying "Yes" is mindless. <br /> <br /> Soon, Sidney works in New York doing all the bad things. His interviews involve asking Broadway music directors if they are (1) Jews, and (2) gays. <br /> <br /> He kills a dog with Sohpie Maes, the hottest movie industry star, when he leaves him in the warehouse office during a business lunch. <br /> <br /> This is the place of bad luck for everyone, because Sidney imagines, among other things, that he is in love with Maes before he wakes up in the form of the Dunstas. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that it totally alienates Alison Olsen (played by the naughty script frenzy Kristen Dunst), a friend assigned to show him links to the magazine * and * The Big Apple. (Of course, we've been in the movie before, so we know how this relationship will end. That's why we need intact tear channels for the third act of the movie.) The problem with The Thing is that the scenario just never he is not boiling, except for one piece of tears, in which True Love wins. <br /> <br /> The publisher Harding is supposed to be a son -bitch, who also just wants to quit his job. However, the scenario will never come to one or the other side of this dichotomy, and Bridges stays twisted and wafted in the wind. <br /> <br /> Alison Olsen is to despise Sidney Young, but whenever he comes to her (as he always does), he engages him in conversation, instead of trying to discourage his existence. <br /> <br /> The "comedy" of the early stages is built around a pig-destroying hotel room, then taking the elevator down to urinate on high-heeled celebrity shoes during a cocktail party. <br /> <br /> The hot star Maes confesses that she is attracted to Young because she is "wounded". "However, the character never shows us * why * he is injured. This is another resultant of the deadly wounded screenplay. <br /> <br /> In one hour and fifty minutes, this case seems longer (and more lethal) than Napoleon's retreat from Moscow. It is uninspiring, ridiculous, impossible to recover, and even not for rent. Escape
