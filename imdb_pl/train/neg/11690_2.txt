It is a belt for giving such great actors in such a weak and boring movie. In addition to all unanswered questions in other comments, what is so difficult to get thieves? Simply eliminate the bank's employees, see who was in the bank - from all angles of the camera recording - before the robbers' entrance, and the additional 4 other robberies among the hostages. Where is the tension that every body talks about? It was so obvious that when the hostages were asked to change in the same uniform, they all had to go out the door ... they saw it many times. At least Mr. Spike Lee could make a movie for good music and shoot artistically. The movie is not worth it. Pronto!
