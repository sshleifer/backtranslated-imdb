The most embarrassing moment in this movie is the moment when Brady Corbet says "You bloomed" at the end of the movie. I almost died. I'm still not sure why screenwriters put this line there. Was this supposed to create an affair? Because it almost made me sick. <br /> <br /> The rest of the script was almost as bad. <br /> <br /> I never liked the original Thunderbirds, but Thunderbirds had the potential to do it. This movie is not. If he did not have a Thunderbirds big draw card, he would be moved directly to the television or post-production. Maybe even earlier. <br /> <br /> As I said, the best thing about the movie is that the credits are spinning and playing Busted's song "Thunderbirds are go". I can not believe I've wasted $ 7 watching it through pay-per-view.
