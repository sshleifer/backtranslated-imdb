What can I say. <br /> <br /> "What the Bleep do we Know" has reached almost impossible - leaving behind such masterpieces of the genre as "The Postman", "The Dungeon Master", "Merlin" and fourthly, it will go down in history as the worst a movie I have ever seen in its entirety. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is really impressive because I've seen a lot of bad movies. <br /> <br /> This masterpiece of modern cinema consists of two interwoven parts, alternating stupid and imaginary story about an extremely annoying photographer, abandoned by her husband and forced to take anti-depressants to survive, and a group of talking heads, telling stories about how quantum physics supposedly justifies their pseudo-philosophy of the new aga. Essentially, if you start your day off meditating like Enya and Kenny G, this movie is for you. If you have a sense of humor, a crowd of people who know how to have fun and a good portion of a good weed, this movie is also for you. Otherwise, stay away. Tell me your word. <br /> <br /> The first thing that hit me in "What the Bleep do you know" is that it seems to be edited and combined by the same people who make cheap camera weddings with pink effects hearts, computer-generated sparks on the screen and other selected fools. Who allowed these people to be near the cinema premiere is a mystery to me. I think that's what Kenny G. is doing too much. The movie was steeped in cheesy GCI, similar to what you or I can produce on our computer with over-the-counter video editing software, but it never happened because it's It's just too funny. <br /> <br /> the script was written by someone who did not have any writing experience. All characters and conversations were not only troublesome and invented unbelievable, but "writers" had the impression that they had to push every important information, or rather disinformation, about what is going on in most of the film. your throat. Well, considering the target group, maybe it was not a bad idea. The main character, for example, spends half the movie popping pills. It seems, however, that this was considered insufficiently convincing, so there are at least a few dialogues that relate in particular to her anxiolytic pills, just in case the viewers could not combine her excessive pain and suffering with the small white pills that she takes after each together when he feels down. Acting ... Well, I've seen a better performance in Ed Wood's films and no, that's not an exaggeration. Heck, the little game I played when I was 12 was much more inspiring. It really was. <br /> <br /> The story is interrupted here and there with a band or random talking heads, a strange mix of kooky scientists, kooky doctors and self-proclaimed mystics who talk about how quantum physics supposedly provides an "explanation" of how a man or woman created their own reality by participating in the experience of life. Reality, as you see, is a field of probability with many different possibilities and is set in stone as soon as the Watcher chooses to notice it. What happens when more than one Observer does not speak, but then who cares. Listen, Enya, meditate, watch, and you will be God, and no one has anything against such stupid and archaic things as critical thinking, logic, etc. All reason is immediately rejected when people are stuck in their ways and are unable to achieve "change paradigm "and" go down to the rabbit's den. " Moreover, the Heidelberg Principle of Uncertainty is apparently proof of alternative realities, parallel universes and such. <br /> <br /> Speaking of rabbit holes, the analogy permeates the film. All these people talk about getting off the rabbit holes. I'm not sure what that had to do with anything they said or showed, but I'm sure it somehow involves anal sex. In fact, the film is very anti-sex. Sex is depicted as dirty, ugly and anti-enlightening all the time. <br /> <br /> In any case, talking heads say, the main character achieves harmony and enlightenment by painting hearts all over his body with a magic marker and goes around with even more stupid eyes than before. <br /> <br /> I want 2 hours of my life. <br /> <br /> Here are some random quotes that I accidentally remembered: <br /> <br /> "What I think is unrealistic has become much more real to me and what I thought was real, it is often a lot less real than an unreal one. "- Some people talk about the spirituality of quantum physics. <br /> <br />" What do you need one man to have an erection? Just one thought. Nothing changes outside, all changes are inside And yet he has an erection "- Some self-styled mystic, the head of her own school of enlightenment. <br /> <br /> [looking at himself in the mirror]" I hate you! I hate you! You are ugly! I have you! - the main character, fat and ugly photographer.
