Hey HULU.com is playing Elvira's horror movie on your site, and this movie is called Monsteroid, it's fun to watch Elvira's comments on this bad movie ... Have fun with bad movies. In any case, this movie has a really small value, besides, how good the 70s look like in the movies of horror Bad Effects, Bad Dialog, just bad film making. Avoid this unless you want to laugh about it. While you're in HULU, check out the other movies that they have in their possession, there are 10 episodes, and some are pretty decent movies with a good story and production. You can watch many of them at 480p resolution, if you have a decent speed combination.
