I almost called HBO and demanded a refund for the month just because they were broadcasting this movie. I can just see movie directors sitting around, "Okay, we have to come up with something that's similar to Home Alone, just add a handful of cash for the kid, we'll hire low-paid actors, and oh yeah, we'll make it a lot less fun ! "<br /> <br /> Okay, maybe not the last part, but it's basically what you have here. You do not even want to see them if someone else rents them. And as a movie for children? Forget about it. I would not let my children see this, not necessarily because of the bad taste jokes, but because I would not like them to say, "What do you think, showing us this bad piece of rubbish, Dad?!?!"
