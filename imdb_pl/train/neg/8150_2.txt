If you want a less demanding and reasonably entertaining hour, you can watch it. It really is not that bad. Yes, it has more logical errors than I would like to describe here and it can tax the patience of people - like me, I must admit - who are willing to throw things to the TV on the occasion, but it's at least fun. Just because it's not always FUNNY funny, there's no need for it to let you down. <br /> <br /> However, if you have read the book - or any other Brookmyre book - it's probably best to avoid it. I read them all and when I first saw the movie, I despised it. In fact, I destroyed it in detail and for a long time on another website. The television story has virtually no meaning for this book and only served to outrage and enrage many of the faithful (and admittedly angry) Brookmyre fans. <br /> <br /> The best advice ...? Observe this, then read the book and only THEN do your comparisons and submit your judgment.
