He is not the best acting film. The director focused more on the stardom of the projected actor than on giving a good artist. He can be a hero, his family and sincere fans can enjoy him. But definitely not worth the neutral audience. Combat sequences are a total comedy. Dance moves in song sequences are pathetic. Music is mediocre. This movie was the biggest flop for the actor. Despite the noise caused by the film, the movie failed. Do not even think about watching this movement, even if you want to kill time. Instead, you can watch cartoons. A good movie buff can not digest this crap for 2 1/2 hours.
