Now I turned it on by curiosity and I had to watch it - in the same way as watching a car accident ... <br /> <br /> I appreciate the fact that it's a parody, but that should not stop criticizing horrible directing, acting and dialogue . Seriously, I rated it as one of the poorest movies I've seen - more like the episode of Tales from the Cryptkeeper, and this one was bad ... <br /> <br /> Okay - some critical remarks (1) when the doctor had a heart attack before the monster ( we never see a monster attacking him, so we assume his heart attack), the army then shoots bullets, rockets, bullets into the monster - which was the feet of the doctor - but the doctor is not touched by any rocket and is still alive (2) army attack from a distance about 100 yards, and we see that you are using a flamethrower - these things have a range of no more than 30 meters! (3) when the monster tries to take the professor, the soldiers run into the classroom and shoot at the ceiling; the monster drops the child, and the soldiers do not try to shoot the monster ??? come on! (4) the monster looks like something from Power Rangers! (5) there is one scene in which five "good" (priest, girl, doctor, reporter and kid) look shocked and receive reactions (along the lines from hands to mouth) one by one - so natural! (6) the general just runs away, every time (7) the general refuses to try electricity and does not listen (8) the acting is terrible (9) did I mention the monster with a rubber suit ???? (10) this horrible music, all the time!
