I recently watched Belle Epoque, thinking it could be wonderful because he won an Oscar for the best film in a foreign language. I was a little disappointed with the predictability and simplicity of the film. Perhaps the conflict that I had was that from the moment of making the film so far, the story of a man who fell into the hands of beautiful women and eventually fell in love with a good girl, was made so many times. In addition to the predictability of the story, some of the scenes in the movie did not fit the story (eg. Some event at the wedding). Sometimes the film was a bit polite in its ideas and in relation to the Franco era the film was embedded in the church. The only thing he filmed was the wonderful moments, the scenery and the character of Viola, who was a strong, independent woman in a time when women were not really associated with these qualities.
