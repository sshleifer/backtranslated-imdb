*** Includes Spoilery *** <br /> <br /> I did not like this movie at all. <br /> <br /> I found this incredibly boring and rather superficially made, regardless of the significance and depth of the proposed topics: taking into account that in the end we have to die, how should we approach life? In a "light" manner, like Tomas; in a "hard" way like Tereza; should we find ways to avoid answering this question, like Sabina? How important is loyalty in a relationship? How much professional life can be mutilated for the good of our relatives? How much do we have to involve in the political life and social problems of our country? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I did not read Kundera's novel, but after I was disappointed in the movie, I certainly want to understand if the story was ruined by the adaptation of the film (which is in my opinion) or whether it was boring from the beginning . <br /> <br /> I do not agree with most of the positive comments that defined the movie as a masterpiece. I just do not see the reasons. What I see is a lot of disadvantages and an example of them. <br /> <br /> 1) The three main characters are thrown at you and it is very difficult to understand what drives them when making decisions. <br /> <br /> 2) "Secondary" characters are just to fill the gaps, but they add nothing to the story and you wonder if they are really necessary. <br /> <br /> 3) Not like the incarnation of Tomas. Nothing is good for him. He is so egocentric and selfish. In a sense, he is not a human being. But when his self-confidence fails and he realizes that he depends on others and is emotionally connected with someone, I did not consider the interpretation credible. <br /> <br /> 4) It is unlikely that an artist like Sabina could afford her lifestyle in a communist country in 1968. In addition, the three main heroes succeed in their professions, which seems strange to me. a) How can Tereza become such a good photographer? b) how can they do it well in a country that does not have all the economic incentives that usually motivate people to succeed? <br /> <br /> 5) The false accents of English spoken by actors are ridiculous. And I'm not even my mother tongue. What's more, the letter Sabina receives while in the United States is written in Czech, which I consider to be very inconsistent. <br /> <br /> 6) Many comments praised the film saying that Prague was beautifully made: I think that most of the film was shot on the spot, so it's not difficult to give the film a feeling of Eastern Europe, and taking into account the inherent beauty of Prague, it is even difficult to make it look good. <br /> <br /> 7) I found the end a bit trivial. Tereza and Tomas, finally happy in the countryside, far from the temptations of "metropolises", away from social struggles in which fellow citizens live, detached from working life, die in a car accident. But they die when they realize they are happy. So what? If the dead were unhappy, would the message of the film be different? I do not think so. I thought it a cheap way to please the audience. <br /> <br /> 8) The only thing in the movie that is unbearably bright is the way the director introduced the characters. You see them for almost three hours, but in the end you have nothing left. You do not feel empathy, you do not relate to them, you are on the couch, watching the sequence of events and scenes that have very little to say. <br /> <br /> 9) I hated it, stop the music in the restaurant scene (which praise some of the comments). Why does Sabina have such a strong reaction? Why is Franz agreeing with her? I really do not see the point. The only thing you learn is that Sabina has a very bad temperament and quite strong personality. this is it! What is so special and unique about it? <br /> <br /> After all these negative comments, let me say that there are two scenes that I really liked (that's why I gave him two). <br /> <br /> "Naked Women Photoshoot", where jealousy, jealousy and uncertainty of Sabina and Tereza are beautifully presented. <br /> <br /> The second scene is the one that represents the investigation after the occupation of Praga by the Russians. Photographs Tereza, made to inform the world about what is happening in Prague, are used to identify people involved in the riots. I find this to be quite original, and Tereza's sense of despair and guilt is well presented. <br /> <br /> Finally there is a small possibility that the movie has been deliberately "designed" in such a way that "Tomas types" go to like it and "Tereza" will hate it. If that is the case (though I doubt it strongly), my commentary should be drastically changed.
