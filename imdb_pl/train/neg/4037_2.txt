I have no idea what The Shield producers tried to do, but the result speaks for itself: The Shield is virtually unseeable. <br /> <br /> Apparently appearances on The Shield are great ... <br /> <br /> In fact, the show is so badly connected that you can not really see performances. For example, editing cuts off reaction shots before they reach their full effect. <br /> <br /> I do not know what is intellectual about it, but it deprives it of showing all emotions. <br /> <br /> I give The Shield one point for ambition in the subject, but that's all I can give. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that I see many talented performers are wasting their present on something so weirdly filmed.
