My first full Heston movie. A film to which everyone already knows the end. "Sci Fi Thriller". Campy factor. Everything that happens with this movie got injected into my head when I rented it, and in the morning when I watched it, it was the perfect movie to watch in the mood I was in. (Do not want to move.) Insert player, hide in blankets ). And although I tried to understand what is going on to bring about the ending, which will be eternally ruined by pop culture, it just did not happen. Everything was everywhere, relationships had no backbone, the ending had no admission. Everything was just there in some bizarre way, and the observer had no choice but to leave half-stunned at the end he would reach, because even though we all know it's people, it's a quick answer to WHY people are making any serious attempt enjoy the movie for everything other than stupidity thrown out the window.
