This horror is really weak ... I mean, if it's the right movie I'm commenting on. Nothing terrible happens when the family receives a lovely little German Shepard puppy. I had German Shepard and this is a really good dog. I did not, however, get the idea to get it from this movie, but rather from the comedy "K-9". However, this is another story. This movie really does not have much fear in it because the most frightening scene is at the end and it looks really tacky. We also see that the guy almost put his hand to the mower. The point is. However, the father suspects something, because his family seems to be quite strange, he learns somewhere if you keep a mirror for them while you sleep or can you see them. All in all it's a very weak horror, even according to television standards ... TV movies that work, are there as "This House Possessed" are quite good and there is another haunted movie about a woman and these strange creatures that are rather good. This one is really boring.
