This is the story of two guys who found a copy of "Funky Monkey". Finding this seemed strange at the time, when it turned out that there were still posters for the film in the local Cineplex Odeon. After watching such classics as "Every Which Way But Loose" and "Project X", these two guys realized that movies with monkeys are amazing. <br /> <br /> These guys were on a long ride when they watched the movie. There was a monkey that was replaced by a stuntman when action sequences were required. It was evident that the monkey was not trained in the school of Shakespeare's acting. Perhaps replacing the monkey Ben Affleck would help the boys think. <br /> <br /> Maybe a strong helper would help Jackie Chan, and maybe even Hulk Hogan. Fortunately, this movie had an amazing war artist and Jet Li looking like Matthew Modine. While some say that Matthew Modine is not getting close to Jet Li, the camera tricks prove that he is just as good. When it becomes obvious that an untrained chimpanzee can not cope with a movie, the movie is based on Matthew Modine to be a real star. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that there is some strange kid who develops a bond with Modine and the monkey? Is it possible for a kid to learn self-confidence and even choose a girl from this movie? Even Matthew Modine should be jealous of this (because using the pick-up line "I'm the second fiddler for a monkey" does not seem to work with women.) Shortly after seeing this, the two boys got a phone call from Matthew Modine. a, telling them "Seven days."
