NATURAL BORN KILLERS (1994) <br /> <br /> Cinema Cut: R <br /> <br /> Cutting the director: NC-17 <br /> <br /> This is an unusual photo of Oliver Stone, but when I read that he was on drugs while filming, I did not need further explanation. "Natural Born Killers" is a risky, crazy movie that we do not get very often; strange, psychotic, artistic images. <br /> <br /> "Born killer" is basically a story about how two mass murderers were popularized and glorified by the media; there's a great scene where the interviewer asks teenagers about Mickey and Mallory, and the teenager says, "Murder is bad ... but if I was a mass murderer, I'd be Mickey and Mallory." Mickey describes this situation "Frankenstein (monster) and Dr. Frankenstein" - Dr. Frankenstein is the media that turned them into these monstrous killers. <br /> <br /> Most of Oliver Stone's films explores the disadvantages of America, a country that the director loves and he admires. I think "Natural Born Killers" is about the influence of mass media, technology and how obsessive the nation is, Americans are (and most of the world) in matters like mass murderers and bizarre situations. <br /> <br /> Assassins played by Woody Harrelson (Mickey) and Juliette Lewis (Mallory) are surprised by two outstanding actors who enter the lives of two interesting brutal killers. Mickey and Mallory believe that some people deserve to be killed, perhaps in the cruel theory of social Darwinism (survival of the best adapted) - Mickey says in an interview in prison that other species commit murders, we as people destroy other species and use the environment; the script is interesting, but it is doubtful how much the film comes down, in the sense that we think about society and human behavior rather than the intensity of the two-hour bathhouse we saw. <br /> <br /> The last hour of the film takes place in a prison with maximum security; we see the harsh realities of prison life; attitudes of the commander, etc., overcrowding in prisons - maybe Stone questions the future, the path that society leads. <br /> <br /> Two other interesting characters; First of all, a reporter who runs a show about America's Maniacs and is obsessed with making ratings that he manages to capture the story of Mickey and Mallory. The second is a Scagnetti policeman, a crazy, perhaps sadistic officer in love with Mallory - he also has a strange obsession with mass murderers because his mother was killed during the Waco, Texas massacre by Charles Whitman. <br /> <br /> Photos are great; different colors, shadows, styles create a sense of disorientation; green is the most visible green, resembling the disease of the killers (in the pharmacy, when looking for a rattlesnake antidote). <br /> <br /> The camera's work is crazy; trembling, buzzy, some determination is needed to get used to it and accept it. Highly unorthodox, psychedelic and unusual. <br /> <br /> "Born killer" does not hide the existence of crazy murderers, they question him and how we as a society can fuel this attribute ... <br /> <br /> Although the above review sounds quite positive, no I liked the movie. Quentin Tarantino, who wrote the script for the film, was not satisfied with the changed scenario and asked to remove his name. I can see why. Although sometimes they look interesting, the Birth Slayer is a mess in the picture. <br /> <br /> 4/10
