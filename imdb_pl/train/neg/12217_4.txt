As low-cost indies go, you usually find that you get what you pay for, and let me just say that I did not pay for "Frightworld" ... <br /> <br /> Writer / director: David R. Williams presents the story of an abandoned amusement park, besieged by the vengeful spirit of a killed serial killer. This is not a bad premise, but it is done with a lot of low budget errors. Working in the camera tries to be too readable to the audience, constantly using shaky cuts to hide the fact that they really do not have anything terrible or evil to show us. It becomes obvious from the very beginning, when we become acquainted with the would-be killer and soon realize that (acting) is the most terrible thing that happens ... After the painfully long title sequence we return to the present day, the action remains the same. "Frightworld" generates quite exceptional photos when it shows the scenery from the interior of the fun-house, but for a very long time can not save the film from the average indie hell. <br /> <br /> There is mediocre nudity, but not much for gore, which is usually a grace for this type of movie. <br /> <br /> Fans of really bad B movies can find something for themselves, otherwise they do not spend a lot of cash.
