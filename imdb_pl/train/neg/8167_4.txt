Forest is not just a regular cannibal dish every day, but also an interesting mix of supernatural elements. The story tells about two pairs that travel to the forest during a camping trip. Soon, they terrorize their apartment in the cave, cannibalistic foresters and ghosts of the deceased wife and two children. There is something you do not see every slass. Director Don Jones gets "A" for the effort, although the film itself is in every level, the acting is just average, except for Jeanette Kelly, who plays the dead forester's wife (Michael Brody aka Gary Kent). /> <br /> The film begins with beautiful photos of a couple wandering through the valley to the forest. They realize too late that someone is persecuting them. Both are sent at a typical price. Our killer uses a proven hunting knife throughout the movie, except for retrospection, when he implements a hand saw, pitchfork and a rusty cutting blade to send a lover of his scams. the movie just does not work with him, I find it quite boring with just bad acting. 4/10
