This movie is horrible. HORRIBLE. One of the worst movies ever. I can not even imagine that Gigli is worse than that. The previews made us say "NO", but then we searched for something in the ruins, now we decided to go further. <br /> <br /> STARS US. <br /> <br /> Affleck is NOT an actor. It is an image and can look good in explosions, but even in the style of Bruce Willis in "Die Hard". If he undressed his shirt and ran around fighting evil, it would be a comedy. <br /> <br /> The best part was Catherine O'Hara - she's always good. Gandolfini again drops (if it were not for Sopran√≥w, he would be washed away), as in "The Mexican". <br /> <br /> Affleck hogs in every scene and how others have said - without character, he has any motivation for his actions. <br /> <br /> AVOID THIS FILM AT COST.
