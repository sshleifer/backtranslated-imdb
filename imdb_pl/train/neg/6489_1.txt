What seemed like a good premise for the movie ... unfortunately, it can not be achieved on almost any level. At the beginning of the film it is very difficult to imitate the fact that I fought with the desire to turn it off, and the biggest problem with the visual aspect is the fact that working with the camera is just too great with so many "artistic" weaves and semi-subliminal cuts throughout the film, which actually divert attention from the whole. We're really trying too hard to immerse you right now and build to a full-blown ending, but the movie just has so many semi-formed characters and an irrelevant scenario that just makes you feel disappointed and confused why you've tried so deep to reconcile with this.
