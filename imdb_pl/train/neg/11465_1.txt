Undoubtedly, this is one of the worst photos I've ever seen - the kind of movie you chose from the shopping center's desperation during Christmas, when you missed the start times for something good, but you're still alive, take a look at the movie! And that's exactly how I got to this stinking bomb ... <br /> <br /> At more than three decades away I still feel the rotting fish that make up this story. An incredible plot - that the whale carries a grudge against the individual not from the sea - is ridiculous. And all this, except for the completely out of place "theme of love" that plays at the end of the movie deprived of a love story. At least Charlotte Rampling is adorable (in a two-dimensional role), but Richard Harris simply chews on the scenery. He was not Captain Quint (Robert Shaw) and it is not "jaw". Fortunately, I put most of it to mind and when I came across it in TV sets, I immediately went. "Danger, Will Robinson!" See current t.v. an advertisement showing a husband and wife watching whales ("Orca - I love Orca ...") - at least it's been in sixty seconds. This projection represents the 92 minutes of my life that I will never return.
