I saw this movie above all to see Brooke Burke (as Jill), whom I met briefly in Los Angeles at the model fairs, in her first feature film. I was hoping to see her more, but I thought she played her role very well. Because it is such a beautiful and ready TV and model host, it was not surprising. I wondered why she was killed and what happened. Maybe I just did not notice it. <br /> <br /> I was not sure about the genre of this film and although I liked the actors, I felt it was for the university audience. I tried to keep my mind open, considering that horror was not my favorite genre, but I felt that I grew up with gags. It seemed that in some places it stretches, in some places you can guess what power the bad professor had and how many other films had an unsatisfactory ending. <br /> <br /> After writing a few scripts, I know that many of them are difficult and can boil down to personal opinions, the number of films you have seen and studied, as well as those with whom you are connected at some point. <br /> <br /> In short, I found it interesting, but not a satisfying story and ending for me. If Jill (Brooke Burke) finally came back through the portal and kicked everyone in the ass, which would be a satisfying ending and would get a higher mark.
