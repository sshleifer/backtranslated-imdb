25,000 $ Pyramid Clues: Deep Blue Sea. Trembling. To slip. Eight Legged Freaks. <br /> <br /> Pyramid Category: Movies that were funnier and more exciting than Snakes on a Plane. <br /> <br /> To hell, with this definition I would have to take into account the rather startling journey of Ted and Elaine on the plane! just like Snakes in both laughter and thrill. <br /> <br /> The sad truth is that it is not even close to the mother of all unintentional intentional fun snake movies: Anaconda! In addition to never seeing the cast of JLo-Cube-O.Wilson-Stoltz-Wuhrer at the same pace, Jon Voight broke away from all time. His last scene represents everything that SOAP has tried and failed to do as "such a ridiculous-to-funny" movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, Snakes on a Plane is the ultimate proof that students and fanboys are doing the worst coworkers. Every big scene was discussed and analyzed so much last year that all you could tear at the premiere was the amount of fan-flop-pots that had to be removed in my theater. I heard more forced laughs than in the recording studio for the movie "According to Jim."
