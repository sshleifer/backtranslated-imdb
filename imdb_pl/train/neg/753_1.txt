Wow ... <br /> <br /> I received this at local Wal-Mart after reading online that it was released earlier. I have been following this online for some time and had to buy a movie. <br /> <br /> Wow ... <br /> <br /> I think that what really struck me is the assembly or lack of it. Time and again characters (usually Narrator and whoever is with them) are shown walking ... and walking ... and walking. I'm not an editor, but I know you can cut someone who leaves point A to show him in point B. There is no need to show almost the whole trip! Wow ... <br /> <br /> Actually, I ended up feeling sorry for the actors involved. It seems that they have not received any indication of what to do in other scenes than look frightened or look happy, depending on what actions were to be added at a later date. <br /> <br /> Wow ... br /> <br /> Why it was decided to do almost all effects with the help of CG is beyond me. Even ILM sometimes uses thumbnails. One of the most distracting applications of the green screen in this film is the constant rush (according to the final subtitles) of the same group of people representing citizens of different cities, including London. Sometimes these people come and go regardless of the angle of the shot or distance from the camera. In one shot in London, it seems that at least two men over six feet are walking right behind the brother of the narrator (star Anthony Piana with no distracting mustache). I have not seen such a false piece of facial hair since GETTYSBURG. <br /> <br /> Wow ... <br /> <br /> Why did Timothy Hines talk about this movie the way he is outside me. It's a turkey, simple and simple. On the plus side (at least for me) he provided some of the most authentic laughs I have seen for a long time.
