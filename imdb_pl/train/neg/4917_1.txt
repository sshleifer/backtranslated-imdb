**** SPOILER WARNING **** <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly one of the funniest comedies ever created on the screen. Completely impossible to take seriously. It takes a great novel to list all the comedy procedures included in it. In the heyday of her program, Carol Burnett and the company that often took pictures on movies, they turned the film in a way that was hard to imagine. Carol played Jenny, who suddenly fell ill with only a slight cough and immediately appeared treacly and everyone looked around, wondering where he came from. Harvey Korman played Oliver with liquid curls and looked almost like Ryan O'Neal. The only funniest thing than this piece is a real movie. <br /> <br /> What a death scene at the end. Jenny really looks like she's dying alright ... dying for her make-up artist to come and give her some color. And of course, we all know how often hospitals encourage a loved one to come into bed with them during the last moments of the patient. The final scene in which Ryan O'Neal sits on a bench in the snow and wonders about his future in the film industry is an immediate classic. He was about to worry. He never recovered from it.
