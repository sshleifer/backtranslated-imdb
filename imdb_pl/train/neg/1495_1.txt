I've watched horror movies since I was five, starting with Childs Play. Since then, I've seen good horror movies and bad movies, but it's definitely a DUMBEST movie I've ever seen! The actors did everything they could with the material. The plot was simply idiotic. Plus, it was just gore. I can take a lot of blood, but it was just ridiculous! In one of the scenes, the character is stabbed back and choked with guts! Normal stupid! Another problem with this movie is the boring and probably the slowest movie ever made. The end of it is simply stupid. But on the other hand it fits the rest! Finally, when the girl escapes from the cannibal / ancestor, she receives help from an older woman. The old lady makes tea, but when she turns to talk to the girl, the girl attacks her! She changed into a cannibal! The film is delayed.
