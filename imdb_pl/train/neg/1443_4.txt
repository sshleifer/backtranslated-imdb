Start with a good song: Swayze speaks several times to his friends or this language is heard among the tribes. This is a great plus, as usual, viewers from the US and the UK believe that all people on the planet speak English (in case you were one of them: no, no). <br /> <br /> But acting is "tenenkrommend" as we say in the Netherlands (it makes your toes spin - and not in a good way). I like Swayze, but it's awful in it. Muscles in his jaws make overtime and frowns around the movie - some have to tell him he looks massive. Not Patrick: he looks stupid and is compensating for the lack of character. Alison Doody (Elizabeth) decided on a style that does not suit the style of her co-workers. Her acting is so gentle that this film could have been set in these days. And it is not. Your dress was a clue, Alison. <br /> <br /> The best acting came from people from the African continent and Sided Onyulo as Umbopa, which I liked the most. Clean, warm and character, his performance is a joy to watch. <br /> <br /> General: it's fun on a rainy day. Detriment. Could be better. Release the director.
