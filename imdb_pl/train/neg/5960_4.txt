My friends and I rented it for "Bad Movie Night" with high hopes, but The Brain was something of a profession. The brain itself is great looking, but mostly sits on its small platform. Who thought it would be fun that Brain could only be fooled by three people in 94 minutes? This film initially has many things, including the advantage of Estevez-knockoff, playing a rebellious genius (we were told that his huge intellect is misdirected in his sophisticated pranks and school acrobatics, including the introduction of glue kicks on someone's chair). He also has a few great lines, a happy, informal and absent bollard who barely manages to be anywhere, and so, some girl is naked. However, the director desperately needs learning in the art of stimulation. In the last half, everything begins to drag and pull, with at least 3 or 4 meaningless, boring scenes of chase that form the middle third of the plot. Scenes inside the PRI complex are particularly bad. At least 15 minutes of this movie are people running on the same staircase. I could fix this scenario for half an hour, more cheese, more gore, more nudity, more Brain actions. If you're going to make a bad horror, at least give me something to watch when my superego closes. Maybe the director tried to really put the audience into his movie - at the end of this nonsense I felt like one of the zombies.
