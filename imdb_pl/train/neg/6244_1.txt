Mario Lewis of the Competitive Enterprise Institute wrote a definitive, 120-page, point by point, line by line, debunking this lying film that should be titled A CONVENIENT LIE. The website address where you can find his challenging report entitled "SKEPTICA GUIDE OF INAUGHT TRUTH" on the website: www.cei.org. A shorter 10-page version can be found at: www.cei.org/pdf/5539.pdf After reading these demolition you will realize that the alleged "global warming" is no more real or dangerous than the 1999 Y2K fear that Gore also supported, as did the pseudoscientific movie THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW, based on a book written by the alleged UFO abductee Whitley Strieber. As James "The Amazing" Randi does with the psyche, and Philip Klass does with UFOs, and Gerald Posner does with JFK's idiotic plotting theories, so Mario Lewis makes Al Gore's film and the entire "global warming" fraud.
