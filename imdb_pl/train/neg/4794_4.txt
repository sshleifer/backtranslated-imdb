Why watch it? There is only one reason, namely the greatness of John Saxon. I love his acting. My favorite shows are Nightmare On Elm Street 1,3 and 7 as father Nancy as a policeman, Black Christmas as a policeman and From Dusk Till Dawn again as a policeman. While I was browsing my video shop mall, I came across the Zombie Death House movie and quickly rejected it, but I noticed before the transition that John Saxon was not just an actor in this movie, but I heard about the director for the first time in my life. I was intrigued (also cheap cost $ 9.00) and me and I had to have it. After returning home, I realized that this movie did not live up to Saxon's other work, not even his acting, which could have been mixed up by additional directing pressure. But it was not just him who sucked other actors. It looked like everyone was ripped out of a recent porn session and they said now that you really have to act. The film even looks like the quality of porn from the 80's. I can not recommend this film in good faith to random viewers, but if you're an obsessive fan of the 80s who lost a culture from that era, having been born late or a fan of nonsense movies, this one is too. Also, if you dump John Saxon like me.
