... and yet we were told that there was still an hour and 20 minutes left. <br /> <br /> Why, oh, why was not there an editor who would tell the writer / director to cut out, snip? Apparently the writer / director had been doing shorts before; in short it would be good. But the lack of dialogue disappears after twenty minutes. Lack of many musical looks. Noise in the background (conversation, movement, and especially the ubiquitous helicopter) are aging very quickly. But the worst defeat is in history. After a short time there is not much. <br /> <br /> After an hour we saw variations of the same scene over and over again. I almost shouted on the screen: "We get this, we get it !!!!!" It's amazing that after leaving the theater we could go home, watch the Daily Show and excerpts from Colbert's report, get ready for bed and know that the audience was STILLEM trapped in theater. It is not enough to give up your vision. You must give the audience enough to share their vision.
