I agree completely with the last commentator, which may be the worst film ever made. I also had to rewind most of this movie. Michael Madsen had to do this movie as a favor for someone. The picture quality is grainy until the end. And what a small story is, it's just stupid. lower result I would like to. Do not waste time on this movie because you will regret it.
