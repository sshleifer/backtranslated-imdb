This is really a new low entertainment. Although there are many worse movies. <br /> <br /> In the scene genre Gangster / Drug it is difficult to have a convincing plot (such films do not, I mean Sebastian's motives, for example, there can not be more far-fetched and damaged stereotypes.) Then you would also need a certain relationship between characters that would be credible (this film does not.) <br /> <br /> Sure, that Tristan is distanced from his family, but why is it again? What is the matter with his father that he must ask permission to leave his age? an interesting picture to ask about the lack and need for rebellious behavior of children in a higher-class family. But this movie is not going in that direction. Even if there was potential, judging by random Backflash. Was he not downstairs anymore and why he does not do it again? <br /> <br /> So there are some interesting questions about a solid socially critical drama (but on the other hand, this movie is simply not because it focuses on "cool" production techniques and special effects, not giving the characters a thought, and first of all, they force the story on the path they want to, and without paying attention to the story that breathes and evolve naturally.) <br /> <br /> I want to be a drama, do not glorify abuse of substance and violence (nowadays it would be incorrect politically, right?), but on the other hand it's nothing more than a cheap action movie (there are so many of them) with a medium set of actors and Vinnie Jones, who can not completely ruin what's left of his reputation by doing it what he always does. <br /> <br /> So all in all ... just ... I can not recommend it. <br /> <br /> 1 for Vinnie and 2 for editing.
