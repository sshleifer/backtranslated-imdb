This is undoubtedly the worst thing I've ever spent my money on. I feel dirty for admitting that I hired this "movie" and actually paid to see it. It does not even judge trash. No? No. It is a juice that collects at the bottom of industrial garbage containers located in particularly stinking districts after an extremely humid summer. To call it garbage would be to degrade garbage everywhere. It was so bad that I felt I had to register with IMDb and warn my neighbor. This character from Luvahire claims that this movie is great. You have to question his understanding of reality. Take some of his comments and analyze them. <br /> <br /> "The actor who played Ricky (I forgot his name) did a VERY good job." <br /> <br /> I understand. Well, if the director imagined his audience huddled and grimacing at every sentence uttered by Ricky or alternately exploding uncontrollable laughter at the moments when most directors would like a more bleak reaction from their viewers, then yes; Ricky did a great job. <br /> <br /> "I am an aspiring actor, I take theater in my school myself and I had to play where I had to cry and it is not easy to be emotional on stage, so I give props to actors who have to make an emotional scene and can pull it away. <br /> <br /> Wow. I also have to give props to actors who can draw emotional scenes. Luvahire, you may want to look into another line of work there, buddy, if you think that these chuckleheads have downloaded it. Still, they can help you if you want to practice crying. Just watch the movie. ha. ha. ha. <br /> <br /> "PRZYWRÓĆ SEQUEL" <br /> <br /> If I were your theater teacher at school, I would disappoint you solely on the basis of this comment. <br /> <br /> I'm too disgusted to continue. Now I'm going to pass a movie about my partner, Mr. Bangli. <br /> <br /> Hi! If you've read so far, I take it for granted that you've already seen this movie, and now you're looking for one of two things in this commentary: 1) The additional joking depreciation of what you agree is an extremely weak movie. 2) An additional playful degradation of what you think is a good movie effort that requires defense against such slanderous scum as me. Regardless of whether you want to help in expressing your disgust or ammunition in order to trigger a punitive repartition, if I say something good, it will only disappoint you - so I assure you that there is little chance of such disappointment. <br /> <br /> Other negative comments here in IMDb have already calculated particular shortcomings of the film (eg acting, soundtrack, direction, dialogue, editing, etc.), but all these errors can be easily forgiven in themselves. Few people will be renting a movie called "Hood of the Living Dead" if they require the highest class. The final failure of "Hood", however, is that it does not live up to the plentiful name promise. "Hood of the Living Dead" virtually jumps from the shelf in the video store because of the implications of straightforward and unambiguously creative killings. There was a chance to combine a cheesy zombie movie with the realism of life in the ghetto so that the zombie gangsters bombarded the innocent life while rocking in the rags so the undead pimp would drift over the deadly lice in their sneaky rides. The combination of both species could be fun. Instead, the movie is more like watching shy children in middle school play, but they do not understand. To avoid the feeling of betrayal on the part of the video borrowing audience, I suggest that the Quiroz brothers re-release the film with the following new title: "Hood of the Living Dead: A home horror film that we shot on our camera with some friends over the weekend last summer because we were bored" . Or maybe they could publish it as a document. "The Day Creativity Died: Exploring how a low-budget film can still be completely devoid of wise or original thought, despite the lack of connections to a large film studio." <br /> <br /> The potential tenant, whose interest has not been suppressed, should find the following blurb on the back of the video tape: "The Quiroz brothers have once again proved that watching things you can do alone is not very interesting. "- Lord. Bangla
