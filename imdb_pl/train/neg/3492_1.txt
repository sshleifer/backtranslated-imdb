I do not buy kung fu movies for the story. I buy them for battle scenes. A bad story can be forgiven for the perfect fight scenes, but not the other way around. <br /> <br /> The story was decent, but it moved too slowly for my tastes. In total, there were about 3 or 4 battle scenes, lasting only a few minutes each time. The last fight was a bit longer, but until then I was so bored that I did not even pay attention to her.
