Hej, <br /> <br /> If you're going to make a documentary about Leonard Cohen, try to do it about Leonard Cohen! It is filled only with Leonard to anger the viewer, who will wonder why they are listening to all other singers (some of them are doubtful) about themselves. Puleeze .... sounds like they survived their entries in the middle school diary - who cares about you, what about Leonard? Guess what people, if you "do something" worthy, maybe someone will do a documentary about you. I particularly offended the parading of U2 members as if it added credibility to this film - NO. Leonard does not need Bono or The Edge talking about his spirituality. It would be nice if the filmmakers made a fragment of their spirituality into the film. Oh good, what an idea! I will give props to Rufus Wainwright and Jarvis Cocker for their covers of Cohen's songs - the rest of the performances were boring and some were unbearable. <br /> <br /> Cohen fans, do not say I did not warn you!
