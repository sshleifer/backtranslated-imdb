It is difficult to make an impartial judgment of such a film that has had such an impact on me at such a young age. This is undoubtedly the worst kind of exploitation film. I was so unhappy that I saw this movie for the first time in my youth, I will never forget it. I thought it was the scariest movie ever made. Then I saw it again at the beginning of this year and I was terrified again. <br /> <br /> I am not a fanatic, not one who would say what others should and should not see, but I have done a great offense at the way something so horrible as the rape in this film. I love low-budget cinema, but it's just nasty. Rather, take Rus Myer instead.
