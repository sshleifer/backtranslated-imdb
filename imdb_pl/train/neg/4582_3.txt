If you want to learn the basics of quantum mechanics, spend 9 USD on a used textbook, not the movie. I'm a bit worried that the money I spent is used to buy Kool-Aid for shipping to Guyana. <br /> <br /> I do not think the directors really have any point of view, but it looks like they've tried to do a few: 1) Science can explain everything we do, which means that our life is deterministic; 2) Science can not be used to explain everything we do, which means that we have free will; 3) Science is really cool, brother; 4) We are God; 5) The world exists only in our minds; 6) Sarah Norman is a difficult role to follow and 7) here, put this little paper square in your mouth and you'll see really cool things.
