Together with my girlfriend, we went to see the movie as "Premiere Surprise", which we bought on the ticket to the film announcement before its opening in Denmark. We sat around the first hour and then we left! The aim of the film was simply to show the era (and club 54), but it happened in the face of the development of a character that was not there, and the conspiracy, which was not enough. /> I was rarely indifferent to the characters in the movie! <br /> <br /> The music was good though. So if you want to hear good music and fix the mood from the 70s, it's probably OK. But do not expect to get a plot of reliable characters. <br /> <br />
