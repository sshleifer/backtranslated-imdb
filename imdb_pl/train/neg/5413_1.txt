After a fairly successful MASTI, which was a bit better, Inder Kumar returned again with the comedy PYAARE MOHAN based on the Hollywood film. where Kader and Anupam play blind and deaf people <br /> <br /> This movie is a boring exercise <br /> <br /> In the movie, they joke such nonsense that you do not feel like laughing like head of Snehal Dabi I'm stuck in the back of the horse all these comedies, which we do not laugh at now, but szydzimy <br /> <br /> The movie begins banally, and some scenes are funny, unfortunately such moments do not last long, as history never moves in this half, even comedy is boring Twist is well served, and the other half becomes an action movie in which the blind and deaf are going to save the heroine, and we have all the OTT scenes and fighting scenes. <br /> <br /> The director Inder Kumar is angry. The music is fine, one song stands out I LOVE YOU MY ANGEL <br /> <br /> Vivec is awful in comic scenes, his timing is very bad and he's fine in serious scenes For some reason he's still doing comedy and ruining his career at Fardeen Khan is a little better, but too wooden. Among the rest Esha and Amrita are the heroines of annoying Boman Irani Snehal Dabbi is ok
