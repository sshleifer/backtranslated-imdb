I saw it late at night on the cable. At the time I did not know that the girl announced as "Shannon Wilsey" was actually a Savannah porn star, but she was so beautiful (and so often naked, thank God) that I was actually sitting through this decaying brain crap. I like bad movies and the next guy - actually more than the next guy - but it was far beyond the bad and rancid. The truly annoying abuse by the mad scientist and the almost total incompetence of the director, screenwriters and special effects is exacerbated by unjustified nudity, which is the only saving grace of the film. Savannah, before she turned into a plasticized Barbie Doll, became a porn queen, she is really interesting to watch - she is dead, she is incredibly beautiful, sometimes she explodes uncontrollably giggle, looks outside the camera and laughs, and generally seems to have a really good time, which is more than you can say for the public. Although even Savannah and her colleagues spend a lot of this nude image, you still can not hide the fact that it is an incredibly stupid, poorly made and irritating movie. If you know someone who has it on film, or if it's available on TV, check it out, but do not waste your money on renting.
