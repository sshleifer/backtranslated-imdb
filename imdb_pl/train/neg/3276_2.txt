TV program from the 80s, updated with a fresh, feminine body and obscene language. "Dukes of Hazzard" passed me; he did not say anything when I was in front of the television in New York or California; or, I would probably watch. I knew, however, that somewhere (like the clips attached to the updated version of the 2005 movie) It was about a fast orange Dodge charger - and "General Lee" is still good. <br/> <br /> Hunky cousins ​​Seann William Scott and Johnny Knoxville (as Bo and Luke Duke) are the new Orange Sage players. Beautiful Jessica Simpson (as Daisy) fills her scant, short well - but even her exciting pink bikini is not able to beat the competition from the dormitory full of bouncing, topless coeds. Too stupid plot is associated with graying Burt Reynolds (as "Bosse" Hogg) threatening to transform Hazzard County into a mine. <br /> <br /> ** Dukes of Hazzard (7/7/05) Jay Chandrasekhar ~ Seann William Scott, Johnny Knoxville, Jessica Simpson, Burt Reynolds
