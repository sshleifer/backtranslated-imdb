After watching the announcement, I felt that this movie would be a good improvement in comparison to the fast and furious series. So, I expected that there would be a lack of plot, but at least this time it will not be loaded by a group of powerless people with cans with a fart. Unfortunately, I was wrong. If you could imagine a Fast & Furious movie with a worse plot than in any other way, this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> This is absolutely the worst movie I've ever seen (I'm nice - no, I would not take a baseball bat for my nuts, as others have said.) The story did not just exist, but the action was also nonsense. the director thought they could just throw a few women and exotic cars, and then call it a movie, for example, in the movie there is a point where the guy pushes the nose button and his Lamborghini takes off in the air and flies over to SLR McLaren to win. And after Eddy Griffin got into a fight with one of his "girlfriends" (in this case, Imusa's comment would have worked), the girl asks her to stop and get out of the plane and, of course, do it in the middle of the desert. I could not stand it anymore, I only saw half of this monstrosity, it was the first movie I ever performed in. Then I had to stop for a drink to kill all my damage ne brain cells. <br /> <br /> I gave him 1 because 0 is not an option. You'd better go to your local car program and stop at the interface of the lane on the way home. I will keep all viewers in my prayers.
