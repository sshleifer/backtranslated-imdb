15 years ago, Power Rangers was one of the shows that overwhelmed nations, especially young people. When I was a three-year-old kid living in the Philippines, I watched this program every Friday on ABS-CBN (there's channel 2). When the movie was released in 1995, everything was shocking and frightening to me when I watched it with my father and 2 uncles. My grandparents have even sent me a box of "Balikbayan" full of Power Rangers (including an easy-to-build Megazorda and stuffed Rangers toys). I even played video games and I loved just one of them ("MMPR: Fighting Edition") which was REALLY sad. Anyway, it was a program that set up a springboard from my interests in a series of robots (especially the series of anime mechs such as "Gundam"). Now that I'm 18, I'd like to think that this program is pretty bad for me right now. To prove it, I traveled down memory, buying a 2-set DVD collection from "MMPR: The Movie" and "Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie" and watching them both. I said: "Ugh. How terrible. Just another garbage in the attic for me. " For all of you, people of my generation, this is NOT a program that you would like to watch over and over again. I'm not saying to leave it behind for the rest of my life, but sometimes it's not a bad thing right now, right? Instead of "Power Rangers" I recommend something like "Mobile Fighter G Gundam" (HIGHLOMENDED), "Ninja Senshi Tobikage" (aka Ninja Robots), and even ORIGINAL Sentai shows that were the basis of "Power Rangers.
