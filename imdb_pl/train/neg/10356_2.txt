(it may be a bit on the spoiling side) I would like to start by saying that I did not watch the whole movie, nor could I because it was clear from the first hour that I would be incredibly disappointed. It's obviously a problem to do what many think is an amazing book, and turn it into a Disney movie created for television. <br /> <br /> Wrinkle in time should be transformed into an amazing movie a long time ago. It has a great story that can connect children and adults. In addition, it is built in the quality of sequels. But Disney fixation was not a good solution. The problem with the movie is that all the things they've changed to turn it into a visual story have stifled what was so great in the book. It's a complicated and emotional story for children. There was no reason to make Charles Wallace purely "psychic" because it was the easiest way to explain it. There was no reason to write a fight between the three Mrs. W as an additional tension, without that there is enough tension. There was no reason to remove Meg's glasses ... it deprived us of what could have been a very sweet scene between Calvin and Meg, which happens in the book. <br /> <br /> I could search for small things for a few days, but I also think that bigger things, like the direction of art, were turned off. Take, for example, the way Camazotz looked like, with its strangely darkened sky. The horror that appears in the book is that Camazotz can be Earth. It looks like earth. He has people who look like people. The sky is blue, the grass is green and the children are playing. But something is a bit wrong. The directors decided to make Camazotza a complete different, instead of taking a lesson from the book and applying it to the general direction of the film. Of course, the lesson is that Camazotz could be Earth, that is, if we forget how to love. It would be a lot more terrible if we had a beautiful afternoon when they were walking down the street and the children were bouncing the ball in the same rhythm. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I did not watch the end. Maybe someone can tell me how Disney has crashed the end. <br /> <br /> Generally artistic disappointment. <br /> <br />
