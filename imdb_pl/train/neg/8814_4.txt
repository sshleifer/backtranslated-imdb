This movie is not very interesting, except for the first ten minutes. The tempo and editing are a great introduction to the band's work, even better than saying Gosford Park. Then, inexplicably, he slows down, loses focus and begins to resemble a traditional French film, finally recovering the focus of love between Antoine (Depardieu) and Cécile (Deneuve). In the middle there are too many side lines and loose ends of the story, a few threads started have not been finished. <br /> <br /> ******* AHEAD SPOILERS The main story is the relationship between Antoine and Cécile. He was loyal to her after his relationship with her many years ago, despite her re-marriage and the establishment of a home in Morocco. As a builder, he is now rebuilding his life and regaining his life by taking the mask of Cécile's marriage. After reaching this, he is buried after a strange accident (literally) and becomes a coma. She wakes up only after she burns her old painting, which indicates that they have come to terms with the past and can start a new life properly. ***** .... emits information about the overthrow of the former regime in Iraq. Cécile's child is bisexual and is bitten by dogs (loyalty) when he meets his boyfriend, while the girl he lives with seems to be sick (of this?). Her sister is a traditional Islamic woman and comes into a relationship with her husband Cécile. This presents Morocco as unnecessary backwardness, despite the whole building, in which a strange colonial vision is glaring, which almost glorifies the past. He portrays Islam as backward and vulnerable to extremism, which can sometimes be real, but certainly not at all. Ultimately, everything can best be described as the addition of locale couleur and l'art pour l'art. <br /> <br /> Deneuve and Depardieu are great. Thanks to this material they are so familiar that they are able to spin something extra in every scene: raise an eyebrow, body language, radiating pride, awkward behavior. The film itself is disappointing and only confirms the limited role of the French cinema in today's world. Of course with some exceptions.
