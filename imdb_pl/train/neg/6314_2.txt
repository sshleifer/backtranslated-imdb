I love Seth Green. His performances at the THAT 70s' Show are always worth a look, but yesterday evening I felt that the program must be renewed. Four lonely young people inherit a flat in New York, for which most of us will die. Grandma must have been an heiress to have such space in the first place. So I felt that realism had to be realized. Besides, the conspiracy about the four best friends who got this apartment was not credible. I would be excited if they had to introduce themselves to one of the parents, who would provide great humor and dysfunctionality in relation to the configuration of the series. There was not much humor in it. I only watch it because it falls before My Name is Earl on the winning Thursday night. I think they should come back, scrap this series and start again. We need more series related to the family. What about Seth and his friends who will move into their crazy parents in the suburbs when the fire burns their place. THey could have Dabney Coleman playing father and Christine Estabrook, play mother and dysfunctional siblings. The list of possibilities with someone like Seth Green is infinite and the network draws him in.
