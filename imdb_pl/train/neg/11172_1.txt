Undeservedly popular song "I Love the 80's" from 2002 is a ridiculous, idiotic, offensive and even disgusting mess of pop culture show, which was the first in a long series of awful television programs that ultimately defined the end of VH1 once the only true music channel left on TV! I used to live practically on VH1 until spring or winter, I forget, which now, in 2002, when such garbage began to appear for absolutely no reason. For pure morbid curiosity (I'm guessing you'd call it that), I decided to go ahead and see it, anyway, on the first night it appeared, even though the ads looked like complete nonsense. At least I can honestly say that I was not a little disappointed because my expectations were of course the lowest level in the basement. The emphasis on this program, which I discovered in the first 5 minutes, was smaller in each year of the 80s, and what was and was not culturally significant or popular (what I expected to see), but instead an improvised platform for a whole bunch of really awful comedians with no name to show what is more than likely their comedic skills * casts their eyes * ... more like her lack, if you ask me about it! Now it's pretty easy to understand why no one has heard of any of these idiots before they appeared at this concert because everyone is so terribly unhappy and miserable in their attempts. "Humor" that I swear that I felt my intestines tie with every rancid one lineer that they fired one by one! In total, I have no problem saying that "I Love the 80's" was / is the trash of the lowest denominator and one of the main reasons why I hardly ever watch VH1.
