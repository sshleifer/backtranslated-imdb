The opening scene "explains" why Hurt is later "resistant" to "Polluted Man". It is a pity that it does not explain anything else: how did he get what he "caught" / what it was / why it works so fast. Then go to "Present Day Budapest". OK, was the opener in the past or in the future? It turns out that this is the past, of course, but for a moment it looks like the movie was probably moved to the beginning. I'm sorry, I should have paid more attention, huh? Or maybe it's just badly done. Then there were many misunderstandings about the various tasks he had in related fields, and finally a reference to how he should have died as a result of the original experiment he had done on it. Aha! So the private and private industries came together to poison one of their best guys to see the results? He had to be one of the best guys, he was friends with a chemical company, for God's sake. There is also the substance itself: technically poison, but it mutates in the "carriers" of resistance, so we can have everything we want; poison, disease, allergic reaction, very different things in real life. Magically, it is not contagious from one dying sacrifice to another, only from the carrier. How convenient. There is also the protocol: They jump into the situation, having no idea what is in the store or how to prepare for it. Did the producers not have enough money to show the proper washing after the crew simply left the stage of the deadly unknown substance? I still thought that Hurt would die because of the bad cleaning technique, and the open scene would eventually prove to be closer.
