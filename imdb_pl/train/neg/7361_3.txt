Mr. Perlman gives exceptional performance (as usual). Unfortunately, he has to deal with the scenario and a few nonsense fragments. <br /> <br /> Larsen is in "Die Hard" mode with singlet and bulging muscles. grimacing and growling through its part. <br /> <br /> The charming Erika is very decorative (though fully dressed!) and shows some signs of "getting into action" in the end. <br /> <br /> SFX are mainly weak CGI and steal other movies. <br /> <br /> Shooting is pathetic - worthy teams A <br /> <br /> Not even worth seeing for Perlman - UNIKAJ
