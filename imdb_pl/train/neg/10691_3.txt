I quarreled with myself whether to rent it or not. I am always afraid to borrow something I have never heard of (I do not remember that it is in cinemas). Great cast ... it just tilted the scales. 30 minutes, I almost stopped watching him. The first few minutes are pleasant to watch, but unbelievable. After that it's even worse. The authors of this film would be able to study future projects a bit if they want their films to be even better. Or they may just try to write something a little credible. I give him 3 ... a 1 for writing (just because there are words) and 2 for being able to persuade so many good actors to agree to make this movie, despite having to read the script. Oh, my God, this movie sucks.
