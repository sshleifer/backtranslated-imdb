The actor asks "What is my motivation?" To understand his character. After seeing this "docudramy", this vague and chaotic farce, the viewer wonders what the motivation of anyone was. <br /> <br /> This inept offspring of television during the day (Oprah show) has overlooked a mile of great opportunity to explore weighty problems. <br /> <br /> All his characters were shallow and superficial, and their plot is much less socially redeeming than the episode of "Simpsons". This presented the police police as unprofessional and incompetent. He failed to explain why the court may treat the main character, molester child, so differently than in the case of the male accused. <br /> <br /> Why did this unrepentant woman begin to "cultivate" her second class, start an affair with him when he returned to the sixth grade? Why did the boy's mother testify on her behalf? The simple answer is overwhelming narcissism, plus generational rationalization and greed. The film did not give any hints. <br /> <br /> Why was the viewer not informed that the victim's mother sold interview rights for printed and television tabloids, parading with her young son on "The Today Show"? This lawyer Mary Kay made the donation, she herself calls for the "Son of Sam" statute to use her crime, selling her story to the highest bidder? <br /> <br /> Why was it not explained that LeTourneau's father was a former right-wing Republican Congressman, an American presidential candidate from 1972, John Birch Society President? In 1983, the political career of John Schmitz ended when it turned out that he had children from his own student community, revealed only when this lady sexually maimed their little son? However, Letourneau's dad removed many children from "too liberal" Catholic schools, fighting to ensure that all students did not receive any sexual education? <br /> <br /> A month after her conditional release, she was again pregnant with a 14-year-a-second second daughter, Mary Kay, received a 7½-year prison sentence for numerous violations of probation conditions. A prophetic publication on a sad case appeared in the Seattle Times: "At the end of the two unfortunate hours, LeTourneau was led to prison, and this nasty mélange of seams on television ended up until the castings began." br /> <br /> Of course, 18 months later, the parody was made.
