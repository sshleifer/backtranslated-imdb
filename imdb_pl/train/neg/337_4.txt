Well, what to say. GOLDEN CHILD belongs to the category "so bad, it's good". Eddie Murphy has some fun (and sometimes quite irritating poems), but you're still having fun. Chales Dance has never been worse than his role as the villain of Sardo Numspa (what is called this ??). <br /> <br /> Who should watch a GOLDEN CHILD ... hm ... hard to say, but my best idea will be people who like embarrassing movies and can be torn apart by bad acting, bad story and even more embarrassing dialogue. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
