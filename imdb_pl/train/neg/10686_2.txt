Help the economy - spend your money somewhere else! The film's summary is: The First Lady has a husband murdered because he cheated on her. this is it! Undetected by anyone, with the exception of Kuba and Angie, he designs and implements a vast murder plot that no one knows ... and completely escapes. <br /> <br /> Some specific points are particularly funny: standing in front of the president, Kuba is bouncing the ball of the killer ... who steps into the back of the president's head. <br /> <br /> Kuba and Angie watch the movie from the press camera and see ... the trail. They make every effort to protect the film, believing that they are the only people who have a copy of this very public film. <br /> <br /> Kuba talks to a member of the presidential staff. PSM comments that there was no conspiracy. Kuba claims that more than one person was involved. The PSM then argues that the plot includes the FBI, the CIA and the NSA. Wounds, I'm wondering if PSM is at stake. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Archer, First Lady, is an embarrassing artist. Kuba can not see the picture, and she says: "You are too close ... step back ... look from a different perspective, look from my perspective." Can anyone miss this tip?
