An attempt to bring Elvis Presley to the present day, but despite the sexy scene with a small shower and a pseudo Playboy, Presley is surrounded by the same old body, blinking clich√©s. The woman chooses E.P. on the beach, then takes over his life - and it seems he does not care! Dick Sargent is exhausting in a different sidebar, but Don Porter and Rudy Vallee (!) Are trying hard like two Elvis bosses (you see it's lunar). Some songs are quite good, especially "Almost in Love", but if you want to see a looser, hyper, updated sex-comedy Elvis - look somewhere else. When Elvis and his Fatal Attraction combine with each other, there is a wooden board between them! Get off your high horse. ** with ****
