Someone actually gave this movie 2 stars. There is a very good chance that they need immediate professional help, because anyone who does not spend 30 seconds checking if there is a lack of stars is literally frightening. <br /> <br /> This movie is ... well ... I guess it's some awful porn movie / snuff without pornography or real horrible pieces (except acting, story, story, sets, dialogue and sound). I wrongly assumed it was about zombies. <br /> <br /> Watching is actually pretty scary; you are scared that someone will come and you will never be able to describe what it is and leave, thinking that you are a freak who watches home-made amateur films with torture or something similar. <br /> <br /> I am so surprised that I am writing this review on my mobile phone, so I do not forget to try to lower the rating below the current level 1.6 to save others from the same horrible fate that I just suffered. <br /> <br /> The worst movie I have ever seen and I can say (with a hand on my heart) that I will never, never end it.
