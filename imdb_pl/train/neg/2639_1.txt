First, let's start this review from the fact that WE SIGNED ONLY TO SAVE THE REVIEW AND TO WARN PEOPLE TO SAVE MONEY !! <br /> <br /> It was one of the worst pieces of trash I've seen since Hulk's time. The plot was the most predictable trash you can come up with. If you're expecting 24, but on a big screen, immediately empty this waiting in the toilet along with the money you would use to buy the ticket. In this way, you can get more pleasure. Acting was horrible, the story was totally unrealistic (along with the so-called "twist" in the end.) I have to say ... The ending has surprised me, I do not like the surprising plot, which surprised me, but instead the easy way in which they collected what can be considered the ONLY scene of some decent action throughout the movie. They rushed to the end so fast that I did not even realize it was over, until I saw that the credits were rolling at the moment I was considering burning the film reel if I could only find out how to get to this room. <br /> <br /> Throwing was terrible for several reasons, first, they had to accidentally change the character's assignment because Michael Douglas played the roll that CLEARLY Keifer Sutherland should play. While Douglas stole around agents, knocked on phone lines, broke into systems and killed people who were pursuing him, Sutherland g he is a less capable agent who is always in the mood of advertising even when he does not go that bad. The game of a very gentle agent, nothing like his type Jack Bauer does not love 24 fans. <br /> <br /> I can promise that this movie will fail in all areas. This is best compared to the remake of "The Fugitive" / "In The Line of Fire", but written by people with mental disabilities
