This movie sucked. The actress sucked, the script was useless, and the movie sucked. There were two threads in the film that were not developed, and the viewer had to do some work to find out what was happening. <br /> <br /> I do not say you have to describe it, but suddenly you find that something is happening and you say as if you had the slightest idea what they are. Examples: <br /> <br /> Negative comments of the heroine about the hero. The audience is never shown how she knows anything about the guy and how it is related to the death of her fianc√©. The viewer also has a minimal exposure to the guy's death. <br /> <br /> Also, suddenly there is a scene with a group of guys loading and tensing machine guns and everything you see before cutting them out to other scenes. No explanations about weapons and people with them. <br /> <br /> We gave her 3 because we did not feel that we want to regain our time. While watching the movie it was nice to spoil the movie, so at least it gave us some entertainment. ;-)
