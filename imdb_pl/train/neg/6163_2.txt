Hooper is not funny, not fasting, not romantic and not informative. There is no real drama. One would think that a movie about the world's biggest stuntman would have a drama, it was a rehearsal, but it did not seem real. No character examinations, no conclusions were drawn, even the actors did not seem to have fun, they just tried to act as if they were having a good time. There is no reason to watch unless you like to look at Burt and you want to see Sally from time to time. The Prancer horse was beautiful and did what he had to do. In fact, Prancer was the best actor in this film. Smoky and the Bandit was such a funny movie that I wanted to like Hooper. This movie turned out to be a real disappointment and a waste of time
