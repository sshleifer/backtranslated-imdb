I love movies. I love independent efforts and large studio productions. I love movies with stars and I love those with unknowns. I love dramas, comedies, action adventures, science fiction, secrets, westerns, every genre except for horror. I love foreign films, as well as those in English. I love good movies and even love bad movies because almost no movie is played at any level. Except "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues." <br /> <br /> When I took part in the night show "Cowgirls", I joined the audience around 10. Less than half, I was alone. Soon I could not even bear this disturbing mess that developed before my eyes and I left. To this day, "Cowgirls" remain the only movie I ever came from. <br /> <br /> I do not know how to describe this incoherent, vain, kitschy, meaningless movie or how to properly convey its lack of repurchase value. Suffice it to say that it is one of the worst films of all time, ridiculous and unforgivable at every level. He tries to be clever, but his concept of feminism seems hopelessly anachronistic. He tries to be funny, but his humor is rough and noteworthy. This is one of the few films that manage to defile your ethos, presenting the heroes in such a hideous way that you rebel against them and their values. If you want to watch a movie, watch "Waterworld", "Ishtar", everything except that. With the exception of the new "Alexander". If you choose between this and this, read the book.
