It's the biggest piece of nonsense. It looks like they spent more time, effort and money on the DVD cover than on the real movie. I really thought the DVD was turned off from somebody else's porn until I recognized one of the cover actors. This movie looks like someone earned a hundred dollars and a camera, and half of it spent on rats. The picture is very clear, but with a very unfortunate lighting, cinematography, if you can call it that, production, acting, if that's what they are doing and the script, if it is, make this movie look worse than old porn. At least old porn is right. It seems that some members of PETA have gathered and decided to make a really worrying, senseless PSA about the rights and feelings of animals. It is not worth money or time. It has nothing to do with the actual serial killer of BTK other than the name of the killer and the name of some victims. The people who created this movie should be happy that it is not yet free, or could only go after it to ruin the film so badly.
