Watching this movie was a waste of time. I was tempted to go in the middle of the movie, but I resisted. I do not know what Ridley Scott intended, but I found out that in the army women are as stupid as men. They learn to spit, insult and fight in combat, and it is also a waste of time (in my opinion). And what the hell was the last scene in Lybia? Are they still fighting Gadhafi, or is it easy to believe that Islamic people are always a threat?
