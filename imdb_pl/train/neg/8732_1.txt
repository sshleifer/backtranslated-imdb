The story is about the death of young children. Hopper is the one who must investigate the killings. During the film, she seems to have trouble with her daughter. Finally, the serial killer is caught. this is it! But before you find out who is dunnitem, you must see the terrifying acting of all actors. It's unbelievable how bad these actors are, including Hopper. I could go on like this, but it's a lot of waste of time. Just do not watch the movie. I warned you.
