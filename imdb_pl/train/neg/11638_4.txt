"Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned" is the third part of Gabriel Knight's games, a series of adventure games about the mischievous writer / paranormal, Gabriel Knight. Gabriel and his companion, Grace, were asked by Prince James of Albany to investigate a series of mysterious attacks called "Night guests". When Prince James' son is kidnapped, Gabriel chases the night visitors to Rennes le Ch창teau, where he begins to put together the mystery associated with the Holy Grail. <br /> <br /> Despite the marketing, this game does not apply to vampires. Vampires have a symbolic appearance in the game, but they are never in the command center, like the voodoo hounfor in "Sins of Fathers" or werewolves in "The Beast Within". Gabriel and Grace are not trying to discover the true nature of vampires or research knowledge about vampires. Although vampires murder three people during the game, their victims are randomly chosen and have nothing to do with the main story. <br /> <br /> A lot of the charm of Gabriel's first two knights were in the accounts that Gabriel created with villains. Thanks to these accounts, the player could not help but sympathize with the villain, and thus the villain was transformed into a man and less into a monster. However, in "Blood of the Sacred", Gabriel's only interaction with the villain is based on a single, tacky interview that does nothing to give the character a black character. <br /> <br /> The roles that Gabriel and Grace play in this secret are quite futile. Gabriel spends time eavesdropping on the identity of the treasure hunters in his hotel, but what he discovers is nothing but red herring. Grace spends her time studying the mystery of Rennes le Ch창teau, but all her research becomes unnecessary thanks to the presence of a troubled ally who has known the answer to this mystery for centuries. <br /> <br /> The actions of this troublesome ally and its polar opposite --- the vampire leader - are insurmountable. The ally leaves in the daylight tips on the mystery of Rennes le Ch창teau and expects that Grace (and not other treasure hunters from the tour group) will find them. However, he could reveal the secret of Grace entirely on the first day, instead of exposing the abducted child to an additional 48 hours. And finally, he just tells Grace all the secret. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the leader of the vampires does not achieve the objectives of centuries of plotting, because he decides to refrain from acting for two days after kidnapping. The only reason he decided to delay the action is that he wants to enjoy his victory. <br /> <br /> The game would be much better if it was focused exclusively on the Holy Grail. Kidnapping and vampires should be omitted, replaced by a race with the Vatican to discover the secret of Rennes le Ch창teau. Because Gabriel is often portrayed as a reluctant Catholic, this conflict would have many opportunities for character development. <br /> <br /> In all, the game was a disappointing part of the series, despite the improved interface and the return of Tim Curry as the voice of Gabriel Knight.
