ORCA is not entirely evil, but it is not really the best time of Richard Harris. As a mad fisherman reminiscent of Ahab, Harris gets into a game of death with a vengeful orc after killing the whale wife and unborn child. Charlotte Rampling plays a whale expert who engages in Harris. He yells at him a lot about how important it is to leave nature alone. He does not listen and somehow ends up in the arctic fighting against a crazy whale of vengeance. There are no special effects to talk about, except what looks like a round mirror for the whale's eye - there are infinite shots of Harris reflected in the eye, so that the audience will understand that the whale knows who he is. Because Derek, as one of Harris' crews has an exceptionally unpleasant course towards the Orca and most of the cast, including Robert Carridine, Will Sampson and Keenan Wynn are not doing very well either.
