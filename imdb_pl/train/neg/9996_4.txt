Although the production direction and Jerry Jameson are definite improvements, "Airport '77" is not much better than the "Airport 1975": neat, commercial garbage sinking (this time, literally) a decent cast. Jack Lemmon is a pilot of a packaged passenger plane, which is kidnapped by art thieves and crashed in the sea (all the publicity said that it is near the Bermuda Triangle, but there is no mention of it in the film itself). When the lifeboats fly out of the water, we see how all their cranes fall (blindly) into the ocean and it's hard not to laugh (imagining that the cranes clog the plane, passengers and waterlogged scenario). NBC used to broadcast something that looked like a "directing cut," with at least an hour of extra material - mostly flashback footage - with all the subtleties of the "Gilligan Island" episode. The most exciting moment is the air crash, and some players have fun: Lee Grant is an unbearable drunk, Brenda Vaccaro a senseless stewardess, Joseph Cotten and Olivia de Havilland flirt with the elders. Still, personality conflicts and tearing military details ultimately tear patience. ** with ****
