It was a horrible movie! Not for the item, but for delivery. I went with my girlfriend (when the movie appeared), expecting to see a film about the triumph of the human spirit over oppression. What we have seen is 2 hours of brutal police oppression without exalting at the end. Announcements and advertisements did NOT HAVE this mention! Besides, even though they played in the whoopi goldberg, I remember that she was arrested and killed in the first 20 minutes! Again, the announcements do not say anything about it! (not what you would expect, but it's just a problem). If I knew how depressing this movie would be, I would never see it. At least I would be prepared for it. It was an advertising campaign with a bait and switch and I will NEVER see this movie again!
