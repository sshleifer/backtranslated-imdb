The collection of jokes that pretend to be "Babe" has never been created; the screenwriters clearly hoped that the catch of watching conversations about animals was enough to keep the film. This is not. Eddie Murphy again sells as a doctor who rediscovers his forgotten childhood gift to understand the incessant and pointless chatter of guinea pigs, tigers, rats, dogs and pigeons. The voice cast is impressive (Albert Brooks, Julie Kavner, Reni Santoni, John Leguizamo, Garry Shandling, Ellen DeGeneres, Paul Reubens, Brian Doyle-Murray), but the script is so unimaginable, colorless and depressingly indecent that the whole thing is shaking up the rubbish quite quickly.
