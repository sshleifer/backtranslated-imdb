"Tashan" Vijaya Krishna Acharya is a tarnished, stylized product. Of course, this is one of the most stylish films, but when it comes to content, even the masses will reject it. Why? The screenplay is as amateur as a two-year-old child. The script is king, without a good script, even the greatest director of all time can not do anything. Tashan is produced by the most successful production banner of "Yash Raj Films" and Mega Stars appearing in it. But nothing on earth can save you if the scripts are bland. Thumb down! <br /> <br /> Performances: Anil Kapoor, veteran actor. But how could he play such a role in this way? Akshay Kumar is a great actor, in fact he is the only saving grace. Kareena Kapoor never looked so hot. It looks stunning and leaves you, everyone gets up. Saif Ali Khan will not get it here. Sanjay Mishra, Manoj Phawa and Yashpal Sharma are wasted. <br /> <br /> "Tashan" is a boring movie. Film failure at the box office, if you stayed away.
