This movie is a joke, and Quinton should be ashamed of trying to pass it on as Modesty Blaise Film. If you have trouble sleeping, all the money lends this movie. The figurine, which they call the actress who is supposed to be Modesty Blaise, must be the most boring person on this planet. Maybe it could be used as a base for the hat at the back of a real movie. Seventy-five minutes of thank you, who ever invented the fast scroll button. If you see this movie, if you can call it coming, RUN. I can not stop thinking about what third world country could use the money wasted on this nonsense. the film is boring, the actors are bored with the waste of color, they waste the air, they breathe. If you want to see Mostey Blaise, watch the movie they made in the 1960s, maybe what the director should do.
