I remember when it happened, many children were worried about it. I think I was a bit too old to get excited, and I was a fan of real martial arts movies and I always thought it was a bit bad. <br /> <br /> In the early 90s, we were crowded with programs like this making children feel that they can fight and be a guardian of power or equal to these children on the 3rd Ninja. I think that eventually parents and filmmakers have had enough of this, because in reality, all we've done is kidnapping children who revolve around and hit everyone. <br /> <br /> Many children's films have an important purpose that they are trying to do and it's nice that your children are watching and receiving a message, this one has no news ... just uses a million things in less than 90 minutes . <br /> <br /> The movie has no great visual features, but can you expect it? Acting is very bad. Victor Wong is a great actor, but it was embarrassing for him to see him here. A short, fat, fucking old fart as a powerful ninja who was just funny. The kids were playing too much, and the youngest ninja Tum Tum was probably the worst actor I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The film has a story that everyone knows before he even read the review. 3 ninja ... you know that they will fight a bunch of bad guys and of course win ... I have to say more. I'm sorry if I broke it for anyone. <br /> <br /> With all these things, KIDS WILL LOVE. This film is aimed at children and only children can enjoy it. If you do not mind that your child is watching movies about kids fighting this movie, it's a good movie to let them see. If you do not mind that your children see a complete trash that has nothing to do with real martial arts, a real actor or a period of reality, then you found a movie for your children ... I tell children because I think that even girls will like this ... I remember all the crush on Rocky girls. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 stars, because I think you can make a movie for children and still make it pleasant for adults ... this movie was disappointing at the time .. It is out of shoddy and nothing original or I would not let my child watch it ... Kung Fu TV series is on DVD and there are a lot of great Shaw Brothers movies. ..Why not show children things that really entertain them and do not make them stupid along the way, maybe even teach them a few moves, and not just how to kick a man between legs, like a grandfather at 3 Ninja ... no, no no ... never kick a man between legs ... never ... it's such an innocence.
