The story of Corpse Grinders 2 is very similar to the original Corpse Grinders, and what is different from the others is made up of strange strangers. <br /> <br /> I am convinced that this movie will be the # 1 worst movie on IMDb - if someone actually watched it. The plot is disconnected and, in a few (too many) cases, there is absolutely no point. The real miracle is why this sequel was created in the world for such a failed and frightening (but still somewhat better) movie. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie if you like watching awful movies for good laughter.
