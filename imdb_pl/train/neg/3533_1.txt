Let this movie serve as a death in the film of the "great twist" from the 90s. Known in some circles as The Kyser Soze Syndrome, this cinematic dismissive hand was made to death by M. Night Shayamalan, and even Ron Howard used variations in A BEAUTIFUL MIND. However, in REVOLVER, director Guy Ritchie (known in some circles as "Mr. Madonna"), uses the Soze theme in a much more obedient manner. <br /> <br /> Jason Statham (with a very dubious head of hair) performs in the role of Jack Green (known to everyone as "Mr. Green"). Or maybe Mr. Gold is an irritable spirit who can possess members of the underground world. I'm not entirely sure, but I do not care. REVOLVER is one of the most over-the-top examples of excess cinematography, the dissatisfaction I suffered for a long time. Be a witness to the broken structure of time, painful abrupt cuts, constant internal monologues and painfully pretentious animated sequence. This director's style of "everything and the sink" makes the work of Quentin Tarantino look calm. Cinema smoke and mirrors lead me only to the belief that Ritchie was so bored with telling this banal tale how I watched it. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of moments of revelation that are supposedly shocking, but only come as messages for Mr. Green. I wanted to like Green because I always like Stratham as a character who is two steps ahead of the other. Here, however, he is struggling with problems, as the reader overcomes the classes in English literature. The lack of wit only corresponds to the lack of restraint shown by his nemesis, Mach (Ray Liotta). Liotta feasts in the scenery like a hungry man at the Swedish table, spits out, cries and empties through the film in an embarrassing way of showing the speed of the print and the leopard. <br /> <br /> REVOLVER has no advantages. This is another Ritchie film faux pas and can even surpass his miserable remake of SWEPT AWAY as his worst movie.
