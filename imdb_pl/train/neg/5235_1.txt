I can just understand why some people would like to emphasize the relationship of this movie with the eighties, but I would not really say that it is a thorough description of the lives of most people in that era - even in the poorest properties of Bradford. This, however, is typical of the blunt agitation rubbish that the old Royal Court Theater has been driving at that time. Lots of "right" craftsmanship for small, small audience, but well-connected backslapping to ensure future commissions for violent playrights. The simple fact is that if you want to think about a real shared experience, you will see millions of others nodding, knowing that you agree to love and live as it is shown in "Gregory's Girl." <br /> <br /> I would like to call it the "sink" drama, but it would be a great harm to the water and sewage industry. However, when it comes to a decent scenario, this movie is actually completely wiped out. For some reason, strange tracking was born among the viewers of the Guardian - I can only assume that they get a visual thrill from pretending to slum it. Control my friends. It's a bad movie with a bad script that likes to think it breaks the boundaries, adding humorous insight to the grim life on the estates. it's not ... but it's grim. Do the laundry instead.
