I can not help laughing at people who praise this performance as heartbreaking and tearing. First of all, it is completely unrealistic that these people will have an excellent life after their new homes. <br /> <br /> How can these families keep these new mega homes? And what about their poor neighbors? Property taxes must certainly increase after this event. Besides, the noise would make me nervous. <br /> <br /> Secondly, how big a reality TV program can be? It's practically the same repetitive garbage week after week. We are familiar with the suffering family, we are renovating the house, we surprise the family and we all knock out Kleenex boxes. <br /> <br /> Not to mention the boring part of the renovation. The only interesting part of the program is to see what the house looks like, but even this segment is destroyed by false confessionals and constant sobbing. <br /> <br /> "Extreme Makeover: Home Edition" is a show that pretends to be cordial, but falls. Skip this one. If you like reality shows, "Survivor" is much better and moves.
