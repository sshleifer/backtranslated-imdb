I have nothing to comment on this movie. It's so bad that I had to put my first comment on the IMDb site to help some viewers save time and do something more interesting instead of watching the "movie" ... whatever it does, even stare at the wall is better. <br /> <br /> And since I have to write a minimum of 10 lines of text, I also tell you that it is a low-budget movie, bad acting, no actor names, stupid mutt as a wolf and so on ... Also, history does not bring anything new special effects are made in the style of the 80s. <br /> <br /> The film is almost as bad as the movie "Megalodon". <br /> <br /> So have fun! ;) (I do not watch this movie)
