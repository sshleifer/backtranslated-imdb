Not the worst movie I've seen, but definitely not very good. I am a paintball player myself, who often plays airball, and the transition from forest to airball is quite a big change. The film shows similar quality First of all, the film starts with this band, which apparently tries to shoot this guy "Phantom" or something like that, they seem to be a professional band and wear shirts and shooting magazines, autocorks. One guy who has bushy. Not much bad with this movie, but how it was perceived was very bad. The group of children who are good guys are woodball players who do not seem to have much money and dream of getting "better weapons". Another team constantly chooses and offends them because they play in forests and blah blah. The spectrum helps these children with wood and trains them and all this nonsense, makes them play football and basically overcomes all teams, including 'professionals'. <br /> <br /> So what's wrong with the movie? The budget is a huge thing, the paintball film could not be bad, but the budget is quite low, and the film seems to be made by an amateur. There are no big names in this movie, and acting is very bad. Paintball perception is also very bad. They seem to suggest that everyone goes for speedball and all other nonsense. In my opinion it was a bad movie and it does not give a real idea of ​​what paintball is. Honestly, real paintball is not so palpious, it's a lot of cussing and bonuses, not "respect" and rules. Do not watch this movie, then expect to go to the field shouting "4 to 1 !!"
