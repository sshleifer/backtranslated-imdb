This movie is more deceptive than ever before, using a tense actor such as Walken to play trash in this piece, which made it look like there was nothing better to do than play a boring role like this! And the fact that the movie was supposed to be about some witch, and you really do not see it until the end of the movie, but meanwhile you have to sit and watch this boring movie when you're doing or trying to reach meaning At this point you have to go through all the boring actors and actresses, thinking about how you left the movie and decided on this one, and how you just rolled up your money, makes you useless all the time. there. I prefer to watch fairy tales for divine love. Leave this one, please!
