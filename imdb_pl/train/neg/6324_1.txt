I spent eight years leading cinemas in the 80's and 90's. It was by far the worst movie I've ever shown to the public. One of the things that made it so bad was that you were trying to be a great, inspiring movie. Even the great Gregory Peck could not have saved that horrible piece from being much smaller than average. Jamie Lee Curtis, in the early role of not a horror movie, clearly showed that she did not learn how to act (she still tries but does not get better). <br /> <br /> Excuse me and here's a spoiler, international nuclear disarmament will never happen, just because it makes children afraid to play a small baseball league! Even the concerts at Nick and The Disney Channel are not stupid enough to try to convince us of this drainage. <br /> <br /> It's not worth the time when you waste watching him on cable TV. This is not worth the price of a movie rental; Your dollar would be better spent on an additional packet of microwave popcorn with another selected movie (because it can only be better than this one).
