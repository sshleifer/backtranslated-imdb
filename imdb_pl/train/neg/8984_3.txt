If you've ever wanted to see a movie that emphasizes style over content, this is for you. For me, Son de Mar is beautiful for SEE, but there is a precious little substance there, unless crazy, melodramatic, manipulative love yarns excite you. It may be one of those famous "chickens" that you've heard so much about. <br /> <br /> We are in the middle of this movie before something really happens: Ulises (Jordi Molla) goes out to sea looking for tuna and does not return, leaving his wife Martina (Leonor Watling) and son to cope alone . Then, in a crazy sixth minute of time on the screen, they bury Ulises, Martin gets married again, and her son grows up to the middle of his childhood. This quick transposition is, to put it mildly, and very sloppy: after 40 minutes more or less it turns, we suddenly become a full-fledged melodrama, all in six minutes. I think it's called a runaway pace of narrative. <br /> <br /> Five years later, Ulises (as in the wandering superhero Ulysses, take it?), returns to his "Penelope" (Watling) just to find a wife of Sierra (Eduard Fernandez), an inexplicably rich guy (What does he do to make all this cake?), Which inexplicably holds crocodiles as pets. When Martina asks Ulises for his absence with great anger, he tells her that one day he will take her to the island of Sumatra, and she will understand THE EVERYTHING. <br /> <br /> And here's the case: he DOESN Take her to the island of Sumatra. The appeal simply dies somewhere in the script. He does not really explain where he was and why he ignored his wife and child for five years. He DOES NOT ALLOW for an honorary guest, and the film does not fill holes in the story that look at us for at least half of the movie. I can only assume that director Bigas Luna wants us to fill the plot with mystical hints (fish, reptiles, sea) that she offers through breathtaking photos and evasive dialogue. It just does not work. The narrative "arc" in this film looks more like a shaky string. <br /> <br /> I'm sure Jordi Molla is a good actor, but I could not buy his Ulysses as a hero (that was the original Ulysses). With a damp sensuality, he spits out the short verse of the same poetry from Virgil about 2,000 times, and each time he stimulates Martina to an explosive orgasm. This guy should be hired to revive old marriages. I'm sure Virgil would be impressed. He was not so often laid, as I understand. <br /> <br /> This poetic "device" occupies a leading position in the film and I had no choice but to assume that it was a reversal of the famous Ulysses "siren" (ie beautiful girls singing seductively to distant sailors who were convicted If that's what Bigas Luna does, you see a problem - it offers intricate symbolism in the attempt to snatch and pick up High Art. Once again, it just does not work, at least in my eyes. <br /> <br /> Watling is a beautiful and magnetic young actor, but he gives us a character who does not seem to have too much intellectual or even romantic depth, it is over me how she could desperately fall in love with a guy who has a sign on his face rent (like on vacation), greasy hair in the style of the 1960s, which look more like seaweed, and one of those trendy twenties of the 21st century "(you know, four-day growth, not more, no less.) EXPECTS that he is a dreamy guy (I think), but his eyes suggest that he may suffer more from over-exposure to an absurd scenario. <br /> <br /> But do not despair, this movie is great to watch. Just do not try to connect dots on red herring or think too much about what you hear through dialogue. You can lose fast scrolling on this video (especially in the first 40 minutes), and you really do not miss much.
