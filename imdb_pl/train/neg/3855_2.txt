The only redemption was a small part of Larry Miller. It seemed like the movie was trying too hard to be "Something About Mary," but I did not even like the movie and it still did not meet those standards. The actor who plays Paul was great, but Selma Blair is stupid in the character of Cruel Intentions. James Brolin was great, but Paul's father looked like he was trying too hard to be a character of Randy Quaid from National Lampoon's Vacation.
