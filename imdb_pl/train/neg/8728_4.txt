This one is bad. A really bad and boring crime movie in which there is nothing unusual. A series of crimes, a killer you can not see in the whole movie, classic investigations. And also a classic story about clay, which discovers what is happening and does not believe anyone, so he must fight alone to reveal the truth. Not too much in it. Voting: 4 out of 10.
