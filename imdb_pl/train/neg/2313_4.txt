Shintar√¥ Katsu gained a lot of fame by playing the wonderful character Zatoichi. Zatoichi's films had a strange and unbelievable concept - a blind man is the greatest swordsman in Japan and spends every movie repairing the wrongs and taking revenge on the villains. It's a nice guy, and the videos are exciting and engaging (I've seen every movie). That's why I saw the last part of the Hanzo the Razor series because I assumed it would be very similar ... and the boy was wrong! It turns out that Hanzo films are extremely sexual and promote rape on "women who deserve it". You see, Hanzo is a Meiji police officer and regularly takes the bad women into custody and interrogates them violently raping them with a "steel pen." How he made his member so strong is something you have to believe, but it is certainly NOT for squeamish. <br /> <br /> Generally, I can not recommend anyone to see these brutal and misogynist movies. However, looking at other reviews, I see that they are still very popular ... and it is quite scary. Despite decent acting scenes and amazing fight scenes, movies are just like brain pollution - and I would not like to imagine how movies could have contributed to violence against women.
