I am for the idea of ​​the great epic of the American War of Independence. It is not it. (I'm talking about it, Emmerich / Devlin / Gibson THE PATRIOT. But digressing.) <br /> <br /> I saw this movie at an advertising show in the old MGM Studios (now Sony) just before it came out. The audience had high expectations in relation to this expensive piece from the era, written by veteran Robert Dillon, directed by the highly acclaimed Hugh Hudson (CHARIOTS OF FIRE), with Al Pacino in the lead role. <br /> <br /> But it did not take long for people to start circling their places, whispering mocking comments about Pacino's terribly misunderstood accent - he was supposed to be an American pioneer of Scottish ancestors (!) - and Nastassja Kinski, who she had recently emigrated to England (!!). Then the story started and everything went quickly. <br /> <br /> The motives were murky, the dialogue was terrible, the events did not have a historical or political context. What about the plot that went forward with an absurd coincidence; for the second or third time, when the alleged lovers Pacino and Kinski stumbled upon each other, it became a bad joke. Donald Sutherland gave a clumsy performance to the British officer / pederast. His accent was also on the whole map. I think there were no English actors. <br /> <br /> Many people have stayed. Those who remained tried to suppress giggles and then openly laughed. I pointed it out - I thought that at least the battle scenes could be good. I was wrong. Inexplicably, Hudson decided to film them with handheld cameras, even Steadicam, a jerk that gave the unjust "authenticity" of the film chronicle that ruined the sense of scale. <br /> <br /> There was a television reviewer in the audience a few rows ahead of me: (deceased) Gary Franklin from Channel 7 Eyewitness News. I could say he was annoyed by the behavior of the rest of us. And certainly the next day in his television segment he gave the film "10" in his famous "Franklin Scale from 1 to 10", while paying attention to stray people who yesterday disrupted the projection. know the art when they saw it. What a jester. <br /> <br /> After this disaster, Pacino has not played in another movie for almost 4 years. Hugh Hudson's career did not come to fruition. You can not say I have not warned you.
