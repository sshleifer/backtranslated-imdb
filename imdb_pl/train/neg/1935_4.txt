Chinese Ghost Story III is a completely unnecessary continuation of two great fantasy films. The film provides special spell casting effects that you can expect, but fails painfully on all other fronts. All actors play extremely stupid caricatures. You must be constantly in diapers to find your humor in the slapstick, even a bit funny. The plot is predictable and development is sometimes irregular and often slow. At the end, the film begins to resemble old Godzilla movies, including shabby special effects of a large life and (well, another) spirit with Godzilla's head. Maybe I would smile if I expected the camp. <br /> <br /> It's amazing what fantasy fans have to endure about the junk - in this case, because someone thought they could squeeze some extra money into a successful formula. They will not be able to do it again: the cash cow is now dead as dodo.
