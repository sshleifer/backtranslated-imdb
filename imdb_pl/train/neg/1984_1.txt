An absolutely steaming pile of cow dung. It's amazing for me that this movie was made. Hip-Hop and old Westerns just do not seem to mix. What kind of recipients were these people thinking while planning this train wreck. <br /> <br /> Not only the concept and the joke, but the acting is terrible, and the fact that some decent actors were even in this nightmare movie makes their whole career laugh. One should not forgive the chicks who have no idea and she is deprived of all remaining dignity. After reading the first ten pages of the dialogue she should have asked which of her friends was playing this sick joke. After several studies, I found a list of other actors who contributed to the film: Jada Pinkett-Smith, Denzel Washington, Brandy, Monique, Kim Kardasian, Jenna Jameson, Oprah and finally Marge Simpson. <br /> <br /> Simply put, I'd rather stare at the blank TV than watch the movie again.
