I give this marriage three years and it stretches. Adrianne Curry is a frustrated mouth, pampered, controlling, loud, and her bi-sexual past makes me laugh. He tells Chris that he has a picture to protect and he has to avoid strip clubs. He married her. Chris has low self-esteem and other time. I do not mind Adrianne Curry, but this combination will not be happy after finishing. Her mother said she is an old cock and thinks that this is his last attempt to regain his youth. Here are 2 very good people who ended up in a nasty divorce. I do not think his old "Brady Family" would fit his new life. I see that they are turned off. Chris said his friends are more important than his family. They supported him and they were there for him.
