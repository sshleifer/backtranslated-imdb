In this strangely boring apocalypse, the world suffers from a double plague of zombies and vampires, but no one seems to be too concerned about this Z-class movie that resembles Sheridan Le Fanu's famous short novel than my mother's lasagne recipe. Bored participants continue to run gas stations, and doctors still call home, and helpful policemen still come out with refrigeration fluid when you need it. The plot and I use this term loosely, embrace father and daughter trying to speak to the "general" whose daughter is missing, in the church, to kill a vampire who, very comfortably, travels with his father and daughter. I must admit that the moment of two real humors can be found between huge pieces of unintentional humor. The film also has enough nudity to interest a fourteen-year-old boy. Watch out for older people.
