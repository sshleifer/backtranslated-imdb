Given its popularity, I found this movie a great disappointment. Maybe I was expecting too much of this movie. After all, this is one of the best known martial arts films of the 1970s, but I could never understand why. The story is uninteresting. It is also a very talkative film with sporadic sequences of actions. My biggest problem with the movie was that the story does not offer a character that I could come from because the hero is an idiot. Director Chang has no sense of style and can not hide the glaring imperfections found in the narrative. I know it should not be high art, but I found the film boring. Definitely not the best example of this very favorite genre. His iconic status escapes me. I recommend skip this.
