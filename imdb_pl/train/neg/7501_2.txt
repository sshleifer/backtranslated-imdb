I went to this film expecting a succinct film about the influence of the Son of Sam on society. I did not expect Spike Lee to force me to feed me more trash about racial tension, mafia justice or the inability of a common citizen to make a choice under peer pressure. Lee introduced an extreme opinion. <br /> <br /> The whole movie could have been more effective if it was in 90-minute format, with more focus, less tangential action. <br /> <br /> Don "do not even bother about renting a movie, unless you passionately like Spike Lee; in this case, the theater is worth it. This is not an escapist movie.
