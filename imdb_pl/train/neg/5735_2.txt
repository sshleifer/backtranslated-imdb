First of all, it's a low-budget movie, so my expectations were incredibly low. I assume that most people looking for information about this movie just wanted bloody blood, actually all of it. <br /> <br /> The plot? There really is not any. In principle, it is Saw, but in China and all hell much worse. Cast? There is no period. Special effects? Absolutely horrible in my opinion ... They were cutaways and the blood was often unbelievable because of the amount, splashing, color, texture, etc. <br /> <br /> I believe that the purpose of this movie was to be a brutal, shocking movie. Now he had enormous potential for a larger budget, but weak scripts, poor dialogue, horrible acting, which seemed to be shots from video cameras, and simply unbelievable "gore", made this movie really awful. <br /> <br /> There are videos that are worth taking a risk in case of some reviews, even the "b-rate" films deserve some features (eg bloodstains were the newest ones I've seen compared to reviews that were worth it ), but it was just awful. I hope that people considering this movie will read my comment and decide against it. <br /> <br /> I am for brutality and shock, but general unrealism and really horrible acting make terrible experiences. Save your time / money and chance for something else, you will not be disappointed.
