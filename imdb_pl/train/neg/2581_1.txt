First of all, to get rid of my own feelings, let me start by saying that I hate so-called comedies, in which every character is written and played as so stupid that you hurt if all are the result of inbreeding. /> <br /> Now I say that I saw the first three American Pie films and although they were not the most amazing films I've ever seen, they were fine (and even masterpieces compared to three "American" movie gifts, I still feel he was forced to ask, what the hell did they think when they made the movie? <br /> <br /> I also have some other questions. <br /> <br /> Who thought it was an acceptable use of study funds and resources of production? <br /> <br /> who approved the final scenario (and what did that person burn when he approved it)? And finally, why did anyone think that he deserves to be released in theaters, where the average cost of admission is from 10 to 15 dollars, depending on where you live, when should he go straight to the discount basket in Blockbuster or Wal Mart? <br /> <br /> It's so bad in this movie that I can not write a really extensive review du this film, because it exceeds the maximum permitted word on this forum, so just touch on the major issues. <br /> <br /> The plot is not boring and stupid, and the characters are as interesting as watching paint for eighty minutes, but the biggest thing I see wrong in this movie is acting. <br /> <br /> While most of the actors do not have any talents that will probably be forgotten in a few years, <br /> <br /> the only big name in this movie is Eugene Levy who spends almost all the time on screen with that deliberate smirk on the face that says to the viewer, "I know it's not. It's funny and I'm wasting my talents, but hey, I pay for it, so who cares," does not even try to make fun of it (it really deserves something better than this garbage). <br /> <br /> As I mentioned, most of the rest of the cast is terrible, although some of them were on really great TV shows, Tyrone Savage (from the classic Canadian series Wind At My Back) plays a character that is so unbearable , unlike yourself and irritating (there are things that he could teach tropical skin diseases) that you would almost like to die a slow and painful death on the screen, Christopher McDonald (NCIS, Law & Order) just hangs on a thread screen and wastes the talent he has , being in this movie. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the next movie in this series will be just a soft core story with a story so that they can get around MPAA and get valued by this movie, we go with nonsensical vulgarity of nakedness and senselessly insult the sexual content that should get X rating (the rating board had to be drunk or use drugs when reviewing the film for its evaluation). <br /> <br /> It is interesting that twenty-five years ago, when Wes Craven sent A Nightmare On Elm Street to the MPAA for evaluation, they forced him to cut twenty-five seconds of material (I think it was part of the death scene, which had a silicone breast cast) to avoid getting an X rating and had no choice but to do it or the movie would not be released, <br /> <br /> but this kind of unnecessarily offensive trash can get R today because everything this is done in the name of comedy, if this movie was a dramatic movie or a horror movie with this kind of content, it would be a huge stench on content and would lose the horror Rating X. <br /> <br /> The last thing that really annoys me is writing , this movie is written to play like a wet dream of a twelve-year-old kid with an extremely overactive sexual imagination, quite youthful and extremely crass, almost every exhibition situation , which is supposed to move the corpse in this film, the plot is so telegram that every intelligent viewer can see how it's coming a mile away, and so-called characters are just stereotypes of stereotypes of stereotypes, often unpleasant sexual references and constant unnecessary scenes of deviant sexual behavior it feels like this movie was written by an incompetent first year in the classroom writing class for low-rent movie schools. <br /> <br /> long and short time is the time to kill this series before it is even stupid crass and offensive, this cake is filled with road apples.
