Would anyone really look at this SEARCH if it did not contain small children running naked? From a cinema standpoint, this is probably one of the worst films I have encountered, absolutely tragic. One day the perverter woke up and thought that I would shoot a movie with little girls and I call it art, I stick it in the countryside and there is no need to tell or explain how they got there or why they do not live anywhere or have parents because movies p * rn they do not need something like that. I would like to comment on the rest of the movie, but I did not mark spoilers, so let me just say that avoid, avoid and find the right movie to watch
