The 1960s is an occasional entertainment movie, most of them come from the movie laughter. It is very uneven and contains many annoying elements. Take, for example, switching between black and white and color. If this is done well, it can be quite effective, but because it was done wrong, it turned into a nuisance and only weakened already bad experiences; a significant part of the film had a strange atmosphere. Acting was not particularly bad for the film on the screen, but in other cases it was downright embarrassing. Many events were not consistent and ended in confusion. How did this family end up in some great events in the sixties? The tip was too hissing for my tastes; because he was Hollywood, everything had to end in the end. I would advise you not to waste your time in the 1960s and do nothing else with your time. I'm glad I watched it in class, not in my own time. I think I can safely say that the best part of the movie was the inclusion of Bob Dylan's music. It's just my trembling thoughts on the flick. I hope you take my advice and stay away from it.
