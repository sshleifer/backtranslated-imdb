Okay ... it was not the worst movie I've ever seen, but I heard a lot of good things about it and I was very disappointed. I saw where the filmmakers came from and tried to express the fact that both sides in this battle are not different from each other, that people get lost in the fight, etc. (well, that's my guess, anyway = ^ _ ^ =) <br / > <br /> In any case ... the movie bores me a little. I watched a lot of really long films, but this one just seemed to pull on and off and on ... mainly because I could not take care of any of the characters. I just thought ... who cares? I also noticed that the action is rather dead and the dialogue is tight. I understand that it was the XIX and everything, but most of the conversations seemed rather unnatural. No one seemed to have any emotions for most of the movie, except for melodramatic events. <br /> <br /> "Romance" in history did not seem to be supported by something other than "I'm a guy and you're a girl", which I do not consider an affair, and yet I felt that I was guided by the belief that these people are lovers. Well ... I think it's all "all this horror around us, we have to keep each other" or anything else. I also counted on some dynamics between the two best friends (who initially seemed to be interested in the girl), but it was just dropped. Maybe avoiding the stereotypical love triangle. I do not know. <br /> <br /> Well ... Daniel Holt was the only character I really liked. And Sue Lee was fine. I did not like Jake, but it seemed to me that he was a bit too ... without circles. Jack Bull, I did not care. And I'm pretty sure you have * to hate almost everyone else, except for the poor, normal people who just get kicked out left and right. It was quite graphic and it had all the "horrors of war", but I saw many other films with the same theme, made better. (For example, I really liked Patriot, even if he was a little emotionally manipulative). But, as I said, I'm a cynic. What can I say? :)
