For months before the release of this movie you saw him advertised in all kinds of print media, so I waited patiently for his video release to see what the hype was all about. After finishing, I had to apologize to my roommate for taking up the VCR for the last hour and a half to watch such a horrible movie. Basically, it fails because it's a movie based on a character that can not be recovered. With the exception of Amanda Peet (whose only advantage is that he is Amanda Peet), you can not stand any of them. The film is based on a dialogue that is sophisticated, moronic and crude. The only funny character is Eric, whose portrait of the only married member of a group of friends is dead. The final change, which aims to make the three main characters laugh, instead inspires the same kind of resentment to Peeta. In summary, rent only if you are desperate or have a dark sense of humor.
