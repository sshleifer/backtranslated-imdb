You can call it a flop, and this is also very big! Quality is not related to the words "National Lampoon", but at least the entries for Holidays and Animal Houses were fun, but this offer must be their most unusual feature I have seen. Ugh! This three-part tale is madly trying to parody the stereotypes and stereotypes that flooded Hollywood movies that turn out to be completely unkind and crude. <br /> <br /> "Growing Yourself". - Jason, corporate lawyer, decides to quit his job and leave his wife so that both of them can grow and do what they always want to do. This life, as Jason sees it, takes care of the children, but his decision to follow this path may not be right. <br /> <br /> Speak of lead, nausea and stiffness. The little performance of the charming Diane Lane is the only attraction. It seems that the satirical element indicates more than just providing it. Stupid humor is tight, flat and especially pointless. Peter Riegert is very impertinent in the lead role, and Teresa Ganzel is playing with her role. <br /> <br /> "Success in the fight" - After completing the collage Dominique Corsair gets a job as a stripper and rape with butter by the presidents of the dairy company. For the return of money, he is interested in the margarine industry and practically operates at the "very" summit. <br /> <br /> Probably the best of these three, but the competition was not great. they want to be more subtle thanks to their sexual and power-oriented tone, but they still feel more cheesy and forced. The idea had something promising and ingenious to build, but lethargic stimulation begins to weaken to the end and a catastrophic dialogue does not Humor tries, but more often does not disappear, despite starvation, Seductive Ann Dusenberry is quite cold and manipulative (well after painful attempt) and likes to reveal gracefully that's all Even the skimpy outfit of a stripper seems to be fully prepared for the first half of history, and the appearance in fun smaller stages ranged from Dick Millar, Mary Woronov, Olympia Dukakis, Fred Willard, Robert Culp and Joe Spinella's favorite queue. <br /> <br /> "Locals" - a serial killer that leaves copies of driving licenses after each murder, is followed by an enthusiastic na√Øve rookie and his old gray partner. However, a young policeman learns that being hard is the only way to face him when the couple encounters one situation after another. <br /> <br /> Stupid! Oh yes. Sure, if you're going to fake something very sky-high, make sure laughter comes out of it. Of course, they forgot about it! Even at 30 minutes of running, the boy is pulling it! The crazy feigned performance of Robby Benson became quite overbearing, and his tired Richard Widmark did little as his partner. Christopher Lloyd underestimates the role of a serial killer, but his frightening and sympathetic behavior works well and shows other traces. Elisha Cook Jr., Rhea Perlman and Harry Reems appear. When jokes appear, they really feel synchronized and become outdated due to the repetitive joking of these clay stereotypes. <br /> <br /> In total, the idiotic material intertwined with its skits is one-off and the unbearable script is basically inept and pointless. Only one or two gags come out of every segment, but there really are too many cheap smelly or ordinary mischiefs that get stuck in your head. This is because it virtually becomes what it is trying to entertain and it basically shows every story. He loses his sight. The performances range from hot to cold, but who can not deny the embarrassment that most faces feel. The first taste of director Bob Giraldi is surly for "Growing Yourself", but "Success Wanters" showed some small blooms with mild effectiveness. Henry Jaglom is doing a hardworking job at "Places." Rick Meyerowitz's vivid drawings that open the film are carefully elaborated and give it style and mood. <br /> <br /> This low-comic comedy pours it over himself, and the famous scenes enjoy the main interest. But is it really worth going through this horribly lame and restless outfit to see them. It depends on you.
