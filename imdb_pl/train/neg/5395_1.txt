Kenneth Branagh tries to transform the dark, rarely produced comedy of William Shakspeare into a musical from the 1930s, resulting in both the evil Shakespeare and the evil musical comedy, because the actors are rarely proficient in one or other of these styles, and in some cases flounders wrong in both. Particularly painful is Nathan Lane, who seems to have an absolute hysterical feeling like Costard, but he is mistaken, and Alicia Silverstone, who deals with Shakespeare's language with the entire authority of the teenage Valley Girl who reads the middle school English class script aloud. <br /> <br /> The music numbers are staged with the "Dames at Sea" high school experience, leaving the cast clumsy and amateur during singing and dancing, with the only exception of Adrian Lester, who turns out to be a great singer and dance man. The only additional advantage of the film is the contribution of Natascha McElhone and Emily Mortimer as eye candy, but they gave much better results than in this film and it would be wise to check some other titles in their filmography and give this hopeless mess pass.
