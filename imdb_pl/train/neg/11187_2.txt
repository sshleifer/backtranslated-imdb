Fatal orders - apart from a clever plot - is that the character simply does not resonate and does not even respond. <br /> <br /> Two examples: the priest, passing through the cemetery late at night, is suddenly attacked by spirits ghosts. After fighting with them he calmly returns for a walk when his buddy appears. "Nothing wrong?" His friend asks, seeing the attack. "Only some demonic spirits - nothing I could not deal with." No reaction, no surprise, just like he changed the tire. His buddy is equally indifferent ... he must be a standard training of priests ... ["And then you put the wafer in. Have any questions? Ok, moving, Demoniczny Duch attacks ..."] <br /> <br /> Example second: At some point, the priests need an answer to the question, and only the demon (or something that now cares) can provide it. How? Why, you must ask a dying man! So the demon has an accidental person suspended from two priests so that they can ask their question to the man who is panting, wheezing. "Hey, do not kill him!" Or maybe "It's not nice!" Would be more realistic than their reaction. They never demand that they let people go or stop in reality, the closest they are to reacting to them is mild irritation. They ask and ask. <br /> <br /> I had to turn him off at this point - my brain was starting to fade. <br /> <br /> Avoid <br /> <br /> * / **** (one star out of four) <br /> <br />
