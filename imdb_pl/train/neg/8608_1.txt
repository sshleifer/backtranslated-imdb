This movie presents two of my favorite actors in Kilmer and Downey. It also offers always pleasant Larry Miller in too small a part. Nevertheless, it turned out that it is almost impossible to observe. Michelle Monaghan may be pretty, but she's almost charismatic, and the reasons for her heroine's obsession with her character are not at all understandable when it comes to the information in the film or the way it's portrayed. The ending seems pretentious and although it seems that the audience should join in the nod and batting of the film, we were unable to introduce us on the side of their heroes, and we do not want or we can not do it. <br /> <br /> Fans of the movie say that those who disagree simply "do not understand". I do not think so. The plot was not complicated or understandable. He was simply uninvolved and awkwardly and of course produced. I have it. "I just did not like it." I Went Down "by Paddy Breathnach and" Snatch "by Guy Ritchie and" Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels "are much better examples of this kind of film production, directed by Shane Black can not reach. <br /> <br /> I share my birthday with Shane Black, but looking at his credits (mainly as a screenwriter) makes me want to separate myself from any other relationship.
