I'm not familiar with the trilogy, but I came across this movie last night at Showtime. The film looked very good with stage design and cinematography, but the script was stiff and wooden. The operation was quite bad - two female wires were thought to be in working order. You never really believed what the supporting actors said. It was the stereotypical beating of Reverend without a hint of nuance, authoritative captain, hot soldier, etc. I am sorry to say that based on these deficiencies I immediately wrote them down as Canadian, not knowing that it was Telefilm's end credits from Canada that gave him back. I know I'm a terrible person. <br /> <br /> Maybe I missed something at the beginning, but hostility towards girls is never explained. Here werewolves besiege a fort, and men lose their time and energy for no reason, brutalizing two young women. FOCUS people. There is a little more urgent situation outside your walls than whether these girls are lesbians - it's just my plea for hostility towards them. If they can aim and shoot with weapons, you might as well make yourself happy with them. The question about their "immortal soul" can be solved later. <br /> <br /> I also think that this applies to the rest of the trilogy, these girls should be heroes? One of them murdered an Indian at the end who saved one of their lives. It seems to me that you are simply a victim of her state, which you can not necessarily blame for her actions, but the other is just a murderer who does not deserve her happy ending.
