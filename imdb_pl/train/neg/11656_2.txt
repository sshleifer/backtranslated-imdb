Scary Movie 2 was a serious disappointment. Just referring to movies like Mission Impossible 2 does not lead to comedy. The film opens quite well with a funny scene of rapping white people and the perfect use of James Woods and Andy Richter. Unfortunately, the movie falls. Acting is terrible. Tori Spelling looks and works completely out of place. The film looks hacked together and is surprisingly slow. Some of the longer gags in this curly snail film, including the joints and Tom Cruise's earlier film, were not funny to anyone in my theater. Fortunately, the film stops for 83 minutes in a shockingly ridiculous ending. (I say shocking because the ending does not even try to end in humor). I do not know what else to say, except that it is a sloppy, hurried continuation that will make Miramax get more cash on stupid teens. In general, a very poorly made movie.
