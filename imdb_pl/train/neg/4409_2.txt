Strictly routine western with numbers (directed by Andrew V. McLaglen, so is it any wonder?). Army colonel Brian Keith fights with the rebel bandit Dean Martin, who just kidnapped the colonel's wife (Honor Blackman, who never found his niche after playing Pussy Galore in "Goldfinger"). Fistfights, gunfights, stagecoach attacks and Denver Pyle in an auxiliary role ... in other words, absolutely nothing new or original. Speaking quietly all the time, Keith gets into a frenzy with a prostitute (a kind of shock after his performance in the television "Family Romance"), but otherwise the low-rent material is wasting Keith's nice talents. This is also bad news for Dino, who does not seem to care. Direction of hacking, bad writing and some unpalatable lowball humor attempts. * with ****
