Alan Rudolph is such a director without this special touch. For example, in "Secret Lives of Dentists" in the dental office there was one shot that could express the entire relationship between husband and wife. Rudolph wasted this. The camera is in the hallway, looking through the door of two dental offices. Dana and Dave are alone in their rooms. You have an idea about their desolation and isolation, but not much more. Lighting, colors, body language, facial expressions could be significantly improved. If I directed, I would spend the whole day, if necessary, to do it well. It's the beauty and power of the film: it can express so much, the whole life, in a few seconds <br /> <br /> The shot with the toddler entering the puddle could be improved. The child should have shown more fascination with the puddle, should have stomped and shuffled his feet, she should have tilted her head to look at the puddle with all her attention. <br /> <br /> Campbell did not deliver. He is a non-communicative man, true, but instead of communicating his inner turmoil in voice, gesture, body movement, the film is based on narrative lector and dialogue with his imagined macho alter ego, played by Denis Leary.
