I'm sorry, but every time I see a movie where a woman sucks a guy and a man only makes a bullet, the movie loses all credibility. So the new (female) Starbuck immediately stained the plot before he left the game (no pun intended). Dirk Benedict was much more credible than the sensitive protagonist-hero than the new age of Kattee Sackhoff - whose abuse is likely to be praised as a "convincing, exciting, necessary, groundbreaking performance" by politically correct new statements about today's editors of copies of the review; but in fact it is just a tired, old image of a woman with a chip on her shoulder as big as a house: the biggest clich√© on the screens. I can give this series one more shot, but the human caricatures alone will not let me fine-tune. As James Hilton once mourned: "Please tell me, just give me a story."
