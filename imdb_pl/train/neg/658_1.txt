I would like to give this film a zero out of ten. Before I went to the movie the day after it appeared, I came to IMDb to check the comments. A commentary called the film predictable and tacky with a horrible dialogue. I never approach the opinion of other people, so I wasted seven dollars on this shitty movie. It must have been one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The person who wrote the script should be pushed off the cliff. Since when the terrifying movies have juicy scenes? I swear, I'm amazed that there were no HUG GROUP ^ ^ ^ moments. <br /> <br /> I think I jumped. Once. And that's because I withdrew, thinking about my research article into English. Banner, birds / cat jumping out of nowhere, when YOU THINK something is going to happen. <br /> <br /> And the characters were STUPID. My friend and I almost DEADLY when the alarm turned on and the main character said: "I need to get my mother's shawl !!!" Idiot. Screw the shawl! Security is just a few steps, but NO, my mother's scarf (which did not match the dress By the way) is more important than my health and safety. And most importantly, they take her home, knowing that the killer knew where he lived. God. <br /> <br /> My friend and I anticipated the whole movie. And not only, I'll bet she's hiding under the bed, moments. It was: "he stole the clothes of a Bishop and escaped from the hotel" and "The detective is going down the hall, not the killer!" Moments. Films NEVER be predictable. Disney movies are not even that predictable. <br /> <br /> I'm going to finish my rant, saying it was a terrible movie. I'm glad I went to see him in theaters, so I would not buy him for $ 15, and then I hate him. It was just bad. It would be better if only one thing happened. If, after being shot by a detective, the killer would fall in the same position in which he was shot. Knife in hand, he fell and stabbed the girl down. Oh, how beautiful it would be. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time or money. Go see a good movie.
