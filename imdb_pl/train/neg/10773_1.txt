I just watched this horrible thing on TV. Needless to say, this is one of those movies that you watch just to see how much worse. Honestly, I do not know how much down the belt can go. <br /> <br /> Characters consist of one stereo lame after another, and the obvious attempt to create another "Bad News Bears" is embarrassing to say MORE least. <br /> <br /> I have seen some valuable turkeys in my time, but there is no reason to mention any of them because it is "Numero Uno". <br /> <br /> Let me introduce you, I watched Vanilla Ice because it was so bad it was fun. This ... it ... is NOT even that good.
