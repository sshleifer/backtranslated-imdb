While Leon is sweet at SNL, it only lasts a minute. Like most SNL movie sketches, this one can not fill 90 minutes. He has some lovely moments (those you've seen in the trailer), but the actors are largely wasted. Tim Meadows does everything in his power, but the story does not have too many points. Will Farrell has a bit. Farrell may be the funniest man alive ... but not in this movie. What a pity.
