Wow, after dropping the Timo Roses drive "Rout City" after about 15 minutes (South Park is more than a senseless curse ... I think some people just do not understand it) I was interested in this movie. I read quite a few positive things, and the packaging and appearance of the film seemed far from the total cost I expected after "Rout city". <br /> <br /> Surprise: the movie is not total, but the problem seems to be exactly that. Timo Rose tries to follow in the footsteps of the German Horror / Splatter cinema, like Olaf Ittenbach and the like. This means that the "barricade" is very bloody and detailed. Gore FX is not really reliable, but OK, the game is okay, but in some cases, the usual sucks. A hillbilly chick in the opening sequence is ridiculous and does not improve until he is shot. <br /> <br /> So what's the problem ... the movie is bloody, has a typical German atmosphere (including classic shots fired in blood), OK FX and modern style, like the promised packaging ?! <br /> <br /> 1. The script is entirely BS. You get a typical story about the hills / lost in the forest with a few guys and galas who meet and meet a degenerate family with hills. Everything leads to torture / mutilation scenes and seems unbelievably random and pointless. This is the first thing that makes "Barricade" half-hearted. <br /> <br /> 2. Random is also a great description for many works with the camera (I liked the repeated cut with tweezers in the extended stage of torture ... or they did not have any material, or the editor works in a hardware store). Even worse is the edition ... for sure, it is modern and much better than many other films in this genre, but its RANDOM. Everywhere there is the abuse of this typical effect of exposure and irrelevant ... there is only ... all the time. Then there is a grainy / noisy look of the film, which is also cast here and there because of it, I do not understand the meaning. <br /> <br /> 3. As with the effects mentioned above, there are many repetitive things. For example, most killings are edited using multiple reps of stabbing and hitting. It's OK, but here it is annoying and false, especially at the end. It is also annoying to assign "music" that is constantly used without any changes in the background. It does not last long until the movie is bearable. <br /> <br /> 4. All of this results in the biggest problem of this film (and many others in my opinion). If you make a splatter film with cheesy, feel its idiocy to polish it with a special FX effect and a new school edition. It looks like they are doing it too seriously. This is not fun, because the decent gore effects are wasted in this context. And where the classic gore effects are fine, computer effects in scenes such as jabbing the mouth or arrows in the end look rather stupid (and 3D splatter mostly sucks even in films with budget and decent 3D artists) /> <br / > I have often wondered if the time of serious splashes has ended and the "Barricade" is another example that it may be time to put it in the grave. It is not funny, it is not character and it is too kitschy for its appearance. The script is a cheap trial of "Wrong Turn" and "TCM" leading completely nowhere. You can understand it literally ... the ending is just there and just as random as many other things here ("I love you" in a fluttering flip ... come on!). "Barricade" tries to turn on a lot and fails ... you can be sure of fast rewinding in this movie to get a large gut, melting of a sour face, nipple nipples and a classic Friday thrashing in the thirteenth style while fingering in a tent (bloody hooray boobies !). But it is really difficult to go through this. A total failure, especially since it can be seen that it could have been something.
