The old intellectual talks about what he considers to be art in films. You get Hitchcock, Chaplin, Bergman and other things from before the 80's. To hide that he has no idea what is happening in cinemas, he throws himself at the Matrix. <br /> <br /> But it's not just the same lame talk about film art. This speech boils down to obsolete psychological clich√©s: to-ego-super ego, anal phase, sexual inefficiency. <br /> <br /> It's spiced up with the cheesy effect of Zizte editing in the films you're talking about. For someone who has a lot to know about movies, his own is, cinematographically speaking: yeiks. <br /> <br /> Speaking in Zizka's own words - I saw 5 on the screen, last night or the words of the great filmmaker: <br /> <br /> Mr (Zizek), what you just said is one of the most crazy idiotic things I've ever heard. At no point in your disjointed, incoherent response, you were not even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now more stupid for being listened to. I grant you (two) points (only) and may God have mercy on your soul.
