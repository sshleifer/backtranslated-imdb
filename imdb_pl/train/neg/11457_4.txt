WELL. I know movies that want to be John Hughes from the 80's were one-sidedly flat, so expectations for this movie were quite low. <br /> <br /> Still, after this you can find one key thing. It seems to me that I got out of my head: <br /> <br /> I just sat in the movie Rob Lowe from the 80s, who had no nudity and contained only sex tips. <br /> <br /> Acting is horrible, boring and flat figures, the portrait of Oxford is an absolute insult, and the rowing scenes are not very encouraging, uninhibited and inaccurate. <br /> <br /> Unless you have some weird Ally Sheedy or Amanda Pays, Rob Lowe) fetish, there really is no reason to see this.
