It was really a waste of time ... the film has a poor story, the story is fragmentary and suddenly ends with many gaps .... although the animation is at the highest level. <br /> <br /> When the movie started, I tried to give it a favor, telling myself that at a later stage it could become interesting, but it was never unique. The same thread was played over and over, but worse was that the main hole was a whole story about how to kill the bad ... The writer could do a lot more with the whole concept, but he seemed to have no heart and he wanted to close movie when it started. <br /> <br /> In general, too much buzz, but not able to provide it.
