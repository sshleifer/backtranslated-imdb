This is not a very good movie, but it is not smelly. It is very confusing and unnecessarily long, so rent it at your own risk. <br /> <br /> My GF and I realized that this movie (think) is this: <br /> <br /> * ** MAIN SPOILERS BELOW *** <br /> <br /> After first, this movie is quite simple after removing all confusing garbage from the state of unconscious sleep (95% of the movie). <br /> <br /> Ignore what really happened: The group of school friends goes to the rave one night. They leave and take part in a car accident in which everyone except Cassie and Sean die. This is a simple short version. (That's right, I said Sean, I'm staying with me) <br /> <br /> Right after the accident Cassie is in the hospital between life and death until the very end of the movie. Here the part of dreams begins. <br /> <br /> The movie is called SOUL Survivors, right? Cassie's mind and soul continue after the accident, affecting other souls (Annie, Matt, Raven, 2 freaks and Judah) along with images conjured up by her mind (Sean, school and everything else around her). Souls are still doing what was defined as: Annie the rave-going chick, 2 weirdo-killers (from the opening scene), Father Jude still helps people etc. <br /> <br /> a long ride, showing many pictures (many of which my GF and I still can not connect), but it all comes down to the fact that it is not Cassie's time to die. <br /> <br /> At the end Cassie wakes up in the hospital after I was "dead" for a while. Her family is there and Sean. This is reality again. Is fine. <br /> <br /> Then the director adds some extra spice, trying to mislead us, showing her a small sleepy fragment in a strangled wheelchair. But this part is really a nightmare, and she wakes up next to Sean, apparently still dealing with her traumatic experience. <br /> <br /> Due to space restrictions, we did not cover all the details, but feel free to e-mail us if you want. <br /> <br />
