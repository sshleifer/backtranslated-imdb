After surviving this inaccurate movie, I admit that it is a more modern story telling than previous versions. However, he is so inaccurate and he was so politically correct that he made me crazy after seeing him. Davy Crockett was very poorly represented by Billy Bob who, it seemed to me, would probably be better manned, as Sam Houston gave love to both men. I think a self-absorbed Dennis Quaid (a true Texan) would be a great Crockett, and that would certainly satisfy his hungry self-esteem. As a Texan and a true believer in the Texan attitude, I feel that Davy Crockett was the quintessential Texan, though he was not born here. Our unofficial motto is: "This is not bragging, if it is a fact", it was created for Crockett. This last scene in Alamo, where Crockett is the last to survive, must be the biggest insult Davy Crockett ever made. To even suggest that this giant of a man and an experienced warrior will allow himself to live, he is ridiculous. Three different eyewitness reports put him dead among the bodies of a dozen or more dead Mexican soldiers after undoubtedly fierce hand-to-hand combat. Finally, this bad end of the movie allegedly depicts the battle of San Jacinto as a joint battle of 600 Texicans versus 700 Mexican soldiers, when in fact it was closer to 1,500 well-trained Mexican regulars. Any Texas school kid who pays attention in his first-ever history in Texas knows that the battle surprised the Mexican army during a siesta, and the Mexican army was so confused that they could not form ranks and fled because they had not been trained to fight with a hand in the border style to the hand.
