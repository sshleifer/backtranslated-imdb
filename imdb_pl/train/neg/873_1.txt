The manager, successful in professional life, but unable to live, meets a boy with Down syndrome who escaped from the residence. Both characters feel very lonely, and apparently less intelligent will show the performers the beauty of small things in life ... With this argument, an atmosphere similar to Amelie and sentimental music, I did not expect a moralistic disgusting movie. In any case, because there were some interesting scenes (the boy is sometimes quite a brutal guy), and the interpretation of both actors, Daniel Auteil and Pasqal Duquenne, was very good, I decided to watch the movie. French cinema in general has the ability to show something that seems to be living, in contrast to the more stereotypical American cinema. But for this reason, it is more disappointing after the absurd ending, with the boy's impossible death, charming tone, executive family happiness, cheap morals, unbearable laughter daughters, guy waving from the sky like Michael Landon ... Really nasty, in my humble opinion.
