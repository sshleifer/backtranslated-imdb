I just had evidence confirming my suspicions. A group of children, from 14 to 22 years old, placed a fantastic "mega screen" offer on the "Titanic" DVD. Only two of them have seen it before. But everyone saw Kate's, Leo's and Celine Dion's moment so many times that most of them thought they'd seen the whole movie. Soon after the start of the epic they began to worry, some of them asked others - "call us when the iceberg appears." Over an hour and a half of the movie, only two girls who saw the movie before, were still there. They started shouting: iceberg, iceberg. There was panic, they all came back to see the sinking of the Titanic. They sat with their mouths open, emitting Ohs and distant exits. Just like I thought, when the movie came up on the stage. What is this? An hour and a half, waiting for the damned thing to drown, but what about the rest. Dr. Zivagho, for example, had a similar time, but think about how much this movie is going on at the same time. In "Titanic", Leo teaches Kate how to spit. Look at the faces and hands supposedly creme de la creme in the dining room of the first-class ship. Look at historical details if you can find them. The plot is so thin that they have to bring in weapons and shootings on a ship that will soon sink. The film standards are a real sink. All efforts are focused on the special effects and ends of the opening week. The film has become the most profitable film of all time, so what do I know?
