I rated the basic instinct 2 highly, but this film got a rating below 4. This film received only 4 from me, but it has 7.3 from over 600 people. I do not see the reason why they like this movie so much. <br /> <br /> This movie is boring because it almost never leaves these rooms in this broken big house. There are only 5 people in this film. It's almost two hours, which is totally unnecessary. Many dialogues are slow and irrelevant. The film's tone is also dark blue, which is depressing to watch. The film can be shortened to several sentences. <br /> <br /> This movie reminds me of "Three times" directed by Hou Hsiao hsien that one is equally boring, dialogues are equally boring. He also has a high rating! I had to stop watching this movie after the first story was over. <br /> <br /> This film lacks passion and emotions.
