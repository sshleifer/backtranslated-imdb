There is not much to say about it. Gammer is a turtle that breathes fire. He is released by a nuclear explosion. He heads towards the ground and begins to destroy buildings, tanks and other garbage (yes, power lines.) I almost forgot. At some point, at the beginning of the film, he befriends the little boy and instead of throwing him or crushing him, he puts him on the ground. Safe. From that moment on we must watch this small plump guy who appears and escapes, appears and escapes, appears and escapes. For some reason, Gammer is able to hear this kid from a distance of 20,000 feet. Well, the plot is to try to get Gammer to a place where you can put him on the rocket and shoot him into space. As usual, the monster is clumsy and uncoordinated (a guy in a Gammer suit). The Japanese army (with the help of the Americans) uses enough ammunition and firepower to resolve the national debt, and of course it does nothing good. They should know that. We saw many monsters on Tokyo. Not to put them off, because they can be fun, but it's not really good.
