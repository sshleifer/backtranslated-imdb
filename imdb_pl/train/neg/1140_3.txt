Terrifying, but above all in the sense that it will end before the age of 70. I saw it as a late night in 1976 and I thought it would never end. Like crackers, it's better than nothing (but only). <br /> <br /> Ray Milland is a bit scary because it looks like it has been stuffed by an ejector. Yvette Mimeux looks like she's been smoking the whole beautiful Burbank Brown center. <br /> <br /> It's the kind of Roy Roses Rosemary's Baby. It's one turkey that should never have been made. If you have insomnia and it is 1:30 on Saturday morning and there is nothing but Roller Derby Chamionship replays from 1972, I think it beats. But God will help you if it's your only choice of entertainment.
