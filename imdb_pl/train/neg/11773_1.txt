I left a few years lurking on these CDs due to lack of intelligence transmitted by reviews that periodically appear in the IMDb space of this film. I saw this movie thanks to the New York Asian subway cinema festival (which this year had an excellent selection of films, see: vital, June snake, CHA NO AJI, Survive Style) and regretted every day that the scene from this movie relaxes in the depths of my mind and becomes a living memory. <br /> <br /> I'm sure you can read a glorious summary of the movie from Subway Cinema, which probably caused me to make a mistake of dragging my friend into the movie. The description has built a kind of horror, which I missed for some time, relying rather on ordinary horror than on cheap fears. In fact, it was different. He based himself on cheap laughter. <br /> <br /> An incredibly annoying announcer described the film as "Lesbians join forces to fight monsters." Completely untrue. In this video, there is a partial story that makes it seem that the relationship between the girl and Pookie actually goes somewhere. More lies. This movie seems to be a shortcut to the movie "Are you afraid of the dark?" The story is ridiculous and she managed only to make you laugh and confusion after finally canceling the attempt to watch the movie with any seriousness and try to forget about the $ 9 you wasted next to the door. I almost want paul spurrier to be in the audience so I can laugh at him and ask why he's wasted 5 years in Thailand to make a bad softcore horror-cum-porn, which belongs to the spice channel that only managed to get the actress excommunicated with family and caused a minor commotion at the Belgian film festival. The only confusion that caused it was gurgling in the lower part of the intestine, because it could not get out of what it is. In any case, I hope I can reject anyone who made a serious mistake by seeing this movie, it was really one of my three worst movie experiences, knocking my soulplane to number 2.
