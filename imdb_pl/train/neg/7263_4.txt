This old-fashioned British-Spanish co-production looks great, as you can see. I have three versions, two VHS tapes, one DVD and all are terribly trimmed, so much so that it looks like buildings are talking to each other. Few movies suffer from pan and scan, as director Robert Parrish seems to be so impressed with the panoramic process that he tended to use both sides of the screen simultaneously, neglecting the middle. Another user comments that we can see how all church residents massacred at the beginning; not in any of the copies I have. There are several sudden cuts of peasants shooting from rifles, one Mexican officer is shot, Shaw and Landau are celebrating, and that's all. We'll never know why Shaw became a priest (if he really is), we'll never know what's going on with Don Carlos (Savalas), though I suspect he was called home to play in Kojak because his passing seems arbitrary . And there is a strange flashback sequence in which Michael Craig (The Mysterious Island) dances in a bowler hat and bad clothing in the great old British music tradition to the hit "BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS", not sung by Johnny Horton here, but with some lyrics that never I have not heard before. On the plus side, the location is great, a huge old ruined fortress with Escher-style stairs leading nowhere, a bit of pleasant scenery chewing by Robert Shaw and good performances by Stevens, Landau, Lettieri and Telly Savalas as Telly Savalas. I did not like this movie, but I did not see it exactly. I will look for a panoramic version and then I will make a decision.
