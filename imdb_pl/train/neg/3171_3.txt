Was this the biggest movie I've ever seen? No. Was this the worst? No. <br /> <br /> As a mother of four children, it's nice to see something that was light and fun. It was great, but it was delightful. <br /> <br /> I think there was certainly room for improvement, but he tried. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if this movie deserves an extreme level of abuse on the part of another reviewer. Of course, they do not care about Eva Longoria. I think it was better at it than at The Sentinel. I think movies are a matter of opinion. Actors play a huge role in whether it is a hit or a flop. <br /> <br /> Maybe the cast did not come out. Maybe there were too many things. <br /> <br /> I just wanted to be in favor of the average movie, not the horrible one. It can just be a chick. As if in the movie The Split-Up or French Kiss. My husband is still talking about them. :)
