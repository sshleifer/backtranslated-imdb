Seriously, I have read some of the reviews of this movie and I have to ask if you were people watching the same movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, I give the directors a lot of credit for being able to play Los Angeles in 1930, but so what? <br /> <br /> None of the characters is sympathetic, the story seems pointless, Karen Black is not just a very good actress. Donald Sutherland is simply angry. (and his character "Homer Simpson" makes me wish for an animated version. D'oh!) Then you had a frightening actor, creeper Billy Barty, etc. <br /> <br /> cinema lovers love it, and the rest of us look at each other and go, "What the hell!"
