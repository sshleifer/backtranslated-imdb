Recently, I decided to return to the Omen trilogy just to discover that {put here demonic music} is fourth. I did not expect too much of it and in this respect certainly met my expectations. If you like to watch bad movies, then maybe a movie for you. Where do we start? <br /> <br /> From the very beginning the look of the movie "made for TV" was obvious. Music was often inadequately suited to what was happening in the film, and therefore (at best) distracted. The script had all the tension of an 8-year-old work of fiction. But we must say that the missing scenario was very well suited to the terrifying acting. Numerous scenes left me to consider whether it was a script or acting, which was a source of ridicule. <br /> <br /> The story itself is quite thin, focusing on all the crazy antics of Damien Thorna's daughter, adopted by poorly behaved and poorly preserved nuns. There are many mysterious and intricate deaths that personally made me yawn when the "drama" developed, and an ordinary external researcher of the whole matter. Later, through some medical phenomena, Damien Thorn Jnr is born. And that almost ends the story. The whole is done quite badly from the very beginning because of the lack of tension, thanks to which the film is one monotonous and / or funny scene after the other. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of WTF?!? moments that provide unintentional comedic relief. For example, what happens to a serious over-reaction at the beginning of the movie when the child scratches the mother's cheek? This is not a 360-degree omen. I also laughed at the excessive reaction during my baptism. The child is crying and everyone looks very worried. A perplexed mother runs out of the church, and the priest is very disturbed when he crosses. What? There is also a nanny at a young age who seems to have a carte blanche, exposing an 8-year-old to all kinds of alternative spiritualism. I laughed when Nanny suggested bringing distressed Delia to the psychic market to meet her hippie nanny's friends, and her mother just shrugs and lets it. "Yes, it's cool, fill my worried 8-year-old daughter with all this mysticism. Cool. I do not have to be there. " Of course, this could be expected from the mother, who allows her daughter to adopt a fully adult Rottweiler, whom they meet on the street, who could bite the girl as an appetizer. The whole scene on the psychic market is quite comic in a slapstick manner, from the terrifying reactionary looks of the minds to Delia, to the resulting hell. <br /> <br /> I also laughed at the "strange accident" death of the nun. Here is a religious fanatic (who is described as part of a cult) who fanatically preaches in a cave full of rattlesnakes to prove that God's Glory will protect them. He opposes the serpents, handles them and SOME is bitten several times. This is not a strange accident. More like a successful suicide attempt. <br /> <br /> The serpent-nun scene was not the only comical death. Car accident with slow speed, resulting in beheading at the school car park. Then there is a demolition ball in slow motion directed straight to the detective. It seems to me that I could go and make coffee, when the slow motion only started to come back to see the demolition sphere still pointing straight to the "worried" detective. There is also the quintessence of death in which the gun was shot and fired, and both act as if they were shot for a few seconds, exchanging terrified looks. Then someone goes down the stairs, revealing who the real victim was. In addition, the death of the priest at the beginning of the film seemed a bit strange and pointless to me. He runs, looking at the architecture of the church. Of course, finding it quite disturbing, it eventually falls, squeezing your chest and dies. Apparently something demonic was happening because that's what the music suggested. Ummm. WELL. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that others have reviewed this film positively and in particular as a "worthy continuation". It is hard not to notice the heartless scenario, unrealistic action and the wrong musical score. The film lacks tension, based largely on Delia's "demonic gaze" to provide a sense of horror, which after a short time becomes quite annoying. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: This is a bad movie in which the only buy-back is the unintended potential of being a comedy.
