I sat down to watch the Bachelor 14 season ("On the Wings of Love"), I knew that I would be in an "interesting" time. I watched some of the previous bachelor's seasons; I'm watching an episode or two and missing three more. I think that a bachelor's degree is often attractive and intriguing, although it often lacks quality and morality. <br /> <br /> "On the Wings of Love" describes in detail the journey of Jake, the 31-year-old commercial pilot from Dallas, Texas, to find true love, the true love that can be found in a series of dates dating all through season. Jake meets 25 beautiful girls from all over the country. He begins to get to know them a little, but it is mostly superficial; how well can you meet someone in a few 5 minute talks? Jake tries to know his true intentions from the very beginning, at least for the public. He noticed that he did not want only love or good fun, but he wants a fianc√©e or a wife. We can only assume that he also explained to women in the competition. If this is the case, it may explain some of the actions of women to some extent. Women are super competitive. Although they do not know Jake at all, they are still there to win, regardless of the cost. <br /> <br /> Women were not only competitive, but also confident and catty. Threats, stabbing in the back and warnings "Take care!" All show that these women were not there for good either. Jake noticed that he was not just looking for sex appeal, but was looking for a "connection". However, the girls pulled out all the stops to try to impress Jake with the sex appeal. They came to the residence in scant dresses? either low or short. <br /> <br /> While some girls seemed to maintain a sense of decency, others missed the note altogether. One girl, Channy, noticed that Jake was a "good guy" for whom she could be a "naughty girl". She said Jake could land on his "runway at any moment." She got speculation from other girls for her provocative statement that showed their approach to these situations. <br /> <br /> So a dating show could not be so bad, right? In addition to the obvious issue of sex appeal, there are other problems that make this seemingly harmless performance. Is this the right way to find a future partner; competing for someone's attention, hovering in extreme proportions? Unfortunately, it was America that limited dating to these days: pleasure and sex without commitment and a little luck on the side. <br /> <br /> Another problem is the premature emotional attachment that many girls associated with Jake. A few girls seemed particularly attached. One girl said: "If I do not get this first impression, it will kill me!" As mentioned earlier, they do not even know him yet, and she spoke about a particular rose, not just one of 15 roses, which can not be eliminated. <br /> <br /> Michelle in particular seemed to have some problems joining Jake. Other girls noticed it too. After one particular outbreak of Michelle, Vienna assured Michelle that she suffered a "mental breakdown and we were only here an hour". Michelle got the last rose of the evening at the first concert? narrowly missing elimination? and he was very emotional. Other girls thought it was just ridiculous. Another girl also cried, but because she was eliminated. <br /> <br /> It started with Survivor, and from there it just took off? reality TV. Shows our entertainment interests as a country; if we did not watch concerts and give them good ratings, the networks would not continue to run them. The only logical conclusion that can be drawn is that enough America is addicted. One thing is clear: America (generally) loves reality TV and related traps. <br /> <br /> It begs me to ask a question: why do we like reality TV so much? What attracts us? Is it because we see similarities to our lives, or because we want to be sure that we are more stable and less pathetic than others? Regardless of what attracts us, we should be careful about the media and entertainment that we allow to fill our minds. I'm not saying that all reality shows are bad; however, I say that we must evaluate each of them. <br /> <br /> Episodes used for criticism: Premier and Episode 2 season.
