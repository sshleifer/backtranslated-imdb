I came to the conclusion that any horror with Orson Wells would be strange. Necromancy was certain, but it was a little too strange because it was good. The film really has a terrifying feeling, because it concerns the satanist / witch Sabbath in a small town and attempts to escape the young woman. However, the director seems to deliberately confuse the audience using flashbacks and dream sequences. There are too many unanswered questions in the final. What's worse, because the story is so tangled, it's difficult to eradicate any character. It seems strange that Welles would agree to the headline of the film, especially since there is not much to do. Maybe one day they'll release a tape of material from this movie. Now it would be really fun!
