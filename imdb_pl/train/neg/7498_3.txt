Spike Lee is in the fall from his early successes and this mess does not help. I looked at my watch often hoping the film would end or get to the bottom. Lee's first movie with a completely white cast is a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> What's going on? That Italians swear and love funky sex, but not with their wives? If I wanted to see Scorsese, I would go to Scorsese. The unusually thin figure of the Godfather adds only to the stereotype. <br /> <br /> I admired several of Lee's films, especially "Do the Right Thing". This movie is a waste of time.
