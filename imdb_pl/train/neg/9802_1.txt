Many people say that this program is only for children. Hm, when I was a child (about 7-9 years old), I first watched the program. It was disgusting to me. I talked to other children about it and, of course, about other shows and I know what? It was a measure of disguise, whenever we wanted to emphasize something stupid (on television or anything else), we said "Uh, like the Power Rangers" and we laughed. <br /> <br /> And before visiting this site I could not imagine that there really are MMPR fans. It was so strange to me that I decided to watch them again and try to understand why people like it. I did not like watching it. But it came to me: maybe I do not have enough imagination? May be. However, this argument is not enough to evaluate it for more than 1 star.
