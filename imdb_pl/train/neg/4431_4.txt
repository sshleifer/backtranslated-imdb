This painful comedy drama gained surprising sensational reviews after the release in 1979. I remember the opening of the LA Times movie section and the 2-page advertisement of "Chapter Two" filled with glowing subtitles like: "Better than" Goodbye girl "!" And "Neil Simon does it again!" What does Neil Simon do? Accepts the autobiographical situation ( remarriage too soon after the death of a beloved spouse) and makes her rusty, unpleasant and - most badly - indecent ... James Caan plays Neil - er..o George - a writer who can not come back to life after losing his wife, enter the thrilling Marsha Mason (real Mrs. Simon ... soon to be Mrs. Simon) who tries to love George despite his moods and general melancholy. Mason is very attractive here and maybe would save the day if not for Caan's indifference (not to mention the sub-thread for painfully slim blonde Valerie Harper, who brings the proceedings to a grudge.) I liked the explosion of Mason at the end ("I'm wonderful! I am NUTS about me! "), But I did not see a happy ending for these two people ... and time proved me right. ** with ****
