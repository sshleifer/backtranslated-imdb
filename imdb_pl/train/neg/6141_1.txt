One night I waited for my friends to come back to apt, and "Gymkata" happened; I have watched too much. It's really fun and really scary. Think of it this way - if in your work you have an idea for something so bad and you did it in such a terrible way, how long will it take? Not as long as this movie. This, of course, must be seen.
