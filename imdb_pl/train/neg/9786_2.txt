OK, I bought this movie from Woolworths for my friend because of the joke on his birthday because the cover had sexual innuendo. <br /> <br /> But we decided to watch it anyway. Only for the purposes of merriment. <br /> <br /> And I'm sorry, but it must be one of the worst movies ever. <br /> <br /> It started well and we thought "Ok, it could be alright". But after about 10 minutes we were unfortunately wrong. <br /> <br /> It started when the "mysterious footballer" turned out to be the most obvious figure, Scouser / Australian (I say this because he had an accent that could not be identified) who acts, I can say, was fatal. <br /> <br /> Then it came to an end and by that time we all lost the will to live. The final with paint. <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked about this story is the fact that they did not win, but they did win it aggressively enough. <br /> <br /> And I know this has nothing to do with it, but the name of the band was just awful. Critical injuries. I mean, they could have chosen a more amazing name, such as "The Destroyers of the Anti-Christ" or something like that. Or so it should be called a movie.
