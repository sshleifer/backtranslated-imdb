I caught this movie on Sci-Fi before starting work. If you're interested in diving Dean Cain and avoid flames at least a dozen times, this movie is for you. If that does not get you interested, well, I'm afraid you want to be the one who's in flames because this movie is pretty bad. Acting is terrible at the beginning, horrible, terrible. All characters are completely unpleasant, and the dialogue is worse than a typical Z-class S-science movie. At the end of the movie, he began to remind me of "Hollow Man" (along with escaping the elevator shaft), with the exception of the Dragon, not a naked, invisible man. However, unlike other similar films, this one was not even terribly bad ... it was just bad.
