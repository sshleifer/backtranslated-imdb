Wow ok. So, after reading this little dispute, I decided that I had to see this movie for myself. This movie is horrible. I stopped watching him. I definitely recommend cleaning the wardrobe instead of watching this movie, you'll be more frightened / funny. <br /> <br /> Low budget with poor performance. <br /> <br /> Whoever gives this movie 10s is completely incorrect and should be ignored. <br /> <br /> I am not connected to any other reviewer in any way. <br /> <br /> Simply, this movie is not worth watching. > <br /> Very, very BAD FILM.
