if they give me the option of negative numbers, I will use this. This movie was really terrible. I went to theaters, expecting it to be terrible, and somehow I managed to exceed my expectations. <br /> <br /> The script was weak, acting was painful. I wanted to leave, but my friend rode and wanted to earn her money, I think we were both disappointed. <br /> <br /> Rising breasts, when girls have great power and change their hair, the color was just bad. Eddie Izzard seemed just angry for the role of the super villain, but he was strangely weak and stupid. Jenny Johnsons (Uma Thurman) came out as psychotic and strange, just like Matt's friend (Luke Wilson) Vaughn (Rainn Wilson.
