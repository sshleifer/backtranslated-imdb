Well, there's no real conspiracy, it's just an excuse to show scenes of extreme violence and unjustified sex (which can sometimes be fun, but not in this case). What else can I say about it ...? The action, when it happens, is ingenious and there is a nice scene in which two figures fall from the skyscraper (one must be several miles high), but generally there is not much to offer "Kite". Follow if you like, but you do not miss much if you skip this ...
