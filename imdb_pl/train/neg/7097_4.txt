This movie has such an inexorable low-cost class B on all stages, effects, etc. That you think they spent 80% of the budget on Connery. It's like watching some of the Star Wars Commander stuff (completely out of content). <br /> <br /> The story can be described in one word: FLAT. And oh my God, I do not remember anyone so uninteresting for a long time. We have no reason why he was so wicked (inborn defect, we are inclined to think), nor any real conviction or talent for his iniquity. <br /> <br /> If you're Connery, go hire `Forrester '.
