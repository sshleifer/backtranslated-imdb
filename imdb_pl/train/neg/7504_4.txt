I'm afraid I have to disagree with the majority. I've found a bit boring Spike Lee lately! Although he tried something else, i.e. Not only documenting the rise and fall of a serial killer, I do not think it works too well. <br /> <br /> It really is a bit too much - Vinny (John Leguizamo) and Dionna's relationship (Mira Sorvino), Ritchie's lifestyle (Adrien Brody), and then local mafia types. The story is good, but in the end it's all you have - 2 or 3 stories. Did not Mr. Lee put the film any further in this direction thanks to such a provocative assassin? > <br /> <br /> However, there are some good points. All scenes with the killer of "Son of Sama" by David Berkowitz look very nice (color saturation, etc.), and the game is pretty good throughout. <br /> <br /> In general, I felt that different stories would work well on their own or without homicide. In the end, he was not strong enough. <br /> <br />
