Although I am generally a supporter of a well-made film, I am not limited to films that escape these borders, and more often I like and admire films that successfully "break the rules". And it is quite true that the director Pasolini breaks the rules of established cinema. But I also think that it does not break them successfully with any real point. <br /> <br /> Pasolini's work is visually shocking, but it is not a matter of what is actually on the screen than it is filmed, and the bitterness of his films seems to be less a matter of artistic choice than the result of amateur cinematography. This applies to DECAMERON. Pasolini often preferred to use actors, and although many directors did it with an extraordinary result, under the direction of Pasolini his non-actors remain non-actors. This also applies to DECAMERON. Pasolini quite often contains images designed to shock, insult or otherwise interfere with the audience. Such elements can often be used with a surprising effect, but in Pasolini's hands such elements rarely seem to contribute anything to the film. This also applies to DECAMERON. <br /> <br /> I was given to understand that there are many people who like and even admire Pasolini's films. Nevertheless, I have never met any of them and I have never been able to read anything about Pasolini or his works that made such a taste or admiration understandable to me. Judging by his works, I am of the opinion that he was a fundamentally amateur director who did not "break the rules" as much by choice and lack of skills - and who was initially applauded by the intelligentsia of his time for "existential boldness", simply confirming him in bad habits as the creator of the film. I find his work boring, not impressive and pretentious. The same applies to DECAMERON. It is also, unfortunately, true for practically every Pasolini film.
