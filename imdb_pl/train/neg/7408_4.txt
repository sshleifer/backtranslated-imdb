I'm not sure why I clicked "contains a spoiler," because quite honestly there are not enough explanations in the movie to know enough to happen to spoil it. <br /> <br /> Visually mainly provides. Well, in addition to monsters with a rubber mask from the 80s. I will say now that before watching this I have never seen Lordi's band, nor did I know anything about them that they won the Eurovision. Apparently the monsters in this are band members, almost on stage. Anything. In any case, I did not know this when watching. I thought that monsters / demons are usually passable. Almost. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure that behind what we see on the screen is a semi-consistent explanation, but maybe it's better not to know. It would probably be really unbelievable to think about it. The action makes it roll fairly well, so that the viewer can have fun, even if half of this factor jokes with wtf, and more precisely in this film. <br /> <br /> I gave him four mainly because I'm laughing at it, especially because it does not explain anything. I had to be in the mood in which I was, but for some reason I thought this toy was funny. Then I check the movie on the Internet and find out that NOBODY knows what the hell is supposed to be. It made me even more amused and raised my score by an additional half point to 4/10. <br /> <br /> It is not frightening or particularly consistent, but it is quite nice visually and sonically. In general, it is not necessary, but you can watch them. Do not expect too much and do not expect it to make any sense and can entertain you if you have the right mood.
