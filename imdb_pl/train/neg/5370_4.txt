Råzone is a terrible movie! It's so simple. It looks like they were trying to make a movie to show the life of the drum. Like Zappa many years ago. Unfortunately, Denmark does not have good young actors. Leon is still a little girl in "Krummernes Jul", and Laura is simply not good enough to play such an important role. several times in the movie he plays with the soul and it destroys the movie! <br /> <br /> Even if I think it's a movie you should see. I do not agree that teenagers behave this way, but I think they can show you how it can end if you let your child go. It is also important to support Danish films and new companies such as "Film folket"! <br /> <br /> all in all, I think people should see Råzone. Not because it's a great movie, but because it's a movie that deals with important topics. I also think that it is important to emphasize that there are scenes full of violence in it, and actually in these scenes Laura works best. - like the end in which he holds the gun!
