Van Damme. What else can I say? Bill Goldberg. WELL LET'S GO. We now know that this movie will be really awful. <br /> <br /> I saw the first five minutes of this movie at TBS, knowing it would be bad. But even I did not think it would be THIS bad. The plot is awful, Van Damme is getting old (in the end), but unlike Arnold, his films are also. <br /> <br /> Forget about this movie. I can not see it. Always. I would not even pay to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> 1/5 stars - in his heart lies a wonderful, thrill ride thrill. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe not, but marketers would definitely like us to think so, right? <br /> <br /> John Ulmer
