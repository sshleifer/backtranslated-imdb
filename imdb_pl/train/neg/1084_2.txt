I rented this DVD for two reasons. The cast of great actors and the director, although Robert Altman can be hit or skipped. In this case, it was a huge miss. Altman's attempt to create tension fell on his keester. After watching Kenneth Branagh in a good movie like "Dead Again," I did not think he could contribute to such a turkey, and I hope it does not ruin his reputation. It seems that Robert Duvall fell into the hands of most single Oscar winners. Down the spiral, which includes actions in money eating movies, such as this one. Duvall was once a great actor in excellent films, although his best performance was not "Tender Mercy" but "The Great Santini". This movie was a really big waste of time. I give him 2 out of 10.
