... that would be what you have. <br /> <br /> Words themselves can not describe how bad it looks. If you have trouble falling asleep, pop it and I guarantee you will leave in fifteen minutes. <br /> <br /> Robert Lowery was quite a good actor in the 1940s - but he called here. In one of the interviews, Johnny "Duncan" Robin said that in one scene he and Batman had to run away from the car home, and Lowery was doubled from the camera range, because his belt was too tight! Duncan himself looks more like a motorcycle hood than a wonderful boy - in fact, he is rather a guy in his thirties who is waiting for Lowery to start, so he will be able to put on a big cloak. <br /> <br /> Running a batmobile that seems to have left the party cars used by Honest Al below the price of the sticker - Dynamic Duo does not put much effort into concealing the fact that it's Bruce Wayne's car rides - in fact it is marked by several characters throughout the series. <br /> <br /> Acting is wooden - the sets are cheap - dialogue is frightening, and if there was even a script that he followed, I'm sure he read "Batman says something here" because it looks like that they are inventing what is happening. <br /> <br /> Batman's belt is made of a thin fabric with no visible pockets to store gadgets - in one scene, when Batman needs a full-size flashlight, which the producers simply put one on when the stage starts - he will never see again. His shield is so bad that he can not even see, and his ears look more like flops pugs of an unhappy Easter rabbit than they do anything similar to a bat. <br /> <br /> In one scene (I do not think of it), Batman replaces the radioactive counteracting money that falls into the flames when they are exposed to the air as a payoff for some hoods. It is radioactive, so it can track it down - the reason why it is highly flammable is not explained. Well, unfortunately, the bandits open the package in a cardboard warehouse - we know it's a cardboard warehouse, because Batman slips inside and pushes those boxes that look like about six ounce on hoods to knock them out - and soon the whole place burns on Earth. Thanks to Batman! <br /> <br /> In another scene after turning off the batmobile, Batman points the passing driver in the middle of nowhere and takes his car - leaving the man to take care of himself and tell him not to worry because if Batman breaks the car, the police will he will buy him another one! Yes, you guessed it, he said the car would be off the cliff in a few short seconds. It does not mean that for a driver who has probably died from trying to dig a road to Gotham City, it does not matter. <br /> <br /> There's a weary thread with Maple Lois Lane Vicki Vale who is convinced that Bruce Wayne is Batman - she had to notice the Batmobile parked in front of Bruce's house - and maybe she saw Batman and Robin running for a walk in a clearly dense populated suburban area. <br /> <br /> Everything in this series is bad - and everyone but the youngest in the audience will want to throw a toast on the screen. If you're looking for a bad movie, you could not get any better - if you want entertainment, try Burman Batman movies, Adam West Batman TV series or the previous Lewis Wilson Batman series.
