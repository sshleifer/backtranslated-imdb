I have not seen anything so bad since I came out of James Bond's "Moonraker" twenty years ago. I managed to sit through all this because of Tilda Swinton, but she could not do anything to save this beast. <br /> <br /> As the intersection of "Pi", "Orlando" and "Throne", this movie has failed in every aspect of the film. The figures were cardboard and could not evoke any sympathy. The plot was unbelievable. Acting was, with the exception of Swinton, amateur. Computer graphics were worse than in the Throne. Timothy Leary was very annoying. I could continue, but what's going on. <br /> <br /> The only good thing I can say about this movie is that Tilda Swinton was in it. I have no idea why the actress of her caliber has agreed to perform in such misfortune, but most likely now regrets it. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money or time on this stinker. There is nothing worth seeing here.
