1/10 and this is only because I do not lower my grades. <br /> <br /> skip this "movie" and wait for the last movie "Trilogy", do not buy or rent. trust me, you will not miss anything. The architect does not bring any new information: _ (spoiler) _ there were more NEO in front of him, he is like no.6 or something like that. You could have come up with something like that from the first movie: Agent Smith told us that the first created Matrix did not work because it was too perfect. Trinity died, and Neo's "love" brought her back to where I had seen it before? Oh, the roles have been reversed in the first movie! same as action scenes nothing new with more opponents. Action scene (more than 20 ships) in the BIG battle we have not seen (maybe in Revolutions?) Betrayed by someone (hmmmm, maybe a guy holding a knife who wanted to stab Neo? EGM button soon. <br /> <br /> in total shameless trick to make money (especially on guys who went to see him more than once), which apparently worked like a charm.
