In the case of romantic comedies I often assess the quality of the film based on the vagueness of my eyes at the end of the experiment. Unfortunately for "The Wedding Date" I can rate a movie with only 4 out of 10 possible tears. <br /> <br /> I apologize to the fans of Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney, but I have not seen too many chemies between them two characters. The premise of the film is the reverse "Pretty Woman", in which Dermot plays the role of Nick, a valuable male escort hired by the character of Debra Kat, who accompanied her to England for her sister's wedding. The romantic relationship is likely to develop between the patron and the client. But the dialogue seemed forced and artificial. And there were not enough romantic sparks flying in Nick and Kat's relationship. <br /> <br /> In the supporting role, Amy Adams was outstanding as Kat's sister. Whenever Amy came to the screen, she served as a spark plug and catalyst for the energy of the film. Maybe if Amy Adams was cast as Kat, the movie could have more dynamics. But as it turned out, instead of reaching for Kleenex, I was looking for Visine, trying at least to pretend that this movie has an authentic sentiment and romance.
