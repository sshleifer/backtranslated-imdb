For anyone who does not know c.S. Forrester's book should be interesting. It is colorful, well-made and presents a high adventure, but for those of us who know the original stories, it is terrifying. It was difficult for me to go through it. <br /> <br /> For some reason, screenwriters seem to be forced to rewrite the stories they are working on. Of course the spoken word is different from the written word, and some episodes would be difficult to film. But why are scriptwriters rewriting history, not just adapting it? In this case, the authors did themselves. <br /> <br /> Some examples: There was no rebellion at Renown. The officers took over the ship after the half-mad captain was completely angry when he fell through the hatch - for reasons that were implied but never given. There was no court martial. The court of inquiry was conducted in an almost congratulatory atmosphere. Captain Pellew does not appear in this part of the saga Hornblower, nor the wife of Colonel Ortega. Hornblower himself was never in the brig, either on the ship or on the shore. There are many such manipulations of Forrester's story. <br /> <br /> From a purely technical point of view, I think that repeated use of the reversing device by Flash hurts the continuity of the story. > Why, oh, why did the writers have to spoil a good story?
