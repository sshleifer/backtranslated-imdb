What a waste of time and money! My hubby and I saw this movie - after watching the announcement and thinking that "it can be funny". WRONG! This movie takes about 90 minutes for a long time. Actors are trapped in a badly written scenario and can not get out. The jokes are weak and tired, and even if you do not see Wilson's naked back, you can not make any part of the movie. Special effects ..... are not. I expected that I would see the harness and cables supporting Ume in her flying scenes. And when people apparently were not able to control a faster-than-a-faster superhero's bullet or to fight scenes, they covered everything with the whirling vortex of the indistinct screen - which pretty well concealed the horrible effects. Wilson's helper was a bad pretext for a man, and Wilson had no chemistry with either Uma or his co-worker. The sex scenes were not sexy, and the funny scenes were not funny. I guess I just expected too much from these actors. None of the characters was really nice, so I ended up not having to care about the flying fig about any of them. The only unforgettable performances were the kids who played Bedlam and G-Girl as teenagers - at least they had some chemistry. Overall, the movie super stinko - I would not recommend it even as a rental - it would still be a waste of money!
