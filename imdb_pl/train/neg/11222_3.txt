Cybil Richards heads the next masterpiece of erotica Full Moon / Surrender Cinema. This time, Jacqualine Lovell (wearing a rather attractive silver outfit) is tasked with destroying all evidence of sexual activity. However, she can not resist watching the tapes, and she likes them. Erotic scenes are well filmed and set to a great soundtrack (at least for this type of film). The cast is largely horrible and mainly looks very average. Jacqueline Lovell is her extremely attractive person, and between watching sex files she manages to reveal her chest and bury her a little below. She also suits the low activity of lesbians. Honestly Lovell deserves much more than this type of tariff. Here he looks great naked, but in reality he is much more attractive in his silver dress telling about the "drama". The totally mushy movie with Lovell and the soundtrack are the only real exchangeable features. Medium even for Surrender's production and the new budget is clearly low for them.
