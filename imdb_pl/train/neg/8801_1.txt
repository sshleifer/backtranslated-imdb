Folded (edited) together with parts of the body (removed scenes) of corpses (Anchorman), Frankenstein Monster (Wake up, Ron Burgundy) is definitely not a sight for sore eyes (something you would like to watch twice ... .. maybe even once that's it.) <br /> <br /> More often than not, relativity of scenes in WURB is important for the narrator of the third person. Even more worrying is that the characters in WURB are inconsistent with the versions of ourselves that we had at the end of Anchorman (in the introductory narrative we were told that WURB takes place soon after the original). from the beginning of the film and included a hybrid co-exhibitor / lover. In this movie, he returns to his immature pranks with witty telephone conversations to Veronica (quite clearly that it is more of the same scenes from the original Anchorman connected to WURB.) This part makes the film, constantly evolving history, includes a clan robbing a bank without a cause, called an alarm clock. These scenes are almost painful to sit down. This part has been removed from the original Anchorman scripts. <br /> <br /> Most of the other scenes with the participation of our Channel 4 news team are clearly alternative / removed on the scenes from Anchorman. They go to the same event as the original, the same original scene "bitching group about having a woman in a team" and the same segment of fashion shows for cats, which Veronica had reservations about reporting. <br /> <br /> Burgundy re-creates his first date with a disk space overlooking San Diego and dinner at his favorite club Tinos. None of the characters mentions that they were on the spot before and when Burgundy enters Tinos with Veronica, introducing her to her as if they had never been before. Oh, they wear the same clothes as their original date. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I have to admit that filmmakers care - even if WURB is just a clever way to present deleted scenes related to narration. Between the two stories of Ron Burgund, this one is weaker. From the perspective of time, Anchorman managed to get up from the WURB ashes. Stay with the class, IMDb. Thanks for falling in.
