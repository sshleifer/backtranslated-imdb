I can not believe I've wasted five hours of my life on this trash. The previous five-day offer of this author was very pleasant and I could not wait. But most of the dialogue was completely incomprehensible. Suranne Jones was the main culprit because she either mumbled or murmured her poems, but most of the rest of the cast followed her example. Notable exceptions were Bernard Hill and Anne Reid, old people whose diction was exemplary. Do producers not listen to production before they are broadcast to ensure that dialogue is audible? As a result, I suppose I have lost my orientation in what is happening, and because the original storyline seemed to be transforming into a standard thing between us and the Muslims and the rest, I soon lost interest. The ending was a total highlight. A complete dud.
