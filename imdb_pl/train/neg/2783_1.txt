Some time ago I visited one of my relatives and we came to the theater, so we thought we would come and give this movie. What a mistake! This movie is horrible in every department. I've never heard about the movie before and literally everyone has not done it yet. No wonder it's as important as it gets. It's a comedy, so he says that the only fun thing is the director's ability or lack of it to make such a movie. Approaching Christmas, it should be titled how to cook a turkey in almost an hour and a half - or how long it was when I left. At the end of the movie you will feel as if you were poisoned with food on a sick turkey and you regret that you wasted your time on such dribbling. Who knows why these things arise. Some people left the theater before the movie ended and I blame myself for not leaving earlier. It really annoys me that you pay good money to see something decent, and everything you go out and see is a bad television movie that should be shown at two in the morning, in fact it's so bad, day TV should not show it. What else can he say ... probably too few bad words could do justice.
