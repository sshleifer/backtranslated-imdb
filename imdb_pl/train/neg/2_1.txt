I saw a capsule comment that said "great acting." In my opinion, these are two great actors who give terrible performances, and with zero chemistry with each other, for a great director in the worst effort. Robert De Niro must be the most ingenious and insightful illiterate of all time. The performance of Jane Fonda unpleasantly drifts across the map, because apparently there is no control over this figure, mainly because the character is so badly written. Molasses would be too fast adjective for the pace of this film. Although the intent of the movie is to be uplifting the history of illiteracy, watching it is a real "bummer". I give him 1 in 10, really one of the worst 20 films because of the level of budget I've ever seen.
