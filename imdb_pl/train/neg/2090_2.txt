I realize that this should not be BSG and I can deal with slow-paced programs if they are interesting, but I am completely uninterested and bored with this series. <br /> <br /> It seems that the BSG formula is: + Przygoda + SciFi + Zawieszenie + Tajemnica + Dramat <br /> <br /> it seems that the Caprica formula reads: Bland Drama + Moderate Scifi <br / > <br /> Maybe it will be more interesting, but from episode 3 I can barely watch it. In fact, it's at the bottom of my list to watch for a week. It is a sad state of affairs. The Syfi channel really destroyed their Friday lineup. What happened to the SG1, Stargate Atlantis and BSG glory days on Friday nights? They had a good thing there.
