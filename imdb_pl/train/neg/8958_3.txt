I did not like the first movie "Cube". It was a good idea, but the annoying acting and characters always kept me from liking too much. I really did not feel the need to watch his sequel, but when I heard, they did a third movie that would act as the prequel of the original. I was intrigued, thinking that maybe they would fix some problems with the original and provide us with an unforgettable cast of characters. Well, I thought badly. <br /> <br /> "Cube Zero" starts well enough, showing us two characters responsible for watching and maintaining the endless maze of traps that bully people in Cube. Filmmakers manage to provide a sense of mystery by establishing the daily routine of two men. It created several questions about the reasons why people are sent there, as well as the true nature of those who carry out the entire operation. They are all left to the viewer. Acting was a bit weak, but in total the first half of the movie moved relatively well. <br /> <br /> With the continuation of the story, one of the two "observers" begins to develop serious doubts about what he is doing. And then he decides to go and help the group of prisoners. Here everything quickly begins to dissolve into a blunt cheese. <br /> <br /> Sent by people who run the Cube program, we are introduced to the "Jax" form. Together with the two subordinates, he plays the main reason for the film's failure. To begin to look like "Jax" and talk more like a third-degree villain, taken directly from the James Bond movie, along with the "popular" glass eye, the same ruined any atmosphere created by the relatively pleasurable pace of the first half. What's more, it's more like a comedy than a serious movie. With incredibly simple lines maybe the writer will get bored and do not worry about it. The operation itself gets worse when the previous "observer" meets with a group in Cube. All interaction is painful to watch, just like everything else after it. <br /> <br /> Again, not making an impression on anything else, like the weak characters, dialogue and action of the "Cube Zero" is a waste of time for those who are looking for a good horror movie.
