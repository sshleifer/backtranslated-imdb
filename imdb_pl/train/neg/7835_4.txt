Man, I really wanted to like these concerts. I'm starving at some good television and I applaud TNT for providing these "possibilities". But unfortunately I'm in the minority I'm guessing that when it comes to Cinematic Stephen King. How brilliant King's writing is, the irony is that it just does not translate well to the screen, big or small. With a few exceptions (very little), the king's experience can not be filmed with the same influence that stories have when reading. Many people would disagree, but I'm sure they have to admit in their hearts that the best filmed story of the King is just a faint memory of what they read. The reason is simple. The average story of the king takes place in the scene of the minds of the heroes of the story. It gives us insight into their inner thoughts, their emotions and their sometimes broken or unreal points of view. In short, King takes readers to places where Panavision cameras can not be placed. As the audience watching the filmed King remains less than half of the information to which the reader has access. It is not too far to say that One becomes a character in the King's story that they read, while One is limited to a little peeping at the same character when filming. As long as King writes, Hollywood will try to shoot everything that comes out of the word processor, no matter if they should. I do not blame the filmmakers for the rehearsal, but they need an incredible amount of talent and caution to realize the elusive adaptation of Stephen King who works. The task is similar to converting lead into gold or some secret Zen championship. Well, next time good luck.
