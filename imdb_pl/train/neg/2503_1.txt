What a bad excuse to create movies in Zealnd. I'm ashamed to call myself a New Zealander when this movie exists and is currently playing on New Zealand satellite television (August 2006). The cast consists of a large number of local soap stars. The ship, in real life, is one of the interurban ferries that run daily between the two main islands, and even has the company logo (dolphin) still on the whole set, including the ship's funnel. The ship is to be a cruise ship / ferry between the US and Mexico. It has obvious signs of rust and old age all over the world, but it has to be a luxury ship in its virgin voyage. One of the scenes shows the snowy peaks of the southern island of New Zealand in the background for God's sake! It must have been a very cold time in the US / Mexico! The story is weak, the acting is weaker, and the New Zealand / American accents simply do not work. I expect that the New Zealand taxpayer contributed to the production costs of this film, and that was a waste of money better spent on real production. I know high school students in New Zealand who could make better films using their mobile phones. Goof: There's a truck with the sign in the hold and they've stuck the Taco Company sign on the truck door, probably to look American. But a part of the sign is above the marker - one would think that they would notice it in the prop department before joining. I would love to continue, but it is simply not worth it.
