I have never been to Paris, but after watching "Paris, Je t'aime" I go mad to visit this city! I've been to NY several times and I love the city and its neighborhoods. I expect this movie will move me, I will feel like jumping on a plane and fly straight away, but here I regret the time and money I spent with him. There is no love story between people or person and city. There are many dysfunctional meetings and relationships or people who know each other and it just does not work well. Maybe it reflects the characteristics of a city that says it has thousands of people living alone. Can not you find love in New York?
