I am sorry if half of the world is offended, but life is confusing enough. I do not have to watch it that way. A copy of Anthony Hopkins, a great time. I even watched the Break and I knew it would be a steaming stack of Quentin. But this thing is not well made and is not bold - even if it's artistic. Well-produced films have reasons for cuts and quick edits, not just "oh but it's a realistic interpretation". It will make your head hurt. It's the fastest moving picture that never took you. I still love AH and I will always give him another chance, but if you do not have time to watch bad ideas on the screen, skip it.
