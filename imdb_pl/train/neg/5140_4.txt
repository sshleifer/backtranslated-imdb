Demer Daves, is a great director when it comes to Westerns, and the "broken arrow" remains in everyone's mind. As for the melodrama, he should leave it to meet people like Vincente Minelli, George Cukor or the fantastic Douglas Sirk. The scenario is so predictable that you will not be surprised when you watch such a warm weep. The character of Natalie Wood was inspired by "imitating the life" of Fannie Hurst (see Stahl and Sirk), but who could believe that he is the black daughter of a man? Susan Kohner was more credible in "imitating life"), and Sinatra and Curtis receive such stereotypical parts that they can not do anything with them: a poor officer and rich handsome - and a sergeant. who will Natalie love? France is shown as a land of tolerance, where interracial relationships are welcome. At that time (about 1944) it was doubtful, it is still intended for people with limited possibilities that can be found here and everywhere.
