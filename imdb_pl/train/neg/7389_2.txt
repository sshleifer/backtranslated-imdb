I buy or at least watch every Seagall movie. He came out with some good movies, and then he went down to bad stories, bad work with a camera and a stroll, he almost lost me. A few movies ago he remembered how to make a decent movie. Now he forgot again. This movie is seriously dark (at every level you want to name). There is a lot of slash & gash here without a clear purpose, unless it is a warning against the army. <br /> <br /> Seagall could have taken place in many scenes, because it was often too dark to say, and the voice of someone else was used most of the time. Unfortunately, the only interesting character was the bad guy who killed the guard to escape arrest and then began to wreak havoc all over the place. Well, from when will we put an armed guard in a prisoner's detention room? In any case, this bad guy was at least colored and very focused. There is a lot of blood if you like this king of things. It seemed to me that bad guys were tearing the same thing every time. I'm glad they did not suck blood from their unfortunate victims. I'm going back to my summary. Essentially, this is a horror movie disguised as action movie.Dec 6,2006
