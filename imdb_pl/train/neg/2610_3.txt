102 DALMATIAN [Walt Disney]: I was not a fan of the previous part and this effort has all the weaknesses of the first, stupid stuffed plot, terrible in relation to the acting of Glenn Close, who tugs every scene, as if playing her own entertainment and incredibly bored and uninteresting actors leading. Once again, the dogs are the only "actors" who seem to be "real" and this is an episode. Another wasted effort here. GRADE: D
