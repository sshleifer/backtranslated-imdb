WE FAW DOWN <br /> <br /> Picture format: 1.33: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: silent <br /> <br /> (black and white - short movie) <br /> < br /> Stan 'n' Ollie mixes with a few floozy (Kay Deslys and Vera White) after heading to the theater, which burns in their absence! Needless to say, their tyranny wives (Vivien Oakland and Bess Flowers) are not entertained ... <br /> <br /> A good comedy by Leo McCarey was a narrative framework for the masterpiece of William Seiter SONS OF THE DESERT (1934) with L & H playing in victimized circumstances, forced to tell a monstrous lie that turns in a spectacular way. Many of them are very funny, especially the scene where Stan is teased by Deslys, which leads to a brutal push and shove game. However, some games are cut by Oakland and Flowers, playing their roles completely straight, which adds an element of unpleasantness to the scenario of "henpecked husband". Originally released in the UK as WE SLIP UP.
