The first mistake you make in styling a movie is to use "living dead" without really budgeting for a real zombie FX. Sure, it was a low zombie budget - really low budget. I thought it was a film school project. Amateur actors and amateur effects. <br /> <br /> It really was not that bad considering the above, and it was an interesting twist to the zombie genre. If you are going to get an "R" for violence, you might as well give us some good pictures of the attacked children. Women were so little used in this film that they can almost be classified as "gay interest." <br /> <br /> And, I'm not in Oakland. There were a lot of shootings and there were no cops!
