Immerse yourself in your favorite chair and turn on the console by dropping it into the waste disposal device. Spend 90 minutes useful. live your favorite game. Disjointed - poorly filmed - unguided garbage. It requires pieces from several other science-fiction movies and tries very hard to combine parts into a pitifully weak story. There is nothing new here, filmmakers do not realize that providing simple entertainment would lead to a monetary game, but to change the movie into a good movie, you need inventiveness and talent. Any money spent on watching this is a waste and I personally would like to regain 90 minutes of life.
