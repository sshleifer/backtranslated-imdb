There are so many silly things in this movie that I can not name a few: <br /> <br /> the character BOGART: 1. His name ?? Whip McCord (too easy, so I'll leave it. Boy, that makes "Humphrey" sound good.) 2. His long curly hair and stupid sideburns. 3. His Black Bart outfit with spurs! 4. I am not sure what shade of lip gloss he is wearing, but it is not flattering. <br /> <br /> The character of CAGNEY (Jim Kincaid): 1. His lipstick does not do him any favors, either. 2. The man is absorbed by the hat during the whole movie! Could not they find a hat that would fit him? Even a bit? !!?! 3. His pants are too tight at the back. 4. Blows smoke from the gun too many times, if you know what I mean, and I think so. <br /> <br /> If you're an accidental fan of Bogart or Cagney, and think that maybe a change of pace to see them in the west, do yourself a favor and forget about that. EVEN THE HORSES LOOKING THEM! (I mean, when they do not look bored.) <br /> <br /> I admit with all honesty that westerners are my least favorite movie genre, but I still saw a lot, much better. br /> <br /> On the comedic level or as a high camp, Oklahoma Kid works. Otherwise, beware. Therefore, see it only when you need to see every Westerner there b) you are a real Cagney or God. C) Each of the above comments appeals to you. Woah ?? ..
