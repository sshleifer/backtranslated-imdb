So I understood it as a task for Trent Harris, who from time to time teaches in a film in U of U. I think that this is his only real way to get anyone to watch his movie ... <br /> <br /> At the beginning, the documentary part continued. Yes, the kid is not in any place, but it's not good enough to be interesting. <br /> <br /> Seeing Sean Penn dressed as ONJ is the only attraction ... and after about thirty seconds he loses all humor. <br /> <br /> When Crispin Glover faces Larry, the story was better, but I could not take it anymore ...
