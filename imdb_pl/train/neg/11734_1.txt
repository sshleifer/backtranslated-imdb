Tasteless. I can not even intelligently write about the film. I was laughing about the whole movie. It was not meant to be funny. Matt Farnsworth has no idea what he's doing. His story is written, it seems, without any knowledge of Iowa culture and the problem of meta. I know Farnsworth comes from Iowa, which makes his film even more puzzling. Why do the two main characters have accents? It does not make sense. Acting was mediocre at best and sometimes difficult to watch. The film was filled with grateful violence and sex. I'm guessing that violence and sex were meant to make the movie sharp, but it turned out to be unbelievable and offensive. The end of the movie is so brilliantly bad that all I could do was laugh and watch the loans going on in disbelief. When I left the theater, everyone leaving was laughing with me. The end of the movie was supposed to cause tears, but it happened exactly the opposite. Do not waste time on this awful movie, unless you want to see ignorant, juicy, exaggerated, trivial nonsense.
