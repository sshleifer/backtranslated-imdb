Where to start ... If this movie was a dark comedy, I would say it was FANNN-TASTIC! Unfortunately for me and anyone who has free time and pennies to lose (remember, that's the price I paid, I got it from Wal-Mart), this movie was supposed to be a thriller. The only thing I got was watching the bad release of Anne Wilkes from Kirkland from Misery sans of the snowy forest. If you want to laugh, on a rainy Friday evening with friends, I highly recommend this movie. But if you want to watch something at least half decent, do not even bother. <br /> <br /> I, for example, like bad movies, the worse the better in most cases. But Wow ... and Meow WOW !! The only person in the whole movie that did not stink was a little boy, played by Vincent Berry. The only reason I even give him 3 stars is because he gave me something to do.
