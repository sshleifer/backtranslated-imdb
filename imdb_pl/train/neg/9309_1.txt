Hej wszystkim ... <br /> <br /> There really is not much to say about this movie. The basic thread is that the guy (Brandon) takes a few friends on a trip to his hut in the woods for a weekend holiday away from work. After getting the girl on the way, everything starts to be bad for everyone. <br /> <br /> The story itself (written by the actor playing Brandon, I believe that though I may be wrong) is unlikely and unconvincing, and works accordingly. Sam "Clown Killer" is rather a sad excuse for a psychotic killer. Far from being a dark, mysterious, but above all an intelligent predator, we propose a rather clumsy nursery-singing nursery rhyme that seems to undergo a small midlife crisis. The only thing that justified the writing of this commentary was the sex scene and whatever was in the film (the quality of the film led me to enjoy this kind of thing). <br /> <br /> In short, this movie falls below every possible standard set. Admittedly, while watching this movie, I shared a few beers with a close friend, so we managed to collect some of the relative entertainment value from the movie, and therefore rightly mention that S.I.C.K fell only two judgments. However, in reality (and in retrospect) the one-star rating is more than a reasonable result for the film. <br /> <br /> 1 star for ten.
