Aldolpho (Steve Buscemi), a budding filmmaker, lives in a dilapidated flat in New York and relies on his mother, who helps in renting. He has a beautiful neighbor named Angelica (Jennifer Beals), who may or may not be married, but Aldolpho would like to play in his film. When Al unexpectedly gets the financial promise to finance his movie from a strange man named Joe, he thinks he did it. I mean, until Joe takes Al for an adventure to steal Porsche for part of the financial support. Will the film be made before Aldolpho is completely free of the moral backbone? Will Angelica play in the film? It is in the view of this viewer a horrible movie. The script is terrible, with a plot that wanders greedily, not wanting. Beals virtually growls from all of his lines, and Buscemi, though sympathetic, is undefined. There are many unpalatable materials and unpalatable characters to run. Finally, the production values ​​are also very weak, which makes the film look the other time. If you have time on your hands, it's still a good idea not to risk this movie. But if you're the proverbial glutton for punishment, go ahead and watch this damn thing. In the end Beals looks beautiful.
