The Omega code was a model of cinematographic incoherence. There was some (but very little) good acting, mainly by two prophets and Rostenberg, who appeared only once and did not have any lines. Otherwise the acting was definitely bad. The plot was rather weak and only partly based on the questionable interpretation of the Bible. Certainly not one of the best this year.
