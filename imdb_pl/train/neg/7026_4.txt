On his birthday, a little boy tells his mother that he is not her son and that he wants to return home to his real mother. <br /> <br /> In a sense, Comedy De L'Innocence feels that it comes from a different time of filming, maybe the 60's or 70's. Certainly it reminded me of Losey's Secret Ceremony (1968) and Richard Loncraine Full Circle (1977), which concern the loss, grief and relationships between parents and "lost" children (interestingly both films are Mia Farrow). > <br /> All three films are filled with unpleasant characters that behave in a strange and unexplained way. All three films are cool, both emotionally and literally. All three films focus on mother-child relations, and ultimately all three films pose the question - "what is real, what is imagined?" <br /> <br /> Beautiful, but defective, does not offer easy answers and leaves lots of hanging , unexplained and strange.
