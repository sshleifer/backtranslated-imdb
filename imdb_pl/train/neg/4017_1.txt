Yes, this movie attracts attention and is considered classic in the genre of adult movies. Nevertheless, I did not like it. A woman who commits suicide in a scene more suited to horror is given the opportunity to return to earth briefly to live a life of desire that she has never done before in her everyday life. Damn sex scenes to follow. Why are they absurd, because they try to be artistic so much that they take away the sexual act. I mean, we're watching porn for sex or not. Little Girls Blue also does things in an artistic way, but is still very erotic and pleasing to the eye. Of course, the girls in this one are very cute. We have quite an unattractive main actress here and it does not help. If it turns out that the advantage in your adult film is not attractive, there is no artistic vision that will make me enjoy the movie. Sex scenes range from quirky to quirky ... I mean, there is a snake in one of them. So for me this movie just does not work, because it does not excite me, but rather turns me off.
