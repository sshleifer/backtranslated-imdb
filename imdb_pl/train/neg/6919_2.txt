My roommates and I almost shortened our TV from the many spits we made while watching this funny piece of pseudo-zen from the 70's. I've read about this bonfire for centuries and scanned my local TV shows late at night in search of the YEARS in search of this elusive turd. A few years ago our local branch of ABC was known for showing cool cinema for its night flick (eg "Frogs", "Night of the Lepus" etc.). Then one day it happened: at 1:40 on a Saturday night (over 5 years ago) it was! We had over 15 people, and the movie did not disappoint! <br /> <br /> See! Andy Griffith as the stupidest and most annoying bad guy from Jaye Davidson in "Stargate"! <br /> <br /> See! William Shatner practices various things on the top of his head that only slightly resemble human hair (or something organic). <br /> <br /> Hear! jaws falling mentally in the 70s, which makes "Chicken Soup For The Soul" sounds like BF Skinner <br /> <br /> Feel like! The content that every decade was better than the '70s. <br /> <br /> For those who are still reading ... the story surrounds the mid-middle class - holes that decide to satisfy their --- chief boss (Griffith) by joining him on a cross dessert race involving California and Mexico. They all wear leather jackets and look more like Christopher Street than anything else. On the way, they stop at the Cantina, get drunk, burn their joints (view Robert "Mike Brady" Reed smoke is a combination that you will not forget soon), start a fight, try rape and just act like a bunch of suburban mid-range lifters. Although I have a great copy, which I recorded from television, I WISH that it will be released on video, so that the whole world can enjoy half its baked stupidity.
