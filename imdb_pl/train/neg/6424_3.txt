A writer would be broken, and his agent (Tom Wood and Arye Gross) are forced to live in a self-service center run by an eccentric and intimidating manager (Ron Perlman) whom they believe is a serial killer terrorizing the city, "Costume Killer" (so-called, because after injecting Windex victims, he puts them in stupid costumes). They convince him that his life story will be a great movie and will bring together a group of unmatched would-be filmmakers (John Considine, Joe Pantoliano, Kristy Swanson) and will discover that the art of making movies can be murder. <br /> <br /> There are more in this film, but unfortunately it has remained on the assembly floor and it shows (rumor has it that the studio wanted a "lighter" dark comedy). Our loss (and the actors who do all the good work and deserve better), because it has the makings of a unique black comedy, but only grows to the average charming. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Ron Perlman, it is absolutely worth winning only for his performance. His comedic sense of time is excellent and he has the opportunity to make a really great experience (he was not kidding when he said in a commentary on the Hellboy movie that he needs to intervene when he goes into Jerry Lewis mode). It's just cool to watch this. <br /> <br /> David Dukes also shines in a two-story (but key) role.
