I imagine that when Hitchcock's scholars and experts come together, the conversation is not about the Master's big movies like North By Northwest or Strangers On A Train, but a lesser-known effort like the one in 1931, unclear and seriously flawed who presents a great director in a fledgling form. <br /> <br /> Emily and Fred Hill (Joan Barry and Harry Kendall) are a mid-class London couple who want to stay ahead. He regrets their fate; she accepts it. The change comes in the form of a letter from his uncle saying that he will prepare them so that they can enjoy the life of luxury in the world. They are planning a world cruise. But their problems have just begun. <br /> <br /> Ask Richard Hannay, Roger O. Thornhill or Marion Crane. Well, Marion is indisposed at the moment, but you have an idea. Travel and Hitchcock go hand in hand like moths and candles, preparing for a dangerous trip at best. This may be Hitchcock's earliest trip on the subject, not his most successful and unforgettable one. Hitchcock is trying to mix comedy with another element, in this case with a domestic drama, not with tension, but both are not cohesive, at least not here. <br /> <br /> The hills are a boring, flat couple, without chemistry or personality. When they are in Folies Berg√®re, in the form of a cross-section of film material that looks ten years older than the rest of the film, they are avoided in the costumes of female performers. "The curtain went up too soon!" Emily sucks. "They are not dressed." <br /> <br /> When the Hills drift away from each other in a voyage, it seems to be a mercy that kills more than a tragic thing, even if the people they work with are drops, too. Emily's man, Gordon (Percy Marmont) bears photographs of himself sitting next to empty chairs, which, he suggests, fills Emily. Fred's girlfriend "Princess" (Betty Amann) has Clary Bow's eyes and Wallace Beery's shadow at five. There is also a nasty passenger colleague, a clever spinster whom Hitchcock always presents in a cartoon horn. Subtlety was still ahead of us. <br /> <br /> Everything is recorded violently, with misleading blocking and tense dialogue. Hitchcock is trying some early comedy with Fred and his umbrella that does not go out, and Kendall seems to be trying to laugh while Berry plays tears. When Fred and Emily break away, we see they are being pushed by a pair of rickshaws, one of many awkward attempts at symbolism. <br /> <br /> Emily is the only nebulous sympathetic figure, partly because she really cares about her husband and torments romance with Gordon, but most of all because she belongs to the first of many magnetic blonde Hitchcock, her platinum curls are beating around her face like Botticelli on the open deck of Chinese garbage near the movie. > <br /> Things end in a dangerous situation in which the heroes can cope and possibly fix your relationship. Only that they are not active participants in the resolution and beyond the fate of a friendly cat, nothing about the ending resonates. <br /> <br /> At least you have some nice views of London in the early 1930s and a chance to see Hitchcock while he was still working on food. "Rich And Strange" is Hitchcock, who pays his contributions and learns the profession, one for scientists, but not for ordinary filmmakers.
