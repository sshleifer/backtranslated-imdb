"Sir" John Gielgud had to become old enough to play the mess of a movie like this; <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies, I think, considered "art", but do not be fooled ... it's rubbish. Stick to the "art" that you can admire in the frame, because films marked as such are usually incomprehensible fakes like this one. <br /> <br /> In this masterpiece Giegud recites Shakespeare's "Thunderstorm" while the camera moves far to naked people. one of them is a small child urinating in the pool. Wow, this is a strong thing and a real "art", right? This is just one example. Most of history does not make sense, it is impossible to follow, so it is one that liberal critics are afraid to say they "do not understand", so they give them high marks to save their false ego. Do you want Shakespeare? Read his books.
