One can only assume that Robert Osborne is contractually obliged to express delight to even the least attractive films in the TCM library, because this would explain him praising the "advantages" of this "charming" movie during its introduction, when I saw it on cable television. Seeing that any old movie on IMDb receives the status of "classic" from many greedy amateur reviewers, I thought that there was an urgent need for a more honest review of the film. <br /> <br /> This is not your father "Buy in the corner". For all my doubts with "You Got Got Mail", it still outshines it as a remake in almost every conceivable image. For those who have seen the original, the defects will be all the more obvious. <br /> <br /> From one of the worst sequences of Meet Cute I can recall (sad slapstick attempt "humor"), this movie moves to the wrong foot and never really returns. This "musical" qualifies as one in the rarest sense of the word. A droplet of instant, forgotten music numbers appears, and then Judy sings, "I do not care," waving my arms like in an attack. The Christmas song she's singing in the store is probably one of her better numbers here. Miss Garland was great in many music movies, but here she seems terribly lost. The role was initially to be filled by June Allyson, and Judy is definitely unable to fill the shoes of the old part of Ma≈Çgorzata Sullavan. Van Johnson also performs a rather bland performance as the second type of Jimmy Stewart. Pencils never reach the chemistry of Stewart / Sullavan or even Hanks / Ryan. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that knows (some) notes, but not music. It seems that he does not understand why the original worked, and even felt the need to add another possible interest in love for the Van Johnson character, which unnecessarily complicates matters. The basis of the remake of the original thread of infidelity is a trite plot device with a priceless violin. Watching and feeling it, as if someone from DeLorean and the condenser of the stream was probably embarrassing. It's really an excuse for Keaton's pratfall. Even the great scene of resolution between romantic tracks is wrong. After watching both films, you will understand why they called it "Lubitsch Touch" and NOT "Robert Z. Leonard Touch". <br /> <br /> Avoid this and watch the original movie or one of Judy Garland's films earlier, unless you are an iconoclast who likes to see once a big star falling to the ground.
