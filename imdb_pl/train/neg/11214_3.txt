I also saw this movie at a local show about a year ago. First of all, let me say that it looks great. Cassella is an incredibly talented and fantastic operator. I just want the movie to be as good as it looks. I would not call it a horror film. The introduction of several shots of rotting ghost does not make him a horror film. There's no secret, no tension, you know who did it all the time. <br /> <br /> It's a drama. You know what happens to both sides of the whole movie. Acting was fine, I think, but nothing special. <br /> <br /> And the slogan "Revenge can be deadly" .... really? ... should check how many hundreds of horror / thriller movies have exactly the same password? <br /> <br /> It hurts me to say it, but I know a lot of people who have been working on this movie and I know that they do not want people to smoke their butt, so I give my honest opinion.
