Director tries to be Quentin Tarantino, screenwriters try to be Tennessee Williams, Deborah Kara Unger tries to be Faye Dunaway, dead James Coburn tries to be Orson Wells, Michael Rooker tries to be Gene Hackman, Mary Tyler Moore tries to be Faye Dunaway (older version), Cameron Diaz tries get out of the frame as quickly as possible (successfully), do not ask Joanna Going. Eric Stoltz and James Spader are trying to hide their embarrassment with this nonsense material. Provides endless, senseless dialogues and very few actions. <br /> <br /> Tulsa is a city with beautiful elevator halls, an art deco church by Bruce Goff and a charming, extensive residence of Frank Lloyd Wright. Visit Tulsa, do not watch this movie. It does not do justice to the place.
