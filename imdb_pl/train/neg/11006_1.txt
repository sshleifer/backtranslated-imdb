The film features, among others, "SlapChop" Vince Offer (who also wrote, edited and directed) and Joey Buttafuoco - not exactly names that shout "quality". And with such uplifting skits as "Supermodels taking screenshots" (exactly as it sounds), a guy who robs a sperm bank ("Rhymer"), necrophilia with rotting corpse, fetuses on the black market (with a scraping man should be them without a jar) ), lots of gay jokes, a sketch about a big phallus, which is a superhero and forced abortions. Skits are painfully indecent (such as "Batman and Rhymer"), acting is not good enough to be considered amateur, and the movie is primitive only because of being primitive ... and stupid. I really believe that a group of 8-year-olds could EASILY make a fun movie with the same budget. <br /> <br /> Apparently this movie resulted in a lawsuit "Slap Shot" by Vince against Scientologists. Honestly, I would not know who to root in this case !!! Apparently, he claimed that somehow Scientologists destroyed his reputation and sank the film. Regardless of the fact that the film is repulsive from the beginning to the end and 99% unconscious (for comparison, Ebola is more fun) ... and these are the most beautiful things I can say about the film. <br /> <br /> By the way IS Bobby Lee (from "Mad TV") is wearing a diaper and taking part in a stupid fake porn movie. It's amazing that his career can beat it.
