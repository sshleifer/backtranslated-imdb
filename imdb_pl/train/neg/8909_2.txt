This movie is lame and not funny at all. The plot does not even make sense. Some scientists who work on the periphery of science open the door to another dimension (maybe hell ???), and his daughter gets sucked in by something or something, and one day for no apparent reason returns, and now has a large breast and wears a scant outfit ( I think demons in another dimension did it for her?) The main character is a guy who wants to marry his girlfriend, but he's gay, so of course he is more interested in a new girl and they will come across this witch's book of spells (want to be witches or something? ??), and the evil spell ends with a re-reading of how the demon of evil comes to earth, which apparently can only be stopped by a bikini girl and a rejected man in love. There are no topless scenes, and the guy in it that my boyfriend is talking about is a well-known wrestler, but part of it is totally unnecessary, of course they did something to put it in, because then wrestling fans will really watch this senseless movie. I'm sure the topless girls do not hurt either. Additional features on the DVD were even more confusing than the rest of the movie. I thought it might help to explain what was going on, but in fact it made things all the more confusing. Who are these people and what are they doing? Essentially, this is a go-camping-to-make-out-then-fight-a-monster movie, but there are a few things (such as a different dimension and bookseller) than it is misleading. I did not like this movie, but it was only five bucks, that's a big deal. I do not recommend watching it, although it was too stupid, I can not think of any part of the movie that would be good.
