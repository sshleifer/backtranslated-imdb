Pot - a cauldron if I ever saw it. A suspected thriller borrowed from "A Time to Kill", "Silence of the Lambs", and even an inverted "In the Heat of the Night" with a small reverse murder, and la "Strangers on a Train" thrown into the basket. where all of the above, to a large extent, have been successful. Namely in delivering emotions. The plot seems to be condensed from a larger book, making the plot become obvious and non-invasive, while in the direction of lacking momentum and verve. In order to control any kudos, it was necessary to provide a significant turn along the way and here it also fails. Connery apparently slows down in his old age, barely worried about the American accent, and besides, he seems too old to be Lange's husband and the father of these goshs - his children. He even has a father-in-law who seems younger than him. Laurence Fishburne barely has a chance to live in her role and from the very beginning you are confused whether he is a bad guy or a good guy. Someone once said that flashbacks should not lie - they do it, confused, here. The rest of the game is only average by a reasonable cast in their protected stereotypical roles. The alleged climax also went on to throw myself away, leaving me firmly entrenched in my back, not what the goal should be, the front edge of my seat. An average sloppy movie in Hollywood for sure.
