Madison is not so bad - if you like a simplified, offensive "family friendly" tariff, and more importantly, if you do not know anything about unlimited seaplanes. If, like me, you grew up in this sport and your heroes had names like Musson, Muncey, Cantrell, Slovak, etc., get ready for disappointment. <br /> <br /> Professional film critics have long commented on the formal nature of the film and its tendency to use every trite sports stereotype in the book. I do not have to repeat what they said. I missed the sense of real excitement of unlimited water races in "years of glory" (which many would have claimed were already in 1971). <br /> <br /> Yes, it was great to see the old classic boats roar in the sixth gear, although it was clear that the restored versions (hats for volunteers at Hydroplane and the Racing Boat Museum) were cared for by scenes at reduced speed. But where was the sound? The great thrill of the old hydras was the paralyzing noise of six Allison or Rolls-Merlin aircraft engines, achieved by their designers for RPM, hitting the starting line right in front of you. You did not hear it, YOU DID. True hydro enthusiasts know exactly what I'm talking about. It's not in Madison. Instead, each racing scene is buried under what is supposed to be a "heroic" musical score. <br /> <br /> And then there are rappers of drivers, driving smoothly and comfortably in cockpits, as if resting in the latest luxury limousines, in some cases they sometimes smiled sinisterly when they were wondering how to best defeat the poor hero in his hometown. Or, in one particularly funny shot, taking the time to notice Jake Lloyd giving the "Rocky" salute from the bridge to the pier. In fact, some unlimited drivers wore reflective vests to minimize the beating they took when the boats slammed into hard water at speeds above 150 mph. <br /> <br /> As one reviewer said: "Sport deserves something more. <br /> <br /> Finally, because another user has moved anachronisms, I will add one: Seattle shot shows Kingdome and Safeco Field. None existed in 1971
