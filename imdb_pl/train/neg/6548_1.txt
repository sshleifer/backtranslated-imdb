If you watch it without thinking about what the story is about, you are surprised. Even then, the abstract painted a picture of quite a reasonable plot, but the actual movie is nothing else. <br /> <br /> After the summary, he talks about the possessed mountain climber, which you will see as a prologue before the initials and indexing of the text, which talks about the presence of Chronopolis, an imaginary city that exists in the dreamy manuscripts of the mind (note to yourself? means trouble with flashing lights), where its inhabitants are immortal desires a change in their ubiquity. They see our world and notice all the people of this climber, and the summary explained that they decided to contact him through alchemy, creating an intelligent sphere to meet a man. <br /> <br /> What this translated is a repetitive animation that a five-year-old child can produce. Create shapes, but merit goes into a time-lapse style and throw it through the loop that paralyzes the mind. And repeat until your eyes start to close, then go to the next scene. If anything, Chonopolisians (if this term exists) really love their sticks and bullets, constantly playing in conjuring up this magical ball, and having a fun day playing with it before they release it into the "other" world. It is also not better when a person interacts with the ball in another hypnotically boring and dream-inducing sequence. <br /> <br /> Thank God, of course, that the running time is shorter than the advertised one, which is 57 minutes (or less) against 70 stated. Although it is very outdated, its boring colors, non-existent history, rough soundtrack and repetitive images will win with no fans. Do not waste time.
