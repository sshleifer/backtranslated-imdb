Do not even ask me why I watched it! The only excuse that I can come up with is that I am ill with bronchitis and too weak to change the channel. :) It's too scary for words, a movie that is not a bronchitis. Acting is regrettable, Richard Grieco treats him as a happy serial firing killer with a penchant for knocking down the cops. Nick Mancuso's telephones during the show as a police officer on his trail and Nancy Allen manages to co-create the whole film in a unique way. The script is bleak, filled with stereotypical lines: "Are you ready, Pardner?" He murmurs Richard Grieco to each of his victims. Horrible. Avoid.
