The only reason I do not give this movie less than 3 stars is because it is not on par with a movie like Manos: The Hands of Fate. The biggest crime of this film is the fact that it is drowningly boring and terribly British. The premise of this film sounds potentially promising, the whole concept of teleportation, but the direction in which they went was completely uninteresting. It was more about funding research and bow ties than projecting lasers. The actors were wooden, deprived of emotions and restrained. Like the romance between two scientists, which was not intriguing. I have never been able to tell what was the attraction between them because chemistry did not exist. I really did not understand why the main melt-faced guy decided to kill everyone he met. At least now I know that I should always give someone a fair hearing before I cut off their research grants, otherwise they will go crazy, killing mindlessly with silly gestures.
