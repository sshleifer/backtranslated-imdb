Just good old stupid. <br /> <br /> I mean really stupid, not a good fool like Killer Tomatoes, or Ed Wood movies, it's probably the most stupid movie I've ever seen. To give this film a golden Turkey, insulting turkeys. To call this film stupid is offensive even to stupid people. <br /> <br /> If it's the future of American cinema and art, it's better to really start world war 3 and 4 at the same time and let the cockroaches run the show after. <br /> <br /> Now I have to get drunk to wash this insult to my one brain ... <br /> <br /> This is a really good movie if you're suicidal.
