An unacceptable, cliched thriller has a young couple who is researching the most infamous murders in America, becoming road partners with a wicked young woman and her snarling boyfriend - who is a real psycho. The artistic and alienated tone of the film changes between pseudo irony and stupid extravagance. Perhaps beautifully made, but ultimately fun. Brad Pitt's performance as a low-rent killer is terrible. * with ****
