Mraovich himself should never be able to touch the camera again. If he does, he should be arrested on the spot ... at least for petty theft. Anyone who pays even a ten-cent for renting any of their rubbish should file a claim and receive compensation. It was innocently my first sight of his "work" ... and this will be my last. Ed Wood looks terribly good to me. <br /> <br /> When I return this shit to the video shop, personally I will ask to take it off the shelf. I am an active supporter of the gay cinema, I am upset and angry that this distorted, not very talented male child can hand out and pack something like that, with a nice boy on the cover (Jamie Brett Gabel, who, luckily, not other acting credits in IMDb) and an interesting summary on the reverse used as bait and then sold as a movie rental. Trust me, there is no place on any stand; this is not a movie in any sense of the word. Offensive, irresponsible junk, like this, can only be detrimental to the efforts made to promote and support gay cinema (hell, generally gay rights!) For those who tempt you to rent it because of the cover, you will be disappointed. Gabel is not so flattering to look at the movie as on the cover, and appears once or twice without a shirt - that's all. Instead, the familiar Mroavich asks us his disgusting, apologetic-looking nakedness from the cake. <br /> <br /> This "thing" that he "collected" is a reverse vanity project for Mraovich. Both he and his friend Michael Habousch (who, I understand, seems like dumpy garbage) are horrible at it. Mraovich deliberately presents himself as completely without talent (in all areas), desperately wishing to attract any "lost" attention he can for himself. You must feel sorry for him.
