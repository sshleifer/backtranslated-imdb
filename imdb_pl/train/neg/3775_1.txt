As other viewers mentioned, this film was an interesting experiment in photography. The colors are bold in the comic. I think that the director was delighted with his "artistic vision" over the film's appearance, not the much-needed attention to the content. Despite the excellent cast, the performances are weak and the story almost inconsistent. Madonna was most probably just cast as a trick to get the pre-release press. The good thing is that her appearance brought some credibility to her album "I'm Breathless", which was a stratospheric hit (largely due to the inclusion of "Vogue" for dance), there is no or no the smallest connection with this film). I think that the main part of the money from this movie came from the links with the album "I'm Breathless" by Madonna. <br /> <br /> If you watch it at home, according to the end titles, I think that "I have two hours of life, I would like to go back." Save time - do not worry about it.
