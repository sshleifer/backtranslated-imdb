I never thought of Charley Chase as very funny, although his character on the screen sometimes reminds me of John Cleese, whom I consider VERY funny. (Charley Chase also reminds me of Hen Broon from the Scottish comic "Sunday Post".) In Chase's best films, I tend to admire his professionalism, not laughter. I tell Chase that his best films - such as "Mighty Like a Moose" and "His Wooden Wedding" - have inspired the fandom who is fiercely loyal to him ... but I'm sure even the most ardent fan of Chase will agree that very early and very primitive "Married to Order" is not funny at all. <br /> <br /> Chase - eager, awkward, hopeless, naff - is a young swain hoping for a trial with Rose. Oliver Hardy gives the best performance in this movie as her father, who does not like Chase as a "mollycoddle". Leo White, who did a more significant job as a foil for Chaplin in Essanay, is here on the spot as a rival. <br /> <br /> There is some action with the participation of the Ingersoll watch. I was intrigued that the name of the brand is mentioned in the dialog titles: is this an early example of product placement? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the main disadvantage of "Married with intention" is Rosemary Theby cast as Rose: she is supposed to be a standard version, but Theby - a flat, hawked face - is physically inappropriate for the role. Theby (wife of Harry Myers) had a successful career as a screen actress, but he was never credible. The film historian William K Everson dealt with it very disparagingly in one of his film books. <br /> <br /> I will rate "Married to Order" only 3 out of 10, and I'm a charity ... because I still suspect that Charley Chase has something everyone else gets, but it's gone missing.
