I think I've seen worse movies, so I give it 3, but it's hard to remember what they could be !! Probably Xtro (nasty and boring) or possibly Creep (just boring), but it's hard to think of something worse. It is difficult to know where to start. Let's say it is Under Siege, a poor man with an even poorer man, Jean Claude Van Damme. The only option of redemption was Casper Van Dien - I always wondered what happened to him after Starship Troopers. Yes, he was Johnny Rico, if you really want to know. <br /> <br /> Judging from this side, got stuck in TV hell .... Casper, be more selective .... please !! !!!!!!!!!! Arghhhhh, I just turned around and there is a decent movie called The Criminal Law ... now I'm starting to really be scared for the last 1.5 hours !!!
