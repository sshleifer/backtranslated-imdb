Despite the mysterious positive reviews and high marks, this is a horrible movie. Horrible enough that I feel obliged to warn you how bad it is. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in the last period of Paradise, during the struggle of India for independence. What follows in this funny story fills me with disbelief. What characters do and how they behave does not convince me that the characters exist in those times. <br /> <br /> For example, did a young married Indian maid from a local village have an affair with her married English Champion, knowing full well that the discovery of romance would probably mean complete social ostracization and shame if not for mortality? Unbelievable, but maybe. But does the same young Indian maid, in the conservative Indian society of that era, behave like half-naked Britney Spears in the heat, takes part in hot outdoor sex in the open daylight in an open view where it can be discovered at any moment? It's not just damn unlikely, it's a delayed feature line. <br /> <br /> Such idiots combined with poor acting led me to leave the cinema for an hour to film, so I did not watch the other half of the movie. One can only hope that the ending has more intelligence than what I saw in the first half.
