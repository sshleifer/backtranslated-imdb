Disappointing and annoying. The screenwriter has no real understanding of human nature, but instead he splices cliches in a chaotic way. The character is not studied in depth. They are puppets plunged in a conspiracy that openly confesses, he needed a dramatic element, a mother's affair with his daughter's lover. <br /> <br /> Anne Reid gives a great performance, despite some strange situations and lines, such as the passive permission of her angry daughter to hit her eyes. The screenplay presents Darren (Daniel Craig) as Dr. Jekyll / Mr. Hyde without any clues, why, except that he snorts cocaine in front of the big stage. <br /> <br /> A mature writer could have done more on this topic.
