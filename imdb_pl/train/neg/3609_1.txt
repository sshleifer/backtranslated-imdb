It must be the worst horror I have ever seen. I remember watching it years ago, when it initially appeared on the video and for some strange reason I thought I liked it. So, like an idiot, I missed the purchase of a DVD after the release ... what a tragic mistake! I will not even bother to enter the story because it is so transparent that you can look through it all. I'm a fan of Herschell Gordon Lewis, so I'm used to the bad effects of upset and bad acting, but these people take it to a completely different level. It's almost as if they deliberately tried to make the worst possible human movie ... if it was their goal, they did it. If they were going to make a movie that would scare you or make you believe in any way, shape or form, that it's real, they failed ... UNWANTED! Avoid this movie ... read the storyline and see it!
