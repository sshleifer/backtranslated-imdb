It was disappointing. It started well enough, but when it lasted and lost every opportunity to rise into the air, it fell flat. Maria Schrader's actress is horrible, she never seems to mean what she says, nor does she even know what she says until she says it. She showed no real emotions, neither for her beloved goya nor for her mother's story. When Lena seemed to have little more than an academic interest in the story of Lena. There was never a real relationship between Lena and her mother, except that the mother was having a good time at the wedding, which was not much. The supposed parallel between the "mixed" romance of Hannah and the relationship between mother and father was as banal as it appeared, and so unsuccessful. The wedding was completely unconvincing and stupid. The climax of the protest was uninspiring and no matter what Lena did or did not do to influence the outcome, she would surely show some complexity of feelings at that time, a haunted look, an inexplicable ambivalence. In fact, none of the characters in the movie had any depths or sparks. It was very difficult to worry about any of them, even little Ruth. Everything with Luis was a distraction. (Why she threw him out of the phone in the hotel, there was no context or explanation.) If all references to him were removed, it would not have been noticed. <br /> <br /> A simple story that embarrasses the poor character development (who was her mother, again ??) poor acting and directing that made everyone look like they were acting. You could almost hear "quiet on the set! .... "I started thinking that it was worth 7, but as the movie repeated, it quickly dropped to 4, and then earned 3 after the stupidity of the wedding scene. The film was as cold and sterile as I saw it. Horrible waste of good history.
