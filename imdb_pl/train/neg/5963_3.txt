This film begins with the execution of a witch and his mistress. His head is cut off and buried separately from the body ... sounds like "A thing that will not die", right? Well, it's a bit of a fight, but when the body reconnects with the head, all the interesting and macabre deaths end and the movie moves very slowly. I mean, the movie only has 88 minutes and I still thought "When will it end"? The characters in the film are mostly idiots and deserve to die for being really stupid. The villain is also very angry because he moves slowly and really wonders how he manages to do anything because he is afraid of jewelry. The only thing you can observe when reconnecting your head is because there are so many boobies that you really start to lose points. I still want to see a horror movie, not a movie with a soft porn cortex, and as a horror film it's a way of slowly moving to many slow episodes to be even somewhat pleasant. And do not read in the back of the box, when it came to light, as if the zombies attacked the city, there is ... only a small scene in which three or four zombies attack the house and are so easily repelled are not a factor in the movie at all the scene is rather pointless. So for the most part I say that you should avoid this movie unless you come across it really cheaply.
