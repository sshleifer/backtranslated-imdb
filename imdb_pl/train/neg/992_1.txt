This movie was disgusting. They should be warning that some sadistic nasty writer is trying to get his name before being detained as a hostage for one and a half hours watching garbage. What is rubbish? Abuse of people's time, misuse of energy and waste of any kind of educational system that taught her to read and write. Talia are a sick mad loser. Your psychiatrist must prescribe stronger medications for your problem. <br /> <br /> Acting and plot did not give me a choice but to rewind the middle of the trash. I finished on the stage, which was unbearable. If you want to learn how to shock people, watch Larry Clark's movie. I have lost all respect for the whole cast of this film "no more support from me". How can actors or actresses sit on the set while such exposed human behaviors manifest in the mind of the psyche? I felt sorry for all the actors who took part in this scene. I think the devil now knows who the author of this movie is; congratulations that you caught his attention.
