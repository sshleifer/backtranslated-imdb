My boyfriend and I rented it because we thought it might be a good "Halloween" start. A killer terrorizing young people, a white mask ... you get my drift. We were not right! The word game is not intended. We've discovered not only one of the worst movies, but also an iconic classic! It's filled with holes in the story and it makes no sense. The actress who plays Maddy is pretty, but that's it. I express my appreciation for being filmed in VERY low budget - I always support such films. Only this particular one. <br /> <br /> This movie may be good to see if you're drunk or tall; Otherwise, do not worry. Unless you want to lose film privileges like me!
