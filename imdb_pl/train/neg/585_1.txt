The original film, Man From Snowy River, is one of the best I've seen, almost perfect. The story "Lady and the Tramp" in two senses - a rich girl / poor boy and abilities versus a blood line. Continuation, however, is not only a shameless attempt to use the good name of the original, but also an absurd, overblown Disney mess best summarized as "Rambo Meets the Black Stallion". Without the charm of the Black Stallion. The young hero returns from a three-year absence and suddenly becomes a Superman on a horse; in the original, good movie was real and credible, but unfortunately reduced to the caricature in the sequel. I was not so disappointed with the movie, and sometimes something made me nervous - they lacked banality. Brazen audience manipulation - do the heads of the studio think that all you have to do with the audience who loves horses is to put nice horses in front of them so that they will be happy? Clutter in the movie.
