I often do not go out of my way to write comments, but to do this I just had to warn anyone who might think that watching this, they will see a comedy. It does not come close. Although the premise (change in color / gender / whatever) is bad enough (and has been done, better, many times before), the actual transformation of two black guys into two white girls is one of the least convincing transformations ever made on the screen. It would be bad enough if the script only needed to change white chicks. However, the Wayans brothers must dress up for two specific white women. As you have already guessed, they fail completely. I've seen how drag queens without make-up do more convincing women than the two with the best special effects and make-up people Hollywood can provide. It's terrifying. Add to this a mix of a basketball player built like a building, a terrible dialogue and more holes in the plot than a golf course, and this movie hits a new personal level. And I like bad movies! Avoid like a plague.
