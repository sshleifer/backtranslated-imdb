It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I usually praise every movie for some aspect of its production, but the intensely annoying behavior of more than half of the characters made it difficult for me to appreciate any part of the movie. <br /> <br /> The most common was the statement that the guy who designed the building was guilty of collapsing the avalanche. Er ok. <br /> <br /> Also an attempt to ski and the style of an avalanche slalom will not work. Running 10 feet in some trees will not work. Unfortunately here. As mentioned earlier, the innate stupidity and stupidity of some characters is ridiculous. In an enclosed space, with a limited amount of oxygen, a 4-year-old can say that starting a fire is not a good idea. <br /> <br /> Anyway, about 5 minutes of the movie itself is bought back and gaining recognition. However, if you have a bit of intelligence, also this movie will be difficult to accept. <br /> <br /> It hurts me that so many high-quality stories have not been produced, and yet someone will pay for such things made. <br /> <br /> Oh, did I mention the last five minutes? To give you a catch, you have to watch to see the latest techniques of fighting avalanches. Absolutely priceless.
