Oh dear, honey. I started to watch it, not knowing what to expect. I could not believe what I saw. Sometimes I thought it was a comedy. I loved the way the government plans to capture a terrorist leader to dump one man who is not armed and expect him to catch him and run off with a rocket set. If it were really that simple. In the end, I found a movie worse than "Plan 9 from space".
