A very tacky and boring road movie, with the intention of being fashionable and modern, shown in the style of editing and strange camera angles, causing only drowsiness. <br /> <br /> The cast is wasted, writing is stupid and pretentious. The only thing worth noting is the top notch soundtrack Lalo Schifrin, really cool, as well as the opening sequence, very original and interesting. <br /> <br /> Run, if you can, bad reviews and comments about this movement are completely deserved; it's really clean trash. Of course, it has its own charm, watching a movie that everyone will not drop a glass of beer if it's on fire, but keep it on a stormy day where you have absolutely nothing to do.
