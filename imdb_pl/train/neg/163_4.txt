The previous part of the movie was rather pleasant, but at the end it became banal. Although Turturro is an actor who I generally like, his Luzhin often reminded him of the bad impression of Rain Man, and the portrait of a genius as a semi-autistic man was irritating. Generally, it seems that this film tries hard and ends with pomposity, despite the majority of good performances.
