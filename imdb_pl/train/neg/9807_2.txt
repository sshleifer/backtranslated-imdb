I rarely give less enthusiastic reviews about a TV series or movie I do not like in IMDb, but Mighty Morphin Power Rangers is just so painful, scary. <br /> <br /> I would not mind if it was an animated series - I think it would be better, but as a live show it shows the words "cheap" and "campy". Of which Power Rangers is. Five multi-colored, spandex teenagers fighting against evil, using their martial arts skills. Costumes are scary - they look like something that resembles athletics athletes and gymnasts. Acting is pathetic, and the choreography of the fight is so shockingly bad and so bad to watch, makes Jean-Claude Van Damme look as good as Bruce Lee, which in itself is an understatement. In fact, they look like they were jumping and dancing; as if it were some version of The Nutcracker, or they were doing ballet instead of fighting. In addition, there are a few cartoons in which martial arts often occur, and yet this is done in a fun, but not so tacky way that makes it look stupid. <br /> <br /> Children show or not, it's just bad and on the verge of absurdity. And although this version is embedded in America, you might be forgiven for thinking that while watching some sequences of combat that were not filmed in the US, but rather in Japan; in this way, a somewhat "false" fight and footage were borrowed from the Japanese version - only to combine them with the American version. <br /> <br /> If you like this kind of thing, stick to the Japanese Sentai equivalent.
