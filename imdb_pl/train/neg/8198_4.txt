Alien Hunter: 5 out of 10: Is it me or any movie that starts in Roswell, New Mexico. Take Alien confused with The Thing, confused with Contact, confused with all things On the Beach, The Andromeda Strain, the scene from the class Raiders of the Lost Ark and throwing himself on the small Stargate. <br /> <br /> The derivative does not even begin to describe this movie. Of course, if there is nothing original in the story, they strengthen gore and sex, right? No, it's a wink, you miss a romance and sex is annoying. (James Spader causally mentions that he needs a shower, and the delightful Leslie Stefanson asks you to join him?) AGGH!) <br /> <br /> In fact, if the movie ever needed a shower scene to liven up things this is it. I mean, if you have unbelievably handsome women in white swimsuits wandering the Antarctic research base, why not go for a break. <br /> <br /> With about 30 seconds of real thrill in the whole movie, Alien Hunter is an extraordinary serious and slow trip on a science fiction adventure. He needed a much better twist of the plot to liven up, and by the way the Alien himself is a very clich√©d trick and practically no time to screen for someone who divides the half of the title. <br /> <br /> I also learned while watching what is the motive of children from corn in space. (Note that since Jason on Friday is the 13th fame, Pinhead with Hellraiser and this Leprechaun, everyone traveled to space to kill misplaced teenagers, why not a corn field?) Characters in the cornfield like the stats from Logan Run, and I just waited for stalks revive and attack them. <br /> <br /> It would be exciting and evidently against this alliance of movies. Acting is mostly good because Spader returns to the role of Stargate, while Stefanson and Janine Eser model the latest beach clothes in Antarctica. However, John Lynch read the whole script and acts like a mad angry man long before telling this story. <br /> <br /> Alien Hunter is a disappointing slogan that makes me a pine for the right kids with the Cosmic Movie.
