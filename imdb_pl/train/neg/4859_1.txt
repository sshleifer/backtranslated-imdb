You must admire the director Todd Sheets for his devotion, willingness and enthusiasm when it comes to making movies: in 1985-2000 he made 34 films. Unfortunately, if his Zombie Bloodbath trilogy has something to say, it's probably all nonsense (and a quick look at their IMDb ratings seems to confirm my premonition). <br /> <br /> Part 3 sees a group of disgusting students in the detention center somewhat more abundant in events than usual after being attacked by hordes of living dead who fled the secret military base directly below their school. Working with the frightening scenario of Brian Eklund (which is largely based on the liberal use of the atomic bomb). The director Sheets provides another embarrassing amateurish effort, in which there are unpleasantly stunning performances from his talentless cast, terrible visual effects (some shitty CGI and what looks like front of a huge cardboard shuttle) and its characteristic cheesy gore (a handful of offal drawn from the victims' clothes). <br /> <br /> Finally, after what seems like an eternity, annoying Zombie Armageddon, heroes fighting for life and unconvincing undead animal fondling, end up with the end of the jump in time / paradox, which forces viewers to see again a few tiring minutes from the beginning of the movie. Honestly ... once it was enough, Mr. Sheets? What did we do to deserve to see it again?
