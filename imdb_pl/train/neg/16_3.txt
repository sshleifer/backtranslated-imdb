There are a lot of extremely handsome people in this movie. That's probably the best thing about it. Perhaps even this makes it worth watching. <br /> <br /> "Loaded" tells the story of Tristan Price (Jesse Metcalfe), a young man who will soon mark his presence in the world. He is the son of a well-off family with good reputation and is on his way to law school. But just like many such settings, things are not as perfect as they appear. Expectations in this family far outweigh love. Outside of school, Tristan's father rarely lets him leave the house. It seems that this is the result of some past traumatic event that shook the family, which is partially revealed in flashbacks, but is not explained until the very end. The claustrophobic environment of Tristan causes him to be released in very extreme ways at the first possible opportunity when his friends take him to a strip club to celebrate his graduation. The ceremony soon follows the strippers back to the party at the beach house, and from there Tristan befriends Sebastian Cole (Corey Large), who draws him into the criminal world of drug trafficking. <br /> <br /> Although technically well made, the film suffers from a poor script and story, which is not too addictive. This video also includes some camera tricks that seem annoying and out of place, such as slow motion, fast movement, frozen frames and echoes. These are the types of effects that the director can normally use to show the hero's perspective when using drugs, except in the case of occasional hurdles in some cheap style attempt. <br /> <br /> Despite the cast of relative unknowns, the performances were good all around, especially with regard to the main antagonist (Corey Large). I suspect that in the future we will see at least a few such people in larger and better projects. <br /> <br /> Of course, mentioning the actors, I have to mention their appearance. Ranking based on fever, this movie has a score of 11. Women in this movie are incredibly looking and almost distract you from what you watch in a boring movie. I am sure that the masculine characters are also quite attractive, but you will have to ask someone else to comment on this. <br /> <br /> Generally, I can not recommend this movie, not to buy, rent, or even for free. Unfortunately, it is not worth the effort that you have to take to sit down.
