There is nothing like watching gigantic robots fighting in the desert wasteland, and robots do it. Sure, the acting is bad, the dialogue is sub-par and the characters are one-dimensional, but it has gigantic robots! The special effects themselves are quite good during this period. Certainly they are not as refined as today's standards, but they contain a minimum of computer graphics and instead use miniatures, so they have aged quite well. His shortcomings are easily overlooked, given the short duration of the film, and he has an ironic humor in parts that make him quite pleasant. I recommend this to any fan of giant robots or a poor sci-fi who is looking for a light hour of distraction.
