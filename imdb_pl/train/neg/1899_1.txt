I looked at it because I thought there would be a lot of car chases and cool cars to stare at. I think I was lied to. This movie is very boring. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with Kip Raines (Giovanni Ribisi) in front of the Porsche sales office to see if they have the right car. When they confirm that it is right, Kip pulls a brick from the trunk and throws it at the window, smashing it. He gets a Porsche while his friend gets the keys. They start the car and move into the night. They deliver it to the warehouse only to be followed by the police. So the whole crew dumps all the cars and goes their own way. Then we can see Memphis Raines. He gives a small speech to a group of children on the go-kart track. Then he is confronted with Atlee Jackson (Will Patton). Atlee tells Memphis that his brother Kip is in a deep * pole *. Memphis is known as one of the most famous car thieves in Los Angeles. Memphis goes to the scrap yard and meets Raymond Calitri (Christopher Ecclesten). This guy threatens to kill Kip if Memphis does not deliver 50 cars in 72 hours. <br /> <br /> There are a few problems with this movie: <br /> <br /> 1. History: the first 48 hours in the movie take place when Cage and Duvall are looking for a team and planning everything. The last 12 movie hours are a waste! <br /> <br /> 2. The Cars: You see maybe 10 cars out of 50, how the movie advertises. So where are the other 40 cars? Why do not we see them? <br /> <br /> 3. The Chase: The chase at the end of the movie was a joke. It was not full of tension at all. <br /> <br /> 4. Dog: Somewhere in the movie the dog eats hamburgers and swallows three keys. It is impossible. The keys were open. The keys severely damaged the esophagus of the dog, stomach and large intestines. The guys suggest to give the dogs laxatives that will help him get rid of him. It will not work. The dog will get a lot of diarrhea, but without keys. This was stated in "Jackassie" after Ryan Dunne put the toy into the rectum. Take laxatives, a lot of diarrhea, but you do not have a car. The same thing with the dog. <br /> <br /> 5. Cop during The Chase: When Eleanor collapses for a few minutes, Nicholas Cage desperately tries to start the car. You see a police cruiser behind him who does not look at his car at all. But when Nicholas Cage starts the engine again, the policeman shakes his head to the right, sees the car and immediately starts racing. This is stupid. So when he heard the engine start and saw the car, he knew it was the car he was looking for. How does he know that this is the right car? He sees only the back. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie is boring. There is no action. There are very few cars. The movie is stupid. I have never seen the original, but I plan. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 1 star on 10. Instead, get Fast and Furious.
