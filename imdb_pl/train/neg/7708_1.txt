The only aspect of this film that protects him from being my least favorite piece of celluloid basket is a single poem spoken by an agent trying to infiltrate tomatoes eating a man, dressing himself in a tomato costume: "Can someone give me ketchup?" I urge anyone who has a disorder sleep, to use this film as a sedative; works better than a demarol overdose.
