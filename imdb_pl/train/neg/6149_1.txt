I will spend a few days dedicated to Ron Howard before I quit his job altogether. Unfortunately, when dealing with Lucas at such a young age, Howard is now entangled in many of Lucas's traits. How else will you explain his madness of catastrophes? His only useful movie was of course "Wierzba". Everything else, including that, is too dependent on superficial garbage. <br /> <br /> Some spoilers. <br /> <br /> He can not even have a semi-smart focus like Peter Weir. No, poor Howard got stuck on his knockoff features that he would soon be forgotten. <br /> <br /> Here is an old saying: "love conquers everything, even illness." It's a pity that Howard has already gone through the whole subtext with more skill. Heck, even Disney did it better. Ron even catches the possibilities created by imaginary realities. <br /> <br /> Howard's comment is simply awful. Do not even rent a DVD. <br /> <br /> Final analysis = = kinematic misfire
