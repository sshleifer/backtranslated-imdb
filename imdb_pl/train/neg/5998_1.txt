The basic formula for the original series was; take someone, encourage the audience to like him and then put him in deadly danger. This formula worked for 32 episodes realized in 1964-68. <br /> <br /> Now we are jumping 40 years to 2004. We were introduced to Alan Tracy, a slightly less-diligent kid from school, with his friend Fermat, a young man known to everyone. They are transported by Lady Penelope in her pink Thunderbird Ford to paradise on the island, where Tracy Family live, for school vacations. They are almost immediately taken care of by Kyrano and his daughter Tin-Tin, while adults go to the rescue of John of Thunderbird 5, who was damaged by the staging event. It's all part of The Hood's plan to take over Tracy Island so he can steal Thunderbird's machines ... <br /> <br />? Rob a bank! <br /> <br /> Yes. The plot is just as inert as this! <br /> <br /> Dialogue is trivial, acting more wooden than dolls (fiberglass), effects, everything except special and the result of Hans Zimmer ??? What was there about Barry Gray's brilliant topic shone through Zimmer's weak orchestration. The rest of the score was extremely forgotten. In fact, part of the score was broadcast the following week on the radio and did not recognize it! I did not even bother to witness Busted's average endeavors. <br /> <br /> To be honest, Ron Cook worked quite well as Parker, he and Sophia Myles as Penelope seemed to have been wasted. The appropriate material could be demonstration plugs. I would call the CGI job the leading edge - 5 years ago. <br /> <br /> The dynamics of the main vehicle were simply wrong; The original models of the series at least moved as if they had mass <br /> <br /> Another problem is that the whole production seemed to be one long set of products, from every vehicle built by Ford to the entire contents of Tracy Freezer is produced by Ben & Jerry's. <br /> <br /> My son (9) liked the movie, but this crossword Spy Kids and "Clockstoppers" aimed directly at his age group, did not add anything to the legend Thunderbirds. When Star Trek hit the big screen in 1979, The Motion Picture, a whole new life was breathed into the franchise, which then continued for the next 20 years. In this movie, Frakes missed the golden opportunity to do the same with the Thunderbirds series. <br /> <br /> I predict that this film, like "The Avengers" and "the Saint" before it, will fall into oblivion within 6 months, leaving the original series as "classic".
