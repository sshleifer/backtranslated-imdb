Unfortunately, this was wrong. This movie stinks from beginning to end. It was difficult to watch because I used to watch Clarissa explaining everything at Nickelodeon. I loved her. Then the next thing I found, she spread in Maxim and she was great! I did not really hear about it until I watched the movie by accident. I could not believe she would let me see something like that with her name all over her body. Everything was wrong, but it still seemed that someone somewhere in the team really tried very hard to save the sunken ship. It is a pity ... I hope it will continue to work and I would like to see it with a real cast in a real movie.
