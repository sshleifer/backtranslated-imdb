Do not worry. I thought I would see a film about great tension and action. <br /> <br /> But after an interesting start, it becomes boring and terribly predictable. In the middle of the movie you have a small social drama and all tensions are lost because it slows down speed. At the end it gets better, but not so good. I think the director took the film too seriously. In such a movie, even if you are not interested in the plot, you want some cool action. I almost fell asleep in his middle / main part. Rating 3/10. <br /> <br /> derboiler.
