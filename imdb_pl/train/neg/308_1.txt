They think about "Going Overboard" (aka "Babes Ahoy") and force me to cry. Throwing out the window would be better than watching this movie. It is not even a supposed "so bad a good" movie. I would spend the money to buy copies of this movie and burn them so people will not see it. Oh, pain, pain ...
