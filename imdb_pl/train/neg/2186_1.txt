... but it will make you wonder if we have such a thing! This movie is just as bad as any horrible horror today. The man circles around stupid ladies, trying to decide which to kill, so that he can give his girlfriend a new body. One scene includes a man staggering and gushing all over the set for a full three minutes, covering everything that must be more than ten gallons of "blood". The film also tries to create the impression that what a man does with his girlfriend is bad and contrary to nature, but the film is so badly made that the audience can not deepen the feeling of shock or indignation. This film, uninteresting dark and brazen sinister, can not even get its own title - the initial inscription says "A brain that will not die", but the end credits mention it as "A head that will not die".
