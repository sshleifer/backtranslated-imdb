* I loved * the original Scary Movie. I am a huge fan of parody - this is my favorite form of humor. Sometimes it is considered the most intelligent form of humor. The Wayans boys seemed to understand this concept perfectly in the original film, and then temporarily forgot about it when creating the sequel. I think Wayans is a family of comic geniuses. Unfortunately, even geniuses make mistakes. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a promise. I liked the parody of the "Exorcist", especially the gag "come out, mom". Now it is Wayan quality material. But besides, I can only think of two other moments in which I laughed: 1) when Tori's spelling is seduced in the middle of the night by the ghost, then she becomes clumsy and begins to talk about marriage with him. In the meantime, he says: "It was just a bell !!" It was a bit funny. 2) Parody "Save the Last Dance", in which the character Cindy accidentally beats the girl, practicing new moves. But even short-lived giggles can not compare to the laughter of the first Scary Movie. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is pure trash, filled with cheap gags. Subtle or implied jokes from the first movie are enlarged and exaggerated. For example, in the movie Scary Movie I, several innuend√≥w suggest that the character Ray is gay. It was funny. But in Scary Movie II, the whole scene of strangling the penis with Ray under the bed was stunning and incredibly shy. This is the pattern of the whole movie. Shocking humor * alone * does not take the film too far. This was unfortunately a trend in 2000 and 2001. <br /> <br /> However it hurts to judge Wayans' movie so low, I have to give him 2 out of 10.
