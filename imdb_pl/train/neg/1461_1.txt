I saw this movie and I was shocked! Robert Carlyle is not Hitler, he is a man who unfortunately tries to be Hitler. The film lies, does not reflect the truth. In the scene, Hitler hit the guy with his weapon. Hitler never hit anyone, he would not hit people with his fist but with the fists of soldiers. Understand?? Another thing: it is too obvious that Hitler is so bad, he was more clever than shown in this film. No German would accept him as a leader because they see that he is angry. So the real Hitler did not show people his bad side. <br /> <br /> Did any of you Yankees watch the movie "Der Untergang" or "The Dawnfall"? it's a great movie with amazing actors. And his German movie. I think that this subject of Nazi Germany should not be realized as a film by people who know nothing about Germany. People! Watch "Der Untergang": <br /> <br /> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363163/ <br /> <br /> It's a great movie about a very sad period for people around the world.
