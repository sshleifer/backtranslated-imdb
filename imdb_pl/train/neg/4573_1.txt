I did not know much about this film before I watched it, but I heard it had something to do with quantum physics, so I was interested. I did not know, however, that this is NOT an ACTIVE HISTORY, but a group of New Age bards who adore the sound of their own voice talking about how little they know about basic quantum mechanics. I say that it belongs more to the category Documents than Comedy or Drama. <br /> <br /> Marlee Matlin is in the movie to give this New Age * symposium a * type of plot. Her fragments of the film are terribly clenched and aim to show the speaker's thoughts so that we do not die of boredom. Matlin has a real job as a photographer, unlike the New Age hippie who breaks up on the couch. We listen to nameless people who wonder what "quantum physics" means for them. The only bright spot in this movie was the speaker from India (I assume), but I think he appeared in the bad movie. <br /> <br /> It looks like Barbara Eden has really given up, and she continues about how quantum science has something to do with her crazy New Age beliefs. It looks like the Quark of DS9 ran out of cash, and he also briefly presents himself in the movie. There are many weird CGIs that we should be impressed with; cells in the body are shown as jello dancing molds, because the filmmakers apparently have seen Flubber too many times. <br /> <br /> People in the movie say that the people of Arawak in San Salvador thought the Columbus ship was invisible because the natives had never seen the clipper ships before, as if people had any way of knowing it today. Of course, they skip all this information and say, "Columbus' ships were invisible to Indians in America." The film makes many such arrogant jumps. Thomas Young conducted an experiment with a double fissure around 1805 and discovered that light could look like a particle for some time and a wave for some time. Of course, you will never * see * this watching this stupid movie, because the only reference to this is that "atoms can be particles and waves." And that must mean that people can walk through the walls, walk on the water and never grow old if they just want the stars! Then I'm sure Marlee Matlin may stop being deaf if she only * believes * strongly enough. I'm sarcastic, but this movie is full of false hope and beliefs that people who support them do not really hold. <br /> <br /> These are New Age kookers who have grasped the quantum theory, confirming everything they believe in meditation, zero point energy, crystal healing, etc. If these snake oil suppliers really believed in the shit they were selling, could not they just * wish their payments instead of appearing in this witty movie? We can listen to another nameless man, without any references, which we know, talk on the couch in front of the fireplace (or TV screen) about how he creates his own life. Every time he was on the screen, I wanted someone to drop in and throw the cake in his face. These people treat themselves too seriously. Some other balding guy in a suit says that nobody * really * touches anything, because the magnetic level is at the quantum level. If only someone would come on the screen and punch him in the stomach, shouting: "I'm not touching you! The moral relativist in the film claims that there really is no such thing as good or bad. So, apparently, is it OK that Hitler killed millions of Jews to death? Another person says that "there is no such thing as love." It's just a chemical substance and we do not really love people, we're addicted to the chemical hurry we have when we're around them. I suspect this guy is doing this movie as a social network because he's been addicted to heroin for so many years. <br /> <br /> We are witnessing a truly pathetic sequence in which two young adults are walking around after the wedding party, seeing everything like RoboCop. They assess whether women are cows, dogs or foxes, and sexual position appears on the scree. Marlee Matlin gets drunk at the wedding, which she has to photograph, and the next day she decides to love and take a bath, because she is a beautiful and unique snowflake. <br /> <br /> I liked it when the movie said that people often find evidence of their imagination. Perhaps in this review I see only what I want to see, but I really wanted to see how these people get patties to the face, and this never happened. <br /> <br /> If you have never heard of any of the ideas presented earlier in the movie, you may find them interesting, but there are better sources for all ideas. If you want to watch a good movie about Heisenberg's uncertainty, go to "A man who was not there." If you want to read a good book about Quantum Field Theory, read Hyperspace by Michio Kaku. If you want to see a movie that talks about different philosophies with imaginative visualizations, see Waking Life (though it may seem boring, important to yourself and sometimes pretentious). All in all you should read Quantum psychology or the rise of Prometheus Robert Anton Wilson instead of wasting time on this film. <br /> <br /> I usually have very hard to give the movie a score of 1 to 10, but this one was very easy for me: 1/10 stars. <br /> <br /> The title of the movie is real. People in this movie do not know # $ *! No question, the worst movie I've ever seen.
