Even if they were not aware that the Sellers were in poor health during the filming and died before the film was released, THE FIENDISH PLOT OF DR. FU MANCHU would be a painful watching. It is said to be the lampoon of the famous Oriental villain of Sax Rohmer, but he lacks concentration. The potential for a satirical commentary on the anti-Oriental undertones of Rohmer's concept is ignored. Indeed, the film uses racist insults. There are almost no jokes or gags, mainly actors acting idiotically and spouting with grim lines. Particularly worrying is that Sid Caesar is forced to throw curses and racist insults for laughter. Most other actors are also embarrassed. <br /> <br /> And then there is Peter Sellers. He plays the double role of the sinister Fu Manchu, who is trying to come up with a formula to regain his youth and his steadfast British enemy Nayland Smith. Sellers are not one hundred percent bad; he conveys a weird warmth to Smith when he discusses his fetish attachment to the mower and strangely moves like Manchu when he expresses his love of entertainment in an English music room. But most of the time he plays with two roles with a weary grim face, which is even more sabotaging all comic possibilities. Procedures of sellers in which revives their weakening strength by means of electric shocks are particularly excruciating; it seems too convincing that it is funny. <br /> <br /> A few real witty poems, as the sapstick bit Burt Kwouk (Cato movies in PINK PANTHER) as one of the Manchu minions, and funny music numbers Helen Mirren can not save this mess. If someone wants to understand why Peter Sellers is considered a comedy genius, he will not learn anything from THE FIENDISH PLOT OF DR. FU MANCHU.
