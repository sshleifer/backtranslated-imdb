This film was to present a bachelor "a ladie man" who was ready and willing to settle once and for all. However, I did not care for his mission to calm down because I did not care about his character. I do not understand what all these beautiful women have seen in him. He had absolutely no class or charisma. He should have at least been convinced, which made the ladies weaker on their knees than playing the saxophone, but to no avail. The fact that he is a musician does not make him sexy. Not to mention that the things he did to get the attention of the married woman he had come to love in five minutes of getting to know her were absolutely outrageous and ridiculous. Does this man have a shame, what ever? If he cleaned up, he stopped doing and he was saying stupid things, he would be more attractive as a character, but unfortunately his character was bland and boring. <br /> <br /> Gina Gershon's figure was unnecessarily British. She might as well be a tense foreigner with her regular voice, rather than a weak British accent that would sometimes disappear in the movie. <br /> <br /> Only two characters that I cared about were fish and frogs. Now the two of them had chemistry! Nominations for the Academy for both? STAT! Strange holes, lack of character development, terrible acting, unnecessary drama, stereotypical moments ... What a mess in the film.
