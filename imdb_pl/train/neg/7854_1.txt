Wow, this is the worst movie ever. the only reason I signed up for IMDb was that I could complain about this movie. I never left the theater or stopped the DVD, but I almost stopped it (and I should). but I watched it all the way to the end, to let it fall again with an absolutely horrible ending. wow, if all that craven can produce, its time is long. I never saw the first one and never see it again. it's a horrible action with terrible intrigue. hey, looks like someone shines on us, let's go check it out. and the sad part is that when this movie appeared on DVD, it was completely tested in the hit list forever. so I feel bad for all people who saw this trash.
