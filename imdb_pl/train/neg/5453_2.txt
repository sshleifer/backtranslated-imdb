OK I caught this movie in the middle, but ... oh. Dear.god.it.sounds.like.they're.all.reading.from.scripts. <br /> <br /> Especially the guy who is now in the Teacher and The Book Group, although at least he proved he can act if he wants! (The part in which someone has a heart attack, distinguishes itself as a bastion of bad making of movies both in terms of acting, scripts and overall credibility). It looks like it is making money on Human Traffic, but it's not the best movie ever, it's at least original and had actors whose delivery did not resemble the serious but hopeless GCSE students who were trying to get a positive rating. Not as much as Human Traffic as a little car accident!
