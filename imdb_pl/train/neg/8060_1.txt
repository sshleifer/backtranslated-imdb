What a bad movie, bad movie! I tried to watch without a quick transmission ... It did not work. After about 30 minutes I stopped the movie, went online to see how many minutes this disaster was. (Only 84 minutes, Whew!) It was a tangled, boring movie. I do not think anyone could be knocked down by hitting a fluorescent lamp much less gutted by one !! The funny thing is that I watched the movie version of "The Killer Cut". The box boldly says "More blood!" "More sex!" "More Terror than cinema premiere!" Yikes! If this movie was horrible with all of these claims, I wonder how bad the "UN Killer" was? If you want to see a great movie about the world of the living and the world of the dead, watch the series "Night of the Living Dead" !!
