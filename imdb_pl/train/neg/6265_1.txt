I happen to be the director's nephew. It took me many years to get a copy of this movie and I can confirm that it is one of the worst films of all time. My uncle does not even have his copy (I asked). I am waiting to bring him a copy. <br /> <br /> Currently the average rating of the film is 1.9 / 10. As far as I know, it should be somewhere in the mid-30s in IMDb "bottom 100", but with only 206 votes has not yet been placed. <br /> <br /> It's sad that Film does not even respect 100 titles. <br /> <br /> In any case, I am giving copies of the film to family members this year for Christmas presents. The best / worst gift in history?
