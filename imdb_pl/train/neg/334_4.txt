A bad movie for sure. It is such an absurd fantasy with many weak special effects, many hurried scenes (for example at the airport) and a real uncomfortable time. (Charles Dance) is terrible like a bad man and is much better in (Last Action Hero). (Eddie Murphy) makes a not too comical joke and I heard that this sunken has already succeeded, a great success? !! I will never understand why or how? In one of the television interviews I heard myself (Eddie Murphy), when he was nominated for an Oscar 2007, he regretted it in a comic way !! <br /> <br /> One of the comments said (Hey ... It's the 80's!). Well, my friend is not here. It's a movie stupidity that for many years created a lot of RAZZIE films, whether in the eighties or fifties! <br /> <br /> There are 2 reasons why I wrote about this movie. First of all, I will never forget fascinating long dances (Charlotte Lewis), especially when she was in bed, before bad guys attacked her home, wearing only a blue shirt and OH BOY, the camera corrected her naked legs, it should be. But how strange! Because I watched her in the following movies and was not so beautiful? !! In any case, the second reason is that I recently found the title of this movie on my list of the worst 100 films ever! <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Bad movie, Greeeeeat legs.
