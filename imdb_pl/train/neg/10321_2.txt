This series is awful, jokes are horrible and getting worse. I am one of those people who have never been huge fans of Corner Gas, but at least I liked it at the beginning, until I got into the routine in the second season, all the jokes were played and the characters had nothing for them. Well, at least Corner Gas was good at the beginning, Little Mosque on the Prairie is a typical horrible comedy CBC, which had nothing to do with episode 1. Who are the people who watch the program anyway, I'm honest, are they old people and maybe just people who actually live on the prairies? Maybe jokes are for them and they work there? I do not know a single person who likes this program and I can not stand it, the jokes are completely predictable and the characters are even less developed than in the Corner Gas. Let us hope that this will not last long, because all the success of this program seems to me based solely on the assumption that this program is Muslim, which is different and could / should have led to a great show.
