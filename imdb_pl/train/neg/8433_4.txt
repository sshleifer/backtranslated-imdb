Pere is an idiot, but he is aware and acts as a consequence. His life is completely boring and he does not know how to change it. When his last friend dies, Nicco. He feels completely empty and decides to go out to get drunk. When he returns home, he crashes with the girl who places the ads. Although he ignores him, he falls in love and starts obsessing with her. The beginning of the movie is a bit slow and for most people it can be boring. However, when the action starts, it's a bit better (maybe not much!). Perhaps the best part is 5 minutes of sex (almost 30 different scenes about it) that can be seen in the middle of the movie, it's not good for eroticism, but too funny and This is probably the best movie, neither the actors nor the direction are good, and the results are a boring movie that can be fun for some people (not for me). The whole movie is based on absurd situations (idiot, as the movie says ) I like Ventura Pons, but I have to admit that it's not one of his best films (maybe his worst!), he knows to do it better.
