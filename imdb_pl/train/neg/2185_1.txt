... or the audience. A short summary .... <br /> <br /> So you have that doctor who experimented with stolen parts of the body for some vague reason. He wants to perfect transplants, but he feels he has to do it in his basement. WTF ??? And then suddenly, unfortunately and comfortably, his fiancé cuts his head in a road accident for which he is responsible. Tired of sadness, he keeps his head in a pan of lasagne (or maybe a strudel?) And pumps her with a full "adreno-serum" (sic) to keep her alive. And then he wakes up, speaking his head (so to speak), though her neck was clearly cut off from the vocal cords, and she has no lungs, so she could not speak, even if she had them. It seems that an ungrateful bakaom underestimates everything her fiancée did. Just like a woman ..... <br /> <br /> Then his grief changes into horn, when he sees the possibility of transplanting the head of the beloved one to the first poor bimbo that he can pick up from the street. Meanwhile, the assistant doctor, type of a penny shop Igor, falls into a philosophical dispute with his head, which established a telekinetic friendship with the "monster in the closet" (every crazy scientist has one). Eventually, the writer is aware that he can not ask his misogyny and fear of intimacy problems in the audience forever, so he kills everyone and then he goes to the bank to pay off the check before the financial movie helpers have a chance to stop . <br /> <br /> Did I mention that I think it's a bad movie? <br /> <br /> Someone should say Turner Classic Movies to stop showing this edited version without top. The view of the assistant with a torn hand, piroupling the house without leaving a large amount of blood in it is simply too valuable.
