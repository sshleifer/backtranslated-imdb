I do not like to use the word "horrible" to describe any work of cinema, for which time, effort, talent and money are sacrificed, but the attempt to adapt Charlotte BrontÃ«'s "Jane Eyre" by Zefferelli is a total waste of time. <br /> <br /> The scenario lacks finesse and strength, everything explained to the viewer in an uncertain way, leaving little imagination. The main actors are pitifully mistaken, clearly employed to name the stars, and the musical result is capricious and boring. Charlotte Gainsbourg and William Hurt do not have any chemistry with them. It is like a wet pasta, even worse than Joan Fontaine, who at least was capable of a little emotional involvement in what should be a story of frustrated passion. And William Hurt plays the whole movie in one tone, and the tone is flat and devoid of energy. Of course, the inert and gruesome scenario does not help any of those great actors in their efforts to bring this breeze to life. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Fairfax Joan Plowright is like Disney's creation, which constantly appears to sweeten the scenes in which it would be best missed. <br /> <br /> There are no secrets related to the history of the first wife of Rochester. The role of the would-be second wife, played like Elbie MacPhearson by Barbie Doll, is an empty cipher. <br /> <br /> Fiona Shaw, a very great actress, is completely wasted as aunt Jane, Mrs. Reed. It would be better manned like Mrs. Fairfax. Only Amanda Root, as a beloved Jane's teacher, evokes genuine sympathy or credibility. <br /> <br /> I saw this version of "Jane Eyre" after watching Robert Young for British television, produced in 1997, with the participation of Ciaran Hinds, Samantha Morgan and Gemmy Jones. There's no comparison. The vital, romantic and deeply moving version of Young is like an exploding new compared to the wet rustling of Zefferelli. <br /> <br /> I will now be interested in the 1970 version with Timothy Dalton, about which I read very well the things on this page. I am amazed at how many people like Zefferelli's Yorkshire picture book. <br /> <br /> All I can say about this film is the fact that the house is beautiful and the pictures are colorful, except that it is a complete misfire.
