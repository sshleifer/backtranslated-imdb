I am really surprised by the number of good ratings that this anti-Christian pseudo document received. Now I respect the opinion and faith of the guy, I myself do not believe in the Christian doctrine taught in this state. However, anti-Christian propaganda is a slightly different issue. <br /> <br /> This film has important points, but they are very few and represented in a very biased context. I do not recommend not to see it. In fact, I think that everyone should see it and decide for themselves whether he believes it or not. And this is actually more of an opportunity than the one that the director gives to Christian teachings. Instead of an inquisitive approach to this topic, it looks like a personal vendetta for a Christian school that influenced his childhood. For the most part, it also misrepresents Christians as unbelievably na√Øve or fundamentalists, without moderation between them. <br /> <br /> The director uses film scenes from the Passion of Christ without permission, interviews the director of his former school and presents almost exclusively anti-Christian historians and writers. In fact, I thought the director was the most mundane man and I think his attitude was fully justified. I doubt also that any of the believing Christians interviewed consulted the following words and even before the interview said about the purpose of the investigation. <br /> <br /> Therefore, there are certainly new and interesting facts to find here and some very original thoughts about Christianity. But the way in which this whole thought is produced is often offensive, highly unprofessional and terribly biased.
