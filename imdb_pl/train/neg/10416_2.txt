Before watching this movie, I would say that I love everything Kathy Bates did. Now all-minus-one. James Woods is pathetic ... not his character, his acting. Someone should tell him that "poor" is not a synonym of dirty, unconscious, or clich√©s. The same applies to Randy Quaid's stereotypes. The only buy-back option is Henry Thomas, who is not a strong enough actor to carry this soaked mess. If you like the country, you'll like the scenery. It's the best I can give. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of both independent and strange films, but it's just terrible.
