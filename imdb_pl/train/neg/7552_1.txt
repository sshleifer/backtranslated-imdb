Wicker Man Doss The Impossible! He replaced Cat Woman as the worst newest film in my mind with a steel trap. YES it really is so bad. It's so bad that when I sat down to write this review, I thought, "If I had the choice of either watching this movie again or having red hot needles stuck in my eyes," I could go to the red hot needles. > <br /> Neil LaBute created a rare movie in which Joel Schumacher could sit comfortably and say with a sense of comfort and guilt "Yes, it's a bad direction". <br /> <br /> I think it's the first tip for me to be the slogan: "Some sacrifices have to be made". Of course, a bold line may sound bold to intrigue you, but sacrifice will be visible on the side of the audience. Trust me, people responsible for this movie should be charged with a crime of hatred ... or at least a scam for trying to pass it on as something like entertainment. Seriously! The film is about an island where people are simply farmed, and I'd rather stay on Gilligans Island with only photos of Condoleezza Rice, and then I found myself there. <br /> <br /> The most fun part of this movie was a guy who ripped the loudest fart I'd ever heard in the cinema. It's not a joke or fiction. I've never been in a "thriller" and heard so much laughter throughout the movie. I can not tell you with certainty if the laughter was intended in any effort to lighten the tension of the film, or simply to really think that the crud would actually fly. Honestly, I found myself on the way to a power outage or perhaps a fight to break out in the cinema, to make everything more interesting, which is quite sad, because Deez, Powder and I hit two beers before the film just for a moment of anesthesia ( will soon become a law in front of all Nic Cage movies, write to your congressman today, do not hesitate). At one point I thought maybe this movie is really a parody, and Anna Ferris will appear? Oh, how I want. <br /> <br /> Nothing Cage throws away so much of the ham on the frame that I'm thinking of doing a cholesterol test today. To think that I ever thought Sean Penn was d * ck for slamming actress Nico, oh, he's still smaller than one of them? Yes Sean Penn's d * ck was reduced due to this movie. Do us a favor. Nothing, play your strengths and stick to pathetic losers and drunkards. You can not play superman, you can not play strong, hunky roles, go straight to prison, do not pass, do not collect $ 200. His best moments in this movie are the moment when he finally gets upset and actually hits a powerful woman to steal her bear's suit (like a fart, not a joke or a functional moment during this review) and then he starts to run like Aman masturbating a bear, but with half the merriment of a bear who knocks his trash. Fortunately, it meets with the end shortly after it turns out to be a sacrifice for the crowd on the new hybrid tour Burning Man and Lilith Fair. Yes!!!! I just broke the end for you and if you knew better, you would build me statues and sing the songs of my legend. I sat through this festival, so you do not have to. <br /> <br /> About halfway through this little woes, I thought Jack Bauer would wrap the case in 20 minutes in real time. .OK 35 minutes if Kim is attacked by a mountain lion. Even Steve Martin, Inspector Clouseau, could figure it out in less than an hour? And you're not Inspector Clouseau. <br /> <br /> If for any reason you are taken prisoner and you have the choice to see this movie or take a bullet, take a bullet. <br /> <br /> Somewhere Uwe Boll laughs at us all.
