Watching this after receiving the DVD for Christmas 2005, I came here to do it - but after reading other comments I have no heart. Apparently this is a movie that works very well for children of a certain age. Let me not be a complete Grinch; it can still work for some children - if they are not too saturated with media and have not become too visually sophisticated, eg from watching all LOTR and Harry Potter. But if you're an adult, stay away; you will not like it. <br /> <br /> Good songs: Barbara Kellerman as a Witch, especially in the early stages with Edmund, creates the right mix of charismatic evil and restrained madness. (On The Stone Table goes up a little.) Michael Aldridge in the less-than-profound role of Professor and Jeffrey S. Perry as Mr. Tumnus also has a kind of refined, clever game that we expect from the best BBC dramas. And the Aslan costume works very well, very well considering. They have eyes that are all right. <br /> <br /> Bad bits: almost everything else, but in particular two areas. First of all, casting. England is filled with good actors and contains tens of thousands of attractive British school children. How could they end up with these four stiffeners? They move like wooden soldiers and talk about it. Peter has no gravity or charisma (and is clearly shorter than his allegedly younger siblings); Edmund is simply cranky; and Lucy ... Sophie Wilcox as Lucy is so dramatically, apparently, drastically wrong in this part that I can not imagine how she got a job. <br /> <br /> Two, costumes for animals. Again, it seems that they have worked for some children. If the kids are still at a level where Big Bird and Elmo are exciting, believable characters, they can be delighted with the movie. But for the viewer with sophistication, say, a 12-year-old who saw the Prisoner of Azkaban? When Mister Beaver comes out from behind this tree, there will be shouts of cruel, mocking laughter. Costumes just do not work - I could not, and I think that no adult or modern teenager can, suspending disbelief, looking at Mr. Beaver. Draw animated later (gryfy, etc.). Works better, it's easier to do. <br /> <br /> So: ten stars for a very young and delicate soul; everyone else reads or re-reads the book and watches a much better movie that develops in the imagination.
