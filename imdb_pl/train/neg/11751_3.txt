WHEN HEY ARNOLD! first appeared in the air in 1996, I watched it. It was one of my favorite programs. Then the same episodes began to be shown over and over again, so I was tired of waiting for new episodes and will stop watching them. I was a little surprised when I heard about HEY ARNOLD! THE MOVIE, because it seems that it is not as popular as other Nickelodeon cartoons, such as SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS. Nevertheless, having nothing better to do, I went to watch the movie anyway. Entering the theater, I did not expect much. I expected it to be a stupid movie version of a cartoon for children, like the movie RECESS. I think I got what I expected. It was a stupid movie for kids and nothing more. There were some good parts here and there, but most of the film was smelly. Just for children.
