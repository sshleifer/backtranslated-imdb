In the seventies there were many really great horror movies - but this movie is certainly not one of them! It is a pity that The Child is no better because it works with a decent idea that takes several sometimes horrible horror topics. We have the idea of ​​a vengeful child who worked so well in classic movies like The Bad Seed, and then we have the central zombie theme, which of course was the backbone of many successful horror movies. The plot is basically this: a young girl blames the load of people for her mother's death, so she goes to the cemetery and raises the dead to take revenge (like you). All this is good and good, except for the fact that it is boring! Nothing happens for most of the movie and although it brings some pleasure at the end; the finale is not enough to justify sitting for the rest. The film was of course filmed with the budget, because the locations look cheap, and all actors are rubbish. I can not really say much about the whole movie because there is not much in it. A child is a grim horror of the seventies and I certainly do not recommend it.
