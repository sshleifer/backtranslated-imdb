* Some spoilers * <br /> <br /> This movie is sometimes written under the title "eternal life". This is often a reference to the final scene, but it describes more accurately how dead and buried this once-respected series after this messy and illogical sending. <br /> <br /> He is "hey kids, let's show show air" about this telemovie, which can be endearing in places. Some fans will feel like insiders because they like to choose different episodic performances. Co-writer, co-producer, Tom Fontana, and his buddies are packing up to meet friends and favorites from other programs, as well as real Baltimore personalities. <br /> <br /> It's all but the returns of virtually all members of the TV series were different from each other, your old favorites, as well as later non-favorites. <br /> <br /> He was always aware of dragging the rope's executive producer, Barry Levinson, Fontana, James Yoshimura and the rest of the creative team against budget-conscious NBC directors who just wanted another moronic procedural police like "Nash Bridges" who regularly she beat "killings" in the rankings. The pressure told during the show bounced off the riveting realism, which went beyond its form, and the dingy sensation that demeaned him. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for this film, Fontana, co-authors Yoshimura and Eric Overmeyer and director Jean de Segonzac just threw the towel. They took the most absurd story from this series, supplemented it with an unlikely and artistically unprofitable new plot and put a burden on moving the whole mess to one of the weaker cast members. <br /> <br /> Shortly, it's been some time since the last episode of the series. Yaphet Kotto as Lieutenant Al Giardello, the former heart of the Homicide Division in Baltimore, is now a candidate for mayor similar to Kurt Schmoke, and Schmoke appears on stage. But this promising beginning immediately and unbelievably continues tragically. <br /> <br /> In the spotlight, Giancarlo Esposito becomes the son of Giardello Mike. A handsome man who did a good job elsewhere, Esposito was one of the pretty faces being late to supposedly revive the television series. But the question for the viewers always was: is Mike uncomfortable as a son of Gee, or is Esposito not feeling well in this role? <br /> <br /> To be honest, Esposito has no chance to play the main story without a break. This is because the writers choose this moment to revive another plot that spat out the loyal intelligence of the series. <br /> <br /> Visible video snuff was promoted and then seemed to actually take place on the Internet. After several red herrings, the detectives arrested the suspect. But the harassed and overworked deputy prosecutor of state Zaljko Iwanek forgot to submit applications on time, and the suspect was released, but was later murdered. <br /> <br /> Let's summarize: he forgot to make a paperwork because there was not the most sensational case in his career, because the mayor, Attorney General, Governor, the entire Maryland legislature, US Attorney General, NBC, TV court, BBC, AP, Reuters, People, The Sun, Washington Post, New York Times, LA Times, Time Magazine, The Times of London, The Economist, Johannesburg Mail and Guardian, L'Osservatore Romano, Le Figaro, Paris Match, L'Equipe and Computer World they did not call every 10 minutes for the status of the case. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, an old gang of detectives and associates returns to Baltimore to help. There are a lot of talents on the screen. Unfortunately, with a limited number of dialogues, some of them are only on the display. <br /> <br /> Two of the strongest actors, Clark Johnson and Melissa Leo, are not allowed, while time lost to Jon Seda and Michael Michelle could be better spent on commercials. The authors seem to satire this by presenting Jason Priestley as the latest great detective. On the other hand, they give an easy path, easy passage Michelle Forbes is a very influential scene. <br /> <br /> There is some other cunning casting, with the actual lieutenant Gary D'Addario, the center of the book that gave the show off, playing another detective. Visitors come from other concerts, such as Whitney Allen, who is doing a deadly and unconscious "Miss Sally" from a children's program beloved by prisoners on "Oz" Fontana. Dina Napoli from WBAL TV appears alone. <br /> <br /> Even during entertainment, these guests may be distracted. Ed Begley Jr. actually develops this story in his short performance, playing dr. Victor Ehrlich of "St. Elsewhere "Fontany. He still has a lively character and suits the hospital. Then remember whether St. Elegy did not turn out to be the fantasy of an autistic boy? <br /> <br /> The most useful cameo reflects corporate synergy. This movie was made when Court TV bought the rights to the series again. This network contributed to the creation of legal aid Helen Lucaitis, who interviewed the homicide team, and later appeared in "Oz". The television correspondent does an efficient job summarizing the messages, i.e. the feature points for those who are late. <br /> <br /> Although Lucaitis is so skinny that he disappears when he turns sideways, he's also doing great with the physical comedy of Esposito. He shows more juice in his scenes with Lucaitis than with any of his regular friends. Perhaps the two of you should do spin-offs. <br /> <br /> When the film is over, the casting cream rises to the top. Although they are burdened with a lost script, Andre Braugher and Kyle Secor defeat him. Their performances remind viewers what caused murder, significant episodes, the best show in the air and one of the best television productions in history. <br /> <br /> It's great to watch the best professionals; It is a pity that this movie does not give them a better chance. Tough fans may want to see this movie anyway, but you can live without it.
