Well, the writing was very sloppy, the direction was sloppy and the editing was worse (at least I hope it was an edition). the acting was not bad, but it was not that good either. almost none of the characters was nice. at least 45 minutes of this movie was a waste of time, and the second hour was not used near its full potential. it was a great idea, but another wasted good idea is passing by. it could have ended up in three different places, but it simply continued in the predictable end of Hollywood. and what was not predictable was done so badly that it did not matter. the end was not worth watching. Sandra Bullock was out of her element and she should stay away from this type of movie. the film also looked hasty. the movie just was not worth watching, and if I paid for it, I would be very crazy. maybe I was more disappointed because I was expecting a really good movie and I had a bad movie. the film was not terribly bad at all, but I do not recommend it. I gave him 2 out of 10 b / c I really liked the idea and I liked one character (Justin, I think, super intelligent). he also had very cheap ways to detect holes in the story. it was like trying to cover the volcano with cheap masking tape, it was not pretty. in any case, if you see him, wait for the theater or video for $ 1.50, unless you like almost every movie you see, so you'll love this one.
