This comes back to matin√©e times, when children from nowhere else have spent time dating on the balcony after they dumped their younger siblings. It did not matter what was on the screen - small children were sitting by them, and large children ignored it. Adults, of course, would never see it. <br /> <br /> But they put it on the video, as did most of the squeaking, low-budget "B" horrors of the golden age. television. The intrinsic and unintended humor of this film is derived from an outdated ideology ("bad girls" gathered to replace the crushed body of poor John - they were there "), an abused conspiracy (crazy scientist trying to play God), a violent but conscientious monster (whose presence in a previously normal, seemingly rural laboratory of a scientist is never fully explained), and the action that polarizes in wood or on top. <br /> <br /> It's a great party movie, assuming that guests will enjoy adding dialogues and comments to nasty movie exploits. In fact, if you or your guests prefer more passive entertainment, this video is also available on video to treat the "Mystery Science Theater 3000" in which the host and puppets of the cult TV series create the necessary extras.
