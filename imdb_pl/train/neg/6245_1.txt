The only thing that "An Inconvenient Truth" proves is that Al Gore is still an idiot. These "undisputed" experts are unquestionable, because the reaction to their other hypotheses is generally below real science. They are mainly people of false science. The biggest source of greenhouse gases - CO2 - are people, we exhale them and if you are not willing to sacrifice your brothers to save the world, there is nothing to do. We've heard the world end up as a result of man for over 50 years. Fools publish a time line on their day of doom, and when time goes by, nothing happened. "An Inconvenient Truth" is just another vehicle through which an insincere faction of American society can sell its pile. <br /> <br /> And as for Al leaving the tobacco business because of his sister's death because of cancer, it is a load too. Al could not drive his farm better than he could manage the country. He lost money for the operation because he did not care about the farm, when he could earn more dollars in speeches. The only global warming that is not questioned is the hot air produced by this gas cushion!
