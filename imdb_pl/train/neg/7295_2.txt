First of all, the reason I give this film 2 stars instead of 1 is that at least Peter Falk presented his fantastic performance as Lieutenant Columbo. Only he can get 10 stars for trying to save this totally worthless attempt to make a movie. <br /> <br /> At first I was all excited to read the commentary of one poster that Andrew Stevens in this movie gave "his career performance." For me Stevens's horrible performance completely ruined the movie, so I was ready to shed all kinds of insults on the person who then wrote the above-mentioned comment, then I thought to myself what else Stevens had done, so I checked and you know this person was absolutely right. In 17 years since making this movie, Columbo, apparently, each of the 33 projects Stevens has been in since then he was a complete shit, so it's unlikely that anyone would even see the rest of his career. <br /> <br /> If you like Columbo, see every other of the 69 titles before watching this. Do yourself a favor and save the worst at the end.
