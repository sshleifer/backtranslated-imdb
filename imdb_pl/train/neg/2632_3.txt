I am saddened by the rating of the film with many of my favorite actors, locations and genres, i.e. Douglas, Sutherland, Washington, D.C. and political thriller, but "The Sentinel" really low. It looks like they had a great idea, they signed the right cast and they made some great photos in the city, and then they took leave, letting the rest of the crew improvise the rest. I regret that I can not blame him for another unremarkable performance of Basinger (not only I think she is one of the worst actors in Hollywood, but still a decade later I cook that she was the only and definitely the only evil actor in the film to win an Oscar for the film " Confidential LA. ") But it was not the only problem. Sutherland, whom I love as Jack Bauer in "24", once again playing "Jack". I miss his old days "A Time to Kill" or "A Few Good Men". Douglas must have stopped working and he called that number. Plot: Someone, a Secret Service freak, wants the president to die, and Douglas is (accidentally) framed. Will anyone believe him? Actually, there's no spoiler here: as soon as they hit the plow in half, it'll end before you know it. And why did anyone (s) want the president to die? Is this to be revealed in the sequel? Too many holes in the story, too many doors open and never closed and too predictable is "Sentry". If you only see one movie a year, you may not know who the mole is, but anyone who is familiar with this type of movie or even saw one episode of "Law and Order" will know in the first few frames. Was it terrible? Not really, the pictures were good, and although Sutherland played Jack again, he still has it.
