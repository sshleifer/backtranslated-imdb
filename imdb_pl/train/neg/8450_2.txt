What's happening with ITV Drama. First of all, "Losing Gemma" is simply the worst television drama I've seen for years, and now "Perfect Parents" is a complete mess from start to finish. Whoever is responsible for commissioning this drivel should receive P45 in a special edition. <br /> <br /> In most dramas / thrillers, the requirement to suspend certain levels of faith is necessary for the plot to develop, but "Perfect Parents" took it to a new level, I suspended so many beliefs at the end of this nonsense that I felt that I was fed with a truck of "magic mushrooms", it was as if the screenwriters decided to try "Drama by numbers" covering several serious problems - Religion, Education, Greed, Fear, Murder, Paedophillia The only problem was how the Great Eric Morecambe said once, playing the piano: "I play all the right notes, just not necessarily in the right order". For your next Script boys, I suggest you try to read a few other scripting books than "Scripting for mannequins". <br /> <br /> Because of the ridiculous script and the total lack of tension in the management, the acting was low, not the actors' fault because the cast was at the highest level. But I suggest that all the actors involved in this apologetic piece of drama instruct their agents the next time the postman attempts to deliver the script from the ITV drama section, make sure the letterbox is firmly closed!
