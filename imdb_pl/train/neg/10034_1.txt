If there is one film that is the worst this year - it's TASHAN. The first promo made it clear that the movie would be a boring movie in the Dhoom 2 style, and I knew it would be a bad movie first, regardless of whether it was because this is a Yashraj movie Or maybe watching a bad promo But this movie gave me a shock, it was even the worst than Dhoom 2 and what I expected. The first introduction of Saif, which is boring Then Saif-Kareena will meet, Kareena is so fake, then Anil Kapoor, God, what's he doing in such a strange movie? What role is this? What he is doing? His first scene is fine, but then his act becomes repetitive and overloaded. Then came Akshay, who provided nice scenes, but then the movie became more boring and with all obsolete things. Children's romance, overdose of children's action scenes in the style of Rajnikant and all the boring scenes. The ending is another joke <br /> <br /> Vijay Krishna Acharya would have more movies to make if this movie worked, i.e. a yashraj strategy, nothing more than money. Vijay is the next addition to their list crap filmmakers Music (Vishal Shekhar) is just <br /> <br /> Performances Akshay Kumar appear in the film as a breath of fresh air, in fact delivers captivating moments Saif Ali Khan is annoying, Kareena is equally Angry Anil Kapoor outrageously and spoils the show even more The rest is fine
