I expected it would be much better. I love Tim Burton's work so I was very excited to see these short films online. Well, they were not what I expected. <br /> <br /> I really do not know what it is that I do not like. I think they are just boring. The sound bothers me and most of the characters, though I loved Roy the Toxic Boy and Stainboy. <br /> <br /> The Match Girl episode probably eavesdropped me the most, although it was quite funny. <br /> I do not like the way some characters die. Like Match Girl, she set up a gas station on fire, or how a girl who is staring died. Roy's death was surprisingly fun. Death by car freshener. Very original ;-) To mnie tak rozszyszy≈Ço ... <br /> <br /> There are things that are not suitable for children. Only some language and gore. That's all I have to say! 3/10
