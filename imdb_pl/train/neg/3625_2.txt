This is a film that belongs to the 1950s. It is very surprising that the American Film Institute chose this one for the best 100 American films of all time. I've seen practically all the movies on this list, and this one is by far the most disappointing of these. Music numbers (and many, many of them) are VERY long and boring, and have no relation to history. The end of the movie has a frighteningly long ballet sequence, which naturally has no real connection with the story of the film. Admittedly, it is very well made, the music is fine, and the dance performed with the highest professional standard - but there is no real reason why the sequence is included in the movie. The main character of the film is very childish and unlike himself and behaves in an unkind way. His mental age is around 14. If you want to see a good musical done in the "golden age" of musicals, go and see "Singing in the Rain".
