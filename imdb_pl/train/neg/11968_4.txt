It's a typical Bruce Willis, action movie. Watch it with popcorn and pals. Rent to save money. <br /> <br /> Nothing of it is realistic. Battles are not realistic. The soldiers are not realistic. Victims are not realistic. And why did Tom Skerritta talk with Willis from DECK OF THE CARRIER? What is going on? Can not he do this from inside the ship? <br /> <br /> Of course, Bruce W. gets a machete wound. There are several medium explosions. <br /> <br /> If this movie accurately depicts Navy SEALS, do not get stuck in Africa expecting to save you! <br /> <br /> A noble attack on the countryside worried me the most. "Places in the first row for ethnic cleansing" ... as Bruce looks at the slaughter taking place in the city. So what does he do? She crawls into the city on her stomach. Yes. How many were killed when they were shooting? Well ... I think the body counted. <br /> <br /> And if this one African guy was so important, why did not he get into the helicopter with the elderly and children? Can you say "Duh?" <br /> <br /> Finally the movie was very dark. Not only in the story, but so much going on at night, it was difficult to understand what was going on. <br /> <br /> Rent it.
