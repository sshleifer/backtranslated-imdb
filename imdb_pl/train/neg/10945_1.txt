Words can not simply describe how awful this movie is. I watched it on video last night and I just could not believe what I saw. Essentially, the "Snakeeater" is about former military (Lorenzo Lamas) and his search for a kidnapped sister who was imprisoned by Rednecks in the Deliverance style. Acting, writing, directing, photography and editing are deplorable along with the song "Soldier", which must be one of the worst thematic songs of all time! . "Horshack" (Ron Pallio) from "Welcome Back Carter" is in a movie playing a funny evil guy. Otherwise, avoid this mess with ALL COSTS.
