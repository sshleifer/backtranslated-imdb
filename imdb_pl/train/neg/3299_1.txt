It must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Actually, I was expecting a bad movie, but I was surprised by surprise. The plot is traditional, all stereotypes are contained in it. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is so badly written that you really laugh when the actors from the other hemisphere try to make it sound true. The picture is not very good, the music is so mallatable that it really annoyed me, the actors do not even try, although the script makes it almost impossible to expect more from people who have been working for 30 years and so-called action the scenes actually lack the "action" itself. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why these bad movies are still coming, who's funding this shit? Where is the show? And why are actors on the ground accepting this mission impossible to script? <br /> <br /> There are a million Hollywood movies in this genre, even without the aspiration to reach theaters, but even these things Straight to the video actually can look professional in comparison. <br /> <br /> I can not say anything positive about it, except for the title, which explains all this, I feel robbed of the 2 hours of my life.
