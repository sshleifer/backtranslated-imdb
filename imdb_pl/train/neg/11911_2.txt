I sat glued to the screen, riveted, yawning but carefully watching. I was waiting for the next terrible special effect, or another ridiculously trivial object to show all the strength, so I could learn how not to make a movie. <br /> <br /> It seems that when they set out to make a movie, the crew watched every other action / science-fiction / shoot-em-up / good vs evil, and saw cool things and said: " Hey, we can do it. " For example, the only car parked one mile from the road, which seems to be a one-way street with a shoulder not intended for parking, is the only car on which the hero, an attractive brunette born of bile, is thrown. The car blows to pieces even before it lands on it. The special effects were of course my biggest beef with this movie. But what really puts it in my bad books is the unbelievableness and lack of justification for so many elements! For example, an antagonist, a flying demon who can hurt you in a weird way, happens on a lone truck carrying an important VIP. Nameless guards with guns get out of the truck, you know they're dead. Then the VIP guy says: "Under no circumstances do you leave this truck, do you understand me?" He gets the beast who killed his 3 buddies, he gets cheated in an almost comical way. Then, for no apparent reason, opposing logic, conventions and common sense, the stupid VIP ass LETS FROM A TRUCK !!! Much of what happened during the film made no sense. Transparent acting distanced me from the movie, and also bad work with the camera and things that make you go: "Wow, this is incredibly tacky." Shiri Appleby saved the movie before 1 because it gave the film the only element that always makes viewers enjoy this sex appeal.
