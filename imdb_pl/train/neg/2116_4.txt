Horrifying pictures from the 30's and 40's ruined my hell. God knows that I do not mind low-budget movies, but those produced at that time have such a gloomy, dirty look - and in the end they are not very good. "The Corpse Vanishes" is a bit more entertaining than the bottom in the barrel, such as "The Invisible Ghost" and "The Ape Man", but it is not classic. Bela Lugosi, the former splendor of "Dracula", plays another crazy doctor; unbearable Elizabeth Russell plays his wife. They sleep in coffins because, as Lugosi explains to the dubious young reporter (Luana Walters), the coffin is much more comfortable than a bed. Ho hum. Angelo Rossitto and Minerva Urecal are also on hand, which may appeal to hardcore film fans from the 30's and 40's.
