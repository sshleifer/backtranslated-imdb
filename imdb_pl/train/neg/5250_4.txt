I absolutely love the book written by Robin Klein, so I was very excited when I heard that the film based on the book was being created. <br /> <br /> But I was very disappointed with the movie when I saw it because it did not capture what I loved in the book - absolutely ridiculously funny Eric and the interesting way in which he looks at the world. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of the film, I realized that things are not as much as I imagined in the book. I just went for a ride. I do not think it was that bad. Miss Belmont was completely different from what I had imagined! I did not think he would smoke and drink - Jean Kittson, who plays it, is hilarious! <br /> <br /> I thought myself that the film and its actors / actresses did a good job, but unfortunately, I'm such a fan of the book (one of my favorite books) that I could not resist disappointment = P
