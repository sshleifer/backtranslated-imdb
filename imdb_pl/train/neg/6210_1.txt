This is the worst movie I've seen since I Know Who Killed Me with Lindsey Lohan. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie I can assure you that only frustration and disappointment await you if you decide to see it. Hey, Tim Burton, I used to be your big fan ... did you even show this movie? I mean seriously, what about% #k? <br /> <br /> Without anything, here's a vague short story ... Nine wakes up, does things, his actions and decisions are irrelevant. ... and the movie ends. Oh, wait ... here comes spoiler ... <br /> <br /> Warning about the dog! Alert spoiler! At the end of the movie ... it's raining. I think that part of my soul died while watching this movie.
