He made the unfortunate mistake of seeing this film at the Edinburgh film festival. It was well shot from the very beginning, but this is the last positive comment I have about the film. Acting was awful, I wonder if gogo girls were actually employed? But it was a really funny story, in fact it was funny, and not boring is the only reason I gave it 3/10. <br /> <br /> ** Spoilers below **. <br /> <br /> I just want to mention a few scenes that really made the audience laugh. wrong. A real eye opener. <br /> <br /> Entering the bus scene: the girl gets on the bus. But according to music, the world ends. <br /> <br /> Turning under the clothes line: Wow, it really shows the writer's plot skills. The room is filled with raw meat and the sale of skills. Why not make her do all three "sins" at once? At least then the film could have been a bit shorter. <br /> <br /> Running up the shopping mall stairs: look how one of the girls escapes down the stairs chased by the Dau eating body, do not wait. . * she * walks * quickly, trying not to break her nails. <br /> <br /> Blood run: it's definitely my favorite scene and the end of the movie. Half-marathon in red paint, ended up by going up the stairs and across the bridge, only to send it most unrealistically through the passing car. Not only that, but this suicide is taken by the most obsessive girl in the movie, now it's a character for you. <br /> <br /> I would like to think that this movie was made for 16 years old and their colleagues. Unfortunately, after the meeting with the director it is not like that. <br /> <br /> But if you're in a sarcastic mood and you feel like laughing with a few friends ... then do not even think about it.
