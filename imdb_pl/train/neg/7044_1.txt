How sad it is that the beautiful and talented Tina Louise has reduced herself to making this awful excuse for the film. Tina still looked attractive and attractive, but for some reason she seems really terrified. I understand her fear; Fearing that this 3-percent smelly will somehow be made available to the public. I am also a fan of sympathetic Adam West. Again, just like in the case of Tina, Adam looks good and in great shape for a man of his age. Its operation here is satisfactory, but the scenario is so bad that it's difficult to even listen to the dialog box. <br /> <br /> The film is a rip off of the classic motto of Brando, The Wild Ones; Out-law motorcycle riders are out of control in a small town. Motorcyclists look like a dapper group and I certainly would not like them to date my sister. Acting is stiff and wooden, and the plot is as old as sand. Hellriders is a hell to watch!
