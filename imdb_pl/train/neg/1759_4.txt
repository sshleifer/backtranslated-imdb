This effort was like a brilliant TV movie ... I do not recall ever being released in cinemas ... If so, he must have died quickly. Watching the DVD in the comfort of our bedroom, it was obvious that this movie was designed for little more ... Ed Lauter, art critic with greed? What a funny turn it was ... I did not see Ed from The Longest Yard ... Everyone else was largely in the hands of Baldwin's numbers, except Pompeo ... She had zero charisma and seemed to languish through most of the picture. .. Daughter of Pompeo had one dimension ... she played every scene like a beloved little puppy ... the slowest delivery of a 3-year-old line that I saw yet ... <br /> <br /> The scenes of the chase gave my wife and me a headache ... too much fast cuts and hitting at an angle ... If you're going to shoot a chase scene in Barcelona, ​​you can want some WIDE shots to take advantage of the beauty of your background, right? The whole story was quite unbelievable and tough, but well, we liked it better than "Life in the water ..."
