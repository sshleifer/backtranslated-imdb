I want to start by saying that I'm a Republican, although I do not agree with many of the things that Bush does at the office. And I love Colbert's daily program and report. They must be two of my favorite programs on television. I like Bush jokes about Conan, Letterman, Leno, because I admit that W is not the smartest guy who ever walked the earth (I believe he is not the dumbest either). not so much fun. I can see where it can be fun and that's it (hey he makes fun of our authority, which is hilarious.). Central comedy is simply a difficult game. I mean one special episode, but the whole series is simply stupid. It seems that CC just says the same jokes from the bushes we have heard many times. I really can not see this concert after the first season.
