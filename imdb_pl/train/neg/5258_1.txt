I rented this movie and it turned out that it sucks. It's about this family with a stepmother and the same stupid fights in the family, and then a nice son comes with his stupid camera and likes taking a picture of a damaged building and strange things and a strange movie, and then asks his father to take him on a side trip and after I just agree etc. etc. ..... They go to this city that no one knows is there (blah blah) And the most annoying thing is that the movie ends, and you do not understand what THIS movie is !!!! I've seen a lot of mysterious films, but it was the worst, To be honest, there's no description at all and I'd like to see it.
