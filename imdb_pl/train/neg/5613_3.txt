In my opinion, this film does not develop a new thought. It seems to me that I took my spear on my spear without looking aside! the director seems to have a plan! Duh! I believe that its rational lack of space has no place for an alternative view. I am usually on the side of the opponent, but the film lacks credibility because it is based on fantastic observations of a man / woman on the street. really now, if you want to create a credible alternative to a religion for over 2,000 years, you have to make more effort by allowing the other side to express their beliefs. I'm not sure, but at the beginning of the film it seemed to me that this is an attack on Cristian's faith, because I do not believe, but let me convince others and I would not like to mock them, but I try to understand and tolerate them.
