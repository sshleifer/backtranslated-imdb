I can only say that I'm happy that I was knitting socks while watching the movie, or I would be very angry that I wasted 2 hours of my life. Acting was terrible, the conspiracy was even worse. There were several scenes that were meant to be serious that my husband and I were laughing loudly. I highly recommend this film to people who like to make their own version of MST3K.
