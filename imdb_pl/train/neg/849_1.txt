One star. That document deserves this. I did not feel disappointed in watching the movie, let alone a documentary film, for some time. <br /> <br /> I am a BIG fan of the "Walking With ..." series, including Nigel Marvin spin-offs, for all their joyful but informative information. And although the topic of prehistoric man has never interested me almost as much as other prehistoric creatures, this topic is still interesting and unique to explore. After seeing all the other documents in this series, I thought that I must also see this document, especially after seeing relatively good reviews in other places. <br /> <br /> Well, for those of you who have made a good review of this doctor ... what did you think ?! lol. <br /> <br /> Although the information they managed to get was interesting, the presentation failed in any other way possible. He had a terrible flow, he was incredibly distracted in what he tried to say (with coded information and sometimes out of place), horrible effects (including a few CGI moments, especially makeup effects) and MTV-style effects of the camera. <br /> <br /> Speaking about the effects of makeup, one of the reviewers mentioned here how funny the scene was, when the cavemen came across this giant monkey and how it looks very much like the horror of the 70s. Well, there are a lot of times when people introducing apes looked ridiculous and acted ridiculously. The terrible positions and compositions of the cameras do not help. <br /> <br /> The worst part of everything is not shown in an interesting and dynamic way, nor does it look remotely real. It does not even look like it has been taken seriously. There was also no emotional impact that the predecessors of the series had. Do you remember the episode of "Walking with the dinosaurs" of the ornithochirus's fate (sp?)? This episode still makes me lie on the edge of tears every time I watch him. This is the kind of engagement with the topic that is the most lacking here. When you are more involved in this topic and this is his personal story, even one that is just speculation, you care more about the facts that surround her. <br /> <br /> The only favors in this production are quite a good narrative (at least in the BBC version that I saw) and music. Otherwise, do not bother hiring this unless you want to laugh (which I often did, but usually rolled eyes after it). This does not belong to the shelf with other documents "Sightseeing ...". <br /> <br /> And does it make sense to find out that this document was NOT produced or directly involved in the same people who were different in the series? Hmmm ...
