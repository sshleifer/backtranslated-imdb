It seems strange that someone read the script and thought: "It's fun! I mean, it's so funny that you have to do it! "Who was that person? Is he or she really responsible for this? Are they guilty for my time, more than a director / writer? <br /> <br /> This movie stinks in every possible way. There is not one piece of good dialogue, not one sympathetic character. A historia ... <br /> <br /> I prefer the second worst film ever, Hulk Hogan "No Hold's Barred" to a large extent. In comparison, it seems almost Shakespearen. <br /> <br /> The ending is filled out with a few minutes of outtakes, and it's still less than 80 minutes. The results include cast members laughing at the "funny" mistakes they made, and things that went wrong on the set of this "comedy". I am glad that someone is laughing at some relationship with this "movie". <br /> <br /> Nothing in this movie is funny. Nothing. It just lasts and continues. It's really so lame. I love movies that are so bad that they are good. It's so bad that ... something, but I do not know what, and I hope we will never find out. <br /> <br /> Amanda Peet is not completely honest about this would-be film. But that does not really mean much. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
