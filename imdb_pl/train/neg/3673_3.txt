William Hurt, a diving scientist ??? US agents are investigating abroad? An ill contaminated man kicking his ass after falling 20 feet on his back and running away? Sniper is missing and he did not kill Hurt (only hurt him), but the second shot "kill" does not work? Waste of time. To compare it to the fall, as other reviewers have done, is ridiculous. Oh, and at the end of the movie, they decide to put on gloves, except for the "bad" agent, and Hurt decides to kill him, giving him a "virus handshake". What? BTW ... when IMDb required 10 lines of text? I just babbled here. Does this limit the content of the review if you need to have x lines?
