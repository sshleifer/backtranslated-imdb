The first 5 minutes gave me hope. Then Meyers proved he had only one good idea for the rest of the movie. The absolute lowest common denominator of humor. Painful watching. A complete task. Written undoubtedly in less than a week, just like the first. Give Meyers a catch and lock him in the cell with Adam Sandler and Will Farrell. And do not let him go until he develops a decent script for something, anything. He has it in himself. These Austin Powers things are simply embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Let Goldmember sink without a trace.
