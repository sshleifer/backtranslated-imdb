This time, the hero from the first movie became a human and this time uses a combination of fists and feet against super universal soldiers and a computer that went wrong and is prepared to take over the world. I'm sure it was a Double Team who convinced everyone that Jean-Claude Van Damme is no longer credible in providing watchful action movies. However, it has permanently destroyed his credibility. While Universal Soldier: The Return is not as boring as Double Team or The Quest, it is still really awful, without the style and style of the original and without pairing the stars. This continuation is created for children who like professional stocks. Looking back, even the action sequences were not so exciting and that's why this movie is a worthless dud. In other words, another cluster in the Van Damme assembly line. <br /> <br /> * out of 4 (Bad)
