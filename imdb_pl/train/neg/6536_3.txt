This DVD seems to be directed at someone who simply turns it on and plays it in an infinite loop in the background. It is organized as a series of music videos for the Grand Canyon with different pieces of Tangerine Dream music. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, TD music is boring, and the DVD transfer looks rather fuzzy and weak. Too expensive DVD for what it is.
