I tried to like this slass, as if I was trying to enjoy all the slass movies. I mean mindless killing mixed up with little nudity and some tension, how can you go wrong. But I think that Unhinged is an example that this formula fails. The main problem is the terrible game of three major girls who landed at home. It looked as if it were under the influence of sedatives and it stopped me from constantly interested in their fate. The film is moving in the direction of tension and horror, but the direction of numbers weakens it and leaves the film quite boring. It is a pity, because if the film was better made, it would be an ace. The story and characters are quite scary, and there are also dark and bizarrely funny moments of interaction between mother, girls and daughter in an old house. There is some good nudity and occasional splashes of blood, but it is not enough to give the film the kick he needed. The finale is quite twisted and frightening, and it does not give the film a great rapture, but unfortunately it is too late. So, in my opinion, you should avoid unless you really love little-known movies. There is a lot of potential, but the film does not provide enough to be worthwhile.
