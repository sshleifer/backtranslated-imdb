First of all: I'm not a conservative. And although I would never call myself a liberal or a democrat, from the first day I was against the war in Iraq. I think it's fair to say that John Cusack and I would probably see eye-to-eye with politics, in fact I'm sure we would be buddies if we ever talked about how great Adam BBC's adepts are. My point is this: do not discredit this opinion, thinking that I'm not part of the Cusack choir, says War, Inc. There is no doubt that WI policy is adapted to my demographic, but the problem is that tailoring is below the standard, and the film in which Cusack wrote, produced and played fits worse than a cheap suit. <br /> <br /> As they say, "the road to hell is paved with good intentions". Cusack, his co-authors, director Joshua Seftel, and even involved actors, no doubt intend to make an anti-war film just as biting and funny as M * A * S * H ​​by Robert Altman, unfortunately for the viewer, it ended up being as unhappy and unintelligent as the Canadian bacon of Michael Moore. <br /> <br /> The current state of American politics, foreign policy and "war effort" is already absurd and as a result tragic, pathetic and, unfortunately, comical - just watch The Daily Show and see for yourself. The bottom line is that you can not write materials as fun as what the Bush administration provides us with every day, so why try to compete? <br /> <br /> The main problem with WI is that I feel so hastily put together. To achieve this, Cusack basically consumed Grosse Pointe Blank (one of his best films), changed the setting and filled up the shopping list of ideas removed from the collected works of Naomi Klein. Most of these ideas are destroyed in the first twenty minutes of the movie, and what makes them so unbearable is not a joke or a gag, or consciously obvious references to Halliburton, neo-conservatives, and the occupation of Iraq by the United States. , wise or funny. Writers are so blinded by their "own dogma" that they felt that simply by referring to these issues, the film would be funny and subversive. The problem is ... it is not. These ideas are already yesterday's news and unless you lived under the stone or you are not so blinded by ignorance, denial and pure stupidity (read: right-wing Christian), these jokes are offensive. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it would work if it was more nuanced, subversive, offensive and deepened by detailed research / insights about the occupation. In fact, jokes and visual gags are superficial and are so bad, with so little finesse, subtlety or satirical wickedness that they did little more than a groan. Homer Simpson once said: "It's funny, because it's true," and The Daily Show proves this every night; War, Inc. it proves, however, that just because it is true, it is not funny. The most important thing: hyperbole is not required when it comes to ridiculing US / neoconservative policy ... it's a big enough joke. <br /> <br /> http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/
