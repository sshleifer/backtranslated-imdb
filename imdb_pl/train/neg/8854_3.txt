We had a weekend off STARZ and turned on the station to see what was going on. It was the movie Howling II: Acting was terrible, but the sweets were great. Sybil Danning and Marsha Brown as the aforementioned eye candy. I used to laugh a lot with a few scenes I saw. <br /> <br /> My friends are wondering why I never want to go to horror movies, If they saw this movie, they would know why. I would be fired for being so laughed. <br /> <br /> Some interesting facts: Reb Brown, who played Ben White, played the American captain in the television movie Marsha Brown was the inspiration for the song Mick Jaggers "Brown Sugar" Mick definitely has a great taste in women.
