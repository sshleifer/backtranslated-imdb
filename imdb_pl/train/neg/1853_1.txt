This film, no correction, this THING, this terrible abomination from the burning pits of hell should be killed before it even leaves the writer's head. I could not come up with enough adjectives to describe this movie. But let's try after all. Terrible, bad, bland, tasteless, nonsense, vomiting, intestinal, provocatively bad, hideous, nasty, disgusting, there are no words in English! The "story" concerns a serial killer who becomes a man of snow. Do not ask how, no matter. Snowman killer flees from killing people. How can you ask if a snowman can kill someone? Without taste, they make you want to remove your eyes, even if you do not have to put up with this styrofoam snowman anymore. In such a way that you want to fill your ears with hot wax, so you do not have to put up with his snow punches. Do not watch this movie! Destroy it in front of you! Because of your soul, do not watch it!
