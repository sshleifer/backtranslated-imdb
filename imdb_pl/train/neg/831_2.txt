Live! Yes, but no copies. <br /> <br /> A real story: some time ago, a Dutch TV station announced that it would broadcast a new reality show. Competition rather. The main participant in this concert will be a woman who dies for something terrible, and she will give the kidneys to one happy person with progressive kidney failure. Seriously. <br /> <br /> The country and international media were in this story like flies on turds, saying that it was terrifying, immoral, what-is-world-comes and the like. In a sense, I had to agree. <br /> <br /> As the months went by, the tension grew to such an extent that the government was mainly concerned with whether they should let this performance go ahead or not, instead of guiding the country. <br /> <br /> The concert took place in the air until the last moment they pushed forward. And until the last moment the country was armed, the prime minister delivered speeches, every newspaper wrote about it, everyone in the country held their breath. And the network was pressed. Towards a new border on television. And they definitely managed to do it. They pushed the envelope. <br /> <br /> The show was aired and we all watched terminally ill women who chose the right candidate to take her kidneys so that he or she would live while she died soon after. <br /> <br /> And then, in the last moments of the show it turned out that it was a partial fraud. The woman was not sick, but all the candidates were. There was no kidney auction. The entire program, which along with publicity and advertising and all discussions, built for many months in a fantastic climax, was an advertising effort focusing on the problem of serious shortages of organ donors. The man who founded this particular network died of kidney disease. <br /> <br /> Now THIS is TV. Leaving everyone far behind with astonishment. <br /> <br /> Do not give me a poorly directed, poorly directed movie about a woman trying to get a show of Russian roulette on American television. <br /> <br /> Like if. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * As if I had to believe that they will get it via the FCC. As if I was going to believe that this would happen through the US Supreme Court based on free speech. As if I had to believe in the ridiculous ending in which this woman stopped him and has problems with conscience, because some guy shot himself in the air. <br /> <br /> Everything has been done before. Instead, watch Running Man with Arnold. At least he had a semi-good ending. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * It's a scary piece of the movie, along with an absurd ending. So, is it finally shot, is it to make us film in public, we will feel better after leaving the theater because there is some justice? Do not take my word for it, but I would say: leave it alone and instead look at the test pattern, you will get a better quality.
