This bomb is just one "explosion" after another, without humor and only absurd situations. Really, pyrotechnics are extreme. Reality is not one of its strengths. I give him 1 in 10. I would do it zero, but this option was not allowed. I'm sorry, but Lithgow and Sutherland deserve better roles. But sometimes we all have to have money. And I still shudder at Tim Burton's farce about Mars. Nicholson was brave enough to admit he was a turkey. But if it was a turkey, this movie is not even a stomach. I would like to say "give me back my money". You can bet I would do it if I could. But this is a problem with premium services, a variety of subscriptions.
