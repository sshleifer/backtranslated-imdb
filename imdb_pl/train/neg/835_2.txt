After seeing both the Lion King and the Lion King II, I was both happy. I thought it was worth seeing Lion King 1.5. What a disappointment! Disney must be more and more desperate when it comes to income. <br /> <br /> Especially now that they lost their deal with pixar. <br /> <br /> Basically, they just downloaded some material that remained in the floor editor (or trash bin) and stuck together to get <br /> <br /> fast zloty. Unlike LK I and II, both had strong feature lines. <br /> <br /> This movie has no history at all. While characters and animations are always pleasant to watch, there simply is not enough material for the movie. Some bits could be good fillers of the second disk in the original offers. <br /> <br /> Disney - Shame yourself that you threw away this rubbish to make money fast! <br /> <br /> Next time, take some time and effort and try to get our permanent work done.
