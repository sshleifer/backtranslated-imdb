Maybe I'm not a big admirer of the original "Creepshow", but its tacky sequel makes the anthology look like perfection! And to think that I'm going into it, expecting to like it one more thing. Five years after his predecessor George Romero returns to the EC Comic track, and on this trip he played the screenplay of three stories by Steve King. However, the direction is passed to Michael Gornick. Most of the film undermines this aspect with uneven Gornicka brushes. But most of the blame must have been attributed to the horrifyingly static and unbearable Romero script (especially in those dialogues flowing through the first and last history). Moralistic messages (mainly from a sour group of characters) simply took on black humor. Oh, it was painful and the same can be said about the living rotten music accompanying the painting. Loosely combining three stories (Old Chief Woodenhead, The Raft and The Hitchhiker) together is a slightly interesting and effective story covering the entire story made in the form of nostalgic animation (the 80s). I liked the segment, and Creep's wise figure was a glowing light. <br /> <br /> # The first story of "Old Chief Woodenhead" sees two senior owners (George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamour) from the general store dying of the local community, Dead River. Robbed and eventually killed by a couple of punks dying to live in Hollywood. In front of the shop stands a wooden figure of an Indian chief who lives to avenge his death. <br /> <br /> - Listen to George Kennedy's waffle .. And cornered for 10 minutes about how he is devoted to his "great" community. What a nice, touchy time. Well, like Kennedy's speeches, it's one monotonously colorless and exaggerated object that never brings a good effect. The bossy script is illegible and the performances are adapted accordingly. These two factors really contributed to my headache. When the Indian comes alive and turns into an avenger, the thugs meet with very fast (though frightening) death in the right way. The effects were praiseworthy, but what about those loose hair? How could Hollywood have knocked down this strand of hair? Ugh! <br /> <br /> # The second story of "The Raft" follows a group of Yahoo smokers and teens heading for an isolated lake. After swimming to the raft in the middle of the lake, they are trapped on the platform because of the ominous, looking creature lurking in the water. <br /> <br /> - Now it is much better, MUCH better. What begins with your basic teenagers turns into a mysteriously frightening configuration, full of tension and claustrophobic tensions. And he can not even deal with flashes of nudity or splattering. It is quite morbid and it also affects the sense of humor. The surprisingly ironic ending has a beautiful accent. Nobodies protrusions are acceptable without a significant mark. Gornicka's direction is sticking to a nasty and rather sticky side. While the alarming music on this occasion pressed the appropriate chords. Creatures similar to slime in the lake (as many have mentioned) look like a disgusting black tarpaulin (yes, you read well!) Floating on the water. <br /> <br /> # Finally, the number three ends with "The Hitchhiker". A rich but sexually deprived woman is on her way back home after she is with a male gigolo, but she is late. Thinking about some ideas, to explain her lateness if necessary, slides off the road and accidentally hits the hitchhiker. Instead of checking or getting help, she leaves in the hope that she will come home before her husband. Soon she is terrorized by the massacred corpse of a dead hitchhiker. <br /> <br /> - Not terrible, but I really did not get into this ridiculously absurd exercise. Compared to the first two, this one was so different and tried to tickle the funny bone instead. Lois Chiles was fine in the lead role, but this constant assurance and small conversations that she carries with her have become pitifully annoying and even tired. The vivid effects of the make-up are clearly visible and they drip with your eyes. When a hitchhiker goes, it becomes feverish, cheesy and exaggerated during the execution. From there, we hear our dead hitchhiker repeated and repeating? and repeat the poem: "Thanks for the lady of the ride!" This happens every time she decides to drive it. Make some kindness for your beloved one. <br /> <br /> In total, the second story "The Raft" and unpleasant, well thought out effects are what raises this extremely lower sequel.
