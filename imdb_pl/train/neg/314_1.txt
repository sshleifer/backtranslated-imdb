I received this movie for $ 5 in the discount store, Adam Sandler is an amazing actor and I thought it would be a good movie, well, he was not. There was absolutely no story, no bad jokes, and the other comedian said "F-Word", every other word he said, curse usually does not bother me, but it was over the top. And even worse than the lack of a feature line were the parts in which Sandler just started talking to the camera in random portions of the movie, it reminded me of Dora the Explorer when they turn around and look at the screen and ask questions. And finally, when they randomly placed pictures of girls in bikinis at random moments of the movie. In my opinion, do not buy this movie is a waste of money
