It really shows that hype is not everything. Shows, according to and according to what is a nonsense actor, and the film is made only thanks to the father and his wife. Amitabh is solid as always. Ajay Devgan is always shitty and useless, and the new guy is a joke. The main lady is such an actor's loss. Such a pathetic movie from such a respected director and such a great industry. With films as such, I have reduced the number of Bollywood movies watched. <br /> <br /> RGV has been doing very bad films for some time. It's time to get different actors. Hrithek, whoever? Bollywood needs Madhuri and Kajola. Every other leading lady is a half-naked who wants to be. Pffffft.
