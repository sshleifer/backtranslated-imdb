I rented this movie about a month ago when I had nothing else to do on a Friday night. All I can say to describe this worthless movie is "TRASH". Acting is so badly done. I've seen children in high school that do a better job. and there is no room to capture the viewer. On another note, the special effects were madly tacky, and the whole thing looked like it was shot with a camera that anyone can buy in a radio hut. <br /> <br /> The clown does not look like the one on the video cover. Hell, he does not even appear in the movie until the end, and everything he does, buzz and circulate around a few characters. Nor is there any real murder shown, so it's not a real systolic film. Ever since I saw him, I've listened to several things 1. If it's a serial killer of a crazy clown, is not it a serial killer who kills clowns? 2. If your friend is lost, why would you go to the woods to have sex instead of looking? Sad really. <br /> <br /> 3. Why is it that the only REAL action will spill out in vain at the end suddenly? Has the cast finally decided to show effort in their work? This film is just as sad as it appears. My advice is to avoid renting so that you do not waste an hour or two of your time laughing more than shouting.
