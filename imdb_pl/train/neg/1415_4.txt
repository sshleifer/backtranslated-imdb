I had high expectations that this independent team was familiar with many reviews. Then .... <br /> <br /> Here are my additional "two cents" to the already published, perfect "lost in translation". Premise: Morgan is "stuck" in a dusty town, where he meets a charming Scarlet who works at a local supermarket. Can Morgan help you pick up the charming Scarlet from her junk trailer? <br /> <br /> A realistic dialogue? NO. How about shopping at Target? First, Freeman looks at the interior of Target, as if he came to Harrods. Then he gets absorbed by the shirt rack confirming that he was NEVER in any store visited by the charming Scarlet. Morgan is detached from all aspects of Scarlet's reality and is portrayed as joyful in his ignorance of everyone and everything in Scarlet's life. <br /> <br /> One reviewer enjoyed the scene of Scarlet's fight and ex-hubby, in which her survival, the car in this case requires her to physically attack her ex hubbie. Is Freeman running to her defense ... na ... he is cowering in disbelief and is completely unable to cope with such a dull aspect of her very real, pathetic fate in life. <br /> <br /> The character of Freeman thinks that car wash and a new, very revealing, tight blouse is the key to talking about Scarlet's job. Another sign that Freeman is KEY. Annoying was Freeman's endless "talking", in which all aspects of Scarlet's reality were reduced to one or other related to Freeman's stages of experience. <br /> <br /> Freeman is right, stressing that Scarlet is young and has his future ahead of him, then comfortably ignores the brick walls with which he has to deal: uneducated, without mental skills or experience, VERY VERY, without support family and low self-esteem. Scarlet learns of Freeman's life lessons like: some people pay $ 100 for a T-shirt, and the blouse that reveals can open the door instead of lacking in education and mental skill. In the end, Freeman offers Scarlet a little more than a strange diversion with a "star", without even paying for gas, for Scarlet's death at night, returning to an unchanged life in a city that Freeman does not want to know.
