This is an interesting idea that went badly. Hidden meanings in art left as hints by a serial killer sound intriguing, but the performance in "Anamorph" is terribly slow and without much interest. There is no other way to describe the movie except the boring one. Death tips are the only interesting part of "Anamorph". Everything that connects them is boring. Willem Dafoe gives credible results as a researcher, but has little to do with the script stretched to the limit. Several actors supporting the characters are wasted, including Peter Stormare as an art expert, James Rebhorn as police chief, Paul Lazar as a forensic doctor, and above all Deborah Harry, which is on the back of a DVD cassette, but has only a few lines spoken by a cracked door. Do not recommend. - MERK
