This movie, The Alamo: Thirteen Days to Glory, is totally nonsense. Acting is terrible, it's too patriotic, and its historical accuracy is not always the best (historians would have a day off). She has a few good moments, but not enough to keep her interest because it is much too long. Rating * from **********.
