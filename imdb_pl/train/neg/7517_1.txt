*** One of the ten stars *** <br /> <br /> Because if it was, it would get F. The Holy Mother of God was so bad. My point is that I gave him all the reasonable improvements, considering that it was a movie straight to the movie, but he let me down at every turn. Like many other B films, the basic story was decent, and the filmmakers seemed to have a reasonable level of resources, but the execution was ridiculous. It is a pity that they have attached the good name of Halloween to this fiasco. <br /> <br /> The basic premise is surrounded by some douche brothers who organize an annual Halloween haunted house fundiser, when the satanic book of spells appears and from nowhere throws brothers boys to hell. In any case, this is the idea, but instead the majority of the film is devoted to showing escapades of relationships between a brother and a boy, abounding in a scandalous lesbian thread. Very few facts are devoted to Halloween or the mysterious book of spells. It really annoys me that the filmmakers thought they could escape from doing such dribbling. <br /> <br /> The film is basically about the boy's brother's relationships. It is NOT what the movie is accounted for. I am tempted to track down the producers, or at least threaten them with their injury. Acting is as bad as possible, it's terrible! The script is involuntarily funny. The photos are simply lazy. The whole movie is an amateur night. This film makes the SyFy film productions look like masterpieces. <br /> <br /> The last half hour of the movie had the impression that the filmmakers realized that they do not produce a soap opera and they have to throw in a kind of horror sequences. The evil book of spells finally comes into play and turns everyone in the haunted house into a figure they dress up. I almost feel that I'm crying by writing this review. Wow! I mean wow! This thing was unencrypted, a fragmented catastrophe.
