This is so incredibly bad. Poor actors. You can say that they try very hard to polish turds, but we all know that you can not. Writing is so obvious and easy, it's sad to see them trying to sell them. Humor and pace are so busy, it's hard to believe that any of these good actors have signed up for it. <br /> <br /> That said, it's so terrible that it's difficult to look away from the screen. We just need to know where the train wreck is going. But that's only because we caught him on TV. If we really paid for it, we would be disgusted. <br /> <br /> So he gets 2 stars for being at least fun / fascinatingly bad. And random music (in contrast to the too-difficult indie soundtrack) is ridiculously reminiscent of the Scooby-Doo episode ... but not so good.
