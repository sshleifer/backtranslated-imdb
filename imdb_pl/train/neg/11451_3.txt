Okay, friends, it's expected that a serious film lover will watch all kinds of movies, both bad and good, and this movie has put me through a rehearsal. I will not waste words. This movie was bad. The story was bad. Acting was bad. Always great, Sissy Spacek did nothing to make this movie better. Indeed, I asked myself, why did I even bother with this rotten kitsch movie? Why was I wasting time and money on something that I suspected would be bad? The answer is, of course, that I'm a movie lover and that's why I can not avoid what should be avoided otherwise. I will not waste my time explaining what was wrong with this amateur film, except that the quality of acting was politely subpaar. A serious film lover can take responsibility for watching this movie. Otherwise. Stay home, do not waste time, read a book, take home work or eat a good sandwich.
