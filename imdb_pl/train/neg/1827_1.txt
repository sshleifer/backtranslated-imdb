Jealousy is playing some of the best. Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Amy Poehler and the great Christopher Walken. Only the best can be expected with such a cast. However, with "Envy" no one can save this catastrophe. <br /> <br /> Tim Dingman (Stiller) and Nick Vanderpark (Black) are the best friends and co-workers in the sandpaper factory. They both live decently, but because Tim has better results at work, he can afford more than his buddy Nick. Nick is a dreamer who always invent new ideas for inventions. One day, Nick comes up with the idea of ​​a spray that makes the doggie disappear (Yes, I'm serious). In love with this idea, Nick decides to really come up with this product. He makes an offer to invest in his idea and shares 50/50 profits. Tim refuses that the idea will never work. <br /> <br /> Nick's invention, entitled "va-poo-rize" (again, I'm serious), ends in millions. He likes to spend money on things like a much bigger home, a horse, a personal trainer and fancy deserts. Tim starts to envy Nick. Hence the name of the movie. <br /> <br /> The concept is not bad, but it still turns out to be awful. This video contains some of the worst dialogues and very poor results from all casts. Again, as I mentioned earlier, none of them could have saved this mess. Even the great Christoper Walken, who plays the homeless character of "J-man", did not make the film fun. The film is bad from the very beginning and continues to deteriorate. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie if: * you like nonsense (no word play) * you want to see Jacek Black in a white tuxie <br /> <br /> I say avoid this movie at all costs, but avoid ESPECIALLY if: * you are offended by the bathroom * you love animals
