I have not watched movies for children for several years, so I missed "Here Come the Tigers" when it first came out. (I never even saw "Bad News Bears", although in the 1970s I worked for the guys who financed the film, including "Warriors", "Man Who Would Be King" and "Rocky Horror Picture Show".) Now I like Browse old or small films and find people who have gone on a great career, even though they were not in the great movie at the beginning. Only a few minutes after this movie I could not stand it anymore and jumped to the final credits to see if there was a young actor in this movie who went for bigger and better things - at least watching his / her appearance would arouse interest because the plot and acting did not work. And here I saw the name of Wes Craven in the subtitles as an electrician. He has already done two or three of his early shocking, but he has not created Freddie Krueger yet, nor did he make "Scream" movies. Maybe he owed a favor and helped in this photo. More surprising was Fred J. Lincoln in the cast written as "Aesop", a crazy character in the movie. F. J. Lincoln, from the 1970s until just a few years ago, appeared and produced adult films. He was associated with the parody of adults "The Ozporns", and only this title is more fun than all attempts of "Tigers" combined with humor. Let the fact that an adult actor has been placed in a children's film may indicate how the people who created the film had to sleep behind the wheel.
