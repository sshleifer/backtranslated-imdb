For the most part, this movie seems to be "an effort for television." Direction is inhibited, acting (except Fred Gwynne) is exaggerated and soapy. Especially Denise Crosby releases her poems as if she were cold, reading them from a memory card. Only one thing makes this movie worth watching, and once Gage returns from "Semetara". There is something unsettling about watching a child murder someone, and this movie can be more than some people can deal with. It is absolutely chilling in your veins. This movie does only one thing, but it knocks one out of the park. It's worth seeing only for the last 10 minutes.
