The only thing that prevented this total paralysis was some interesting stylish accents. <br /> <br /> (Moderate Spoiler Alert) The death of the comic is somewhat derived from the scene in Twilight Zone: The Movie, which provides death from cartoons. Despite this, it was treated nicely, especially watching bleeding from the ink and sucking the color. <br /> <br /> There is also another good scene with a demonic motorcycle. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I was glad that I bought a DVD in the store from the sale, because it was awful. I bought "Soul Survivors" at the same time, and both films were similarly annoying because of the constant realization that you were watching the dream. However, where "Soul Survivors" has nothing to redeem, or it makes sense, at least it had several stylish notes mentioned above. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, the DVD allows you to go to 8 "nightmares" in which something really happens, which is the only way to watch it. Scripts between the moments of creative gore are rather unbearable. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
