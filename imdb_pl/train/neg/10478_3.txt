I honestly consider this film as another weak effort of the Dominican Movie Industry. The first 30 minutes of the movie are a bit funny, but when they change their role in society (men do what women usually do, and women do what men usually do), the movie falls. It becomes boring and not funny at all. They allow for many things without explanation and the end of the film is predictable. I did not like the way Roberto Angel played his character and his little one. I went to the cinema with the hope of a good job, but I got really disappointed. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie.
