"Unhinged" is one strange little movie, a forgotten scrap of the golden age of the genre. It's hard to write a satisfactory review of this movie just because the movie is so special. His plot is quite exaggerated - three young women on the way to a rock concert fall into a car crash and go to the estate in the residence of an eccentric old woman and her daughter. Very quickly ladies realize that something is wrong when they hear strange breath and noise from the attic. What's more, mother and daughter seem to have a very, very strange relationship because they are arguing intensely before the host at dinner. An old mother goes so far as to call her daughter a whore and a whore, and accuses her of sneaking into the boys at night to sleep with them. In the middle of the movie, when one girl finally decides that she will go better to find help, killing begins. <br /> <br /> When it comes to acting, this movie is at the bottom of the barrel. None of the three orphaned girls can act, especially the "leading" girl. It is almost unbelievable to hear them transmit their lines in the same wooden tone throughout the movie. Mother and daughter are better, but not much. The film is also quite boring in part and really, really pulling. The killings are gruesome, but nothing we have not seen before. However, as mentioned here, the movie really gains points thanks to its brilliant disconcerting and bloody ending. It comes completely from the left field and has the same shock value as the end of the classic "Sleepaway Camp" camp. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is boring and suffers from a terrifying acting and boring game, boring. Insulated, terrifying mansion and dark, sinister lighting give the film grainy realism, but it quickly breaks down when one of the characters tries to act. Maybe it's worth it if you can lengthen it to the end, but I say it's better to just send it quickly to the last 10 minutes. 4 out 10
