This piece of shit could have been appreciated 60 years ago, but this is one of the most racist films ever made with American Indians played by white men. The right-wing Republican James Stewart was a great racist in real life, just like his close friend John Wayne. In 1971, Stewart ordered the actor Hal Williams to shoot the "The Jimmy Stewart Show" (short-lived series that fortunately fell) precisely because Williams was black. If that was not enough, this movie is very old and boring. Instead, watch "Dances with Wolves" to get a less racist view. <br /> <br /> Stewart turned forty when the horrible movie was made, and even with his funny wig he still looked like a pedophile, chasing after 16 years -old Debra Paget. I am surprised that it was even allowed. <br /> <br /> 0/10.
