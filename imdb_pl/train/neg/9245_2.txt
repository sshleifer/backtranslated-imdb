This video guide was a masterpiece of the year 1995. Beautifully made! Matthew Perry and Jennifer Aniston have a serious chemistry on screen when they talk about what the Start button does. I'm waiting for Microsoft to release a special edition DVD with deleted scenes, a commentary by Bill Gates, a document showing a comparison of Windows 95 with Windows XP and much more! <br /> <br /> Overall: 10/10 (I should have won at least a Golden Globe)
