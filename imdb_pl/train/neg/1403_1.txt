Absolutely miserable loss of the movie !! Nothing ever happens. No ghosts, almost no train, no secret, no interest. Constant and BRUTAL comedy attempts are painful. Everything else is pathetic. The assumption is idiotic: a group of people got stuck in the middle of the place because their train was stopped for less than 3 minutes. What? And the railway line leaves them no place to stay, during a storm? I think not. Oh, they can go 4 miles through dead black fields. umm, yes. Sure. They can also force the hospitality of the railway and stay at the "haunted" railway station. A station that turned out to be nothing but DEEP BIRTH, completely without ghosts, interests or plots. <br /> <br /> It's so boring that it seems impossible. to the list of LOST FILMS !! aargh !!
