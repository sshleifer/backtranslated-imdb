*** LIGHT SPOILER ALERT *** The story sounds good, and if you read the novel, you probably expect a deep and intense movie that can give you insight into some interesting and insufficiently researched relationships. > <br /> It is true that the script tries to do it, the director tries to do it, but the main cast fails miserably. Maria's actress is so dry that she lacks any feeling, and her most intense moments seem almost comical. Sometimes it seems to be upset because of the camera. Her only really emotional scene is coming to an end when she is abandoned by a girl. <br /> <br /> Ioana seems even more tense than Maria, and worse, it does not seem natural. Maria had such an attitude, even if she was artificially pushed towards obviousness, but she had this and her character received some credibility. What's worse, we have no insight into her: where did she come from, where did she get into the lesbian relationship, how did the relationship evolve? We only get some fragments from the parents, and their relationship seems to "be" there: it has content and an end, but there is no beginning. Just like her partner Maria, she has only one scene that really moves, the scene in which she casts the figure of Maria, Kiki. <br /> <br /> Tudor is the only person in this film (apart from the hostess, a great actress there), who manages to prove his acting talent. He has the attitude of his character and fits him. Only once or twice seems to be suspended (the scene at the parents' meal, trying to be obvious when it was not necessary). <br /> <br /> I love this story, Tudor Chirila is okay, the hostess actually works, and Puya provides him with a few lines with style, but that does not save the movie. It is a pity that the whole setting had enormous potential, and Romanian cinematography could use the film on the subject. Oddly enough, the incestuous relationship between a brother and a sister seems to have more credibility than a lack of background without feeling (well, Mary's interludes are a nice attempt in this direction) a lesbian relationship between Maria and Ioana. I'm sorry about spending money on a ticket, I'd rather watch it from the comfort of my room.
