War, Inc. - Corporations take over the war in the future and use the lone killer Mark Hauser (John Cusack) to work wet against rival presidents. A dark comedy that satires both the army and corporations. Often it was difficult to find out what exactly was going on. I waited for things that would make sense. Madness has no reason or method. <br /> <br /> Cusack regards himself as the "spiritual successor" of Grosse Point Blank. I mean, War is more or less a knockout. Again, we see Cusack as the killer who protects * the spoiler * the person he should kill when he's holding his conscience. To be honest, John Cusack looks pretty reliably, eliminating half a dozen men with relative ease. Short fights look good. The rest of the movie is not. Everything is bizarre, often bordering on quirks. War Inc is not funny enough to be a parody and too strong for anyone to even think about what a movie message may be, which I suppose may be a soulless way corporations like war factions compete with and plan without loss of attention. how they affect the average citizen. Interesting, but the satire simply does not work because it is not fun and its heart has no heart. We should consider how the war affects the Cusack's shell, not the millions of lives torn apart by the war. <br /> <br /> John Cusack provides a decent performance. His character boils over the shots of hot sauce and drives the smallest private plane, but the quirks are supposed to replace character traits. Marisa Tomei sleeps like a romantic auxiliary journalist. There is not much chemistry between them. Hilary Duff tries a Russian accent and does not make a fool of herself. Joan Cusack just screams, squeals and wigs. Blech. Ben Kingsley may have to return the Oscar if he does not start to award decent results from time to time. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> This is not a horrible movie, but in the end you have to ask: "What is it good for?" Absolutely nothing. DOWN-
