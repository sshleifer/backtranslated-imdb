At least among those with 100 or more votes. Nominated for the best script written directly on the screen? Brenda Blethyn nominated for the best actress in the lead role? Nominated for the best photo? I always disagree with many types of Oscars, but this movie may be the worst movie of all time, which will be honored by the Academy. Writing and acting were terrible. The performance of Blethyn in particular was one of the worst I've ever seen, and probably the most overrated performer of all time. A horrible movie, unworthy of a large screen and unworthy of any cable or TV channel that has ever played, including HBO (where I saw it). I am grateful that I did not really pay for watching one of the most discounted films of all time.
