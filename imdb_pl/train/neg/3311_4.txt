Saving Grace is certainly one of the leading contenders for "How to destroy the right movie in the final reward in a few minutes." Naturally, if you mix a peculiar Cornish village - largely inhabited by retired elegant ladies - with a liberal dose of marijuana, you will achieve a certain amount of stupidity. However, the last seven minutes of the film go completely unreasonable and it is not even redeemed because it is particularly funny. This is a real shame, because this comedy has the potential to be just as good as Waking Ned Devine from 1998, which also depicted a picturesque little village and its strange inhabitants trying to get out of a difficult situation. <br /> <br /> The protagonist Saving Grace is middle-aged, recently widowed Grace Trevethyn, whose heritage of bad debts forced her to an unconventional way of earning money. Helped by a gardener, Matthew, turns his gardening knowledge into a lucrative marijuana crop. Unfortunately, this leads to a confrontation with the local police, her husband's creditors and the French drug baron. . . . . . . . . . everyone appears at the same time in her greenhouse. The relationship and relationship between Grace and Matthew are well presented, and Brenda Blethyn engages the viewer emotionally in his sympathetic form - you can really feel what he is going through. <br /> <br /> The cast of the smaller roles is perfect, even if some of them are rather bizarre. However, transforming Jacques into a drug lord into Grace's romantic interest is highly unreliable and does not suit the tone of the film. Certainly, hydroponics is not such a revolution in the world of cannabis growing? Unfortunately, the movie turns a gentle humor into a slapstick and ends up as fake as marijuana plants.
