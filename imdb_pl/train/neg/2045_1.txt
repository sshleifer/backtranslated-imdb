This movie must have been the worst movie I've ever seen. My sister and her boyfriend went to rent Zodiac (2007) and got it by accident. I thought it was a joke before the actual movie. it was scary. I waited for it to be horrible and I never did. this movie had no real facts about the true Zodiac killer. The creators of the film apparently did not even bother to investigate anything about the killings ... they liked the name only ... so they decided to write a script that did not match his name. I am nervous, I did not realize that it was not a movie before. I'm trying to like something from every movie, I do not hate movies ... never ... except that. If you did not give her any stars, I would definitely do it. 1 out of 10.
