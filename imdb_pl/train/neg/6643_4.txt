Terminus Paradis was unique, but "Niki ardelean" comes too late. We have enough of this and we want something new. <br /> <br /> Great directors should not have problems with watching out of their time, not in the back. Why do people perceive Romania only as a post-revolutionary country? <br /> <br /> We were just born, not resurrected, and no one is talking about old times anymore. Most people do not remember or do not want to remember, and the new generation of movie consumers does not understand a bit. This should be the first day of the Romanian movie, not the last song - priveghi! Maybe the younger directors should move.
