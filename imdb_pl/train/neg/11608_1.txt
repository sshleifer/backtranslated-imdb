If this guy can make a movie, I can do it too. <br /> <br /> In fact, if you hire me to make a movie for you, I promise that I will do the following: <br /> <br /> 1) I will add more naked women. This movie had none. I think that cheesy B-class horrors are rented only because of their traditional use of the female body. I would not disappoint my viewers. <br /> <br /> 2) I will refrain from creating too many scenes in which the hero wakes up to find out that this is just a dream. I think HorrorVision had about 4 of these scenes. And considering that the movie was only an hour, the ratio of length of sleep to film was quite high. And if I decide to take a sequence of dreams, I will make sure that the person wakes up without clothing. I mean, who sleeps in leather pants? <br /> <br /> 3) I do not break any movies like Star Wars or Matrix, because I know that my budget is small and I will not want to mask my contempt for big Hollywood movies by adding satirical references to them . <br /> <br /> 4) And finally, I will not mix modern technology with undead. I mean, the palm pilot can be so frightening ... at least it turned him into a bad rolly-polly monster before the screen exploded or something like that. <br /> <br /> So if you are looking beyond the quality in your next production of horror, count on me: an extraordinary film director.
