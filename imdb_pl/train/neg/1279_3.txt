The film tells three stories that seemed to be curly without knowing that it is a connected vignette film. The creators refer to three vignettes, combining them to reduce Martin Kove, although you will never see some of Kove. <br /> <br /> The first vignette has a sexy Vivian Schilling, a woman who is afraid of everything the sun (makes Adrian Monk look bold), having paranoia laced in the evening alone. You will literally yell at Vivian for doing funny things. She spends most of her time in the night, which shows her amazing features. But her film is the worst, if not the most biting. <br /> <br /> The second vignette belongs to Bill Paxton, who presents a roommate from hell. His scientific roommate allows him to fully use him, and Bill does it whenever he can. <br /> <br /> The last vignette was funny, because the man is afraid that death will take him at any moment, just like his colleague who choked on oil. <br /> <br /> Not very interesting, because the film as a whole seems to be hacked together with very little involvement. A must for fans of Bill Paxton.
