... but the problem with this production lies in the fact that it is far from a good musical. <br /> <br /> Of course you can not expect witty masters like Sondheim, Bernstein or Porter; however, the music of this song makes even Andrew Lloyd Webber look funny. It's deadly boring and non-invasive (with one or two exceptions) and right after I watched it, I could not recall a single significant melody - which is rather tragic from someone who has learned all the other Hundred People from three listening sessions. <br /> It is also strangely non-theatrical. It takes place on an incredibly large stage (you really have to feel sorry for these people in the first rows who broke their necks to see something that happens 50 meters on the right side or 100 meters on the left) and do nothing about it. When there is to be one person singing on the stage, you get it - and the rest of the huge stage is empty. For me, as a novice theater director, watching was painful. <br /> <br /> The fact is that Cole Porter seems to capture French culture better than non-talented people can get closer. And I'm surprised by the popularity of this would-be legendary musical.
