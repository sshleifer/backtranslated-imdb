The only reason I give it to 2 is that filmography is so stylized these days that it has at least something to comment on. <br /> <br /> This movie is stunning. It's like a lot of other stuffs from the ground of the 21st century. Blood is unjustified and simply repulsive. I did not care about any character, but I was concerned that some morons took pains to write this nonsense: I complained about the money I spent, but my date and I wisely left after 40 minutes and went to the adjoining theater to watch adventure and entertainment "Live Free or Die Hard", which probably got a much higher rating from me simply because for 40 minutes I had endured the whole pile of "Captivity".
