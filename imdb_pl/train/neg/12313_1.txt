This could be the worst movie that Steve Martin ever did, but it was certainly not the best. Of course, he did it nonsense to check the pay. Dreck in this way certainly does not improve his reputation as a funny man. He does not understand that when people go to Steve Martin's movie, they expect entertainment and they do not get bored with tears. It's sad that he brought Dan Aykroyd and Phil Hartman with him. I do not understand why talented people can not control the fact that people do not want to watch them in bad movies. If you want to call a movie comedy, it should be fun. It was not. Shame for the American army for allowing himself to be associated with this pabulum. Full Metal Jacket had more laughter than this miserable excuse for a "service comedy". Certainly Phil Silvers is falling in the grave.
