I really did not know what the movie was about when I went to the theater to see it (the noise of Satanism, etc.). Because the trailers in the last movie I saw were quite interesting. <br /> <br /> Oh, Roman Catholic mythology? Not my idea of ​​good fear and to be honest, I just wanted to see a really good, scary movie, not some loosely drawn religious farce that tries to get cheap emotions when a damn chick gets every few minutes! <br /> <br /> I will try to stay away from spoilers (!), but I found it very strange that an atheist who receives a rosary string from a deceased priest can suddenly end up with Christ's wounds (are not the stigmata supposed to be deep My point is that she meets with losers, does the losers, behaves like a typical rebel and others, and here shows the wounds of Jesus Christ? Come! <br /> <br /> Scenes of crucified, thrown out head, shouting, Blood everywhere, it became quite boring after watching it a dozen or so times.This was not terrifying or frightening, just repulsive.However, watching became quite painful - these shredding scenes were very annoying ... <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION: If your Catholic does not see it, if you are not, you still can not see him.
