Please, let me forget. Please. Please. It's the worst movie I've ever had the misfortune to watch. I consider this film to be an insult to my brain, as well as to my back, who suffered from me, sitting and watching this movie. I still have to see what the damage caused my vision and the ability to perform sentences. What a rubbish !! And do not let me start acting ... Somebody please help me forget !! "Strange science" - come back !! Everything is forgiven ... <br /> <br /> I am "proud" that I can give this film the first place in IMDb ... p, but it's so bad that I can not believe it. Someone came up with an idea and thought it worth to become a movie? Someone actually read the script and decided to produce a movie? Someone read the script and listened to it? Someone saw the movie and decided * not * put it on the shelf to collect dust for eternity? * These * are questions that I want answers to. Not a philosophical question about this tree in the forest and well, you know ...
