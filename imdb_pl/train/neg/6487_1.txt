Well, thank you SO MUCH for Disney for DESTROYING the nice memories I used to have my long favorite movie. I was about 5 years old when the original movie appeared, and it was one of the first movies I remember. So now, when I'm 16 and I feel masochistic enough, I decided to rent this movie. In this way, I was able to poison all the memories of the original film with this apologetic pretext for the film. This film takes everything that made the original endearing and destroying it until the last detail. <br /> <br /> In this movie Ariel and Eric are celebrating the birth of their daughter, Melody, and they are going to show her all in the ocean ... STYLE BROADWAY! After the music number is over, a sea witch Morgan appears in a few minutes and threatens to kill Melody if Triton does not give up the trident. In this way, he gives up without a fight. Eric is gaping there, though Ariel discovers how to use the sword and save Melody. Morgana escapes, so Ariel and Eric decide that Melody should never approach the sea until Morgan is caught. <br /> <br /> Well ... nothing really happens. Eric is total. He never really does anything. Ariel does something. Melody manages to screw up. In addition, animation is a new benchmark for Disney. Computer graphics end in a collision with the background. A single chance to develop a character is always wasted. Songs bite. <br /> <br /> Listen, do not waste your time. I'm pretty sure even young children will get bored because nothing even happened. They will not want to sing songs. If you can get a copy of it, throw it into the ocean and hope no one will find it. Always.
