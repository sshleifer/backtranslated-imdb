The headmaster of high school (Keenan Wynn) with the defeated basketball team unwittingly hires a coach who turns out to be not only a gorgeous blonde (Cathy Lee Crosby), but a catalyst for their new winning ways. Are you really surprised? Along the way, the romance grows between the coach and the band's star Jacek (Michael Biehn). The police are never notified. <br /> <br /> Packed together with other Crown International Pictures as a grindhouse movie, it really does not make a movie. This can be easily edited in the TV movie of the week. Cathy Lee Crosby looks great as a trainer for Randy Rawlings, especially in her scant costumes, but I was expecting something more than the usual excitement of the R-rated movie. A side thread in which the dorky center participates, mesmerized by his teammates, believe he is a former Sydney NBA NBA player, he is the real reason for the new team success, not Cathy Lee's coaching. Too much teasing and insufficient profession make this a big disappointment.
