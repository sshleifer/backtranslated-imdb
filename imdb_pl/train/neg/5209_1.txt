Ok, so I was bored and watched it all the way. <br /> <br /> This movie is gentle, harmless and unremarkable. The story is so sweet that it rots teeth in opening titles. The tail of two "traumatic" children learning about "God" in a fairytale way that honestly left me in a trauma. He uses the Irish "blarney" in such a stereotypical way that he hopes no real Irishman will see him. Aimed at children who would sincerely turn themselves off after the first attempt to accent "OIRISH". In total, why they pump them out.
