In fact, it is an insult to the victims and their families of the BTK assassin. The events in this film are not even close to the truth. Why they could not make a movie with real events does not make sense, because real events are more interesting than it was to create a farce. Do not waste time watching it for free. Low budget and disgraceful presentation of events, which should not be a joke, what really did this movie. If they let me give -10 to this movie, I would like to. The actress drew in and it looks like it was shot on an old VHS video camera from the 80's. Save time and money without watching this movie.
