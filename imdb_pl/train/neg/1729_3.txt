... and how bored they are! The Crater Lake Monster is one of the classic BAD films from the 70s, without actors, without an embarrassing scenario, a pitiful direction and a tireless desire to combine "horror" with a light comedy. This film presents a paleontologist who finds drawings of a water dinosaur under the Crater Lake ... the meteor falls from the sky, and the Claymation water dinosaur begins to terrorize and eat the inhabitants surrounding the Crater Lake. Our local sheriff Steve deals with the matter. Much of the film - when the pool of blood left after what we imagine was the dining room of the beast - is spent after the inept tomfoolery of two guys named Arnie and Mitch, who run a boat rental. They try to be so funny that we get lines looking at the company sign, Mitch says to Arnie, "You wrote the bait wrong, it's written B-A-T-E." Laughter was quite rare here. Then we see them get drunk and imagine a tree trunk to be a dinosaur. Laurel and Hardy watch out! The dinosaur looks fake, but the movie is fun in a bad way. At least the lake is beautiful.
