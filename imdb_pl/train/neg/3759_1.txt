Oh, where to start. The photos were great. When the movie started for the first time because of the initial landscape scenes, I thought I was in a good movie. Then cyprus Bigfoot appeared. It looked like a drawing from the cartoon of King Lion and the loving King of the Congo. He completely broke away from the credibility of the character. Now I knew that there were no people chasing Bigfoot wandering the forest for no apparent reason, but a tacky cartoon cgi. From that moment, the whole movie was filmed for me. The money they'd spent on the toilet for the cgi they could spend on the costume, like Roger Patterson, they did. It was the best Bigfoot costume that no one else could match. I'm a hardcore cheesy bigfoot fan and I was warned about this movie, but my coercion led me to watch the movie and I was disappointed just as the previous reviews warned me. I know that after reading this review you will still be saying, "I need to watch Sasquatch hunters, I need to watch Sasquatch hunters." Then you'll tell me why I was wasting my hard-earned money on such a terribly bad boring movie!
