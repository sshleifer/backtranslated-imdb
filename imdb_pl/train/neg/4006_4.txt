For those of you who have never heard of it (or seen on A & E), Cracker is a brilliant British television program with an obese, burning chain, a disgusting psychologist named Fitz who helps the Manchester police department to get on the head of a violent criminal. He is considered one of the best concerts ever to come out of England (and that says something), and he was a huge success in England and around the world in 1993. <br /> <br /> The original stars have now again joined forces with the original writer to knock out another 2-hour episode. I've loved this program since I saw it for the first time, over ten years ago. A set of DVD boxes contains an honorary place in my collection and I can quote a lot of Fez interrogation scenes practically word for word. The idea of ​​re-playing Robbie Coltrane with Jimmy McGovern for the next TV movie about Fitz filled me with absolute joy. <br /> <br /> I'll start with a good one. One of the many things that impressed me in the original Cracker series was how quickly Fitz was defined as a character. Five minutes to the first episode? with his lecture (throwing books in the air), drinking him and swearing the guy behind him in the queue for gambling? and you knew, you just knew who this character was. You felt that he "clicks" in your mind, a kind of click that only happens when a great actor gets a great role written by a great writer. <br /> <br /> Coltrane, of course, was great throughout the performance, but I always felt that some of the later episodes? those not written by McGovern? he treated the character badly. <br /> <br /> So the good news is: Fitz came back. As soon as you see it in this program? Incredibly inappropriate comments on my daughter's wedding? You will feel that you "click" again. It's him: irritated in a moment and I'm really sorry the next, always insightful, honest to the point that he is tactful, but brilliantly amusing in this process. If you love this character as much as I do, you will be delighted with how it is presented in the film. This also applies to Judith and Mark: in fact, everything that has to do with the Fitzami is perfectly supported. <br /> <br /> The problem I have with this movie concerns the crime fiction that Fitz tries to solve. In the standard Cracker style, we know exactly who the criminal is in the first five minutes? the tension is that Fitz understood that. In this case, we have a serial killer who is looking for American blood. And the reason for this, unfortunately, is not due to any credible psychological trauma? rather, it seems that the murders are just here to allow the writer to show his personal political beliefs. <br /> <br /> I can not write it because I really believe that Jimmy McGovern is one of the greatest writers in the world. I also have no problem with films about current issues or films that occupy a political position. But in the Cracker universe, we expect characters to behave like people, not caricatures. Instead, the Americans in this film are presented in a completely stereotypical way. They have nothing to say, who complain about everything, treat the locals like shit and betray their wives? one of them manages to do all of the above activities in less than 5 minutes. I really thought I was switching channels by mistake or something. <br /> <br /> But this is not the end. We are constantly remembering how bad the war in Iraq is going? reminders that have nothing to do with history and appear virtually out of nowhere. The killer is so busy preaching that Bush is worse than Hitler, that he almost forgets to kill himself; but more specifically, he is the spokesperson for the writer's political views that he forgets to act like a credible person, and therefore us? as an audience? do not buy his sudden transformation from a happy family man into a tortured serial deadly soul. <br /> <br /> Can not say that it ruined the show for me? It was still a good television, better than almost everything else in this genre (mainly due to, once again, Coltrane). But constant politicization made it impossible for him to be as good as the real Cracker classics, such as "To Be A Somebody"? episode which was just as "problematic", but which was treated with much more subtlety and psychological depth. <br /> <br /> Two other small points: Panhandle is not near disappointment, but worse, her deputies. The entire police department? which has been filled with such wonderful characters for so long now is full of vanilla. Fully interchangeable cops who have no personality (how you can drop Richard Coyle with Coupling outside of my personality, but in fact he is missing here). <br /> <br /> There are also a few moments when the program lost its credibility to me. One such case revolves around Fitz, who must narrow down the entire population of Manchester from 1 million to a hundred based on very strange criteria (French windows? How does a computer know if I have French windows?) ?? not only does he succeed, but he manages it in less than an hour. I do not think so. <br /> <br /> So, I was a little disappointed. It is recommended to watch, but remember to leave at least part of your expectations at the door. Even so, if a new series appears after all this, it would all be for good: I am convinced that McGovern can still write great things, and maybe now, when he has his policy outside his system, he can go back to writing about people.
