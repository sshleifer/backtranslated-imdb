This is undoubtedly one of the worst films I've ever seen ... <br /> <br /> The plot is so full of holes, the story is like a bad remake of a bad movie about the tension and the actors sound like they read for the first time directly from the manuscript. Steve Guttenberg is the worst. He plays his character as in the "Police Academy" - the same stupid womanizer - and is not suitable for the leading man in the thriller. <br /> <br /> It's really hard to believe that Hanson DO "LA Confidential" ten years later ... <br /> <br /> Avoid this as a plague ...
