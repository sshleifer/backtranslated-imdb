After leaving the first, you think that wayans brothers can come up with some new jokes. Probably not. If the first one was not bad enough, this one is so bad that it hurts to watch. Considering all the actors they have in this movie, you think they can come up with something cleverer. Although they could not, they had to endure all the same lewd, not funny jokes from the first and somehow put it in that movie-thinking people who would laugh again. Although the first thing, I did not laugh at it. They tried to make these movies in parodies, although they did not succeed on every level. Most of the time, these are just randomly inserted jokes that are so disgusting and lewd that they are hard to watch and enjoy. Then, when they try to make scenes that are film parodies, they end after a 20-minute restoration of the scene with one joke in the whole scene. Also for people who say that they are not for older and real young audiences, I fit well into the age range for which it is supposed to be funny. While people say different people have different ideas for what's fun or not, if you find it funny, you're probably not one of the more mature or intelligent people around. Writing this type of script does not require too much skill, but if you want a more clever and fun movie, see Spaceballs. It's a movie parody, which is really good and well done, and it did not have to use disgusting and joking jokes to make it funny.
