So I heard from several people that this movie led them to tears in the theater. When I first watched him, I was expecting another romantic tearing film by Barbra Streisand; Something like The Way We Were. I certainly was wrong. The chemistry between the two main heroes, Esther Hoffman and her John Howard, did not exist, making it impossible to become attached to the character. There was nothing romantic about it. Streisand's figure was attributed to an alcohol addict who could not sing a single note without forcing me to press the fast scroll button. At some point, her character finds her husband in bed with another woman and forgives him about five minutes later. There is nothing romantic about a dead rock star and a woman who does not seem to realize it until she dies. Parts of the film seemed to pull and pull, and I kept asking myself when it would end. <br /> <br /> The death of John Howard was completely predictable. At the beginning of the film, there was a clear indication of his reckless behavior, and when he died I did not feel any emotion. It was not a tragic accident, it was just an idiot. Not to mention the whole movie, I was distracted by his hideous beard. <br /> <br /> The only parts of this movie worth seeing are the Streisand songs. The end of the movie, when she sings "With One More Look At You / Watch Closely Now", was my reason to give this film as much as 3/10. These 7 minutes were the only part of the movie in which I felt emotions other than irritation and anger.
