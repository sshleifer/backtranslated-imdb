When you look at it now and you hear the whole language here, it's amazing that it was rated as "PG", but this is a 70's grading system for you. Peter Falk unsuccessfully spits out the Lord's name six times in the first ten minutes of this film! However, not many people find this offensive, and certainly not the scum that the films do, or the people who "evaluate" them. <br /> <br /> The cast is an indication of how blasphemy the movie may be: Falk, Peter Boyle, Allen Garfield, Warren Oates, Gena Rowlands and Paul Sorvino are not actors you will not find in "The Sound Of Music". <br /> <br /> I like movies with robberies and many films by director William Friedkin, but this scenario does not work and has just too much "Sleazy" 70's, visually and audibly. For those who loved Falk in the television "Columbo", a shock must be listening to how he uses profanity in movies. This is far from the only case.
