I was able to see it with MST3K and oh, even with riffs this movie was terribly bad. Imagine someone whose competences associated with the camera can be done by a monkey. <br /> <br /> The most interesting fragments (not enough) came from special effects that were "OK". Acting was mostly "OK"; although it was nothing special, it was of a higher quality than the other B films I have seen in the past. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is terribly bad, working with the camera often looks as if the cameraman on the roller skates and pushed him. The story (if you can call it that) is so full of holes that it's almost funny. He never really explains why the hell survived or needs a human body to survive. The script is poorly written, and the dialog is bordered by a stupid plane. The climax of the movie (if there is one) is absolutely funny. <br /> <br /> If you can not find the MST3K version, avoid it at all costs.
