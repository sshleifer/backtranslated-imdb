It must be one of the 5 worst movies ever. The plot looked intriguing, as was the case with Passenger 57. But in this last film it worked much better. The plot was developed in the worst possible way. Only a few horrible moments in Stewardes' movie stand in the open door of the 747 flying aircraft and try to shut the door without wind sucking 250 miles per hour?!? Then the plane lands from a distance of several kilometers, starting at 8,000 feet, which is impossible even for 747 pilots with a thousand hours of experience. When he is on the runway (of course, perfectly straight), he is instructed to pull the flaps, HUH !! Come on the flaps to provide lift at low speeds, when you use the reverse side of the engine on the runway and give you maximum power! I can talk about small and mostly minor mistakes in the movie, but then my answer will become the size of an English dictionary. It's a movie you want to miss, believe me!
