It's really the worst movie I've ever seen. Always. Dot. I paid 3.50 pounds to watch this steaming movie. Incredibly boring, poorly played, horrible scenario, often incoherent and too many scenes that do not seem to have any meaning for the whole movie (eg When the spiritual partner of Heath Ledger is nailed to the wall by the ghost ... what was this scene about? Reply to postcard please ...) <br /> <br /> I should have a medal for sticking to this movie for the duration of it. I'd rather kick a groin rather than sit in the movie again. <br /> <br /> This should be dropped 100 IMDb down. I hope my 1/10 vote will help him along the way.
