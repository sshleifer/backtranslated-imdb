I do not understand the whole buzz about this movie. OK, if you like cheap splashes, you'll love this movie, but if you like good stories and good actors - do not watch it. Personally, I really did not like the actors in this movie, they seem to be employed straight from the street. Dialogues are completely flat and you always know what will happen next. The overall quality of this video lacks the likely very low budget. When we saw this movie (myself and 3 other people), we all had in mind that this movie was created by some people who had to do it, only to finish the film school - with the least effort. Another issue that really reduces the whole experience is a bad camera (very shaky) and a bad sound, the whole movie seems to be played using one microphone.
