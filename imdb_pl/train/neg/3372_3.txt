The pale shadow of a big musical, this movie suffers from the fact that the director, Richard Attenborough, completely misses the musical point, unnecessarily "opening" it and confusing the idea of ​​the game. The performance tells about a group of dancers who take part in auditions to work in the musical B'way and analyze their motivation and willingness to work in this demanding and not always satisfying line of work. Attenborough gives us a new face of hope, assuming that they are trying to "break" the show business, instead of presenting a more shapely mix of characters created on stage as a group of working "Gypsy" live show, along with some newcomers. The film has one advantage over the game and it is an opening scene, showing the size of the original interrogation and the real scale of shrinking to 16/17 on the line (depending on how you count Cassie, who is stupidly holding the line in the movie). Anyone who can catch a local civic light opera will have a much richer experience than watching this ill-conceived movie.
