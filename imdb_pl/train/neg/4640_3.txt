The hunters chase after what they consider a man through the forest, though the audience sees that he is a werewolf. Hunters never know it, because when they shoot it, it looks normal when they cut it. <br /> <br /> The physician carries the eyes of a werewolf on a man who lost his experiment in a laboratory. Man, Rich, has sex with his nurse (Stephanie Beaton) before he even removes the bandages. <br /> <br /> After leaving the hospital, he states that his wife is also cheating on him. When the smoke machine sends clouds next to an amateur moon image (with a fake tree branch in the foreground), it turns into a werewolf! His torso grows larger, he splits his shirt, and on his head grows a gigantic werewolf mask with red lights in his eyes. His pants remain intact. The mouth chews unconvincingly, although some kind of robotics (or hidden hands) in the eyebrows sometimes gives him a sinister look. <br /> <br /> Despite the poor werewolf costume, there is a lot of blood and blood, and these are quite well done. There is even a good decapitation in the film. However, when a man falls from a height, a rather poor mannequin does the job. <br /> <br /> Rich has a friend named Siodmak, who is an occult expert, and accidentally encounters a small man with bullets named Androse, who is also such an expert. They're trying to help him a bit. <br /> <br /> Rich kills people who did it badly. The policewoman investigates the murders and tries to strike at Beaton, who does not care about the lesbian scene, so nothing comes of it. <br /> <br /> Fairly cheap, but between nudity and blood and gore, and not -terrible story connecting (kind of) The most dangerous game from The Hands of Orlac and The Wolf Man is a bit funny. Available either alone or in a Scream Queens Vol. 1 box set
