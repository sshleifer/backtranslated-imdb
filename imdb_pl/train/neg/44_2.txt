I'm not sure if I mean those who described this movie as nasty or for the director ... "Devil Hunter" is certainly one weird movie of "horror". <br /> <br /> The plot is a loose, goose-down face of great films such as "Cannibal Ferox" and "Cut and Run". The chick is kidnapped in the "jungle" by the "tribe" of the "savages". The jungle looks more like a park somewhere in Mexico. The tribe is like a group of hippies who walk in tribal costumes in the style of Party City Halloween costumes. Wild boars run from white to Asian to black to Latin. I suppose Franco just caught anyone who looked a bit ethnic for that chick. <br /> <br /> What's worse, this movie has an ultra-minimal gore, no real horror and a lot of unnecessary penis. Not funny. I can find something that I like in any dingy Italian or Euro-junk movie; this one just fell WAY short. <br /> <br /> 2 in 10 children.
