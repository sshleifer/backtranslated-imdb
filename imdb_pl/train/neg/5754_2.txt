I watched the mask in the 80s and it is currently being screened at Fox Kids in the UK (very late at night). I remember thinking that it was a bit cool during the day and I also had a few toys, but watching it now bores me to tears. I never realized how boring and insipid this animated series was. It's just awful! There is no place in the same league as The Transformers, He-man or Thundercats, and almost everyone forgot about when it ceased to be created. I only watch it on Fox Kids, because Ulysses 31 appears right after this (that is, if the mask does not fall asleep at first). One of the smaller cartoons of the 80s, which I hope to completely forget after the broadcast on Fox Kids!
