The End of Violence and certainly the Million Dollar hotel suggest that Wenders lost his vision, the ability to tell fascinating stories on a moving picture map. I am afraid that the Land of Plenty seals the coffin, being a very unimaginable film, of course sentimental and clich√©. Characters are completely flat and stereotypical, writing, plot and direction are at best amateur. For the first time in a long time I could not wait for the film to end, so I could continue my life. A war-torn delirium of my uncle, a patriotic abstract staring at the sky at the end ... everything struck me, it is so simple and pathetic that it is not the work of a filmmaker who once did on the screen some irresistible magic. What happened? I am afraid that days of experimentation, perceptive writing and interesting possibilities of filming are already behind us. Let's hope he'll find inspiration again ... At the Toronto film festival, where I saw the movie, Wenders had to introduce it. Completely devoid of humility, he offered us: "I hope ... no, wait ... I know you will be happy for the next two hours." I'm afraid he could not be more wrong ...
