It was one of the most boring "horrors" I've ever seen. A college kid has an epidemic of nightmares associated with wandering spirits in Alcatraz. Trying to provide a mix of "Nightmare on Elm Street" and the standard vampire tariff in the form of a bad music video from the 80s, this movie is full of evil acting and an exhaustingly slow story. Although, being such a bad and often funny movie (dig up these dyes and horrible dialogue), it would be a good material to impersonate the Mystery Science Theater 3000. Do not be fooled by the proud mention of the film is the 1987 Silver Scroll award awarded by the Academy of Sicence Fiction, Fanatasy and Horror, or that Devo contributes to the soundtrack, or that Tony Basil is involved in the film. This is a gigantic disaster, though taking place behind the scenes (see other IMDb comments for this video).
