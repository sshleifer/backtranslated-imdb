Let's start by saying that nothing will surprise anyone who reads other comments. That being said, MY G-D, THIS FILM HAD MEAN! I mean, WOW, I did not know that you could throw as much money as they obviously did on something and still get worse than ANY movie by Roger Corman! Corman was probably rewarded with this movie at some point, but refused because of the low quality of the script! The only reason this movie was made is because someone said, "Hey, Zombies are popular. Video games are popular. What game can we get with a zombie in it? Resident Evil? No, someone else got there first. Quiet Hill? No, it's too quiet. People will never sit in a dark room just to be afraid of being stupid. Hey, does not Sega have a game where people run around shooting zombies? They are out of platform business, we could get it for pennies! <br /> <br /> Basically, they tried to make a movie that seemed to be a video game, and even shot a fight as if the characters were playing the game. <br /> <br /> The first and main problem is that the original game was terrible. I mean: <br /> <br /> bad film-merchandising-made-a-go-to-game-in-two-week-and-then-shippe d-out-and-buy-by-morons- and- their-parents-at-horror. The graphics were boring. The monsters were boring. The levels were boring. The interface was boring. CASE was boring. In other words, it was a boring game. And that was the ARCADE version. The home version was even worse! With the home version, you did not even manage to keep your rifle in your hand when you were bored by this senseless game! But digression. <br /> <br /> The second problem is that they have gone so far that during the battles they actually cut scenes from the real game. HUH ??? Did the editor not have enough certainty about the results that indicate that there was a real battle? Not to mention that ANY battle was shot from the perspective of a video game, which may explain the tedious use of Matrix-style effects. The problem is that the game was a first-person shooter (the player moves from the character's POV). Maybe that's why they put game graphics to let you know that they're referring to the game ... Racja, cokolwiek ... <br /> <br /> In any case, the only thing that made the ENTIRE experience was pleasant. it was the fact that everyone in the theater was making fun of the movie aloud, so my sudden attacks of hysterical laughter and general disbelief were treated as common and did not make me throw away. <br /> <br /> To sum up, DO NOT SEE THIS FILM! Do not even rent when it appears on the video in a few weeks. To run. Just run.
