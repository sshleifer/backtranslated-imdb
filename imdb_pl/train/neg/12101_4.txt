I saw it, I agree with it 100%, but I did not care about its delivery. He just came out as an asshole in a poorly edited, imaginary campaign of youthful smears. Editing cuts, galore etc ... The camera would be focused on it and you will see 2 or 3 cutting cuts only in a minute or two of dialogues. Add to this a permanent boom microphone in the film, which is a no-no movie. <br /> <br /> This document goes on a topic with so many angles, so many interesting stories that the movie is so easy to do.

I like it when he jumps back among people of the same religion and shows that they are totally arguing. <br /> <br /> I think he could do something more creative.

In the story of John Smith, the founder of the Mormons, who had a fairly colorful past, there could have been more. Delve into science v.s. religion. One of them is a very methodical, very rigorous process of increasing trust in the theory. It is built from a solid bottom, a new layer on a more proven layer. The huge burden of proof is required at every stage. The second one starts from the top and refutes the irrefutable claims. That's because it's good? I said yes. <br /> <br /> Did I do it right? I would say that you will turn it into the original HBO series? hit a different religion every week. <br /> <br /> It was opening eyes in one thing. I had to be blind. Good ole G.W.Bush ... no wonder he was chosen. He had a religious majority. And well ... now it's blind leading the blind. <br /> <br /> Bill Moyer ... Well ... What can I expect from a guy who hands out the Sutra on the beach?
