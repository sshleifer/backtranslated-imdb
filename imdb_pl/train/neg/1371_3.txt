I can not understand how someone can get a budget for such a bad movie. It's as if the television station desperately wanted anything, everything. They are buried under a handful of snow, electricity constantly flashes and goes out, but the background light is magically that remains constant. Where does this (false) light come from? This and all these stupid quarrels between characters. It seems that they are more interested in mutual complaining than coming up with ways to survive. He tries to create a sense of danger and help people. But because it's so bad directing and acting, you will not fix this Florence Nightingale, I'm sorry. I join the negative opinion and agree that this is one of the worst films ever.
