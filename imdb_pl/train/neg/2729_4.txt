Actress Ruth Roman in a real philanthropic gesture to help soldiers arriving and departing for the Korean War to the air base near San Francisco, launched this star Warner Bros. salute to patriotism and song. Many stars appear as a guest, while the affair of love and hate develops between the beginning star and the painfully green and thin corporal of the air force (Ron Hagerthy, who looks like he was supposed to deliver newspapers from a bike). The corporal seems to have fooled the actress and thought he was going to battle when in fact he was part of the airline's crew, flies to and from Honolulu (you'd think she'd be happy to stay away but instead act like Most children's women in the 1950s movies Doris Day lasts about thirty minutes and her obvious laughter and madness are the most enjoyable Roman is also here, looking charming, while James Cagney mocks his characters on screen and Gordon MacRae sings Jane Wyman also sings in hospital repression after leading Doris Day, causing someone to wonder, "Have they run out of sets?" For an undreamtly interesting retrospection at another time and place. Still, low rents and only the right ones technical aspects make "Starlift" the second supplier. * 1/2 of ****
