The book is so good that at least the opening of the film will bother you, but then, because it is more and more deviating from the book, removing the whole religion, love and mathematics and putting in the clich√©s of candy, it becomes boring. Still, from the comments I've heard, people who have not read the book like it, and if they read the "Wrinkle-in-time" on their child, will do their job. The most embarrassing change is making Happy Medium a clone of Uncle Albert's Mary Poppins (I love to laugh). Nothing is twisted so that the characters on the screen laugh amusingly with things that are totally unloving.
