At first glance, the Omen 4 idea was good. It is nice to see that a devilish child can be a girl. In fact, sometimes, as in exorcists, when girls are possessed or are devilish, it is very effective. But in Omen 4 it stinks. <br /> <br /> Delia does not make me think that she can be a devil child, or rather a child with problems. The issues that only the therapist may be helpful, and not the priest. It does not look terrible or devilish. It looks rather depressed and moody. <br /> <br /> This movie had potential and if it was created by the same people who created the previous three movies, he could work. But it is rather insulting to create a continuation of one of the most popular horror trilogy as a special TV movie. <br /> <br /> It's shrinking on so many levels. It looks cheap, acting is youthful, and the effects are typical of television drama. Heroes do not bring sympathy, and you do not set them. I recently watched it again after someone brought it to me for Christmas, and it was already terrifying. <br /> <br /> If you think about seeing this, I would suggest that you do not. Watch one of the others or watch the Exorcist or watch the Good Son. Just do not waste time on this drivel!
