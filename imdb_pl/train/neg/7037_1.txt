It's really a terrible movie and a waste of 2 hours of your life. At the same time it is bland and offensive, with nudity and lots of violence. However, nudity is not so exciting, and violence is repetitive and boring. In addition, the plot is at best weak, the characters are unreal and undeveloped, and acting is one of the worst I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I've heard that this movie is meant to be fun, but it is not. I did not laugh at watching or even smile. The creators of this movie tried to combine the comedy film with the action movie, but it was not possible in both cases. <br /> <br /> Some poorly made films are funny because they are so bad, but it's not one of them.
