I remember seeing a movie in summer '78 with my parents and I was very nice then. Of course I was seven years old. <br /> <br /> Just before the appearance of Jackson's films, I rented this movie with my wife because I never saw him and I felt nostalgic. <br /> <br /> Ralph Bakshi ran out of money in the middle of the animation process of this film and was forced to drastically cut this production. Because this film was made mainly from rotoscopy, animation techniques for people with limited budgets, it says something. A large part of this movie is an animation only in the very loose sense of the word. There are a few scenes that are obviously people standing in front of the screen, perhaps some animation effects overlap them. <br /> <br /> Due to budget constraints, the film - the compression of "Druży Pierścieni" and the "Two Towers" - has been further reduced. What you get is in a way a movie version of Cliff's Notes from books. <br /> <br /> However, it's not that bad, but the animation brings warmth, which was lacking in Jackson cinema. It's nice to imagine how it could be with decent funding. <br /> <br /> This video is also worth attention because of the continuation that never came. A few years later, a half-hour special television program was broadcast that was supposed to end. I will say only that it was a musical.
