This is just one of those hideous movies that can be found on Lifetime TV, which depict the repulsive behavior of some disgusting woman in an empathetic way. Along with other nasty movies such as "The Burning Bed", "Enough" or "Monster", this movie takes a disgusting criminal and tries to show the viewer why he is not so bad at the end. Give us peace! Here's my question for the filmmakers: if LeTourneau was a man, and Vili was a 12-year-old girl, would you make a picture sympathetic to that person? Answer: Hell is not. <br /> <br /> Imagine a change of gender in this movie, and then you'll see why me and others here think it's a worthless piece of rubbish. If sex changed, there would be no attempt to empathize with the criminal. Instead, we will probably be treated as a portrait of a monstrous and hideous man hunting a young girl, his lustful behavior that lands in jail, and his brainwashed victim suffering from the Stockholm syndrome. The only reason LeTourneau does not receive the same treatment in this film is her gender. <br /> <br /> Let's call the spades for the shovel. LeTourneau is a pedophile. Plain and simple. No if, and or so. She is a criminal who belongs to a prison and deserves our mockery and contempt, but certainly not our pity or empathy.
