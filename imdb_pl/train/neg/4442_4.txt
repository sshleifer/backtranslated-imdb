I do not know ... maybe because I'm Brazilian, but it was all too much. Too much love for music, too many events, too much contrast between the nice life of the main characters (well, this is not so sad) and the aspect of the city shown by the director. Everything seems to me too false: families, relationships, music, "happiness." It simply sells some of the taste of fake Latin American culture. I have to be honest: it seduces me a little, but who would not be seduced by a false life made of nice music, sex and parties? I am not so stupid: what is the world in which people do not suffer from diarrhea, deep sadness and sexually transmitted diseases? I liked the scene with Caridad's mother's phone and discussion about the contract with all musicians and Spaniards.
