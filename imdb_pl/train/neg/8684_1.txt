Abysmal with a large "A". It must be one of, if not the most unpopular, television program at the moment. I am just as against the bushes as possible, but this performance does not even laugh. What you think is Bush as president has absolutely nothing to do with whether you like this piece of nonsense. "Jokes" are not funny at all. For example, in a scene in which the lil bush has its underwear on its head: "Welcome to the al-qa-eeda camp!". Nothing strange. Is this supposed to be a joke? The commercials that were shown in the weeks preceding the performance, mesmerizing, were funnier than the concert itself, and it's just sad. I hope it will not be included even in the second season. He should not even have the first one.
