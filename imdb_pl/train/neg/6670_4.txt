This movie really started great. It had the potential to transform into a truly heart-rending romantic love story with pictures that recorded the love between "Harlan" and Tobe in long, poetic and idyllic scenes. It really did not have to be more than just a moment, and for a moment I became excited that someone was finally making a beautiful movie for themselves, another timeless classic, maybe a modern myth. Why, oh, why, spoil it halfway, making the main character (Norton) the next psycho? Maybe I miss a point, but do we really need another movie about psychos? Does this need in Hollywood present a sick aspect of human nature, indicating a more general malaise in the film industry? For a moment, I was going to write down the director's name; now I remain indifferent. At least in the defense of the film should be added that all actors seemed to invest in their roles. Besides, Evan Rachel Wood is really beautiful and she is a good actress with great potential.
