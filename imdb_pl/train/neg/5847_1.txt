I love the quality of crapness, and this is one of the best. CG is beyond the world, or at least it precedes our world, and the madness of a six-foot man in the costume of a rat chasing people is ridiculously bad. I liked it a lot, but acting is so damned horrible, and even a mandatory nude scene has nothing good about it. just a complete waste of time if I ever see her. I do not know who lost more time, I watch it, or the poor sapci who were drawn into it, hoping they would start their acting career. I can assure you, it will not be. However, in a brighter tone, I managed to successfully perform Kevin Bacon's 6 steps from this film, so I think it was worth watching his 91 minutes.
