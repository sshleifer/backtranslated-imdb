The deceptive cover, the title and the very small hidden Power of Prayer print made me borrow this movie. <br /> <br /> It started really well and drew me. I really liked it. Between 1/3 and 3/4 of the movie, the film began to throw things that were not set and did not make sense. My first thought was: "This is not written by someone who knows how to tell a story." I ended up watching parts of the movie again, thinking that I missed something. <br /> <br /> Before I reached the last 1/5 of the film, everything was BORING, ANNOYING, RELIGION THUMPING DIALOG did not make sense, said nothing and was nervous to listen; I turned off the sound and made quick progress to the end. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time on this movie. <br /> <br /> Watch out for DVD marked Whitlow Films and Level Path Productions. <br /> <br /> And I am a practicing Catholic.
