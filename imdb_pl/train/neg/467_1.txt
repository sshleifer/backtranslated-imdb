There are bad movies, horrible movies, even boring movies ... I can watch the majority and expose it to the end, not this time. Avoid it like a plague, irritating music all the time, terrible editing, no comedy, its better than an innovative mug ... My maiden wanted to watch this thinking that it would be a legal blonde material or a kind of watch, but never better than average chick. For the first time she begged me to press the stop button. <br /> <br /> Girls, well, they were not too good to start with (Denise did OK at Starship Troopers and Wild things), but you fell to gravel. I feel like a mug that spent 30 minutes on it ... Pamela Anderson is almost unrecognizable after many construction works on her face. <br /> <br /> Please, take my advice, if you want to avoid wasting valuable oxygen cells and brain ranting on the complete mince that is on your screen.
