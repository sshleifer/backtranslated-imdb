Bela Lugosi is a bad botanist who sends fianc√© orchids on his wedding day, steals the body in his fake ambulance / caravan and takes him home so that his dwarf assistant will separate the glandular juices to keep Bela's wife forever young. Some second-degree actors playing detectives are trying to solve a horrible, terrible secret. Bela Lugosi prepares it well, but you could say he needed money. <br /> <br /> This movie is awful, and most actors would prefer to stick to the tables, but the plot is wonderfully funny. Tell everyone what's happening in it, and they often laugh and demand a movie. I have a DVD in a 2-pound discount store, which I think is a fairly accurate quote, anyone who paid for it would not mind.
