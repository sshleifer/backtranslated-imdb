I now hired this movie because it was Brad Dourif. He is a great actor, BRILLIANT in everything ... except this movie. And I think it's only because he realized how stupid this movie was and did not bother with a good performance. This movie is an unintentional comedy. Some lines just break me down. And there are some lines that do not make sense and it seems that Tobe Hooper simply throws lines without thinking about the story. ABOUT! BTW the plot is BAD! But this is one of those movies where TAHT BAD is really WRONG to watch. I recommend it only for fans of BIG Brad Dourif or fans of other actors, because the plot is pathetic.
