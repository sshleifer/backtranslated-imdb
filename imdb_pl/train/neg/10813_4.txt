The first half of this version was the best I've seen (and I think I've seen all versions of Jane Eyre ever made). The development of Jane's childhood and character was unique. Then it was as if someone said, "Uh, oh, it works too long" and hacked the rest of the story into shreds. The main scenes, if they are switched on at all, are flipped, combined and turned off in such a way that they completely change the story. There were so few changes and even the development of the scene that it would be difficult for someone who is not familiar with the story to follow her. It was a great disappointment that the beginning opened so much hope, and then the end stopped him.
