Do not be impressed by other reviewers that this film stinks because it is ambivalent to the Japanese whaling industry (which, morally, is not inferior to the American meat trade or Scottish haggis cull), stinks because it's pretentious tosh, a kind of stubborn guff that makes contemporary art evil. He said there are great pictures, but the average bus ride provides stunning images if you do not use your imagination, so there is no reason to go and see this nonsense. What happens in the movie happens very slowly and is often accompanied by a soundtrack that sounds like a gutted cat, and then when you think it's finished, it starts again. I saw it at the porn cinema in Rome, which was rented for the weekend to show Barney's film work, which is an admirable and clever way to regain what once was a local flapite from the dirty-old-human-macaw brigade, but if fashionable young things and slightly older fans of Bjork, who stroke their beard, would be honest, everyone could have a lot more fun if they just showed one of the porn!
