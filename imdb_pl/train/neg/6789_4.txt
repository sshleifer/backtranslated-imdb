The plot of the film rests in one important point: that this murderer was also a responsible, loving, caring father. Not that being a father and a murderer is impossible. But this man is murdered by a teenager without provocation, reason and emotion. This girl was somebody's daughter. I do not think that a father who cared so much for his own daughter could be as cold as for someone else's daughter. Or, alternatively, he could be so cold and yet worry about his daughter and take care of her. And the idea that the convicted murderer would actually ask the parents of his victim to take over and take care of his daughter is unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Having said that, the actors acted with conviction. I thought that changing the color of Scott Bakul's eyes would make it colder and more threatening than usual. You did not see his eyes at all.
