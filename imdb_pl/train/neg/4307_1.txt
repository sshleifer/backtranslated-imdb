It looks like it's going to be a thriller for a movie that's almost funny. This prompted me to say "Oh my God!" More than once on complex plot ideas that were simply stupid. <br /> <br /> Fancy or absurd places just because of novelty or a dramatic situation and unlikely, almost impossible, human reactions and circumstances are too great to understand why they exist. <br /> <br /> If you have time and want to discover how bad the picture can be, you will want to see it. Otherwise, take some time to see dry paint to get a more productive investment of time! <br /> <br /> (That the movie released in 2003 is already shown on TV in July 2003, may indicate the quality of the film)
