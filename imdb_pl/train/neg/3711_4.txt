I did not see the movie trailer when I went to see the movie, instead I based my judgments on the friend's opinions. Now I like Chris Rock and his comedy, but this movie just falls on your face. <br /> <br /> During the film Rock delivers some funny jokes, but unfortunately the movie is very poor in comedy. The film seems to want to integrate both laughter and love into one, and it fails. The love story in the film is simple (thankfully), but it's too negative for the movie, making Rock serious and bland. After all, the film is primarily to be a comedy in which laughter should be the most important. Not much of that in the movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is also quite uninteresting. Some parts were completely discontinuous. If the supporting cast was to be fun, they certainly did not do a good job. A pair of angels from heaven tried to make jokes that were dry and boring. The first pair of Rock incarnations was also bland. If there is one thing they did well, they made Rock seem more playful in comparison.
