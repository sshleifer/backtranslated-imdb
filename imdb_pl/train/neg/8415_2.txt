It was longer than the combination of the Ten Commandments, All Lord of the Rings and Matrix Trilogy. My oh, what a nightmare. This is the only biggest noise in 2006. This is not a moment that is not scripted and trivial. Film music can be done brilliantly and bring real emotions to the viewer. Dreamgirls follow the path of Chinese water torture, in the form of endless music montages, tacky acting and poor directors' choices (Seriously, Mr. Condon, you MUST take old Billboard countdown pictures? It's at # 58! Do not wait, look how it rises up in the charts and here is the Billboard relay to show you again .... and again .... and again)
