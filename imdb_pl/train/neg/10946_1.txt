"This" Malcom "program on FOX really kills ... we can not make our own version? Of course, I speculate and paraphrase, but in our hearts we all know that this is true, and the only thing that NBC added to the "Malcom" record was sex. And, boy, did you add sex ... <br /> <br /> Thirteen-year-old Tucker gets a boner and covers it with his skateboard. Tucker accidentally enters his aunt in the shower and accuses him of watching her and beating her. She spies a beautiful girl in a neighboring house from the window of her bedroom and knows she wants to see her topless, but teases him, smiling and closing the window. And that's all in the pilot. <br /> <br /> Take it from an adult man - the boy's maturation is so crazy and driven by the nucleus that it is not possible that it would be fun for the mainstream audience. The only moments in which anyone has ever approached are movies and can be counted on one side. No wonder that "Tucker" has the warmth and attractiveness of a bathroom in a strip club. Did the network really think that we would like to watch children struggling with puberty? Is not that what people go to jail for? If you doubt that the depravity of the series takes into account: 13 episodes have been filmed, but NBC canceled after the broadcast of 4 episodes; then they made an unprecedented movement of "burning" the remaining episodes, issuing them in the NORTH so that no children could see them. Ironic because children were originally a target group. <br /> <br /> In addition to the general buzz, Tucker has a working lector from the main character to improve tacky writing. Even in 2000. It was terribly outdated, with random music ska and super-sarcasm. I could not like any of the characters to laugh at jokes, and jokes did not come even for a mile ... Shame on NBC for this dirty stripping ... they're better than this. <br /> <br /> GRADE: C-
