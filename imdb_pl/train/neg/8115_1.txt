This movie was the most horrible experience of watching movies I ever had to endure, and worse, I had to watch it and I did not have a chance to stop it because it was for school! Admittedly, the plot was decent ... but I think acting is awful! The exception was Marianne Jean-Baptiste, I thought her performance was great. She was the only attraction, I doubt if I would be able to stand watching the movie. Every time I hear someone say "daarling", I'm embarrassed! Recently I attacked the client because they said "it". It reminded me of one of the worst hours and a half of my life! <br /> <br /> (sorry if it offended someone, I only express my opinion)
