I read the book Celestine Prophecy and I was looking forward to watching the movie. Remember that the movie is loosely based on the book. Many of the most interesting points of the book do not even go out of the movie. That's the movie "B" at best. Many events, characters, the way in which the character interacts and meet in the book are simply changed or do not occur. The flow of events that are very fluid in the book are uncertain and fueled by a view as if you were a child. Character development is very weak. Personality characters are different from those in the book. The direction is similar to the horrifying horror movie "B". I understand that presenting everything in the book would take six hours in the movie, but the on-screen game base overlooked many points. The staff was very good.
