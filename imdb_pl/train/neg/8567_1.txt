When I rented this movie, I had very low expectations ...... but when I saw it, I realized that the movie was smaller (much less) than I expected. The actors were angry (the wife of the doctor was one of the worst), the story was so stupid ... could work in the Disney movie (except for murders), but this is not a comedy, it's a funny masterpiece of stupidity. The title is well chosen, except for one thing: they can add a stupid movie after Dead Husbands! I give him 0 and a half out of 5.
