Chances are that if I looked at it again, I could be physically sick, the movie is so irritating ... unless you believe in the psyche, reincarnation and other hocuses that promote a great time. "The re-circulation of souls," they call it here. Puh-Leeza. <br /> <br /> This story has been made several times before with such films as "Heaven Can Wait". It was also done much better. It is a pity that they had to waste the talents of Robert Downey Jr., Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson. <br /> <br /> At least it is quite a tame movie, in language. This is the only salutary quality of this film.
