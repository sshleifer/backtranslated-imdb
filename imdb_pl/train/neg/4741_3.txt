Wendy Wu: The Homecoming Warrior has a very good, strong storyline, but is ruined by shoddy details throughout the film. I am a younger teenager and I did not like this movie. I thought the effects were terrible, but they may seem to be fun for younger children. The Matrix moves ruining the action, you know it was absolutely fake. Then there was Yen Lo, an evil spirit who temporarily had random people and a return home in which Wendy tried to win. Everything ends like a typical good movie when Wendy and her buddhist monk Shen cousin overcome Jen Lo (and destroy him forever) in the end. So Wendy is learning a lesson ... blah, blah, blah. I am ready for the next DCOM.
