I just realized that watching this movie, I lost valuable, precious moments of my life, to which I will never come back. This movie is not simply bad. It reminded me of every stereotypical black sitcom ever made. <br /> <br /> I regret watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Flixmedia thinks it's a matter of race, apparently "white" people do not like it because there are no white actors. Mate, I think you'll find a reason why nobody liked it, because watching dry paint is much more fun and fun than the pile of drivelas. <br /> <br /> Stop making movies with nonsense
