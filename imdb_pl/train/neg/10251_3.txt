A lot of running. A poorly conceived opponent with very little complexity. A scientist who works in communication that sends signals into space and receives them, is caught by aliens. Together with his beautiful wife, he invades their territory and gives them secrets. In this process, she becomes rather treacherous. Of course, there is not much choice anyway. There is a scene in which he gives them everything they want. It's a boring movie with many long episodes where little is happening. The plot is not technically bad. We usually just follow the car, travel through the forest, examine the building. This is the edition. I suppose that history could not technically support much more. Not much here.
