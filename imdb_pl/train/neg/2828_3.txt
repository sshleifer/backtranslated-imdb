It seems that in the 1970s many such films were made. And the fact that I can not recall the title of one of them is a measure of their influence. Here's what the novels would say "pot boilers". They are nothing more than a vehicle that keeps movie stars in the eyes of the public. <br /> <br /> We have Michael Caine, Peter Ustinov, Omar Sharif, Rex Harrison and William Holden; more than enough names to get to the cinema. Every taste of the hero is satisfied. Although you can suspect that most of the audience is still disappointed. <br /> <br /> Their talents are simply thrown away and I wonder if celebrities with such a large amount of money and reputation can still be so desperate or deprived of sense. This type of film hardly adds a gilding to your CV. Sometimes, maybe the actors should choose the director instead of the other way around. <br /> <br /> It was pretty obvious that it would be nonsense from the very beginning. This absurdly unmatched jazz-jazz music, which also permeated each time when random noise is needed, had Winda Muzak's climatic conviction. Who imagined he was hiring a jazz band when the scene depicts the steamy jungles of central Africa or the endless Sahara with camels and palm trees in the background? Definitely serious stupidity. Ennio Morricone would know what to do; and his results would have been sufficiently filled with atmosphere and tension to raise my rating for a good two points. This director should take the trouble to look at the "Lawrence of Arabia" and even the westerns of Sergio Leone; he could learn a few things. But on the other hand, he probably would not do it. <br /> <br /> Alfred Hitchcock played the theme of disappearing wife with a good result in his film "Frantic". He was later transformed with equal impetus, staring at Harrison Ford. In any case, the confusion around her loss and the chase tension were tangible. Here, when Michael Caine might be forced to use a little bit of mind and bravado, Rex Harrison jumped from a non-existent place, like some cunning old geniuses, to get him back on track when the narrative stumbled. <br /> <br /> At least the photography was rather good, with the perfect use of often beautiful surroundings. But then this stupid music has to get bloated and hit the atoms, which created this little atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The action scenes were also invented and slim, with such ineptly choreographic sequences of struggle that could be exposed in the first place - a year's theater class. And of course players have to fight for jazz accompaniment - just like you. <br /> <br /> And this is more or less the comment that this item deserves. Besides that the script was also quite miserable. <br /> <br /> Stick to this hobby. Even if it included your favorite movie stars, you will definitely be disappointed.
