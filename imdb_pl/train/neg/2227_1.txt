Every now and then someone looks at me sideways and asks "What about SNITCH'D"? I know straight away that they have a case of barely hidden entertainment + horror. You see, I was the cinematographer for the film. <br /> <br /> Let me explain a few things about this "interesting life experience". <br /> <br /> Originally SNITCH'D was called ONE HARD HIT. I met James Cahill in July 1999, the day after I packed TRIANGLE SQUARE, a great, small, 35-millimeter feature that, like many independent films from the era, has never been widespread despite festival awards ... it has been eternal the victim of the SAG fine print, a notorious contract for an experimental function. But digress ... <br /> <br /> I thought I was spinning, and when James asked me to shoot his little gangster in 16 mm with a shooting budget of about $ 25,000, not wanting to break the pace, he took it. Finally, CLERKS, EL MARIACHI ... I also believed in this myth then. <br /> <br /> Let's just describe it as a "film school" for many involved, including me. SNITCH'D was filmed in two weeks in August 1999 in Aliso Viejo and Santa Ana, California. Cahill taught drama in high school in the second city (yes, he is a teacher of drama and English ... consider this when watching a movie, and even observing the use of an apostrophe in the title), hence the location and cast. /> <br /> Note in his cast is the only known dramatic performance of the weather girl Channel 2 Morning News from Los Angeles, Very Jimenez, and more influence, the debut of Eva Longoria, who just arrived in Hollywood and was eager to have a film under the belt. I must say that her professional dedication, focus and attitude "let's do it" made me inspired and was heralding her fame - soon. <br /> <br /> SNITCH'D suffered from poor optics, small amounts of lights or electricity, several du jour boom operators, and unadjusted offline delivery for replication. None of this will override the actual content that speaks for itself. <br /> <br /> In any case, until 2003 the film was sold to distributors (with net loss, I understand), which inexplicably did not have Eva's photos on the box (up to now it was a rising, working name), but she managed to get a clear photo of an authentic Latino gangster to authenticate SNITCH'D. Because Cahill's other passion is the antiquarian book, he seems to confirm that he believes that you can actually evaluate the book by its cover ... because many of them chose the DVD based on his sleeve. ----------------- A year later, Eva, now on the soap, and I met James, to one day shoot a simple short movie that he came up with, SPLIT SECOND, which I think that he never saw any art despite the festival's intentions. <br /> <br /> Six years later I was hired to make another Cahill movie titled JUAREZ in Mexico. I thought he developed this process; my participation depended on the casting, scenario and crew control, and the resulting movie did look promising in the dailies because it was ... a cheap crime story about the mass murder of the Juarez girls; despite the claims here and elsewhere, the film NEVER appeared at any festival or venue, although Cahill repeatedly said that the film has distribution and just waited for the release that coincides with the release of the DVD two studio shots on the same subject, VIRGIN OF JUAREZ and THE CITY OF BORDERS.
