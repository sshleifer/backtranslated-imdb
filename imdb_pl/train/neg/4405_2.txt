I can only say that before watching the movie, I did not have an indication of who Annemarie Schwarzenbach was or what her life story was ... and I must admit that the movie was not able to help me get to that data ... and even that did not work out. convince me to conduct some research by entering a few words on the google website; however, I can only say that the actress Jeanette Hain was great in her silent facial expression, which really played well and showed deep depression, just like in reality. <br /> <br /> In the end, based on the scenario of the film occurred in Turkey and Tehran, as well as in Afghanistan .. but believe me, I'm familiar with this area, it was about the Arabian desert in Morocco .. Turks and Persian people are completely different in terms of face and culture than in a language that is not an Arabic language ... <br /> <br /> I suppose that I will make a film like this one - a documentary - a thorough examination of all these small elements is obligatory.
