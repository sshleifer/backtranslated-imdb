VERY BAD FILM ........ and I mean VERY BAD ... This plot is predictable, and EALLY cheesy, battle creativity and dance scenes at this time is the only reason why I did not give the film one, apart from that ... this is a movie that you can not afford to watch ... I feel when watching a movie, the idea behind this movie was an interesting, even a kind of banal. .. bump blah blah blah blah blah, but I feel that it could be at least a little better if it was not so bad, very poorly presented from the idea to the screen, I think so. The plot is predictable sometimes, although the dance can be said in TIMES, it's pretty good, the break dance was good ... IF you just shoot a movie and watch dance scenes and create your own dialogue maybe it can be 5 ... lol
