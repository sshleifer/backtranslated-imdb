How could I know that it was a "stupid promotion" of "Lordi Motion Picture"? I mean, I realized when the "dinosaur" costume appeared, and before the lead singer appeared, I was humming "Hard Rock Hallelujah" ... though I hate this song. "Dark Floors" is about a young autistic girl who is in the process of escaping from the hospital by her protective father, when they and the rest of the people in this particular elevator are imprisoned for a while ... When they arrive on their floor there is a surprise that there is no one else around. The hospital is empty ... With the exception of various monsters that seem to be haunting them for no apparent reason ... They run through corridors and stairwells, meeting all members of the heavy metal band in their bizarre shock-rock costumes ... Nothing really falls into memory, except for bad acting, no gore / nakedness and absolutely shameless promotion advantage, reminding me very much about "KISS Meet the Phantom of the Park". Yes, remember this dud? It is a pity that I do not ... I just recommend avoiding all Ghost House movies like mushrooms, and not listening to Lordi, because it's the band rip ripoff!
