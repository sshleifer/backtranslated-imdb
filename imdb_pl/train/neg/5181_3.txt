This is the first Horrorfest movie I've watched and after I almost think I do not have to watch others. I was told that this is a "thinking horror movie" and I must say that if it would make me think that it was flashing, I wonder what the splatter / gore movies would look like. Do not get me wrong, even the top of this movie is not worth living. <br /> <br /> The plot is very washed up with too much art for art. Camera effects and music are out of place most of the time, and the characters are trivial, at least. Some characters and scenes seem to be worthless when they start revealing some of the "The Hamiltons" hooks. I learned who Lenny was about half an hour when I understood the movie. I was so excited and confused by Lenny that I felt completely cheated. I was expecting what I got, but they could go a lot further, in fact all the blood falls completely flat. In movies such as "Hostel" and "Saw", you need to play a little better in a movie "considered graphic or too disturbing for the audience".
