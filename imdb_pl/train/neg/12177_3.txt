Since the 1970s, writer / producer / director Charles Band is responsible for literally hundreds of science fiction, fantasy and horror films. Some of them are great examples of using a small budget for maximum effect; many of them are very bad. Trancers (1985) was one of those rare gems. <br /> <br /> A Terminator-style tale about time travel and action. Whistler, who travels into the past, inhabiting the ancestor's body. Whistler is able to control other people using his psychic powers, transforming them into obedient zombies ("trances" of the title), and trying to change the course of history, killing the ancestors of the leaders of the future. Jack follows him until 1985, determined to stop him. <br /> <br /> In this sequel in 1991, Jack is still alive in 1985. After destroying Whistler, he settled down and married Leena (Helen Hunt), a young woman who helped him succeed in the first movie. But for Jack, things do not stay calm for a long time, and trouble appears in the form of Brother Whistler, E.D. Wardo, who is trying to build an army of trancer. <br /> <br /> Trancers II does not have the charm and simplicity of the original and is a huge disappointment considering how good the original was. The story is difficult to capture if you have not seen the first movie (or at least not for long), and there are plenty of impressive action and some weak special effects. Gone ingenuity and wit that made Trancers so funny; instead, we get some bad links and a script that seems to have been written on the fly. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can recommend this movie to fans of the genre is a cast that can boast of many names that will be familiar to science fiction and horror fans: Jeffrey Combs, Barbara Crampton, Richard Lynch, Martine Beswicke . Unfortunately, most of them seemed to have a "day off" when filming Trancers II, and performances are mediocre at best. <br /> <br /> The Trancers series obviously has their fans; four sequels have been recreated. If quality does not go up, I can not imagine it would be good.
