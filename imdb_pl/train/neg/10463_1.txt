This film was so promising. I was very excited about this movie. In the end it was funny at best, at worst painful. Acting styles included a range from really, really flat (angels, wife and daughter) to excessively animated (Casper's character). I felt that the dialogue was just an attempt to convey information to the audience, not real people who are trying to talk to each other. Pay special attention to the "error" scene. This is an insult to the ability of recipients to invent things. However, in defense of this scene he has the biggest laugh from the whole movie. I read that they spent a lot of money traveling to various places abroad. It is a pity they did not use it. I did not feel like I was moved to exotic places. Everyone could put footage from the Colosseum in Rome. However, to finish positively, I thought the sets were quite good. I really liked the graphics displayed on decoding computers. In my opinion (and it is all) that if the SCHMALTZ factor would be significantly lower and the ACTION factor would be much larger, this movie would be good.
