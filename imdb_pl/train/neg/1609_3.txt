The first part, Che in Cuba, concerns this part of his life. It contains too many undefined battles and Che services for too many indecisive wounded (remember that Che was a doctor). It ends when Castro wins the revolution; Che never reaches Havana. The second part, Che in Bolivia, is about guessing. It contains too many indistinct battles and Che serving too many indistinct injuries. <br /> <br /> When I realized it was supposed to be an "epic" (I never knew * anything *, but the title before it started), Naturally I thought of the greatest epic of them all, Lawrence of Arabia David Lean ' and. More about that later. <br /> <br /> Not to be a racist, but beyond what I have already mentioned, there is the fact that there are too many characters that are, well, indistinguishable - unknown Latin actors who look similar, especially considering that everyone wears Che's beards and they all wear Che's uniforms. The result is that the viewer is unable to identify with anyone other than Che, Benicio del Toro (even Fidel has a very small role). While del Toro is wonderful, think of "Lawrence" with Peter O'Toole as the only visible character: without Alec Guinness, without Omar Sharif, without Anthony Quinn, etc. You have an idea. <br /> <br /> Because the other characters are interchangeable, which causes the reference to be lost. When Che's top advisors are killed, you do not feel remorse because you do not know who they are. Even when Che is killed (I do not think it's a spoiler), there is no empathy on the part of the audience - he just got killed. <br /> <br /> It's too one-dimensional to refer to a human being. Besides being a revolutionary and giving way only to Jesus in moral righteousness, the only thing we find out about Che is that he is married and has five children (says another figure that he is at the end). What was his motivation? Full enigma. <br /> <br /> Maybe Soderbergh deliberately jumps on Lean. Like Che Soderbergh, Lean never tells us anything about Lawrence, a mysterious man from Arabia. But at least Lawrence had a friend (Sharif) and coworkers (Guinness, Quinn). He was as brave as he was uncertain - i.e. He had human qualities. Che is like a machine, as warm as a Terminator. <br /> <br /> There was another epic war at the beginning of this year, Mongol. Che makes Mongol look like This Wonderful Life.
