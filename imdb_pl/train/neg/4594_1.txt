I had many problems with this movie. <br /> <br /> Includes some basic information about quantum mechanics, which is fine. Although quantum physics has been around for over 50 years, the film presents this information in an impressive way that seems to say, "Are you not just amazed!" Well, not really. These are no longer shocking discoveries of the earth. In any case, I was already familiar with quantum theory, and the fact that particles must be described by means of wave equations, etc., is not new. <br /> <br /> The main problem I have with this movie is the way these people use quantum theory as a way to provide the scientific basis for mysticism and spiritualism. I have no serious problem with mysticism and spiritualism, but quantum mechanics has nothing to do with these things and should be separated. The people they talked to in this film begin with the idea of ​​quantum theory and then jump over to say that just thinking about something, you can change the matter around you, that's why we should think positively to have a positive impact on the world and improve our lives . Reasoning is totally ridiculous, and conclusions do not logically follow from quantum theory. For every so-called "expert" with whom they conducted interviews in this film, there are dozens of theoretically physicists who would not completely agree. They draw attention, quite rightly, that the unpredictability of the subatomic world does not support the mystical notions of our spiritual bond. <br /> <br /> It disturbs me that people will see this movie and eat it completely because it leaves it with a nice positive feeling. The main theme of the film is based on a total misinterpretation of quantum theory and is as bad in its reasoning as any attempt to justify an organized religion with similar pseudo-scientific arguments. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie. <br /> <br /> Oh yes. At one point, one of the "experts" says that throughout history most of the assumptions that people made about the world turned out to be false, so the assumptions we currently hold about the world are likely to be false. What? It does not happen completely. And even if it did, I do not understand how it helps his argument. That is, if his ideas have ever become commonplace, I think we would have to assume that they are also false, based on their own reasoning.
