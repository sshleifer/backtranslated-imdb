I was so excited and excited about watching this movie when the first promotions were released in November! It looked great and the songs! I was very disappointed when I went to watch it! This is a film that interweaves 6 pairs. It has a staff of 12 people! A huge number of stars have worked on this film. I think that the director, Nikhil Advani, did not handle the situation well and should not have many people in this film, because that would make it easier for him. Compared with the director Nikhil Debut "Kal Ho Naa Ho", "Salaam-e-Ishq" falls quite far. I think Nikhil should have fewer stars. I think the best factors of this movie are songs! The songs are great and I think all songs are amazing, Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy did a great job and did an excellent job over the years. I think the ratings of this movie may increase due to excellent songs! One thing that disappointed me is that the director should not include nudity for the movie, which is performed by Sohail Khan and Isha Koppikar. I consider it very naughty to watch this with my family! Although some may consider this naked as a comedy, this is not something that you would like to see with your parents! I think that Salman and Priyanka made the best acting. I think it's a good movie!
