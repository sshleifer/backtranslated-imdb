First of all, Jenna Jameson is the best actress in this movie, and she is just awful. This movie has all the terrifying phrases in the imagination and everything is badly played. Sexy teenager. Comical (un) horny jockey. A sad, cool chick. A creepy local guy. Parental type pair. A virgin chick that never really dies in these movies. Dialogue is so painfully horrible and supplied with the depth of a wading pool. It's almost as if you want everyone to die early. I recently saw a rough piece of the movie, but it somehow got worse. Sure, the funniest thing is ghoul trying to eat Jameson's implants, but he does not even assess the hire of this dog. Avoid at all costs.
