And how many actors can defend their own neurotic, compulsive and New York personalities? In this film, Woody plays Will Ferrell in what is fortunately a less direct personification than Kenneth Branagh in "Celebrity." This is an annoyingly recurring story: a nebbishy, ​​neurotic man with a wife or girlfriend falls in love madly at the queen of shiksa, where he designs all perfection. Everyone lives in excellent giant apartments in the great districts of Manhattan, everyone is constantly patronizing expensive, exclusive restaurants, where all characters tell fascinating anecdotes and discuss secret philosophy, there is always a trip to Hamptons, during which the main character blames the sand and physical exercise and nebbishy eventual exposure to illnesses, and then of course the main character feels guilty because of his lust for the queen shiksa, but still chases her, sometimes she succeeds, sometimes fails etc. <br /> <br /> It's a tired formula and evidence, that Allen is not a great film artist at all. He just looks like a dirty old man with libido and the emotions of a twenty-year-old who still wants to repeat the same boring stories.
