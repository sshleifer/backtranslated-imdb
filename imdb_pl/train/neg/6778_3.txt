Ojej, ojej ... <br /> <br /> For JM fans it was a nail to the coffin when it comes to her Hollywood career. After constant turns in Girl Can not Help It, Wayward Bus, The Burglar and Rock Hunter, it seemed that Jayne was on the right track to become one of the hottest stars in Tinsel Town. However, the obsession with publicity and appearance in the cluster made Mansfield off the beaten track, namely cheap loans for Euro, until Fox could not resign from the contract at the earliest opportunity. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a devilish waste of everyone's time, with the exception of Suzy Parker, which is the only thing in this movie bad enough for this material. Many people blame the poor Jayne and her snide performance for the poor returns of this movie at the box office, and while she is suffering in this film, she can do everything in her power with this material. After all, Cary hardly burns, right? After a handful of very good dramas and comedies, Jayne takes 10 steps back in her serious actress, agreeing (just because she appears with Grant) to portray this squeaky, idiotic threat. Her character Alice is a complete cartoon bimbo and although she looks good enough to eat in a boiler suit, her every appearance in the movie arouses nerves. We all know that Jayne can do much better than this slag, but here he parades like a pudding with prizes. A real shame. <br /> <br /> Avoid this so-called comedy. It's more depressing than fun.
