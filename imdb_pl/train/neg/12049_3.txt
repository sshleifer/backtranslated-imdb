The box for "To Die For" drew me in - without a shirt hunky guy and a promise of laughter and sex. There was plenty of Thomas Arkli (Simon) who is easy in the eyes, but without laughter and little sex appeal. <br /> <br /> The couple, Mark and Simon, have been reportedly together for several years, but none of the characters is interesting enough to care for, so it's hard to imagine that they care about each other. The error seems to lie in the scenario, not in the performances; both actors do what they can with what they receive. <br /> <br /> The ending is breathy and has no effect (well, not totally unmoved, I felt relieved that it was over). <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a movie about homosexual unions and AIDS, which is funny, "Breaking up the looks" is much better.
