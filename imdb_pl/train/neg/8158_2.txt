What is the point in creating sequels that have no meaning for the original movie? No sense. That's why Prom Night sequels are so embarrassingly bad. <br /> <br /> The original film brought a group of children hiding a dark secret that ultimately led them to kill everyone in a brutal act of revenge. Can anyone explain to me what the dead prom queen is rising from the grave to steel, and the crown is related to the first film? Prom Night 2 had continuous holes in the storyline, which constantly wondered the audience, how it came about and why did it happen? But in the end, it seems to me that you can call it one of those movies that are so bad that you finally laugh.
