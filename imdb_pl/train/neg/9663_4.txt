How cynical are the writers. I can be an American citizen, but I do not have to watch other Americans slap their backs for an hour and a half to enjoy the movie. I am amazed that so few commented on how jingoistic, sentimental and trivial is the dialogue in this film. Historical film inaccuracies are not as disgusting and offensive as in "U-571" (which turns British submarines into US), but you still leave feeling a little slimy. Really, the Germans in this movie do nothing but admire the Americans between the scenes of battles! How sad, unnecessary! I would just like to tell the writers: for many of us it is obvious that you can not capture real people, with real problems, under real pressure, and that you have taken very well tested abbreviations. Fortunately, there will always be nationalist walnuts for you to appreciate your tripe with sugar.
