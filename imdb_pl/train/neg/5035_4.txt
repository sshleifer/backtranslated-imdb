Melissa's sixteenth birthday is just around the corner, and she is just discovering her sexuality with the boys. But it turns out that all the guys with whom he spends his time are murdering with all their strength in this generic film from the 80's. The task of the local sheriff of the city of Dana Burke (Bo Hopkins, Dziki Bunch) and his irritating, loving secret, good-natured daughter, Marcia (Dana Kimmell, Friday 13 part 3), is to get to the bottom of these killings. <br /> <br /> This film focuses more on the aspects of film mystery and melodrama, and less on the killings themselves, and thus is able to differentiate themselves from many of his Slasher brothers from the 80's. It does not hurt that Alesia has a wonderful body (I feel the need to emphasize the obvious, stating that the actress is over 18 years old and thus I convey that I am not overly deviant). On the other hand, the movie is hampered by a few feature points that are underdeveloped and unnecessary, and some of them are too often used, and the ending is anti-climatic. But good prevails over the bad (barely). Give it a rent, but I would not buy it. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Aleisa Shirley shows her tits, bush and ass <br /> <br /> My class: C <br /> <br /> Code Red DVD Extras: Intro by star Aleisa Shirley and director of Intruder, Scott Spiegel; Both the cut and theatrical version of the director's film; Audio conversation with star Shirley and director Jim Sotos; interview with Shirley, Sotos and Bo Hopkins; still gallery; theater trailer for this film; and trailers of Nightmare, Stunt Rock, Rituals and Balalaika Conspiracy
