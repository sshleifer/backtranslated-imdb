Pathetic. This happens when the director comes to work just because someone pays him. <br /> <br /> The intentions were good, great locations and settings for the film of epic proportions. But performance, damn it! I swear, in some photos you can see accessories on the background staring at the camera or looking at the actors, because no one told them what they should do when they hear "Action!". Battle scenes are so bad that you are wondering - are these people really? They could do more damage by squeezing each other. In slow scenes you can see people on the battlefield walking or just standing, waving their hands. <br /> <br /> Only the action in the foreground is somehow underlined. But for what? History is so illogical and discontinuous that it seems to be accidental situations in chronological order, sometimes not even so. Dialogues are stupid, the plot of love is more embarrassing and ridiculous than in Hong Kong action movies. <br /> <br /> With a budget of 40 million and you can see every dollar invested on the screen, in the best case the final result of this huge effort is a glossy round laser disk placed in a thin lid on the shelf in the video store.
