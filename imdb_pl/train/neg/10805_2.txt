The only reason the DVRd was the movie was because 1. I live in Cleveland and Shaq is playing basketball for us and 2. I've always heard how horrible it was. The movie did not disappoint. The best parts are Shaqa outfits. The worst was, well, almost everything else. My twelve-year-old son and I just fidgeted and could not look at the screen when Shaq started rapping and wondered why Max did not want Kazzam to fix his front tooth! But in spite of all the horror, we just could not stop watching him, history dragged you in, like a black hole, sandpit or pitch, it was hypnotic. But it was worth to laugh and say that we actually watched "Kazzam".
