We brought this movie as a joke for a friend and we could have been our worst joke. The film is barely audible, and acting is terrible. The worst child actor he has ever used, and Hasslehoff, who gave performance that is not the norm. The plot is disgraceful, and at points we were so bored that we were wondering what the hell was going on. In some places he tries to be macabre, but he's just funny. <br /> <br /> Just horrible
