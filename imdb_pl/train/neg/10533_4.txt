This version has changed a bit in my taste and I suppose that at the beginning I have problems with this game. But first the movie is a typical television version of the movie, which means that there is no talent for the original version of the movie with William Holden. What could they not afford to employ more than twelve people as extras? Why transfer the movie until 1966? So, could you give your younger sister a line about the protests of the Vietnam War? Why not 1963 and give her a line about the civil rights movement? Jay O. Sanders found the right notes for his character, especially in the scenes with Josh Brolin. On the other hand, Brolin lacks many notes. He is credible as a former BMOC jockey, but there is no harsh sensuality of William Holden. I always thought that Brolin looked a bit like a gorilla, so that all the women in the city would ape (apologies for the pun). Gretchen Moll was lovely, but she seemed too smart for the character she played. She did not design innocence or ignorance that this character demanded. Maybe because she and Brolin were 5 years older than the characters. But then Holden was ten years old. Bonnie Bedelia was rather forgotten because her mother and Mary Steenburgen can not decide whether Blanche duBois or Katharine from "The Taming of The Shrew". <br /> <br /> Regarding Mr. Inge, I always thought that such stories of a young woman choosing a passion over practicality always needed an epilogue. "The Twilight Zone" I think I'm offering a probable epilogue with the episode "Spur of the Moment" in which the young Diana Hyland was chased by the bitter older Diana Hyland, because the younger Diana Hyland decided to escape with a guy similar to Hal Carter.
