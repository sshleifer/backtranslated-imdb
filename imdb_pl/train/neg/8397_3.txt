After reading the previous comments, I'm glad that I was not the only person who remained confused, especially for the last 20 minutes. John Carradine is shown twice, going to the grave and closing the lid behind him. I was anxiously awaiting some explanation for this strange behavior ... naturally I assumed that it had something to do with the bad deeds in the house, but since it was killed by the first emerging corpse (hereinafter referred to as Zombie # 1), these scenes had absolutely no sense. Please, if anyone knows why Carradine kept coming down to the graves - let the rest of us fall in !! <br /> <br /> The whole action is limited to the last 20 minutes, so I'll try to summarize. John Carradine goes out to the cemetery to investigate, and is choked by Zombie # 1. So far, good. But then there is a confusing scene in which John Ireland and Jerry Strickler, discovering Carradine's dead body, in the small moonlighting of the cemetery. Strickler repeatedly tries to push Ireland into an open grave where Zombie # 1 emerged from, but Ireland manages to transfer him to the open grave and PRESTO! Strickler comes out as Zombie # 2! Yes, I suppose we can conclude that Strickler was dead all the time (witch?) But why he changed from a normal appearance into a rotting version of the body, flying to the grave of Zombie # 1, will never be explained. (Considering how terribly slow these zombies are moving, I would think that he would rather stay in his "normal" form until the end of his activity). This scene also brings a question - who the heck is IS Zombie # 1 ??? We can only assume that Zombie # 1 is one of the original murder victims shown in the first films, but who knows which one and why he has a particular resentment to the film crew. <br /> <br /> In any case, after Ireland sees this transformation and runs away, we see EXACT SAME SHOT Zombie # 2, which we saw through the trees, as we saw for Zombie # 1. (This leads to temporary confusion about this how many Zombies really are). Then in the best film from the 1950s horror movie, Ireland manages to leave, fleeing. It conveniently knocks the headstone of the dead cat Faith Domergue (is not it nice with John Carradine to chisel a tombstone for a cat he barely knew?) <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Zombie # 1 has wasted havoc at home. He easily sends three members of the film crew, and then goes up the stairs. Faith Domergue hears him, and thinking that the lover John Ireland has returned from the night shot goes out. Seeing that this is only Zombie # 1, he screams and retreats into the bedroom, where he retrieves a revolver from Ireland. While the star, Carole Wells, is showering at the moment and she can not hear the scream, her friend Charles Macauley (who drinks and hits the mirror in her bedroom). Taking his sweet time (and only after a few sips from his breast), he finally decides to investigate. (One thing that strikes the viewer in the last quadrant of this movie is how SLOW REACTIONS are the stars are screams and arrows). Domergue returns to the corridor, armed and ready, but he makes Macauley's mistakes for Zombie # 1 and shoots him six times! He makes a cool acrobatic flap on the balustrade, and then terrified, Domergue retreats to the waiting arms Zombie # 1. <br /> <br /> Carole Wells no longer has a shower and dries when he hears Domergue's shots and screams; she also does not feel great urgency in escaping to investigate the matter. So at this time Zombie # 1 has time to pull the Domergue string from the neck. Wells sees Domergue's dangling corpse and fainting. The next time we see her, she's in the stream in front of the house (???) - but more on that later. In the meantime, Ireland regained her senses and fell into the house, where she discovers a bloody Zombie slaughter # 1. Although Ireland has just stumbled upon three murdered people, she is more worried that his film has been revealed and ruined! Fortunately for him (and the public) Zombie # 1 throws film equipment on the head from the second floor. This is what we see in Zombie # 1. At this point, the audience is subjected to the assembly of all deaths, showing that the new "reflect" the old. How deep. <br /> <br /> Zombie # 2, in the meantime, approached the house (remember, these zombies move as slowly as molasses in January), where he meets Carole Wells floating in the stream and fishes her. How did she get there? Had Zombie # 1 carried her down, threw her in, then came back upstairs to strangle John Ireland? Apparently, one of the original victims has drowned in the tub, so Wells also has to drown (but why the outside in the stream, instead of the bathtub, it is never explained). Zombie # 2 never goes home (they are all dead now, thanks to Zombie # 1), but instead carry Carol Wells to the cemetery. When the final credits are flashing on the screen, we see Zombie # 2 with his dead love still in his arms, descending into an open grave. <br /> <br /> The viewer remains surprised: Yes, but was not that the Zombie Grave No. 1? Why is Zombie # 2 living? And what if Zombie # 1 appears and wants to come back - will Zombie # 2 let him, will there be a zombie fight? Will the zombies share both the grave and the newly deceased Carole Wells? And what about John Carradine now dead - where will he stay? We know from the earlier scenes that it is clearly at home in the grave ... If this plot of the summary left you confused, do not worry, because you are not alone.
