Seeing the Behind the Sun men, I think I was hoping for the evolution of style and technique to fit the larger scale of this film. I was also very interested in seeing how someone creates a heavily fact-based fictionalized description of what happened during this most famous Japanese cruelty, but that's not it. It is a game like the Nazi European film on exploitation since the mid-1970s - for example, the SS Experiments Camp, etc. (Actually, more like Deported Women from the Special Section). He admits that he has a greater range and more people run around, but he resorts to the same cheap and unbearable device of many unfortunate non-actors falling limply on the sound of ridiculously false shots, seasoned with a sporadically poorly made "shock" sequence. Admittedly, terrible documentary material is roughly entwined between scenes, so trite that even these real images are deprived of most of their power. Watch "The Holocaust" on channel 4 (recently broadcast (still working?) From 1 No. 2006) for a truly disturbing documentary about the evil of war (with the perfect use of real footage in context). This is the kind of treatment that Nanjing's horror deserves, and not this devastated garbage from exploitation (a better-made movie of exploitation without disrespectful use of film material would be fine, but again it's not even a very good operating film). Rating: 3 (5 as exploitation, 1 as a topic treatment).
