It's a depressingly shallow, na√Øve and mostly unpleasant look at the wildly unlikely connection between Brooks' psychotic editor Harold and his insolent girl. They both have ZERO chemistry together - mainly because Harold is unable to do anything but look nice at this stage of his career; but also because Brooks's character is neither interesting nor sympathetic. At the beginning there are 15 static, tearful minutes, in which Brooks, just breaking up with Harold, stumbles over his flat in a state of depression, drug addiction - unbearable. <br /> <br /> Sappily and unimaginative bookified by Joe Cocker You are so beautiful ", there simply is not enough material for a feature film here. Almost nothing happens on the outskirts of their relationship, to look as if these people lived in the real world. I'm sure Brooks's intention was to throw white light on the matter and, in a sense, deconstruct it; but if you're going to do it, writing and acting must be much better than what's here.
