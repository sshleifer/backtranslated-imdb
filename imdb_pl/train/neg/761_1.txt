Absolute garbage. The reason why it's so horrible is not that it deviated from the formula, but because the plot was simply pathetic. <br /> <br /> This alleged star did nothing to solve the matter - and no one else really was - it was just police work. Completely tedious. <br /> <br /> You were sitting to the very end, hoping for a turn - and you had nothing but a huge disappointment. <br /> <br /> There were so many ways to have a relative in a visible abduction. Can Lt's personal involvement finally cover his judgment? <br /> <br /> All obvious signs concerned a stranger. But certainly a genius such as Lt C, through a continuous conversation with an abused husband, gradually reveals the devilish plot in which the tape player plays in the shower, while the masked bridegroom surprises the bride, hides the body and then plants subtle hints. It could be good. It was a total waste of time.
