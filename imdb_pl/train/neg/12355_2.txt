After reading many reviews, I do not know what kind of movie some people watched, but apparently it was not the same movie I saw. <br /> <br /> This movie is awful. Acting, above all Moore, is just awful. A woman can not act. Nice tits, but she just can not work. At no time has she become a real character. Instead, it was broken. Hollywood actress goes to the beach to play with the boys. <br /> <br /> And that's how it is in this movie - Hollywood adoration. The training sequences are on top. Politics - upstairs. Political correctness - above the summit. Combat scenes - you guessed it upstairs. Your task is to enter and exit without being detected. So what are you doing? Why shoot so many rounds and of course make as much noise as possible? Oh G.I. Jane, you can be my wingman anytime. <br /> <br /> The premise is good, but as soon as Hollywood gets it, we'll end up with Top Gun with tits. <br /> <br /> What more can you expect from commercial American films? Probably not very much.
