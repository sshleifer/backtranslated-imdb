This is one of the funniest movies I've ever had the honor of watching. <br /> <br /> I watched it on a DVD with a group of friends on a Friday night and we just could not stop laughing from the beginning to the finish. <br /> <br /> The story is quite simple: terrorists take over a convoy, which they think transports uranium from weapons, but in reality it carries a group of dinosaurs eating people. Easy error. Create a surprisingly incompetent team of the Special Forces of the Army to face the prehistoric beasts. They are led by Colonel Rance, played by Scott Valentine; the man who apparently perfected the game "Smell the fart", as Joey in Friends recommended. <br /> <br /> There are lots of gore and a lot of pictures, but unfortunately Rance's team seems to have a problem with aiming their weapons in the general direction of hordes of huge, heavy monsters. Also, the lights always seem to flicker and go out every time the Velociraptor attacks (probably because we can not see how bad the effects of creation are). <br /> <br /> Having said all this, we all had a great offer of fun that would set the player on their heads. <br /> <br /> As an adventure in the style of Jusassic Park / Aliens, this movie smells worse than the crotch of a dinosaur, but as an absurd entertainment is a great success.
