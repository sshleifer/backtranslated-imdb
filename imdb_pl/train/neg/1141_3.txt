With low expectations, the new movie "Husbands" (clocked for over five minutes) was a pleasant surprise. I will not say that the new film material was a class A material, but it was a very solid foundation for what "could be" a good, completely original movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie was made in 1955 during one-day photo sets. After the new recording, Jules White decided to simply clip the footage from "Brideless Groom" into this short film, creating a not-too-smooth transition story that Jules and Felix Adler are trying to remedy with a quick piece of new material in the end, giving us the old, worn out boys (in this case Moe and Larry) shot in the ass. <br /> <br /> 3/10
