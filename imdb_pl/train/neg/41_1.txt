How can you say horror is horrible? when of course you can not stop laughing at it! The story has been well described by other reviewers, so I will add a few things about the fun of it all. <br /> <br /> Some reviews have located the location in South America, others in Africa, I thought it was on some random island in the Pacific. Where exactly this happens, it seems a mystery. The cannibal tribe is made up of a pair of black women and a man who looks like a young Frank Zappa banging into drums ... Devil God is a big black man with a terrible case of pink eyes. > <br /> One of the "strangest" moments in the film is the moment when "Pablito" discovers that his partner hangs on a tree covered with orange substance, which, I suppose, is blood, begins to scream a few minutes. (this is really funny), and then the head of his partner falls to the ground and "Pablito" copies him a little for what I assume is "sraje n 'giggles" and the eyes are really moving ... <br /> <br /> But of course the "freak" has disappeared when you realize that your eyes are moving because the movie is just bad ... <br /> <br /> I have not laughed so long and I definitely recommend this movie on a Sunday afternoon with friends and you have nothing for work ... grab a beer crate and start watching this movie, you'll love it! If you're looking for a real horror movie or a gore movie ... do not worry.
