Evil Aliens owes a huge debt to the films of Peter Jackson Bad Taste and Braindead. I must admit that I am never particularly happy with these films and I say the same. the ones he's looking at. I lost count of time when the greatest Hollywood movie was quoted, in particular by James Camerons Aliens. The amount of blood and gore in the exhibition is not funny, the other end of the movie is tired. Perhaps it would be better if it was a short movie. Poor actors, the direction is weak and the plot does not exist. I see what the director tried to do, a tribute that he tried to pay, but others did the same a lot better than here. 4/10
