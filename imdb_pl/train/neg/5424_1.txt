Mirror. Mirror (1990) is a flat, lame movie. Why did I watch such movies when I was younger? Who knows? Maybe I was one of those who punished myself, watching one terrible movie after another. I do not know, I probably needed a hobby during my teenage years. A teenage outcast (Rainbow Harvest) is looking for consolation in an old mirror. He soon learns about the horrific power of an antique mirror, and uses it to attack those who have hurt her. Movies like power donor have a nasty side effect. This changes her inside and outside if she likes it or not. <br /> <br /> The mess of the movie, which for some reason was restored to d.v.d a few years ago. I do not know why. They should leave it on the shelf and collect dust. People love this movie for some reason. If so, I would like to know why. Until then, I do not like this movie and I have no reason to watch it again. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend it at all.
