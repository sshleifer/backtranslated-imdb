This film is to be a study of the character of perversion. Some reviewers were embarrassed, assuming that the film is psychologically deep because of perversion; in fact, considering the unnecessary material, it is surprisingly boring and shallow, without a motivational substance. Why is the main character what he is? You will not find out from the script. To better treat the same theme (and more entertaining movie), try Belle de Jour Bunuel.
