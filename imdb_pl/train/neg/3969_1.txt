I'm writing this because I felt somehow led to believe that Dark Remains is a good movie. Although this is not the worst I have seen, it is certainly not good. <br /> <br /> Weak scenario, weak actors and poor direction. Even if they can not afford the cast of big names, would there be too much to ask for a more attractive actress? It was painful to see an ordinary actress in the movie with her boring performance. The story was banal and badly written. Special effects were minimal. The "suspense" tricks that were repeated here were difficult to swallow. <br /> <br /> To be honest, Dark Remains is no worse than some episodes of Masters of Horrors. But not entirely on par with high quality movies. Dark Remains is recommended only for hardcore horror fans who do not want to miss any film in this genre, even if it is a badly made movie. As for anyone else, time should be spent on something more valuable - which should be extremely easy.
