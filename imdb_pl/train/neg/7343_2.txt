Have you ever heard of a Taiwanese horror movie? How about a Taiwanese movie? Probably for some reason. This one was really boring, although it has black magic, including wilted bodies of children and people exploding from inside thousands of eels. <br /> <br /> After reading the thoughts of other people, I could not wait for violence and gore, but not much. Some blood pukes and other lame things, if you're waiting for some graphics or some gruesome effects, you'll be disappointed. They clearly did not use exploding eels and other things to their maximum potential. <br /> <br /> Almost nothing good in this movie; a single character who was not completely insipid, and a few OK black magic spells, like an eel. The plot was misleading and boring. The characters were thin and annoying, including the main character. Aspect of horror did not work at all, the most frightening was the girl with albinos (not so frightening). This is the worst Asian horror I have ever seen.
