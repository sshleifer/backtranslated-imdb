Raymond Burr appears as an attorney involved in the murder of his best friend (Dick Foran) thanks to his sympathy for his friend's wife (Angela Lansbury). It was a full year before he began to make Perry Mason, so the movie could be particularly interesting to his fans if he was an inspiration for his cast. <br /> <br /> There is not much interesting here. Lansbury is always good, but her character is very one-dimensional, and the motives of her crime are completely clear. There is an interesting performance by Lamont Johnson as a painter who is also in love with "femme fatale", but the character of Burra is quite simple. It's really weird to see an actor like Burr making these romantic scenes from Lansbury, and his pausing of delivery does not suit his character very well here, as is the case with most of the films in which I saw him. The whole tension is to be related to the title of the film and the way Burra's character creates a Lansbury character so that she can get involved in it (a double threat prevents her from trying again for the original murder). He does it with a very large tape recorder that he does not notice when he enters the room. I think so. <br /> <br /> Some unintentional funny moments and basically the rest of the things you could do TV.
