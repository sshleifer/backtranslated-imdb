Seriously, why do American actors and Frechians pretending to be Czechs have to speak perfect English with a fake Russian accent? I'm a man, so I liked unpaid nudity - but a soft porn movie would have more of that, or at least it did not pretend to be artistic. <br /> <br /> All political statements in which the didactic painter or director heard about subtlety? Acting was also woody and melodramatic, and the comic relief was never fun. The figures were very shallow, and I just could not identify with them. <br /> <br /> I was laughing a bit when they cut the actors for archival footage from the Prague demonstration - and they were black and white, then sepia to match the material - just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I have read many of Kundera's stories (not the Unbearable Lightness of Being), and his style of writing is good (although his subjects are one great male fantasy) - and I must say that the film did NOT convey Kunderas's kindness.
