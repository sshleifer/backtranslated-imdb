This film is mainly chase scenes and special effects. It is very poor on the story. Most of the computer conversations were just mumbo-jumbo. I watched this because I was a big fan of the original War Games movie, which was based mainly on computer facts and real computer terminology. This movie had nothing to do with it. Most of the computer scenes were not only impossible and highly unrealistic for real computers and networks, but simply poor. It's like it's written by someone who does not understand real computers. <br /> <br /> The ripley game was poor and was basically just an arcade game. There is no real hacking, so what's up? The film was boring. Lame sequel.
