It was a disappointing movie. People seem to have no content, the main character Martin Cahil has zero values ​​of redemption, in fact everyone in him, including Jon Voight, personify sleeze. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Violence is unpalatable, though ingeniously done. Filming is black, at least the print I've seen fits this category. Disappointment.
