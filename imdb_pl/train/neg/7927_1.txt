This movie is AMAZING. I watched it one day with my cousin Jay-Jay. He said it's all right, but I think it's RULEZZZ! I mean, it's great. Ted V. Mikels is so brave and wise. He made a movie quite different from those horrible Hollywood movies like Matrix and Stop or my mother will shoot. But it could have been better. I like ninja and pirates. I also like the big claw that the funny man wears. I think he's the coolest guy from that guy at Domino Pizza. This movie does not just look really cool, like the movies my dad made of my birthday when I was six. It's a very complicated story with dozens of characters that seem to be completely unrelated, but they all meet at the end. It's brilliant how this network is woven to make everything happen. I wish Ted V. Mikels to continue. But he needs more aliens. And a pirate.
