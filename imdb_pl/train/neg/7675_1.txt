Can you ever say that there are movies that do not have any exchangeable features? Answer: Yes, and this is one of them. After taming the terrifying director of "House of the Dead", Uwe Boll cast his less talented eye on the next adaptation of video games. Do these guys not understand? For anyone who can not understand, here it is in capital letters: VIDEO GAMES DO NOT HAVE GOOD FILMS! Operating here is at best below the norm. The set design and special effects are weak. In contrast to the video game (which had horrifying moments) the film has no atmosphere of impending doom, no sense of threat or danger. Stimulation and drafting is confused, and the paper on which the script is printed would be better used as toilet paper. The main culprit is the director. Uwe Boll uses the camera with grace and monkey skills using a brush. Reduced enlargements, dips and pans are combined into a whole gloomy romance at unpredictable moments, leaving the audience confused and bored. Why this guy was ever allowed on the set, must become one of the greatest secrets of modern cinema. Avoid at all costs.
