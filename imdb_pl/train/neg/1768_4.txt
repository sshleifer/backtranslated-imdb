It's another of those movies that could have been great. The basic assumption is good - immortal people who kill to live, etc. - a kind of variation on the subject of a vampire. <br /> <br /> Everything that makes everything fall apart is the total recklessness of the main characters. Even sociopaths know that if you want to survive, you need to keep a low profile - look how long it took to catch Unibomber, and that's because a family member understood this. <br /> <br /> In contrast, the kid (and to a lesser extent the mother) behaves as if he was untouchable. The kid kills without thinking that he will not leave evidence, no trace or a living witness. How these people managed to stay alive and not discover for a month is unbelievable, let alone decades or centuries. <br /> <br /> It's really a shame - it could have been a lot more if it was credibly written, i.e. giving the main characters the level of common sense they would need for so long. <br /> <br /> Besides, it was not bad. I loved the piece at the end, where every cat in the city coincides at home - every time I put food on the porch and see how our cats suddenly fall from the place where they were, I think about this scene.
