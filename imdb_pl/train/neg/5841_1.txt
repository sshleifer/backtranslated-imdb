Spoiler below, but read on or you will never find out about the terrible fate that awaits all who plan to rent "Rodentz". <br /> <br /> On a lunar night, in a remote research laboratory, it's about a serious medical breakthrough to have lethal consequences. The chemical compound that was created to "hunt and destroy" deadly cancer cells leaked out of the hazardous waste disposal system into the basement of the building. Now the rodents involved in the laboratory experiment upstairs are not the only rats in the facility that will become an altered species. Professor Schultz, a leading bio-researcher, has just determined that the addition of a new enzyme allows him to regenerate the "hunting and destroying" formula for the time necessary to neutralize deadly cancerous tumors. When three different stages of the new mix are administered to three different rats and the rest are poured over the faulty sink of the "Waste Hazard", the shocking side effects cause the night of terror ..... prawda ..... <br /> <br /> Seriously, probably the worst movie I've seen this year. Everything in it screams "Low-budget!", From terrifying activities to special effects, which are one of the worst I have ever seen. The heroes are stereotypical morons and behave in a stupid, predictable way: walking alone in dark corridors, looking for a cat, stumbling and falling, so that "rats" can catch up with them, get on board in a small room, etc. <Br /> <br /> While some movies are cheap, this movie really takes the cake. Every possible angle is cut, everything from the re-use of earlier photos, filming corridors "Lab" from different angles to make them look bigger (reminds me - why in this bizarre, massive building worked only Two guys?!?!?!?) to music and special effects that can be done at a PC children's workshop. <br /> <br /> This brings me to the worst aspect of this steaming pile of dung - special effects. Just frightening. Computer-generated rats look so false and stand out on every scene, so even the most stupid movie buffs could see that they're computer generated. And this giant suit of rats - OH MY GOD !!!!!!!! seriously, should we believe that a bizarre child is a monster? Just pathetic ........ Better, some gore look pretty good, especially considering the budget. <br /> <br /> All actors suck. no one involved in the production cared or knew what he was doing. I wasted enough time to browse, just use my advice, it's rubbish. 1/10. <br /> <br /> About the DVD: The transfer sucks, the sound is passable, and there is a comment on the disc with the commentary of the director and two of his friends who say they have absolutely nothing to do with the movie, but we were there to ask questions and comment. All these three human primitives of slime are so incredibly stupid that they should be institutionalized before they can harm themselves or others. I do not want to waste more time or my nice reader, because I'm starting to remember more about this movie than I want ... DVD rating: 1/10.
