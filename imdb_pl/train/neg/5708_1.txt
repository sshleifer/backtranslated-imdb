People like me will rip this movie. This is not realistic. The story is so predictable. You can predict everything that's going on in a convincing way. Of course, they find treasure and become disgustingly rich, and they cheat on the evil one. We have seen this a million times. The authors of this film have to think that the majority of the film's audience is stupid. They must be right, because most people really liked this movie. I mean solving puzzles in a few seconds. A secret treasure hidden under the subway in Manhattan? You would think with all the work that took place in the basement of New York. This room would be previously discovered. and everything that was built during the civil war? PLEASE AND A LOVE STORY BETWEEN Ben and Abigail? how sweet and I thought that the affair in Cliveler's novels was weak. They just fall in love this way, in 2 seconds, WHAT would I worry more about saving my own butt and then a little bit. to hell with a girl and a stupid piece of paper. 1/10 Garbage
