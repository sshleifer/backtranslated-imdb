This may be the worst movie I will see if I live to be 100 years old. I think that a group of first graders could come up with better plot lines than a class project. I am more dumb for watching him, and God has mercy on souls who have been paid for producing this film. <br /> <br /> And when I finally turned it off, I wanted to vomit. <Br> <br /> No one had any idea about photography when it was done. Nobody had any idea about acting. Nobody had any idea about anything else. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that F / X turns out to be shit. The only time I saw it on one of Star√≥w! channels - even the main one. And it was around three in the morning.
