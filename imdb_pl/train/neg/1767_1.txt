you can ask why? The characters growl, scream and chew the scenery for no apparent reason, unless someone wanted to make a film in Barcelona. Billie Baldwin, is this the right one? She forgets the role of a cop / detached-husband / loving-father-a charming-small-blond-girl. the story seems to be cut out and pasted from scenes thrown from adventure films in the last three years. the lack of charisma in ellen pompeo is a black hole that seems to drain energy from every scene in which it is located. its real range of action is displayed when it takes off the blouse when the videos are spinning from one inert chase scene to the other. Unfortunately, the director is rarely bad enough to be a camp or a parody. it's just a clich√©, a friend in every respect. the director gave his own daughter as a prematurely born brat probably because no reputable agent would let the customer ruin his career, being in such a bad, fancy and uninteresting movie. the only jump here is to steal the investor's money and viewer's time.
