Study in bad. Bad acting, bad music, bad script, bad editing, wrong direction and bad idea. Pieces of schlock do not come in any way cheesy or involuntarily more fun than this ... something. At the end of the "movie" you wonder why they were bothering themselves. Poor Malcolm McDowell, was he short of cash or something? Do you still think about it? * SPOILERS AHOY *: If you have not died of laughter in the first thirty minutes, until you see a cyborg populated city named "Cytown". Avoid this, my movie friends. Avoid.
