So "Thinner" ... Yes ... This Steven Bachman (read Steven King) talks about a man who gets his desserts from Gypsy Elder, whom he just killed. I know why I did not like it more than I could. I think that what really distracted me were the actors. I mean who is the leader? Robert John Burke? Who is he? And crying loudly, can anyone stop employing Joseph Mantegna for every Italian role of mafioso? And when are we, does every mafia have to have an Italian mother cooking pasta? The only good job done here is makeup below 10 pounds, Michael Constantine as Gypsy senior. It's pretty good. But the rest, I do all of you, "better actors ..."
