I really like Brad Pitt. He is an actor with brain and wit, not to mention the face, breasts and the rest. Ever since I saw him in "Thelma and Louise", I was wondering what he reminded me of? "Troy" did it for me. He is the new Brigitte Bardot. The differences are obvious, of course. A man, an American, etc., but Brigitte Bardot comes to mind. It is so beautiful that it is the most effective when playing against it. "California" "12 Monkeys" "Fight Club" "Snatch" His self-sufficient humor makes him a human being, almost accessible. Fortunately, "Troy" will soon be forgotten. Only photos with Pitt, half-naked in the thrilling sprint positions, will decorate the walls of the legions of drooling fans. Strange, "Das Boot" is one of the best films of the second part of the twentieth century. What does Wolfgang Petersen manage? Well, I suppose it would be very difficult to say "no" when working with the new Brigitte Bardot.
