This is a science fiction film about the formula B, and the director did not make any problems. It's about a dragon that has been brought back to life by a research team. Everything you do is the things you have seen many times. This is a weak script, with no real characters. In fact, it is full of stereotypical figures and situations. The director attacks this by making a film with the formula without trying to deceive us, and this makes the film a mild charm, but it is not something you can remember. It's best seen when you cook, clean, exercise. A kind of thoughtless fun. It has a place in entertainment, but it is certainly not something you sit down with friends, unless you're just drunk and you do not care. Weight 3.2 is probably fair. I do not think it's as nonsense as most people do, but I'm surprised that some people in the posts thought it spectacular. It really escapes me because I do not see any attempt to make it a memorable movie.
