This is a surprising movie. <br /> <br /> The beauty of sexual relations between men and women is degraded by a group of men and women who can only be described as a collection of weirdoes and unmatched. <br /> <br /> Greenaway gives inspiration for Fellini's film "8 1/2", but while Fellini is the titan of world cinema, Greenaway is not. <br /> <br /> There is no lightness of the master's touch or the ability to convey feelings and emotions with the clarity of brightness. <br /> <br /> It is pretentious, the film is divided into chapters with a written introduction to each, as if the viewer had to be led to the movie, except that written notices remain only the screen for a few seconds, not long enough to allow be read by the audience, which means they are mostly ignored. <br /> <br /> As for women, only two can be described as observers, Palmira, played by Polly Walker and Giaconda played by Natacha Amal. The rest exudes plainness. Both women and men retreat from the harsh light of reality into dark shades of fantasy. <br/> <br/> Greenaway apparently wants to emphasize that sexual fantasy does not lead to happiness. Women themselves are depressing because they provide their services in exchange for money. Relations between men and women are depreciated in a commercial transaction. <br /> <br /> There is no sense of joy, happiness or love in the film, there are actually a few scenes that are deeply unpleasant: <br /> <br /> The suggestion of an incest relationship between father and son, Philip and Storey Emmental, they played respectively John Standing and Matthew Delamere. The souled negligence of both men that Giaconda carries her child, she actually gets pregnant twice, the first fetus is interrupted, and the second time she is sent back to the destination chosen by men from the book of flights. Both men had sex with a woman who has no legs (half woman in the title). Bestiality that exists between Beryl, played by Amanda Plummer, and a pig named Hortense. Father and son share women among themselves. Women enjoy sexual beating. The father sleeps with the corpse of his dead wife. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, none of these scenes is sexually shown, only suggested. <br /> <br /> The suggested degradation of women is such that there is no surprise that the film was booed when it premiered in Cannes for the first time. What's more unusual is that the actresses in the film stood in defense, showing once again that the naivety of women has no limits and that women are fooled by the use of men. <br /> <br /> Greenaway's directing style is pretentious, it is the triumph of style over the content, the film's picture as art, accompanied by the abandonment of common sense. <br /> <br /> Greenaway tries to achieve the sublimity of surrealism, but manages to show the banality of interpersonal relations.
