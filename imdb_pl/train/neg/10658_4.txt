On the way back from IMC6 (San Jose, California) all five of us (remember, three of us, hardcore Kamal fans) reached a unanimous verdict; VV was a solid shit, and thanks to the movie we had a somewhat screwed up Monday. Not to mention that we swore to remain in theaters for the next year. <br /> <br /> I do not blame Kamal here, because in a sense he gave up a hint in a recent interview for the cartoonist Madana (in Vijay TV). He said something like: "Tamizh Cinema'la Photography, Editing'la namba munnera'na maadri. Writer, director, Acting'la innum namba munnera'la" (Tamil Cinema has grown in terms of photography and editing, but we have hardly improved, if it's about script, directing and acting. "While watching the VV, these words are very real. <br /> <br /> Here are 10 reasons why you hate this movie: <br /> <br /> 1. Harris Jeyaraj < br /> <br /> 2. Harris Jeyaraj <br /> <br /> 3. Harris Jeyaraj I barely refrain from using curses here, but the fact is that HJ has mastered a great idea to spoil every one of his latest films (remember about "Anniyan", "Ghajini") with a jarring cacophony, he bills the music as a background music The next time he transpires a drum, he pays it. <br /> <br /> 4. Songs do not help in spatial / temporal moving the narrative of a movie or making it u You'll sit down and you will not notice The film seems to be composed of four VERY long songs with several scenes. n between them. <br /> <br /> 5. And Short went too far. VV is best suited for storytelling, not for 2 hours and "thriller". To use the banal, like the Energizer bunny, it lasts and continues; only in this case you do not want this. The later part of the film looks like a big resistance. <br /> <br /> 6. Pairing Kamal-Jothik Two ice cubes rubbed together could create more sparks than a combination of lead. There is no reason why you should root out with them so that they can gather together. In fact, each time they meet in the second half of the movie, they make a good irritating narrative. I hate to say it, but the 10-minute romance of Kamalini Mukerjhee does more than what Kamal and Jothika achieve in this film, plus "Thenali." <br /> <br /> 7. Kamal Haasan Kamal's accent has this pretentious accent that no one speaks in India or the US; and this is not new either. He does it from "Thoongadae Thambi Thoongadae". It just gets in the nerves. Imagine how much havoc it can be when his talent for using this strange accent meets with shooting in the US. He also does not leave it on Immigration, he offers advice to his people (stunned TN cops from Keeranor, Sathoor and not only) in pure Cambodian ("What we have here, is a bad bad police wok"), of course the effect of nausea. <br /> <br /> 8. Logic There are several directors you expect to achieve on a certain scale. Gautam fails us very badly with some ugly activity in the Department of common sense. Which D.C.P in his senses would fulfill his interest in love on the streets to discuss things like committing himself and living after! The stage in the theater was so bad at the culminating point; we've heard people behind us loudly challenge the hero's IQ. "Is he stupid, can not he just use his Mermaid or Light?" (On a busy road in Madras, a Kamal jeep, a police officer, is chasing a guy on a bike like an ordinary guy!). "Can not he just use his weapon?" ("Guy on a bike" starts on foot and we have a fully prepared Kamal in pursuit for a long time). I do not vote for a later one, but I try to explain the mood inside. <br /> <br /> 9. Gore and Violence If I wanted to watch raped women, cut throats, more women raped and thrown into bushes with a heartbreaking authenticity, I would sit at home and watch "Police Report" or "Kuttram". The use of excessive violence should be a way to extend the story, not overwhelm it! Somewhere down below, Gautum seems confused about what extensions (rapes, murders) are and what is the basis (history)! <br /> <br /> 10. Even a double Espresso shot could not relieve a headache.
