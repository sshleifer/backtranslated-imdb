The small Californian city of Diablo is plagued with a mysterious death after the sheriff Robert Lopez discovers the ancient box. Legend has it that the box contains a sixteenth-century Mexican demon named Azar. FBI agent Gil Vega was sent in to investigate the murders and join forces of the sheriff's daughter, Dominique and Mary, to fight the evil and bloodthirsty demon. "The Legend of Diablo" is an absolute trash. The film lacks fear and gore, acting is amateurish, and the direction is bad. Animation is the only aspect of the movie that I liked. I am a big fan of indie horror movies, for example I loved "Torched", "Live Feed", "Bone Sickness" or "Neighborhood Watch", unfortunately "The Legend of Diablo" is a huge mistake to avoid.
