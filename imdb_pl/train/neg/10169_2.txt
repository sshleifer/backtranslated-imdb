It's 1978 and yes, of course, there are too many black players in teams! Fans will be upset and for sure 75,000 places will be full, only so many black players on the field are less satisfied! This for the Super Bowl television movie is watched. It's not much more, but it really surprises the cast of talented actors who appear (for now), probably most of all Tom Selleck. Unfortunately, the goodness that Selleck brings to the screen is quickly pierced by "actors" such as Dick Butkus. <br /> <br /> This is a stupid story about betting on super bowls. PJ Jackson was accused by "New York" (read Mafia) for ensuring that the game will end in their favor, in this case a $ 10,000,000 bet. PJ is innocent enough and seems to have a loose hug, buying here and there a few people. But everything seems to be falling apart for him. Another person, unexpected Laina, takes control. For a time, the murder mystery is not known for sure, but it appears quite clearly on the last murder that Lainie is a new antagonist. <br /> <br /> It's a bad movie, but you can watch it. Acting is decent, and filming is fine. At least there were no stupid typical car chases from the '70s (they're not here). Just keep an open mind about the past stereotypes and the cocaine era and you will survive. <br /> <br /> 2/10 (maybe 2.5)
