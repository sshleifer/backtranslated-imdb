I do not know anything about the writer's or director's previous work, so I did not bring any prejudices to the film. Based on a brief description of the story in the TV Guide, I thought it might be interesting. <br /> <br /> But unbelievable has been imposed on improbability. Every rotation of the plot seemed to be a pretext for dragging more bloodshed, macabre makeup or special effects. <br /> <br /> The result was professional, and Kari Wuhrer seems like a decent actress, but the rest was more than a disappointment. It was positively repulsive. <br /> <br /> I will not go through the whims of the narrative, but I will give an example of what I consider to be an excess of a clear gore. <br /> <br /> Chris McKenna goes to a detached house on the ranch and pulls out the frozen body of his earlier victim (Wendt) from deep frost. McKenna killed Wendt, biting his neck. Now he feels he must destroy the evidence of his involvement in Wendt's death. (What will the cops do, measure his bite radius?) McKenna unwraps Wendt's head and neck from the freezer bag he finds himself in, takes the ax and begins to chop Wendt's head. Whack. Whack. Whack. A piece of ax still falls off Wendt's neck. The air is filled with lumps of a flying frozen body, one of which falls on McKenna's head. (He pushes him away when he's done.) McKenna then takes the frozen head out to the little fire he built. He sits down on the ground, squats next to him, takes pictures of the woman he just killed and shows them Wendt's head. "You remember her? We could really do it if it was not for you, "he says to his head. "Duke, you always liked bonfires, right?" He asks. Then he puts his head on fire. We only see how it burns, but there is a crackling sizzle in the flame. <br /> <br /> I do not want this kind of junk to be censored. I'm just wondering who likes to watch these things. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to continue the rest of the movie. Well, let me mention one example of "improbability" since I brought the idea. McKenna was kidnapped and locked in a dark bare hut. He knows that in the next days he will be half murdered. (He literally invited the heavy ones to do this.) What would you do in this situation reminiscent of Poe? Here is what McKenna does, which may turn out to be the last night of his life. Finds the rejected calendar with a pin-up girl on it and masturbates (successfully). Give this man the Medal of Freedom! <br /> <br /> A monster that looks like Pizza Hut is thrown into unnecessary flashbacks. The camera is often held in hand and wobbles. In the dialog there are such lines as: "Life is a piece ***. Or it is the best of all possible worlds. It depends on your point of view. " A wide-angle lens was used that turns ordinary faces into gargoyle masks. At the end of the house an explosive ball of fire will explode, while the hero, McKenna, goes to the forefront. <br /> <br /> He is also a hero. First, he kills a man for $ 13,000, hitting him with a heavy statue several times, then a potted plant before finally throwing the refrigerator on the body. (It worries him a bit, but not enough to keep him from paying for it.) Then I hope I have order, he kills Wendt, tearing a part of his neck. Then, by accident, he kills the wife of his first victim and blames the burdens for it, though they have nothing to do with any moral account. Then he smokes a live honcho (Baldwin). Then, after switching off two smaller weights, they intentionally blow them up, although one of them is not completely unfriendly. And we should support McKennie. <br /> <br /> It's not death from cartoons, like in the movies of Dirty Harry - bang bang and you're dead. They are slow and painful. The first - a $ 13,000 murder - is done awkwardly enough to resemble what can happen in real life. It's not easy to kill another man, as Hitchcock in Torn Curtain showed. But this scene does not matter. <br /> <br /> Some people can enjoy it, especially those young people who think that pain and death are things that happen only in movies. A few simple things on the screen.
