<br /> <br /> The main question that I am asking about this movie is how you make Cole Porter and use only 3 of your 15 songs! merman and lahr played major roles on the broadway, where they replaced the weaker red skelton and lucille ball. plot changes abound and the fun is lost. <br /> <br /> SKIP IT.
