Germans think that smiling is funny (just like Americans think that mumbling is sexy and that women with English accents work). I had to go through my eyes when the screen was once again filled with a gigantic close-up of a smiling face. One of these "housewives" is hacking corporate stories about mainframes in which the bank is cheating by tapping a few random keys in his home computer that is only connected to a power outlet. The director apparently loves a rather big, leading lady. I can not say I share his feelings. It is quite funny when the whole family is sitting in front of the TV, chanting along with advertisements silently. Apparently this review must be one row longer, so here it is.
