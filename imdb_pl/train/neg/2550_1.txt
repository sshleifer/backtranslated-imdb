It was the "in the American Pie tradition" that tricked me into borrowing this movie. What I got was a piece of Jackass-style garbage, with the big difference that compared to that, Jackass the Movie seems to be a citizen of Kane. <br /> <br /> This movie made me regret that I rewarded other 1 out of 10 movies because now I can not cross it. This makes some bad movies look like movie exploits. <br /> <br /> Actually, I turned it off after 45 minutes and I rarely do it. But it was just too boring, stupid, uninteresting and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that some people really reward it 10 out of 10. What did your parents do? Drop you on your head when you were a kid? Or maybe it was the first movie you've ever seen, so you have nothing to compare? Are you still a virgin and are the breasts you ever think are torn off? Something must be at least bad. <br /> <br /> My advice: stay away from this. Even if you are in the mood for a simple movie that does not require thinking, choose something else or you will regret it.
