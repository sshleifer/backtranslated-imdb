This film has the look and style of a student project. Yes, there are some interesting (though fun) editions and photos, but the end result was a minor. <br /> <br /> It looked like the director did not say "Look at this movie". It looked like he was saying, "Look at ME! I am a DIRECTOR! "<br /> <br /> Thumbs down.
