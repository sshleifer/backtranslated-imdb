I rented this movie after I heard about the confusion that he was not awarded the Oscar, but after seeing it, it's easy to see why it did not happen. Despite the beautiful photography, the film is incredibly slow, although it has almost no plot. <br /> <br /> The story is about a young boy trying to come to terms with his parents' death in what he can, but it does not have to be an accident (the movie is never clear) and how his grandfather told him stories. Fairytale stories contain the only interesting parts of the story, but they are very short and do not seem to make sense. <br /> <br /> The first tale in particular relates to a boy trying to get the magic flower of his dying girl to save her life, but the boy is delayed, first tasting the flower to make sure that it is not poisonous, which results in this that it is a few seconds too late to save his girlfriend - grandfather says that the moral is that the boy was too impatient, but that does not make sense, because it was an excessive warning and slowness that led to his Fails. The perfect metaphor of this movie really. <br /> <br /> However, Skye's photography is beautiful, but then Stardust, which was released this year, is another film about fairy tales filmed in Skye and beautifully photographed - and is infinitely better than this one.
