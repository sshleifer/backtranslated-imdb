Thank God that I did not go to the cinema for this movie. I would be very sorry about the money I gave. I saw it on TV and I could not believe my eyes. I wonder if any movie can be worse than that. they spent millions of dollars on this film for nothing. horrible acting and a horrible scenario. I think that other people who wrote comments are people working in this film company;) it's a huge fiasco! Can they still laugh at this kind of film in 2000? embarassing ...
