I missed the beginning of this film, which may explain why I did not like it so much. On the other hand, I have been studying the fall of the Roman republic for years, so I know this story. On the other hand, this may be the reason why I did not like this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie has more historical inaccuracies than extras. Although it is so inaccurate that I do not think they will try to make it correct, in which case you can forgive him. The strange thing is that sometimes they try to be historically accurate, which ends in confusion. How to throw the marriage of Antony and Octavia, and then postpone it for later two scenes. Why even come up with it if it makes no sense for the story, and Octavia is never seen? And I like to call Antonius his real name (Marcus Antonius) in some scenes, and his strange English name Mark Antony in other scenes. <br /> <br /> Apart from historical inaccuracies, the movie could still be a funny watch if it was not for this leading lady. There is not a bit of dignity in it. She is hysterical, dramatic and completely without control over herself. Instead of being a clever and composed queen, Cleopatra turns into a hysterical teenager with a bad PMS case. 95% of this comes from weak acting, but 5% are also a bad scriptwriter. There are too many stupid dramatic scenes in the script. Sometimes you did not watch Antonius and Cleopatra, you watched the immature versions of Dawson and Joey from Dawson's Creek. <br /> <br /> If you want to see something about this period, look ... whatever else.
