One of the worst Scorsese. Medium thriller; The only thing I can recommend is De Niro playing psycho. The finale is typical for this species, i.e. In advance, with another almost invincible, pain-resistant villain. I did not like the original from the 1960s, and this version was not very refined. I have no idea why Scorsese wasted his time remake. On the other hand, considering how bad his last films were (I refer to his boring Buddhist film and everyone with his new favorite actress, blonde girl Di Caprio), it's not even that bad in comparison. And considering Spielberg wanted to remake ... he could have been much worse.
