Jungle fever is too stylized, stereotypical and turns out to be fundamentally unfair. Wesley Snipes was wrong about the lead and there was no chemistry between him and Annabella Sciorra. Despite the fact that there is a lot of talent in this film, it is mainly wasted, because parts are reduced to little more than decorative cameos. Also, instead of just showing racism for ugly and stupid things, Spike Lee decides to wave it like a flag in the most gruff and irritating way. I went through most of the movie, but I could not finish it, and it rarely happens.
