I have two words for you. Sean Bean. Is the only valuable presence in this movie. But do not even watch this movie. Even if he is a good villain, you do not want to waste time. <br/> <br /> I did not care about the characters (except the little boy), and I did not really care if the beloved stars ended up dead or dead. The film did not make me care or BELIEVE that these people care for each other at all. After watching the movies, I read many "classic" novels, and this movie made me not even want to read the book. History seems so boring. But I can go ahead and read it to try to buy back the story in my head. <br /> <br /> Stay away from Lorna Doone. The actress who played Lorna was also in Sense and Sensibility and she was much better at it. Watch Sharpe, Horatio Hornblower, A & E has great movies from novels such as Pride and Prejudice. Or miniseries, such as Saga Forsyte. Check them out, do not bother Lorna Doone.
