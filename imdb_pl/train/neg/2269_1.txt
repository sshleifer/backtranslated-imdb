Let's make a talk show movie that already exists and basically have everything that's happening at the show! Well, if this idea does not intrigue you, what should not it, stay away from the ringmaster. I was dissatisfied seeing it in the theater and being able to sit in this mess of the movie. It seems to me that Jerry Springer does not play alone, which shows cheap props for his show (yes, it looks even cheaper than a real springer show) and is known only as a jerry in the movie. The story (if you can call it that) concerns a daughter who lives with her mother, decides to sleep with her mother live in a boy. So the mother's brilliant idea is to call the springer jerry show, and take it with her boyfriend. (Is it a coincidence that they live in a trailer park). Meanwhile, somewhere else in America, a woman meets her friend in bed. So, of course, let's call them the therapist of American Jerry Springer! I would talk about the rest of the movie, but even thinking about the movie makes me a headache. Jamie Pressly, who plays the daughter, looks completely unattractive in the film. And remember Michael Dudikoff, karate kick master from the American ninja series? Look at him now like drunk white rubbish. The point is that it really looks too horrible and is not suitable for calling it "making contact with its charecter". But if your idea of ​​having fun is to see how Jerry Springer sings a country song about your own show or guys who connect with transvestites ... well ... ONLY SEE! ... at least Steve was clever enough to stay away.
