BTK Killer, Green River Killer, Zodiac Killer; a man is still losing absolute garbage and it is ironic that he loves his nonsense. <br /> <br /> I have never seen the movie of Ulli Lommel, but I was so amazed at how everyone thinks his things are so horrible. Like the movies I said at the beginning, they do not even equal six when they are added up! After reading the comments I was curious to see how bad this guy is. The worst is there. <br /> <br /> Credits would not end with the start of a pathetic movie and I quickly noticed that the sound was badly named. Acting was incredibly horrible and similar to camera shots. Editing is the worst. This movie did not make sense and I could not take it anymore, because it would not end and I had only 45 minutes in the film. I could not take it anymore. I wasted 45 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> DO NOT WATCH THIS CAGE!
