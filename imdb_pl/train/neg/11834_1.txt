Let's just say it in simple words that even the creators of the film have a chance to understand: it is a very stupid movie with an even scenario, lame animation and history more or less as original as pushpins. Do not bother - unless you have to find a way to entertain groups of mentally handicapped adults or very slow children. They could laugh, especially if they are from medicine. There is such a special kind of insult in the film - not only the filmmakers apparently think that children are thoughtless idiots who can be spanked, which cost about zero effort, but do not even try to break the sweat by gagging here and there, which an adult may find funny . This film, honestly, scared me away. Shame yourself for bending down so low.
