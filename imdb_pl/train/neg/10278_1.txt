the only worst movie I have ever seen in the theater. I saw this movie at the Austin 2004 film festival and I think this film was accepted for the festival. it was an interesting assumption and it seemed that it might go somewhere, but it just crumbled every time he tried to do something. First, if you're going to do a musical, find someone with musical talent. the music consisted of cheesy piano playing, which sounded like it was playing on a stereo in the room they were filming. the lyrics were horribly written, and when they were not obvious rhymes, they were rhymes that caused groans that showed how far they were reaching, trying to create this movie. and you would think that you will find people who can sing while making a musical, right? not in this case. fortunately, most of the time they were half talking / singing in rhymes, but when they sang, it hurt me. especially when they tried to sing in harmony. and it just refers to music. part of the acting was quite good, but many of the dialogues were awful, as were most of the scenes. apparently they did not have enough information about the scenes, or they just had a bad editor because they consistently jumped the line and used terrible choices when cutting the movie. at least the director was willing to admit that no one wanted a script until they added a hook that made him a musical. I hope that investors will make sure that someone can write music before making the same mistake again.
