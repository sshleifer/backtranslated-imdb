I liked the previous movie Ittenbach, which I saw, "Burning Moon". But while this movie was rather gloomy and nasty, "Premutos" seems to be mostly played with laughter. Although it is admirable how Ittenbach made the film without money in his spare time (and the DVD document is worth seeing), I discovered that I am constantly struggling not to jump to the next gore scene. Sure, it's gore, and if that's all you want, go and enjoy. But be careful: there is a huge amount of lame comedy and boring story. Many compare it to Peter Jackson's films, especially the "Braindead". But looking at what Jackson did on a similar budget in "Bad Taste", it is clear that Ittenbach is missing one thing Jackson has - talent. 3/10 (for quite good and abundant gore effects and for full use of limited resources - but not worth the price I paid for it)
