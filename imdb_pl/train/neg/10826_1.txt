I can not say it's the worst movie of all time, but only because there are still movies I have not seen before! It must be the most pretentious attempt to make a film of all time! The director suffers from the same problems that he had with "There Will Be Blood" (though he was not so bad in this movie. The whole movie seems to look like you're looking at a guy who tries to make an impression beyond his abilities). It's as if he was sitting in the chair of his little director and thinking "how big a filmmaker can handle this scene?" He simply does not have it in him. I do not know if this movie could be saved by a great filmmaker. certainly some size nuggets that could have been refined, but nothing has led to ripening. The scene in which all characters sing is the worst moment in cinema history. , I kept saying, "PLEASE, PLEASE, just do not have a guy on the verge of death singing!" Of course, a massive breakdown!
