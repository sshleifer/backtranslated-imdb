An unimaginably indecent turkey, a mixture of an anti-Nazi musical (!!), pre-war Americana and Agatha Christie, a sneaky trick with one big, big problem: it is deadly patchy. In addition to the one-digit I.Q. plot and dialogue, the most amazing aspect of "Lady ..." is throwing berserks. Gene Wilder (star and co-author) is trying hard: playing on a romantic stage (with his appearance !! and his age !! he and Woody Allen should set up a club for the unaware, without a mirror of aging comedians) and trying to be moving and funny, moving and wise, try to sing and dance and be successful in NONE !! A long shot from his good old days with Mel Brooks. <br /> <br /> For some time I thought that I fit myopia, because everyone in the film say that Cherry Jones is this very hot chick and that Michael Cumpsty is this amazingly handsome stallion !! The guy who plays Claire Bloom's male secretary is a balding thin actress wearing glasses, sexy like a chair and is the passion of two leading ladies !! The highest performance of Mike Starr as the most incompetent, loudest policeman you've ever seen deserves to be among the 10 most repulsive performances in the recent film history. The saddest thing is that we will see the wonderful Claire Bloom and Barbara Sukowa completely misplaced and offensive wasted. At least I hope that the two stars will pay their bills back home (and then release their agents) with this flop. No wonder the actress of the wonderful Sukka returned to Germany after seeing what Hollywood had prepared for her !! <br /> <br /> If you want to see how to achieve a really bad movie from a really bad script with a crazy casting director, study this one - otherwise stay away !!! - 1/10
