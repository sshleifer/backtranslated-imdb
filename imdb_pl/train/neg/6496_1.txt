This movie was a disappointment. I could not wait to watch a good movie. I am the type of person who starts the movie and does not turn it off completely, but I have forced myself not to turn it off. <br /> <br /> The only reason I did not turn it off was because I was a huge fan of Christian Slater and I wanted to see how to play it. I was really speechless after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie was one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Thank you, Christian Slater, for putting a bit of humor into it. If you were not in this movie, I would be bored with the mind. <br /> <br /> I also agree that Anthony Hopkins must stick to acting. Before the movie ended, I did not even get the story. I was confused and annoyed.
