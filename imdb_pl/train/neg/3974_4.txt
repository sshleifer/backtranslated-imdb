I agree with everything Calamine said! And I do not always agree with people, but what Calamine said is very true, it's time for girls to get on to better roles. I would like them to be successful because they were a very inspiring couple who grew up and would like them to grow up as people, actresses, in their career and personal life. Thus, producers should give girls a chance to develop something that is slightly different from the tangent, transfer them into a new direction, which recognizes them individually and their talents in many aspects. This film, which is commented on, is not so bad, but as I saw in their films, their films remain the same as in a typical story and typography. When in Rome is good for the audience of the younger generation, but the adults who were children, when the twins were babies, want to follow the twins in their successes, so I think that we, adults, would like to see them in various kinds of films, maybe a little like sixth sense, hour, chocolat, this kind of film - not to mention only serious movies for them, humorous ones too, but rather see them in different roles to what they've played in their latest films, such as this one and New York Minute.
