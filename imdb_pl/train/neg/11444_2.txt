SNL is quite funny, but people who say it's like watching a short sketch on SNL are a bit stupid. It's NOT like SNL, it's just stupid nonsense. <br /> <br /> Andy Samberg tries to act like Jon Heder, but he fails. Although Jon Heder is funny only in Napoleon Dynamite Andy tries his hand and people think that he is funny. <br /> <br /> Only funny people in the film are Danny McBride and Bill Hader. The only part that was quite fun with Andy was part of the pool. <br /> <br /> They could make "Quiet place" a lot better if they did not make the scene go off 3 weird minutes. > <br /> The part in which more H is pronounced is delayed. They've been trying to work with him for too long, and half the time it looks like Andy is laughing while he's acting ... he's a terrible actor and he does not deserve to perform in the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is a joke and is for people with simple minds with the brains of a 10-year level of comedy. Which is more or less half the United States.
