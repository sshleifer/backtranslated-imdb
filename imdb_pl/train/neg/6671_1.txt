I felt that this movie started well. Acting was in place and I felt that all heroes had a situation, even though the real family was not completely revealed. We've never had enough information about his father to really feel his pain because of all his involvement or growing hostility towards Tobe. I mean, you see in one scene how he admires her because of intensity, and in another scene she almost tears her head off. Another problem with the film was that at the end he was just unraveled and lost all the focus, and I begged him to end. Any film with such a long stretch and a painful ending should never get an automatic rating of 7 or higher only for the actor. We look at the above-average quality of the film. In the case of this film, the end is so bad that I seriously considered leaving the theater. This movie drew me in and then spat me out.
