I think this piece of rubbish is the best proof that good ideas can be destroyed, why all American animators think that children nowadays want stupid versions of good GI JOE stories? Looney Tunes are some of the most beloved characters in history, but they were not created to be Xtreme, I mean let's go on !!! Tiny Toons was a great example of how you can update an old idea without losing its original charm, but this piece of rubbish is just an example of stupid corporate decisions that only want to create a cheap idiot program that kids will love because hey !! ! kids love superheroes ??? the whole show is just a waste of time in which we see new versions of Looney Tunes, but this time in the form of a superhero, it does not sound too bad, but the problem is that this program tries too hard to copy a series like Batman animated series or a new justice league , result ??? bad copies of flash (road runner) or superman (someone else? horny bunny) the problem is that Looney Tunes were not meant to be dramatic, they were supposed to be fun !!!! As I said earlier, this series sucks, and many people wonder why anime is around the world? this series is trying to be dramatic and full of action, but this is something that several series and anime is able to do, if you want to see a good upgrade of the old program, watch Tiny Toons, this is an example that you can bring back old characters to life, but with good history and respect for the original roots. It is a pity that the show is no longer alive, another wise corporate decision.
