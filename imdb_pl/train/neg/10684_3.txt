This movie was magical. I was so emotionally uninvolved in every single character that the biggest antagonist of the films was alone. I played beautifully all the time; promising myself that I will leave, but only drink another beer, hoping that it will automatically transform into something immersive. Even in this state, I could not help but notice that Kuba's acting was as weak as tracing. His obsessive dedication to work was unconvincingly made, just like his one evening after his own idiot failure. Burt appeared on the screen as a general, it is true, general (who wears too much makeup). I got into a frighteningly quick drive to compete with Kuba, except that mine was real and I crushed my toe. Prize! Compensate my rotten fingers!
