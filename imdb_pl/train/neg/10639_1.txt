Mindless, unconscious, badly conceived, killing a career (where is now talented Angela Jones?), Deeply hilarious garbage. No wonder Reb Braddock has not directed anything else since then - anyone who has the chance to make their first movie on their own, based on their own script, with the help of Quentin Tarantino himself, and creates something like this, whoever thinks that THIS was a story worth telling the world, it does not deserve a second break. In these circumstances, performances are good - the actors do what they tell them to do and they do it well. They simply should not do it in the first place. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 4.
