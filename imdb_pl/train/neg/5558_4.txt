I will not take too much time here, I just wanted to say that Darkman 3 is amazing. I have all 3 on DVD, I added them to my collection of DVD movie sets. Darkman ranks there with the best, like Indiana Jones, Alien, Star Wars, Die hard, you understand. There are not many good horror movies, thrillers that take place there. A big thank you to all the crew and for preparing Darkman's trilogy. By the way, if you're wondering how I came across this on DVD. I bought it online, but it's region 4, as you know most American DVD players are region 1. If you own Sony Playstation 2, you have the best DVD player because it is the player of the whole region. Simply go to the settings and then select the desired region setting (1-9).
