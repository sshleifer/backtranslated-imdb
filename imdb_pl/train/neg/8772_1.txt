I have nothing new to say: 4 hours of people dying in a circle on the same hill. The cast was stellar, but unfortunately the producer / director / editor / God strayed. He should have eaten a modest cake (if not for his own good, and for men who died in Kargil), hired one of those great Bollywood directors, hired a real screenwriter, hired a real editor, hired a musician who was not somehow (and who he seemed to listen to some bad version of "Apocalypse Now" on some cheap Indian medicine), he hired a real professional team, threw away all the fireworks and told the real story. Unfortunately, like the devotees of the Indian army, he made decisions that were horrible for his actors and terrible for his audience. We all died over and over again. <br /> <br /> Please, do not do it again, Sir! Sushma Kathmandu, Nepal <br /> <br /> ps: The next time the Indian director decides to glorify the Gurkh regiment, I suggest to hire more than one Nepali to represent the team. Certainly a lot of Nepalese men work in Mumbai - the last numbers are 40,000 to half a million.
