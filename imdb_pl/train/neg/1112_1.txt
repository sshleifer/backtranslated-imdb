I like watching Western movies, but this film takes the cake. The script and dialogue are funny. Acting was awful, where did they get it from? The music was OK, I have to say. Fortunately, I did not buy or rent a movie, but it has now been removed. <br /> <br /> I was focused at the beginning when a stranger (Martin Sheen) started telling his story. I must admit that I liked the confrontation between Hopalong and Tex, where Hopalong fired Tex's finger and told him to practice for 40 years to reach his league. But then everything went pear-shaped. I had to watch the whole movie in the hope that it would be better, never.
