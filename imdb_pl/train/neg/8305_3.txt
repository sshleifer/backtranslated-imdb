Like most people, I love "A Christmas Story". I have never heard of this film and maybe for a reason - it's terrible. The same place, the same narrator, the same director, but lacked the warm stupidity of the original. Charles Grodin was a poor choice to replace Darrin McGavin, but I can not imagine anyone replacing him. History seems forced and lacks the sweetness of the original. Interacting with neighbors, Bumpuses, is ridiculous. In "A Christmas Story", Ralphie's obsession with the BB pistol seems cute, but his obsession with this film is boring. Scud Farkus, the original local tyrant, was replaced in this movie with another child with braces and a strange hat, but with a scant dismissal from Scud Farkus. It would be quite difficult to level the original, even if this movie was made with the original crew.
