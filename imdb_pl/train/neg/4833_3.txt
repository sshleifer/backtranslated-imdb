Yes, this movie is a real thief. He stole some shiny Oscars from Avatar only because politicians wanted another film about a war hero to increase acceptance (support?) For wars that the US are still fighting today. I really do not want to get into politics here, but give me peace, it's more bright than the summer sky. A dirty cabinet is really nothing special, no real plot. I really feel in Hungary in the 1950s when the party was telling people what they liked and what they did not like. At the same time, the same propaganda films were made, except that they were black and white. Even if we consider this title to be a reasonable element of the "US wars" genre, you certainly have much better films to choose from.
