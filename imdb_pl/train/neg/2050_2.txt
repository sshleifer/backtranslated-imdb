Not that "Ulli Lommel's film" filled me with hope, but I must admit that ZODIAC KILLER managed to sink my lowest expectations. Among young filmmakers, there is a recent trend of using digital video for their early projects, which is good and good to give these children the opportunity to create a job without spending all their money on expensive film material. However, many of these young filmmakers also took up the idea of ​​filtering the finished film so that it would look as good as celluloid. The effect is never perfect, but it helps. Unfiltered digital video only works in the "mockumentary" style because it never looks different than the video. This is the main problem of ZODIAC KILLER. Watching a movie is like watching a daily soap opera about a murderer. He does not want to watch the movie. And even more unforgivable is that Lommel is NOT a young filmmaker. He should know better. He should know that generating horror (and even tension!) Is practically impossible. For the love of God, this guy has been directing since the sixties! He may be the only director who has not been able to improve over a forty-year career in the industry. And fortunately, he also wrote the script! So you can expect intricate actions that mean nothing, unreasonable behavior and at least one truly pretentious element of the plot that will leave you completely unhappy. Please, please, skip this movie. You'll thank me later.
