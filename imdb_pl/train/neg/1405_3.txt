"A Damsel in Distress" definitely does not belong to Fred Astaire's better musicals. But even the bad Astaire movies have always had good moments. <br /> <br /> In "Damsel", Astaire is Jerry Halliday, an American music star who is in London on a personal tour. He meets Lady Alice Marshmorton (19-year-old Joan Fontaine), a beautiful English heiress who jumps in the back of the taxi he takes to escape the crowd of devotees. <br /> <br /> Jerry believes that Alice is forced to marry by her rich aunt. She tries to save her from her family's home, but soon discovers that the house staff bets for which Lady Alice will marry. Keggs (Reginald Gardiner), the butler, and Albert (Harry Watson), a little boy, alternately helping and sabotaging Lady Alice's romance with Jerry to make sure they win the bet. <br /> <br /> This musical has many problems. First of all, there is a story based on the novel P.G. Wodehouse (co-author of the script). History is slow, painful and nervous. When Fred does not dance, we have to endure endlessly annoying scenes: (a) Fred, affair with Joan Fontaine, or (b) Keggs and Albert dying against them and each other. <br /> <br /> The butler and the boy from the house are particularly annoying. They are one-dimensional characters of villains, guys you just want to hit on the lips. You want them to leave the screen and let Fred dance. <br /> <br /> Astaire suffers in the absence of his usual partner, Ginger Rogers. Joan Fontaine is the neuter leader in this film and is poorly manned in the musical. She has little character for her, except for her beautiful face and beautiful smile. <br /> <br /> George Burns and Gracie Allen are on a ride, as a publicist for Jerry and his ditzy secretary. The duo adds much-needed chemistry to the storyline, and Gracie has some fun lines, but it's also very annoying. <br /> <br /> The direction of George Stevens' movie is not well done. Sometimes the photos are terrible and out of focus. On the unusually misty streets, many outdoor scenes are taking place to convince the audience that we are in London, not in Hollywood. (In this movie they had to use a ton of dry ice.) On the plus side, the songs of George and Ira Gershwin are wonderful and have become the classic standards of songs. Of course, the dance in the film is unique thanks to Astaire and his choreographer Hermes Pan. <br /> <br /> But the music and dance numbers are badly used and badly staged. Sometimes it seems that the cast begins to sing and dance, because, well, it's time for them to start singing and dancing. Music numbers seem to be accidentally inserted into a meandering plot. (At some point, the butler goes outside the court and breaks up into an operetta solo for no apparent reason.) The numbers include:  "I am dancing and can not be worried now" - Fred is dancing well on the foggy, traffic-filled street of London. He makes a great "reed filming" with the help of a rolled-up umbrella - but the number ends too quickly when Fred jumps into a passing double-decker bus. (In the Broadway musical "Crazy For You" Harry Groener made a much better version of this issue with a group of girls with a choir.) <br /> <br />  "Put Me To The Test" - Fred, George and Gracie dance the three in English cottage. George and Gracie fit Fred step by step, but the number ends poorly when everyone digs for a reason. <br /> <br />  "Stiff Upper Lip" (number of the play house) - in the funfair home, Fred, George and Gracie play while dancing on the revolving floor, the rotating barrel and mirrors of the play house. It's the best number in the movie, but sometimes it gets a bit repetitive. <br /> <br />  "Things are looking around" - Fred and Joan Fontaine together make their single dance number in the film, spinning around the woods at the back of the manor. Fortunately, it's a very simple dance number, because Joan is not a great dancer. <br /> <br />  A foggy day in a London city - Fred wanders around a foggy mansion at night, humming about a foggy day when he met Joan in London for the first time. Sometimes it looks like he is not sure which way he goes in the fog - just like the musical number itself. <br /> <br />  "Nice job if you can get it" - a great song that is abused in the movie. During a social party in the manor house, Fred enters into a chorus of singers with a grim face who accidentally sing this song. Every time Fred joins, other singers look at him as if they want him to leave. (Again, Harry Groener performed the better dance number in this song in "Crazy For You").  "Drum Dance Number" - When Fred and Joan run away, Fred must stop and make the last number while knocking a group of drums. As usual, this is a great dance number. But there is absolutely no need except to extend the film. <br /> <br /> The most imaginative moment in the movie appears when Fred decides to jump off a tall stone balcony in a country estate to prove his love for Joan Fontaine. When he jumps off the balcony, he finds himself in a comfortable trapeze - it's true, * trapeze * - hanging from a nearby tree. Fred (or rather a stuntman in Fred's clothes) grabs a trapeze and moves away from him to the ground. <br /> <br /> The movie is worth having on DVD only for dance numbers, but you feel grateful to the guy who invented the Fast Forward button on the remote. The >> FF button lets you go through other, boring scenes in the movie to go to dance numbers.
