In one respect, it is the "Wizard of Oz", with Paris in black and white, and the Riviera in color. But it's about possessive love, destructiveness and moral collapse, when in reality it's about brand dresses, Riveria shots, lots of big expensive cars and musical and dance cutscenes that suggest Vincente Minnelli in one of his days off. The possibility of watching, but an extraordinary example of a desperate, dark material and a brilliant style in opposite directions. (Was this the model of "Talented Mr. Ripley? Does anyone sense the affinity between Jean Seberg and Matt Damon?")
