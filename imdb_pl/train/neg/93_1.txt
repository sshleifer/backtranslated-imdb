The woman asks for advice on the way to the mysterious city and hears two ghostly stories of a local freak, associated with zombies. But maybe fate also has something nasty for her ... <br /> <br /> Zombie Chronicles is absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever seen. In fact, I have to admit, so badly that I quickly shifted most of the rubbish. And there was a lot of that, believe me. It works only 69 minutes and there is still a lot of filler. You get some skinheads doing a lot of push ups, lots of boring kissing scenes between stupid teenagers (it's rhymed, tee hee) and some great examples of why some people should never become actors. <br /> <br /> As for the title heroes, even the footnote in the film is barely visible. In the intro you get more undead actions than the previous function! Although, considering the pathetic eyes that come out of the nests and eating the brain sequences (among other things, "delights"), it may be a blessing in disguise. <br /> <br /> And in addition, it looks like he has been filmed on someone's mobile phone for broadcast on Youtube. Amazing camera, scratches on print, flickering lights ... I had to rub my eyes when I realized that it was made in 2001, not in 1971. Even clothes and fashionable clothes look outdated by three decades! > <br /> If you think I do not have the qualifications to do a Chronicles review without seeing the whole movie, keep going. YOU are trying to sit through it, I assume you will not even be able to show blue and black colored freaks for the first time before pronouncing and leaving. It's really funny that whoever decided to spend it, and to be honest, it will be much nicer to relax with a drink on the disc than to torture a DVD player with this gigantic excuse for a horror movie. In fact, do not be surprised if you pack your bags and leaves in the morning, leaving you doomed to watch VHS tapes for the rest of your life. Takie uwrze≈ºony ... 0/10 <br /> <br /> Q. What kind of horror with 18 marks the woman is wearing during the obligatory sexual scene ?! You see, the movie can not even get this part ...
