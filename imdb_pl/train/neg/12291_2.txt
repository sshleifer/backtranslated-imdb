Humm, an Italian film starring David hasselhoff and Linda Blair, did not expect too much, to be honest and even less than I expected. This does not mean that the movie is the worst I've seen, because I've watched worse things than this, but the plot was mostly misleading and uninteresting, and some good gore scenes are the only thing that saves. Besides, you'll love some special effects, they are really bad and bad. Now, I just want to watch "The Troll 3" of the same director, it certainly will not be worse.
