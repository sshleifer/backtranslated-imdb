You know that you are in trouble when the movie you are watching has many alternative titles. Generally, this means that they tried and tried to hide the turkey on different markets. This turkey is The Brain Machine, which has seven different titles. <br /> <br /> It's about a super secret government project that is supposed to be able to use a computer to read people, but instead it leads people to kill each other or themselves, or something like that. It is filled with TV actors at level B, who are sitting in a wood-paneled room with grass chairs, trying to play a screenplay that almost does not make sense. <br /> <br /> It's a turkey with a bad taste. Avoid this.
