I saw this film two weeks ago in the "Festival des nouvelles images du Japon" in Paris. Although I did not expect much from him, I must say that I was disappointed, like many people in the audience ... if I would like to summarize how I felt, I would say that I compared Princess Mononoke and Nausicaa from beginning to end. Of course it's stupid. But I could not help it. The stories are completely different, but the presented worlds are very similar. From this point of view, the "palm tree" definitely can not stand comparison with Miyazaki's masterpieces. Even if it's quite good technically, the boredom remains ... in the end, its total lack of originality makes me not care about watching. I rated it on 2 out of 10 (a bit spicy, I think it deserves 3 or 4)
