When it comes to HEIST movies, this one is quite weak. Continuity is pretty bad, there is not enough character continuity to really feel that you understand any of the characters. Peter Falk is great and is one of the reasons to watch it. Falk has some great lines, for example: "He'll be back soon, he'll go to" buy some saugage "or something like that ... there are some nice scenes, although they are totally caused by the actors' efforts. Direction, scenario and editing are poor.
