The Marxist polemics of Jean Luc Godard is so close that it is impossible to watch the film, as one would expect from an internationally acclaimed filmmaker. Fragments of political theater, passionately boring and infinite, are intertwined with the creation of "Sympathy for the Devil" with the participation of Rolling Stones in the studio. <br /> <br /> The process of creating the song, from Mick Jagger playing a demo on an acoustic guitar, on back-lit vocals, is fascinating and it is worth to rent this movie only to see the pieces with Stones. Almost half of the movie is devoted to this, so thanks to the miracle of chapters, you can skip all the bizarre political skits and just watch how the stones put together the song together. <br /> <br /> When I had it on a laserdisc, I boldly tried to see it all, but I do not see how anyone could go through it. In the end I gave up and only jumped the chapter to the Stones segments.
