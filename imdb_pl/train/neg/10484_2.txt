Being a fan of Elvis, I can not understand how you can do it. It is by far the worst movie associated with Elvis of all time, completely ridiculous, stupid and a lot of mistakes regarding the King. Come, Elvis' grave in a public park? Memories of Suspicious minds in 1958 ... and these are just two examples. Some people in the cast try their best, Mike Starr is funny (especially as a performer), the Tom Hanks scene is a surprise, but the guy playing the young Elvis sucks. minute. If you want to see a very cheap, crazy, but absolutely funny, small movie related to Elvis, I really recommend you "Bubba Ho-Tep" instead of this mess.
