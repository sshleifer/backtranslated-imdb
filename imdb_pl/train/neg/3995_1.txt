"1408" is the latest step towards the tactics of cheap fear. The kind that can make fans of dating horrors from time to time jump into their place and shout in their ear, but disappoint the audience looking for a bit of depth and direction. <br /> <br /> John Cusak is a writer who made a career writing books describing his experience of staying in gossip haunted hotels. Despite the assurances of patrons and owners that ghosts roam the corridors, there are few reasons to make him a true believer in paranormal phenomena. When he learns about the history of Room 1408 at the Overlook Hotel - do not wait, I mean, the Dolphin Hotel in New York - decides it will be the perfect chapter closing his latest book. But Samuel L. Jackson, playing the owner of the hotel, is trying hard to dissuade the visitor from the narrative about the atrocities that have occurred in the room since the hotel opened many years ago. The story is simple and we, as skeptics, have to sit in Jackson's long announcements. <br /> <br /> In other words: be afraid! Be scared! <br /> <br /> Of course, it would be easy to convince the audience that they just paid to see the thriller from the edge of the seat, if you did not have to build up to this point for a long time. And also, if what happened was more than cheap "boos" that become so frequent and arbitrary that you can expect them eventually. The room temperature changes automatically. The walls are dripping blood. The intrepid writer can not open the door, etc. And after almost an hour and a half delivering their audience, he promised great emotions, you can sit down and hope that at least you can be delighted with the end. With suspicions about dream sequences and other derivatives of waste of time, even if it can not suppress our doubts that before the film ends, we can finally have something that will make the movie a little less than completely forgotten. <br /> <br /> Despite the great performances (as always) of Cusaka, which is essentially the whole movie, most of the remaining notes are wasted (eg Samuel L. Jackson) in insignificant minor roles. The real secret is how this film received such a high viewer rating. Ghost ghosts?
