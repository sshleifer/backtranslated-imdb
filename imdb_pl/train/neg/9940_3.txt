In the 1960s, as a background, she had a rehearsal and recording of "Sympathy for the Devil" in the classic album "Beggar's Banquet" of the revolutionary evil boy Rolling Stones? Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts, Bill Wyman and Brian Jones ?? plus Marianne Faithful, Godard reveals other contemporary revolutionary and ideological movements? black power through Black Panthers, feminism, communism, fascism - intertwined with reading a cheap political novel divided into chapters: "Rolling stones;" In addition to the black novel ";" Vision and sound "; All About Eve "," The Heart of Occident "," Inside Black Syntax "and" Under the Stones the Beach ". <br /> <br /> "Sympathy for the Devil" is another pretentious and boring mess of uneven director Jean-Luc Godard. Narration and reports are horrible, but fortunately I love Stones and Sympathy for the Devil and it's nice to see them on the beginning of their career, otherwise this document would be unbearable. the vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Sympathy for the Devil"
