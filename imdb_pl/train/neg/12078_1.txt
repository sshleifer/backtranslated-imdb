I literally fell asleep 3 times watching this movie. It is true that Shakespeare needs a certain way of thinking to be interested. But this film exceeds all barriers of long monologues, and what can not prevent many people from simply not taking care of a story based on Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> The biggest obstacle in this production is the total flatness of the character. Often when interacting between characters, it's difficult to tell who is who. Of course, I think that this movie is dubbed in English. Certainly they could get voice actors who could add a bit more drama to these classic, literary lines. <br /> <br /> It would be difficult to judge this movie larger than 1, although it may be based on prejudices perhaps in the age and what seems to be a very low budget. Nevertheless, it is absolutely painful and boring. If you insist on Hamlet, do yourself a favor and read the book again. 1/10
