He rented a blockbuster movie party yesterday, and it was the first movie I watched (it was late on a Saturday night, I wanted "horror fixes") ... Wow, it was awful, almost embarrassing, yes ... Stupid cranky story I really thought movies like Scream had put an end to it; amateur actors providing a stereotype and insipid dialogue, which is hard to believe, has been properly typed in and read from the site; and I've been capturing scenes that are not exciting (especially when they're in a movie that's badly written). <br /> <br /> But I've always believed that no film is 100% worthless. Here are some good things I can say about this mess: <br /> <br /> # 1 Bobbie Phillips: I love this actress. He is the only member of the cast who shows any talent for acting. The only reason I took the opportunity was that her name was on the cover. She releases her presence in this madness with professionalism, although at times she seems stunned to play in such a moronic story. <br /> <br /> # 2 Unintentional Hilarity: This is the kind of movie I remember when there were still home-made circles all over the country, and that was like rubbish like the third triple-bill movie with some prestigious thriller movie that was finally going inland. Unfortunately, in this age of direct viewing, most viewers have to endure these turkeys now without the common experience of being a part of sneering and throwing things on the screen because the movie is so scary. Co leads to ... <br /> <br /> # 3 Porn Stars Trying To Act!: Mainly at hand, because producers do not have to learn or beg them to undress for longer sex scenes, but this compromise usually means that they actually speak in a few lines that are to develop a story (other than "ooh yeah baby" or "harder!"). And, proudly, they all provide expertly looking stupid when they try to act. I would almost rule Ginger Lynn Allen out of this group if her character was not supposed to be an Irish mother, and she actually tries to accentuate sometimes, which only keeps smiles. <br /> <br /> It is nice to look for positives in all experiments and this is what I took from this cesspool known as "Bad Rasa"
