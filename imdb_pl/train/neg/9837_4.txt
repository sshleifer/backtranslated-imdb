This early John Wayne's western Lone Star has a bit more to be desired than what Wayne did for Lone Star until then. First of all, he has his old friend Paul Fix in it; Fix, being a much better actor than the standard villain Lone Star, brings to the environment a very desirable professionalism, instead of the usual hesitating readings of the lines often provided in these waters. The plot, of wrong identity, robbery of wages and murders, is as trivial and cursory as one would expect in a low-budget western 1930s, but Wayne's good looks, unmoved charm and the way with the line go far to make it more enjoyable. Plump, balding Eddy Chandler is not entirely credible as the female partner of Wayne, and about something that happens when Chandler and Wayne are going to fight for a fist that becomes tiring, a gag appears. On the other hand, interest in Wayne's love is played by none other than Mary Kornman, the little "Mary" from the early-known Little Rascals. She is an adult 20-year-old, blonde and cute as a button. Most of Wayne's leading ladies in these Lone Star / Monogram "B" were quite bland and colorless, but Mary is dashing, adorable and, yes, sexy. In the general store is the scene where he works, in which Wayne asks her to bring him a bottle of "nervous tonic" that happens on the highest shelf, so he must get a ladder and climb to the top shelf. Wayne looks at her little ass as he descends the stairs, and then as he descends, again a few miners, when he asks her to climb up and bring him another bottle, he is surprisingly racist for the 1935 movie. try to hide the fact that she definitely checks her ass. In any case, this is an interesting little "B", not great, but not as uncertain and random as many of his then-LoneStar productions. The final shootout is not so well treated, and Chandler after a while becomes a bit annoying, but all in all it's worth seeing, if only to see the charming and sexy Mary Kornman.
