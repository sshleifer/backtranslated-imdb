This movie was strange ... I watched it while eating a quarter of psilcybe cubensis (mushrooms). It was really strange. I'm sure you should watch this, but the mushrooms were not enough. I could not stop laughing ... maybe lsd will work. Film is a lot of things that change into other things and dance. It's really tacky for today's standards, but when it was released, I'm sure it was fine ... one of a kind. I could see how some people would think this movie was good, but I did not think it was very interesting, and then I was on mushrooms. If you have a party or something like that, and everyone is going to smoke, pop that you'll laugh.
