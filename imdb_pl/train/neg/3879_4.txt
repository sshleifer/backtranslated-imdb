Rebar is an astronaut who goes to the world's first space mission to Saturn, but of course it is a horror that becomes ugly and returns to earth as the only survivor. Afflicted by a strange state that causes him to slowly melt and lose his head, if he regularly does not consume the human body, he kills what apparently is the only nurse in the hospital and escapes to the neighboring city to persecute further victims. <br /> <br /> I liked the assumption, and the effects of monsters and gore are actually quite good, but the cosmic scenes are simply pasted together with the NASA material inventory, and the hospital looks interesting like a magazine. A very poor script, small character development and generally poor acting make this film nothing more than an average wave of the hand with the novelty of having a live candle as a killer, and more or less has its own effects to maintain interest. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10, only for the most die-hard fans of movie monsters.
