Even though he got some good press after playing at Toronto Intl. Film Festival, there were many reasons not to expect too much from it. One is a very low budget Canadian film. Two - it is written, directed and plays the main role of the same person (usually a bad sign, unless it is Woody Allen, George Clooney or one or two other respected filmmakers). But despite the fact that I watched him with reduced expectations, it still turned out to be a much greater disappointment than I thought. <br /> <br /> In short - bad script, bad acting, terrible directing! Do not waste time or money on this turkey. He claims to be a comedy, but I only laughed twice. Plus, there is horrible music glaring. Where from this note, I will never know.
