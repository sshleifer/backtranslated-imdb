It's definitely the WORST movie I've ever watched. I've seen some awful movies in my time, but those are taking the cake, no, wait, I mean the whole damn bakery. It is so bad that I believe that the word describing the way you will feel after seeing this cruelty has not yet been created. Please, do yourself a favor if you ever feel like watching this and watching thirty minutes of this annoying purple Barney dinosaur, then multiply it thirty times and you will still get only a small fraction of the terror you would be in the store for. In conclusion, I think you can really call it a horror movie, but only if you want to be frightened senselessly through the worst acting in business and a totally pointless story. <br /> <br /> A real rating, -10 Disgusting
