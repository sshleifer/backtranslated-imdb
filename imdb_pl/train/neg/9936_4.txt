I chose it for 50 cents at the flea market, I was very excited. <br /> <br /> I find it fascinating for about 15 minutes and then just repetitive and boring. <br /> <br /> It is nice to see Mick and the gang in his prime, I wish there were not so many dubbed dialogues that I could hear what they say and play. <br /> <br /> Skits are politically obsolete and incredibly naive and simple, sorted by poorly written Monty Python on acid. I spent more time looking at the fall of England from the late 1960s, and not at what was going on in stupid skits. <br /> <br /> This movie is a good reminder that times really change and what was important quickly becomes simple stupid. Good song, but now it has been played to death by this DVD.
