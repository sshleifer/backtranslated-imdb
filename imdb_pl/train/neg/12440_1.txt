This is the worst damaged brain, super cheap, super stupid, stupid, senseless piece of garbage I have ever seen, incredible garbage with an instant cult status among fans of quirkiness. If you think Ed Wood's "Plan 9" is bad, well ... I'll tell you, it looks like "Citizen Kane" compared to that. Special effects? ... again "Plan 9" is "Star Wars". Â¿Acting? Thor Johnson is Al Pacino ... so he really is angry. But if you're looking for such amazing videos, it's for you! I am an American International fan for so many great horror movies, Price-Corman-Poe saga and some great things related to blaxploitation, but thanks to "Star Creatures" they go down to level Z. Of course, my 1 in 10 works in reverse if you like watching bad movies for fun (the guy playing the Indian chief is great), so have fun and enjoy ... if you can.
