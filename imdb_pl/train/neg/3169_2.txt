This movie is one of the worst of this year. The main characters have no chemistry, and acting is terrible. Paul Rudd is the only one who has talent and the only one who is not annoying. I have never seen Desparte Housewives, so I do not know how Eva Longoria is at this concert, but in this movie she was terrible. It's as if she did not know anything about acting. All her character makes a whining about the whole movie, and she can not get away from reality and still be funny. And the other girl, Lake Bell, shows little emotion and it's like you're looking at memory cards when you read them. <br /> <br /> When it comes to history, it's just like a cookie cutter. From point A to B he passes with a small surprise. Much more could be used with Kate as a ghost. The plot should revolve more around her and the things she does as a ghost. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERSION: It's not worth watching.
