... and I actually gave ZERO on my personal 1-10 scale. I have been attending films since 1952 and have seen over 1000 in the theater (I do not judge films that I see only on television). This is the ONLY movie I ever evaluate ZERO. <br /> <br /> My wife and I took our four children (at the age of 15, 11, 8 and 6 years) and even the children thought it was terrible. In fact, my daughter (now 26 years old) notified me about this site (amazed that the film received an overall score of 4+). <br /> <br /> Animation of dinosaurs looked then amateur (and it is even worse in retrospect), acting (especially Sean Young) is horrible, and the plot is simply stupid. <br /> <br />
