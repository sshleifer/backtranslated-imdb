In the end, I could look at this experimental Lynch after such a long wait ... and unfortunately it was not worth it! Even for a stalwart fan Lynch I found it really boring ... <br /> <br /> nothing happens, there are long, long, long painful breaks in which nothing happens, long, monotonous speeches, where nothing He is not said, and the whole ends with the fact that the viewer does not know or care about what the hell was about what happened earlier and what happened later. <br /> <br /> There was an allusion to Mulholland Drive - blonde and brunette were very Diane and Rita-eque, and the moment of Lost Highway with allusions to some important event that happened, but you can not talk about it clearly. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, all this is very uninteresting and very boring, nothing happens, it is very forgotten and I think I will remove it from my computer and I will forget that I have ever watched it. I'm sorry, David!
