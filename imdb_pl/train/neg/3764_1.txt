This is by far the worst bigfoot movie I've ever seen, and probably the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. Actors and actresses were horrible and it seemed that they were trying too hard to play their roles as dork√≥w, tough guys, jerks, they knew everything, etc. And the great foot was terrible. It looked like it was a kind of computer generated image from Atari and Intellivision. At some point at the end of the movie, when the sasquatches army pursued the remaining survivors, one was shot and during his run looked like a poor donkey! One is hit with a bullet, and the blood that comes out of it was just a terrible animation. Another thing that was annoying was music. Way far too much music (classical score or whatever you call it) throughout the movie. It never ended. Oh yes, the movie is boring as well. Absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I highly recommend taking your $ 3 or anything else to rent this movie and spend it on a gallon of gas or somewhere on the menu value. TRUE AMAZING!
