This ABC failure on television has absolutely nothing to do with the brilliant fantasy novel that is A Wrinkle in Time. Mrs. Madeleine L'Engle led children and adults to a magical, fantastic and original world, like no author before her. This novel, the first in her "quartet of time", is a beautiful look at life, the universe and time. However, understanding this is easy for any child or teenager. His unwavering morality is common throughout the book. This adaptation of the film can only be seen as a mockery from the work of Mrs. L'Engle. Honestly, what were they thinking? The effects look cheap and funny, the story is muddled and uneven, dialogue is strained and almost every magical character of the novel has been lost. It was a terrible attempt to move this book to the screen. I sincerely hope that one day an intelligent, worthy director (Guillermo del Toro, David Yates, Alfonso Cuaron) will make another attempt to move this book to the screen and understand what it really is: a masterpiece. This adaptation can be compared only to the boring, false and cheap art of the motel, which has no basis and has no impact on the public.
