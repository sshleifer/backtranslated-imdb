I did not have any real expectations in this movie and I'm happy. Even if I expected it to be bad, I would be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Where to start? First of all, I think that 15% of the film consisted of footage of immobile scarecrows in the dark jungle. I understand. There are no scarecrows. I think the title "Scarecrow" was enough. <br /> <br /> Secondly, nothing has ever been explained about scarecrows and paranormal phenomena. Is there too many times when I leave WTF? <br /> <br /> Thirdly, the film is taken seriously. I am for film B with buckets of blood, screaming women and senseless violence, which is the result of a simple psychopath or an ancient curse. But these movies often know that they are B-type movies, and even they are asking for them, such as Dead Snow (funny Scandinavian zombie flick) or Evil Dead 2. But this movie seems unaware of his nonsense. there should be more blood and / or nudity. Yes, I said it. If you're going to have a horror movie, do it with homicide. And if you're going to have one hot and half-hot girl, one of them must at least show some side-boob. <br /> <br /> So, as the summary says, skip the Scarecrows and just poke your eye. You thank me
