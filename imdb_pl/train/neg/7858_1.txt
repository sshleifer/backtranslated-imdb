I appreciate the need to employ unknowns in this kind of "horror film", but they should at least hire the right actors. Especially the sergeant is guilty of using the monotonous to push each line. But let's face it, lines are not really important. There is not really a recognizable story, so most of the magazine contains the words f ** k, s ** t, m ***** f **** r and other different bad languages ​​instead of proper dialogue. <br /> <br /> "History", as it is, consists mainly of seemingly accidental gore and death, with a few crazy "surprises" that happen about 10 minutes after you see what exactly happens. Not only that, but there are a few glaring holes and continuity errors (Why are they coming in? Did not he have a gun? He was not dead?) So he makes the whole movie seem like he's been shortened by a few hours to fix them . <br /> <br /> Another movie that just relies on blood and blood, not on a real cinema experience.
