AntiTrust could have been a great tool for Rachael Leigh Cook, but the director has cut out his best scenes. In the scenes in which he is, he is simply a zombie. She is involved in a sub-storyline similar to the sub-storyline in "Get Carter", but deals better with the sub-story in "Get Carter". (I blame the director) The tribute to the director for Hitchcock was trivial. (This is a scene in which Ryan Philippe's character realizes that he may not be able to trust Tim Robbin's charity, at least I think it's a tribute to Hitchcock.) The DVD shows scenes that have been cut out, do not listen to the test audience.
