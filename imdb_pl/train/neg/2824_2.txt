I am a big fan of Porsche, and the car was the best star in this film. <br /> <br /> Haim, now a dried-up child star abusing the 80's drugs, is bland as usual and comments back with smaller characters / actors would be pointless; Needless to say, everyone was very average. It's a nice movie as a journey down the 80s - with strange clothes, good shots from Colorado and a very harmless, though mind-numbing mind. <br /> <br /> All in all, please do not waste your time watching, unless you love movies from the 80s, Corey Haim, or like me, I love the old school Porsche (especially this one looks great) because life is too short, to watch shitty movies.
