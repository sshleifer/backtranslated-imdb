It should not be a shock to you when I say that Alone in the Dark is a bad movie. Simply put, it's as if the monster is slimming, eating the result and then vomiting. The final product still eclipses this movie. <br /> <br /> Seemingly based on the ancient (!) Atari video game, the movie has something else to do with the portal to the entrails of the earth, the release of demons and ancient civilizations. Something about the existence of two worlds, darkness and light. (Guess who is ours.) Oh, and 10,000 years ago a truly superdupeted advanced civilization opened the portal, demons appeared and exploded, and then destroyed civilization. That is why we have never heard about them, conveniently. <br /> <br /> Christian Slater, perhaps praying for Heathers and Pump up the Volume, playing Edward Carnby, a paranormal investigator who happened something bad when he was 10 years old. It's hot on the trail of one of the artifacts of this advanced civilization. Carnby was once part of a secret institution called 713, which tried to find out what happened to this ancient civilization. But Carnby believed he would not be able to find the answers he was looking for, so he left the group. <br /> <br /> But look, these beasts are outside, and their prey in various ways, such as how to gut, divide them in the middle, implanting neurological control devices in them, or simply turning them into deadly zombies. Yes, this is another zombie movie. <br /> <br /> It's more or less distilled so that I can make a story. It's quite intricate and incomprehensible. In similar films, you can see a fearless explorer / adventurer step by step, and when the audience is mentally connected to the researcher, it's a lot of fun. But when scenes change from attack to attack without perspective or context ... not so much fun. <br /> <br /> Acting is terrible, with the exception of Slater, who (though he almost seems embarrassed that he is in the movie) showed that he was able to transmit the working load. He had to; get it - Tara Reid has been cast as a museum curator! Honestly, I thought I'd seen a casting life when Denise Richards was cast as a nuclear physicist at Tomorrow Never Dies. But Reid fits here for Richards, shit emotions for shitty emotions. The most important events are Reid pronouncing "Newfoundland" as "New Fownd Land", Reid delivering most of his lines in a dazed, throaty monoton (a bit like being on an all-night bending machine for the last week before filming), Reid - a museum curator, remember - a lot You spend the film in jeans with jeans. Oh yes, she was as credible as Jessica Simpson, giving stock quotes. Oh, why do the pretty ones have to be so stupid? (Note: I do not think Tara Reid looks so good, it looks like she is in constant need of food.) Almost everyone else in the cast is completely forgotten, except maybe Steven Dorff, who played Burke, one of the leaders from 713. Dorff's character was not very well developed, but there was nothing in the film, from sets by character to Tara Reid. But digression. <br /> <br /> In any case, this amazing and totally ridiculous story is so difficult that the movie moves at such a breakneck pace, but the director Uwe Boll throws a furious, hideous soundtrack; it's so loud that you can not hear what the actors say in some scenes! This can not be true. However, given the level of the game, maybe thanks to Mr. Boll thank you. <br /> <br /> Oh, and funny note. The initial moments of the film include a narrative ... words crawling on the screen at the same time. Do you remember the first Star Wars? You heard this famous Star Wars theme while the prologue crawled. There was certainly no need for a narrative; why do I need a doofus to read what's on the screen for me? Did the producers just look for the blind? Maybe this explains why the soundtrack was so loud - they also looked for people who were hearing impaired. The narrator inexplicably also had a lisping effect on the first few creeping lines - and then he lost it. Bizarre. <br /> <br /> Alone in the Dark is a loud, stunning mishmash of horrible acting, incoherent scenario and direction. Almost no one is calling. There is so much chaos that the audience simply gives up their care for the heroes and the roots of their deaths. Even in the dark, demonic creatures appear cooler and much more developed in comparison. <br /> <br /> Ironically, because there were only three other people in the theater, I watched the Sam in the dark. I wonder if Uwe Boll planned it that way? I can not give this lowest rating, because from the beginning I had little hope for it - and because I've never caught up enough to think about it. It's awful, though Slater is buying back a bit.
