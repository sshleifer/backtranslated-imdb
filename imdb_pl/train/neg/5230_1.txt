Although Robert "Knox" Benfer has his fans, I'm not one of them. His films are innocent and amateur, and they are simply not too fun unless you are 14 years old with an underdeveloped sense of humor. <br /> <br /> He certainly is not famous, because his immature fans would like you to believe, harassing people on Wikipedia or filling out grades in IMDb here. Certainly, he was not profiled by any major media, which testifies to his "glory" of his and his work. <br /> <br /> Benfer has a slight ability of limited animation, but he must escape from his youth to show off and learn to write something really funny before he is taken seriously as a real artist. At the moment, however, she is just a child with a camera and it shows.
