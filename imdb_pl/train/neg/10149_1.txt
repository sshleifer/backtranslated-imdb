I can not believe that Steven Segal's career has hit so low that he was limited to making films with a fourth degree with supporting actors. I watched this move, expecting to see him as shit in some people, as usual. When it is reduced to the use of a single judo chop between the shoulder blades to remove the opponent, and the guy falls like a ton of bricks, something is wrong. <br /> <br /> The plot is unbelievable like a movie, and even if you forgive visuals and read this story as a novel, you would wonder why you even took the book. <br /> <br /> Steven Segal makes moves and it seems that he is doing it only because he is obliged. It does not show any effort or enthusiasm, and in some scenes it does not appear at all. <br /> <br /> I hate to repeat other people's comments, but using footage for cutting scenes and visualizing airplanes on the fly is pathetic. The condition of these scenes, which are cut, is shaky, and the scenes seemed to deteriorate over time. The prosecution film depicting the assassination of President John F. Kennedy is more stable and cleaner. <br /> <br /> In my honest opinion I would like to say, not to waste time watching this movie, it does not correspond to the standards of his work, the man's glow or the exit wounds. I read one review saying that the movie has a budget of 12 million dollars (Segal receives 5 of this) and that the film is still in the budget. I have to agree. <br /> <br /> No wonder it's a movie directly on DVD, because no conscientious theater owner would play this movie.
