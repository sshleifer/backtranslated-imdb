Wow, this is very unusual in one respect: usually the first movie in a long series of sequels is the best of the bunch. People are surprised when the sequel is actually better. With Tarzan, I thought that this movie was the worst of the group, or at least six that make up my DVD Tarzan Collection. I'm happy to watch sequels many times, but thanks to a few characters I'm sitting in this turkey. <br /> <br /> Let's start with a good news: <br /> <br /> GOOD - A lot of actions with many wild animals on display, even if they are just a movie material. You see the attacks of lions, crocodiles, hippos, panthers, you call it, and you see several different tribes of all kinds, including pygmies (in the movie called "dwarfs"). Since the movie was made almost 75 years ago, I can not let go of any realism because they did not have it in movies that long ago. They do everything in their power to reconcile with actors talking against false backgrounds. However, Weissmuller did a lot of action scenes and he was in great shape. He and O'Sullivan make up a well-built handsome couple, if they've ever been like this in the Golden Years of cinema. <br /> <br /> The movie is of historical value (with so many sequels) that it shows how Tarzan acquired Jane and his beginnings of learning English. <br /> <br /> The BAD - From the moment when "Jane Parker" is taken by Tarzan, almost every scene with her is Maureen O'Sullivan in hysterics, screaming and screaming scene on the stage. That's enough to give you a headache and destroy the movie. Fortunately, it calmed down in sequels, but not in this movie. The film is also not conducive to the painting "The Great White Hunter" as C. Aubrey Smith, playing in Jane's father, and Neil Hamilton, as "Harry Holt", a safari guide, shoot every animal in sight, or animals are dangerous or not. These people are killed - happy, especially Smith. On the other hand, it is a pity that there is nothing here that would explain how Tarzan must be in the jungle. There is no story about him or a record of his growing up. It's there when Jane and the group reach a point in Africa.
