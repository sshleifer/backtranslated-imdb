How many more fake "pieces of life" do you have to do? I hope not too much. <br /> <br /> Raising Victor Vargas is a very conscious attempt by director Peter Solett to catch Hollywood's attention. There's nothing wrong with it. What's wrong with this film is that it ignores the audience and overlaps every stereotype in a book about allegedly "nervous" independent Hollywood production. <br /> <br /> To be "real", so leave the camera "documentary style", except that no documentalist would shake the camera intentionally ... <br /> <br /> It's "sharp", so let's not waste time lighting the film. <br /> <br /> It's "hip, so let kids use curses like Al Pacino in Scarface ... <br /> <br /> And so on, and so on. All you have left is the self-conscious attempt to impress Hollywood, which will not impress anyone except the "rarefied" independent crowd who still seem to enjoy every bad movie.
