Daddy Danielle is a ghostly old witch who torments his loving and unconscious family out of sheer malice. There is some subtext that may apply to the French colonial past, but it is mainly Danielle who does various things (eg, purposeful abandonment of a small child in the park), which would soon have a man who raised his teeth with broken fingers. Unfortunately, this does not happen here. It looks good and acting is fine and there is nothing wrong with the concept, but it is so SMUG. God, do you love this movie? It is a pity that he is not as smart or as funny as it seems. The only impulse in the series - sorry, the movie - comes from Danielle, which is becoming more and more unpleasant and unpleasant, and the only surprise is watching the more unlikely ways in which it does. That's right: just like in a sitcom, that's the way it is, with an additional "bonus" of size delusions and a 110-minute working time.
