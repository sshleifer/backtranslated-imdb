This is one of the worst films ever. I like bad movies, but it's just awful. Where are the photos in the movie that are on the box? I think more money was spent on illustrations of DVD boxes than on the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Why would the company release a DVD that is so confusing? I feel like an idiot for borrowing this movie only on the box. Although I met IMDb, I should do some research and make a list before visiting my local video library. I do not have anyone to blame me, except me. I want my money and time back. <br /> <br /> DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM. <br /> <br /> Even if curiosity motivates you, instead, keep in your eyes cocktail umbrellas. It will be much nicer. You have been warned!
