This film contains an outrageous way to confuse and manipulate Americans about Islam. It's a shame that the people who did it really believe that Americans are so stupid to believe it, maybe as an American citizen, every person must protest against this kind of nonsense. If you want to know the truth about Islam, do not let anyone tell ... THE PURCHAS IS PUBLIC! you can read it yourself and decide if what they say is true or false ... <br /> <br /> The film uses many audiovisual strategies aimed at manipulating and associating things that are not even related. Music used in some places prepares the audience to hate what they see, even if they do not really understand what's going on. They use images that are lost in their original content. <br /> <br /> To finish the comment, I would like to reflect ... Do not you think that you can make the same movie with every religion in the world?
