Another of many almost forgotten films made by Poverty Row in the 1930s, resurrected by DVD magic. <br /> <br /> Action cast Universal player Lionel Atwill (often an auxiliary actor in Frankenstein's many films) twins involved in the murder racket. One kills victims (brokers involved in cheating) and asks witnesses for the exact time while the other is deaf and turns out to be "innocent" because he could not talk to witnesses. <br /> <br /> Of course, where it will fall apart, if it's inborn deafness, will not both be deaf? Oh, well. <br /> <br /> Atwill will do a pretty good job here, pretending is deaf and mute. Unfortunately, no one else here can really act worthwhile.
