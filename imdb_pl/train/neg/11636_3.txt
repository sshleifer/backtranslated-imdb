I'm not going to waste time writing an essay and wasting my time. However, I would like to say that all those who are anxious even in this film are completely ridiculous. Johnnyacbest, you can not play this card, and I mean the patriotic card of nationalism, so people will not watch this movie. it is a movie that expresses its free will in this country (oh, I played this card), although the director is a German and deserves to hit the wrist every time he reaches for the camera, but the world is full of controversy, and the same, what you've heard before, like the GTA controversy. It's comedy, laugh and be disgusting, not outraged together, its dark humor and of course you do not have the heart to take it, the past is past, so people remember those who died, but it's time to move on, it was !!! 7 !!! Years ago. You can still watch this movie and have good moral values. <br /> <br /> Besides, I'm crazy, and who needs a soul?
