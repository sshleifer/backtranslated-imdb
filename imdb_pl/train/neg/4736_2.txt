The movie deserves 2/10. 1.5 stars for a girl, (sorry I'm biased, I think a pretty girl is the only climax of movies) and 0.5 for being shorter than Azumi 1. I watched Azumi 1 and 2 in 1 settling. I was surprised that I could sit down. <br /> <br /> Let's talk about the benefits of the movie. Girl. Ueto Aya is adorable. That's all to save the whole movie. The fact is, if the main character was a man, I am sure that most people (including me) would not touch the film at all. <br /> <br /> Now let's talk about negative points. First of all, it's a real draggy, with lots of repetitive scenes. The Nachi and Azumi scenes keep coming back. It looks more like a dramatic way of photographing. Typical Japanese dramas love flashbacks and this movie. Second, the film is too unrealistic in its historical surroundings. I do not mind unrealistic films. But this movie is like a bad way to show creativity, throwing ninjas that act like bears and spiderwebs, etc ... reminds me of Shinobi, although Shinobi is a movie with fantasy settings. What's more, to present "I do not know" what the effect is, the director films people dying with spraying blood (literally) around ... people who do not realize that their head has been cut off ... etc. Etc. etc. etc. Too many of them spoil the show. It seems that the influence of this anime is strong in this movie. It significantly degrades the program. Third, will not Azumi be a killer? It seems to me that it reminds me more of a single-person army, only that it is a woman. I do not think you'll see assassins in military camps. The only time I felt that she was acting like a "killer" when she killed Kiyomas Kato at the end of Azumi 1. Finally, the plot was thin in both films. It is a linear plot without development and surprising in any way.
