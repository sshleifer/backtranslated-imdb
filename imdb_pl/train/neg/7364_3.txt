In 1692, Salem, a lying child with a lie about the slave's involvement in witchcraft sends the confusion of the entire community. The costume drama with Claudette Colbert and Fred MacMurray is not sultry, although it is not a vivid picture of contagious hysteria. Works on three writers (Walter Ferris, Durward Grimstead and Bradley King), elements of the story are rather interesting (especially coming out of Hollywood in 1937), However, anyone who has since read Arthur Miller "The Crucible" melodrama at the exhibition here does not will be tolerated for a long time. The biggest problem with the picture may be in the casting: Colbert and MacMurray are unmatched pair of lovers who are hindered by the witch hunt, and MacMurray is too modern to be in this environment. * 1/2 of ****
