First watched on 8/3/2003 - 2 out of 10 (Dir-Brad Sykes): A mindless 3-D movie about zombie-eating the body in 3 stories in the film chronicle. And yes, we see a zombie eating human parts of the body in 3D !! Wow, no !! It was done again and again in 2D in the zombie movie, but what usually makes the zombie movie better is the basic story, not the actual eating of the body. This made the original zombie classics good. The meat food was simply thrown in as an extra. We are bored by most of this 3-part chronicle due to poor (as in the semi-dark zone) easily understandable and slowly shown finals. The last story is actually the story the movie started with (having a reporter investigating the so-called ghost town) and of course we also see a zombie eating meat in it. Well, I think I said enough. Watch the classic, not this three-dimensional feast.
