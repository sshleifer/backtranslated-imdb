Shortly after watching this film, I questioned the mental skills of every actor and actress who took on the role. Elizabeth Shue is a praiseworthy actress, why would she take advantage of such an overrated occasion? However, I must admit that the loan is due. Some moments in the film were unpredictable and rather frightening, but almost did not compensate for the virulent perverse tendency of Kevin Bacon, Sebastian Caine. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, a woman or a man who has any form of self-respect.
