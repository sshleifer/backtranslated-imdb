After watching the highly censored version of this movie on TV many years ago, I was curious to see what the non-editable version looks like. I was surprised that it was more reliable and well preserved than I remembered, but one thing really stood out. I think other reviewers have mentioned it too, namely, what is the nature and motivation of Chris Sarandon? Have you previously raped other victims? Is he completely psychotic or "average" sociopath? How did he expect to escape the attack on his younger sister? Is this character credible at all, or is it just a matter of additional background? It seems that almost simultaneously is unpleasantly credible and too crazy to be able to maintain a teaching job that puts him in touch with young, vulnerable girls. It seems that this is the biggest complaint of viewers in general. It has nothing to do with its performance, which is terrifyingly convincing. The film takes an uneasy position between pure exploitation and semi-serious treatment of the subject, not quite settling in any of the modes. Not the worst film ever made, but not so good.
