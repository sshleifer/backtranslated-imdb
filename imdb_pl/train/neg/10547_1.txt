I do not remember the movie in which I was less concerned with where the characters came from, what was happening to them and where they were going. I realize that Hollywood's greatest pastime is watching the navel, but these people are either too wicked or too boring to spend time with them. As far as it is worth, the discussion that followed the show, under the auspices of the Key Sunday Cinema series, took into account the fact that probably three women exhibited certain features of redemption. I do not agree.
