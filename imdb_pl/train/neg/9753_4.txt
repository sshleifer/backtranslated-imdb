I am grateful for one and only one thing - that this woman will now be thousands of miles away on a completely different continent !!! Yay !!! This program perfectly summarized how obsessed Victoria Beckham became with herself and her family in the media in the name of self-promotion and "Brand f * cking Beckham". <br /> <br /> A few years ago I used to love Posh and Becks, I still admire David's talent, but I do not have any respect for him anymore. How can you respect someone who has the hand of a wife who pushed him back, working like a puppet. <br /> <br /> It was clear that Victoria's hand was after Beckham's premature departure from Manchester United and now the same applies to Real Madrid. I hope Beckham can live with the fact that he can earn millions of pounds - he sold his soul for American Buck and end his game days for the team that will fight for promotion from Division One in England (without offense America - but in Baseball and Basketball - you do not have football!) <br /> <br /> In any case - digression. It's been many years since I've seen such a stunning, completely false performance of "Posh" - it's the crowning only during her remarkable performances on the red carpet after "defeat" Rebecca Loos, when instead of throwing all cr * on David, he deserved to stick to his arm, trying to save the million pounds that her marriage has become. <br /> <br /> This whole feat of PR was pathetic. Why can not she just go quietly, support her husband with the biggest mistake in his career and keep her head down? When she became so full of self-esteem that she felt that moving to America should be wrapped up with this huge fare for the fans? <br /> <br /> By the way, I saw David Beckham's document yesterday. At least he kept a piece of grace and humility. Two things that his wife could do with education. <br /> <br /> One more thing Victoria - you complain about continuous racing through the mush. A little hint - stop throwing them away about your whereabouts, stupid woman. <br /> <br /> America Good Luck !!
