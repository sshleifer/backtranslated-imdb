I'm amazed at how many comments on this series are about how "real" it is. Maybe I'm not part of the same universe, because if Veronica Mars is something, it's in a big way. <br /> <br /> The actress chews the scenery with enthusiasm and the storyline has holes that can be driven by the truck. This is not what I call the real one. <br /> <br /> It is so sincere in her desire to be "essential" that it only shows how rob Thomas and his employees are cut off from reality. <br /> <br /> Generally, I think it's a nap-fest at best, and even a bit annoying at worst. Kristen Bell looks like she can be a good actress, but it's hard to say that she is oversized throughout the series.
