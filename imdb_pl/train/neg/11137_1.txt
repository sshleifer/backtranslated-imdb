All the naked women in the chest in the world could not stop me from hitting the stop button about one-third of the way through these terrible garbage. With mocking acting, equally horrible script and weak CGI FX effect; this film is an insult to the Werewolf genre. This is supposed to be serious, which in itself would be fun if the film could even lead to evil. apparently competent, but too lazy to do something even a quarter. Avoid at all costs and watch one of the classic Werewolf movies. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10!
