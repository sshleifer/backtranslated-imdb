Dragon Fighter is the first Sci-Fi channel (although it seems to me that it's now called Syfy?) The original movie I've ever seen. But I've seen one or two others since then and I can tell you that they were stupid, but this one really scrapes the bottom of the barrel. CGI is badly done, the action is bad, the script is ridiculous, and what happens at the very end is unexpected and out of place (if you've seen Dragon Fighter, you probably know what I mean, put a spoiler in my review). Plus, there was one melody that was used in almost every dangerous sequence. It was really stupid; they just played it over and over again. And it is certainly not original; I know I heard it somewhere before (I just do not remember where). This should be avoided.
