I used to love this film as a child, but seeing it even 20 years later, it really sucks. Up The Academy could have overtaken its time in 1980, but today there is almost nothing to offer! Movies like Caddyshack and Stripes are doing better today than this steaming dog. No RCP. No great jokes, except for one liner that we've all heard a million times. <br /> <br /> I recently bought a DVD in the hope that it will be a jewel that I remembered. Well, I was WAY off! The soundtrack contained only 2-3 universally recognizable hits (not the compilation others have mentioned), and frequent recordings were horrible. The only thing that was interesting to me was to predict the lines of the characters before they said them. Yes, I watched the movie so many times! <br /> <br /> The only reason I'm writing this review is to give my two cents why this movie should be forgotten, I'm sorry to say that. :(
