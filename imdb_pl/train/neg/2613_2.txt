This continuation is completely uneven, inconsistent and uncontrollable in the "plot" (if it really is) and is too damn difficult to be modern (prevails funny, beyond periodic and characteristic songs in the style of the 21st century) and adorable (yawning: there are too many produced , pronounced jokes with animals.) Actors in his film are secondary to the thread of minors. Even Glenn Close (and usually he's very good) is watching this movie, parodying himself as the original De Ville and leading from Sunset Boulevard! It's a movie that you do not even want to look at. This is a very good example of a bad and aimless continuation. Even Basic Instinct 2 had a storyline, characteristics and acceptable action. It is not so. It's bad.
