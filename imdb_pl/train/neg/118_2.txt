It is said that this is a personal film for Peter Bogdonavitch. He based it on his life, but he changed everything to suit characters that are detectives. These detectives meet beautiful models and have no problem getting them. Sounds more like a playboy millionaire filmmaker than a detective, right? The whole film was written by Peter, and shows how he has no contact with the real people he was. You should write what you know and he did it. And leaves the audience bored, confused and jealous. It's a curio for people who want to see Dorothy Stratten, who was murdered right after filming. But Patti Hanson, who in her real life married Keith Richards, was also a model like Stratten, but she is much better and has a bigger part. In fact, part of Stratten seemed forced; added. It has little to do with history, which is quite complicated. In conclusion, every character in this movie is someone with whom very few people can tie up, unless you're a Manhattan millionaire with beautiful supermodels on call. For the rest of us, this is an annoying snoring. This happens when you are not in contact. You entertain your few friends with inner jokes and bore the rest.
