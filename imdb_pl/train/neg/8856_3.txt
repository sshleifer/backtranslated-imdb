Lee hosted the 100th anniversary of the horror film for Ted Newsom and talked about the movie werewolves. He said something about how his only brush with lycanthropy was The Howling II, and then joked: "The less you said, the better." Indeed, he was right because this movie could be the worst in the entire catalog of screen shows. The first Howling Joe Dante was a groundbreaking movie of werewolves with its amazing special effects and abundant sense of style and theme. It was a film that should be taken seriously. Like other good, original films, the creators of the movie for some strange reason thought that even more campaign sequels are needed than what worked the first time (see CHUD and then CHUD II to illustrate this point). This movie is miles and miles from the first on every front. There is nothing terrible about it. It looks cheap and is black like most major scenes. Lee is the only actor in the movie that is worth mentioning (okay, I'll give Ferdy Mayne). Lee looks embarrassed when he speaks a mindless dialogue and does funny things (check it out, ending with him and Stirbie). Lee looks incredibly tired and knows what it is, which is a little more insightful than the two leaders who leave America for Romania. History is not worth investigating here, and it can be assumed that there are very few stories worth mentioning when you have to have Stephen Parsons and his band Babel, who play most of the movie in the beginning, and the end with this horrible noise. Sybil Danning is here and, yes, he is distracted once, and then we show the scene again and again - said one of the reviewers 17 times (I counted ten - but until then I could get so bored). I gave the film three stars, but it really deserves zero - the three I gave were 1 for Lee and two for the contribution of Mrs. Danning. Yuck!
