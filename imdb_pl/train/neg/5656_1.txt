Ziab la ta'kol al lahem is a horrible movie. It's just a superposition of scenes without a clear link. The action is also very bad, despite the presence of a good actor, such as Ezzat El allayli. But in this movie, something really astonishes, speaking of sexuality, emancipation of women, naked scenes are very rare in the Arab cinema, even nowadays. I really congratulate the director and actors for courage. We want to see more of this style in Egyptian films, but with better quality. The reasons that prompted me to vote for the film as horrible are not only the script and acting, but also the lack of professionalism. This movie looks like an amateur. We see a lot of errors on the screen. If you want a good Arabic movie Ziab la ta'kol al lahm is not recommended. But if you want to encourage uncensored movies in the entire Arab world, watch it and make your friends and family do the same.
