My first question after watching this movie was: "Why the title LIAM?" If the intention was to tell stories from the boy's perspective, it was not well done. Of course, the camera angle was used in the boy's scenes, but a significant part of the action took place outside his field of view. Having a "main" character incapable of speaking (which, of course, suggests a silent, powerless position of a child) makes it difficult to give this character a lot of depth. is characterized by the use of stereotypical characters, exaggerated emotions and language, simplified morality and conflict "LIAM matches this definition to T. The viewer is hit by typical stereotypes of the Catholic Church fire and sulfur in the stern marm school and a well-fed priest clutching money from parishioners. (The stereotype becomes very tiring.) What's more - Jewish heroes are lenders and factory owners! <br /> <br /> Much of the film was predictable ... Who did not think she'd see Theresa scrubbing the toilet after her mother told her, "No daughter will scrub another woman's toilet!" I'm a fan of British realism if it is well made. In my opinion, LIAM is not. <br /> <br />
