As someone who has read the book, I can say that it is much worse than the great American version of Gwyneth Paltrow. The reasons for this are different. First of all, Emma is too unpleasant. Yes, he has flaws and is not the easiest person to like - but the viewer should not begin to despise her. Secondly, Mr. Knightly is unsuccessful. His thoughts and melancholy in this version are better suited to the adaptation of Bronte or Gaskell than Austen and cast the mood of the entire "off" scandal. Third, Samantha Morton is too strong an actress to be degraded to the role of Harriet; and why was she made to look so bad? Harriet is supposed to be blonde and flourish - do not look as if she was going to be abducted in the next scene. Fourth, the structure has been swept and cut scenes. In the end, when Emma decides he loves Mr. Knightly, it turns out to be completely surprising, because this narrative has not been properly shown and transferred to the whole movie. Fifth, what exactly happened with the accent of Mrs. Elton? It sounded like an American actress trying to suppress her own accent at the beginning, after all American women in the middle and then back to English at the end. Finally it stretched at the end. The book and the big version of the film ends with the wedding of Emma and Mr. Knightly. This version is misleading after the wedding announcement, without showing us the ceremony. <br /> <br /> In total, a rather random attempt. Instead, read the book or rent a Paltrow version
