I usually do not write reviews, but I do not understand why it is so highly rated and I wanted to warn horror lovers, because I can only assume that all these high ratings were given by average television watchers. <br /> <br /> I only watched the first two episodes, but the two were so banal that they were not even funny. the same old stories that you've probably seen / read a few times - live toys, bad things from other dimensions ... and it's not just that these stories are not innovative, but also quite bad versions of these stereotypes. I would prefer, for example, "Chucky" and "Silent Hill" during these two episodes at any time. and do not even ask about visual effects ... those in the first episode are fine, but in the second episode ... awful. it looks like some film student project went wrong. blood ... or up ... erm ... nothing worth mentioning. <br /> <br /> it may be interesting for some ten-year-old kid who probably has not seen so many horrible stories (although I would rather recommend "unbelievable" - now that's what I call a decent mysterious television program). but for fans of adult horror it is worthless. I gave only 3 points, because in reality there is a little beautiful picture (especially in the second episode) and some cool acting.
