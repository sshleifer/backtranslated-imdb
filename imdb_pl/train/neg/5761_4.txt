Hollywood does it again. A lot of money, no creativity. I'm sure the writers wrote something other than oxygen. Based on the announcements, I thought it would be a funny movie. But if you hate the latest stupid pop culture, you will lose most of the stupid humor in this movie. Why waste time. You can sit on the log, do nothing and have more fun than this movie will provide. <br /> <br />
