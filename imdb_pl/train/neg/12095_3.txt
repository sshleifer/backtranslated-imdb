Elfriede Jelinek, not yet well-known name, is a Nobel Prize winner in the field of literature. Her novel spawned a film that won the second prize in Cannes and the highest prizes for male and female leads. Am I a dinosaur in aesthetic matters, or has art become so weakened that something is happening? <br /> <br /> "Gobble, gobble" is the favorite orthographic representation in the UK of bubbling noise produced by turkey. In the movie world, turkey is a monumental flap measured by cash receipts or critical reception. "Gobble, gobble" and The Piano Teacher are perfect partners. <br /> <br /> The embarrassing horror of this praised film can not be overrated. It starts very badly, as if it disturbs the viewer. Loans break unimportant scenes for over 11 minutes. We present Professor Erika Kohut, apparently an alter ego of the acclaimed author, a stony piano professor. He lives with his robust and masterful mother. Dad is an institutionalized madman who dies invisible during the action. <br /> <br /> Reviewing a piano teacher is difficult, except to record his unpleasantness. What we see in the film (and can read in the book, as far as I know), is a tacky, exploitative, nonsensical story of an emotional pendulum swinging here and there without moving further. <br /> <br /> Erika, whose name is minimally used, is initially shown as a person with intense musical sensitivity, but otherwise completely suppressed. Not really, because in two steps a handbag appears with its gritty maman, which ends with an abundant apology. If the reviewer has to (yaw) extract a theme (why not use a pretentious word when it gets simpler), Elric's rapidly changing mood would be it. <br /> <br /> A young hunk, Walter, learning to become an engineer of "low voltage", whatever it is, and playing ice hockey in a few moments off, is also a talented pianist. Elrika meets in an old-fashioned recital in a luxury apartment in Paris. In the unchanged form of so many plays, he falls in love immediately and starts with "cherchez la femme". <br /> <br /> Repressed, Erika liked hardcore pornography, shown briefly, but graphically for a few seconds, while she sniffs a handkerchief from the trash bin in the private booth she is looking at. <br /> <br /> Walter performs an excellent interview and is reluctant to accept Erika as a private student whose teaching style is characterized by remoteness, hostility, discouragement and humiliation. <br /> <br /> Soon he declares his love, and before that he chases Erika to the ladies, where they engage in gentle, damn demented and incomplete oral sex. Erika retains control over her merciful swain. He promises to send him an instruction letter for further pleasant exchanges. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, overwhelmingly jealous of Walter's kindness for an upset student who literally has shit before a future concert, Erika fills the student's pocket with broken glass, causing serious wounds on the delicate hands playing the piano. <br /> <br /> The next big stage (apart from genital mutilation, etc.). Walter's apartment appears, which Erika shares with her mother. Erika wants to be humiliated, bound, slapped, etc. Sensible Walter is for now relegated and goes away into the night. <br /> <br /> At this point, it's almost an hour to go. The viewer can only be afraid of the worst. Erika follows Walter on the ice rink where he practices ice hockey. They go to the back room. Lusty Wally is not able to resist the hands pulling her pants. His "little sauce" is soon expelled with a different stomach content. Ho hum. <br /> <br /> Excited, but fascinated, perhaps wanting revenge for the insult so recently paralyzed on the floor, Walter returns to Erika's apartment. Do you know what is happening now? It is not too deep or difficult. Yes, he becomes a brute, while Erika becomes a victim. In an instant, he closes Maman in his room and pats Erika, the next he kicks her in the face, makes sex with her and renews the declaration of love. <br /> <br /> Am I unfair in this summary? Watch the movie if you like, but I advise you not to. <br /> <br /> Everyone can see eternity in the grain of sand if it is in the right mood. I could deal with the difficult presentation of human relationships transmitted by this film if I wanted to. But "I prefer not" because it is a cheap and nasty movie that speaks to basic instincts and says nothing. <br /> <br /> I should say that Erika oppressed by her parents longing for love, ineffectively looking for her in pornography misses him, when he appears literally, pink and pulsating, under the nose, he realizes with a delay that he does not like hurts, blah, blah, blah. <br /> <br /> The world is, for reasons that have not been explained, I stopped it. Apparently, he's leading a monster out of someone who seemed superficially loving - but we all know that every man is a potentially violent rapist because it's his basic nature, however he tries to tell himself and the world differently. <br /> <br /> Finally, if you have patience to be there, there is a small surprise. Before going to the final stage, where she is supposed to act as a substitute for a student's underwear soiled with torn hands, Erika packs a knife into her purse. For Walter? <br /> <br /> Yes, you are in front of me. It sticks into any life-threatening area and does not go away. Roller credits. <br /> <br /> If he gets the second prize at the Cannes festival, how bad were the other entries?
