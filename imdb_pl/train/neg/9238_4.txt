A one-stop comedy that probably gives modern feminists the edge. Betsy Drake, a department store clerk, is in love with the idea of ​​children and marriage, placing her hopes in women's magazines until she spies on the super-bait in the form of the elegant bachelor Cary Grant. The rest of the movie goes from one trick to the next, as the relentless Drake chases her quarry. My guess is that the word "perky" is almost the sum of Drake's approach to the role. She has a charming smile, but after 20 minutes of memorizing her prostheses, I started to overdose. Grant's role is basically secondary and minus his usual talent. However, there is one scene that almost saves this slim exercise. Drake asks poor Grant after his lecture in a respectable ladies' room. Here her dashing way has an unforgettable freshness that is really extraordinary, and if production did not rub our nose in this optimistic smile for 90 minutes, the movie could be more than just a dream of a girls' camp, around 1948.
