This movie should be number one at the bottom of 100. Acting is so horrible that when my son and I watched him, we almost fell ill. And the story is worse. I could go on about how bad it is, but I really just wanted to add a warning to the frankbake review, because I see that no one else has taken the trouble. Do not waste time, money, energy or anything else in this film. Thank God we saw it on television, so we did not spend anything on it. If we were forced to write people responsible for this abomination and be forced to throw executions in their general direction. In conclusion, I would like to say that I have always liked to watch Carrie Fisher's act. However, I am sad to say that it is not worth watching in this particular film. Do not spoil your opinion of Carrie by watching her.
