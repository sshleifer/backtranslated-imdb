Ok, let me say that I did not expect the film with Jerry Springer to be a movie gold, everything I asked for was a movie ... and it was not like that. It looked like bad home movies. He worked poorly, wrote scripts and filled the nudity of the most unattractive people I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The "plot" of the film focuses on a low-class family that decides to "Jerry Farrelly Show" to discuss many issues between the mother, daughter, stepfather and daughter's fianc√©e. From there, the film trembles and evolves into a unique experience: pornography with white garbage. Is sex, sex between each other, even sex between Jerry and his wife? (Yuk!) This movie encouraged me to escape the theater and get a second circumcision. At least it was fortunately short. Disgusting and humiliating. African-Americans and the American working class should be offended. (Howard Stern should be happy, he did not waste his attempt on the movie star. His was wise, funny and funny) <br /> <br /> MY GRADE: F + (daughter was hot)
