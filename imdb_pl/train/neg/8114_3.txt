... mainly because Ju-on 2 can boast the scandalous material FORTY minutes, literally taken straight from the first Ju-on - and when you think the sequel works only for 76 minutes, you leave 36 original minutes' value of the movie. Ho-hum. I found it very irritating - as if viewers simply did not remember the same things! - Not to mention nausea, having to look again. <br /> <br /> OK, this complaint aside, the by-pass for Ju-on 2 was about explaining many unanswered questions from the first video that, to be honest, over 36 minutes, just does not go far enough to create any sense of the very intricate plot of the original. <br /> <br /> But there are really cool new sequences of horror movies that show how good the movie would be if it had some time to grow; and some of the questions asked by the original - some, but not all - are given. <br /> <br /> So in conclusion - if you've loved the first original movie and want to see further changes in history, go for it - but remember to hold the remote control in your hand with your finger on the forward button for forty minutes.
