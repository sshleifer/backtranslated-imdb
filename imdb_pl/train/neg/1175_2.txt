Much has been done using the Rohmer digital technology to "fill" the background. Sometimes it works well, a scene in which Grace and her maid's witness from far away executions of the king are particularly striking. Another time, it gives the film a weirdly amateur look reminiscent of a home movie. The main disadvantage, however, is that the artificiality of the scene creates an alienating effect in the viewer. We know that what we are watching is not real, so how can we feel about the character? Honestly, I did not care what happened to you or the prince. <br /> <br /> Another serious drawback, I am sorry to say, is the performance of Lucy Russell in the lead role. It's in almost every scene, and the success of this movie depends on its performance. OK speaks a foreign language, but is unable to express real emotions. Emotions in the scene in which she talks about her friend, Mme de Meyler (excellent debut performance of Helena Dubiel), seeing her head on the pole, caused embarrassment in the audience. Also watch her hands when she expresses emotions! <br /> <br /> All in all a very disappointing movie, especially considering the positive reviews on this site.
