National Lampoon was once a fun magazine. Regardless of whether you liked Stoner's hippie days of the late sixties, or the self-satisfied and brazen coke days of the seventies (when the comedy was strengthened by a lot of naked babes) depends very much on the date of birth, but everyone agrees, the early eighties, the age the middle killed all sparks of anarchic humor that the drugs did not have, and victims such as this movie and increasingly horrifying spin-off records were firing more holes in the hull. In addition to the nicely illustrated sequence of titles, there is absolutely nothing that would recommend this extremely depressing stinkbug. If you manage to go through the surprising segment "Growing Myself", hoping that everything will improve, it is difficult - no. Whoever thought the woman was brutally raped with a stick of butter deserved comedic gold to give him a head on the dish with a dog-sized mess. If there is a global shortage of guitar blocks, the negative sides of this chaotic, incoherent bag of rotting ideas and terrible performances can serve a purpose.
