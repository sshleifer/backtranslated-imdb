Tom listens to one of those old radio programs, something that kids from the '50s would be watching on TV today. However, they did not broadcast television when this drawing was made, so people got their entertainment - from comedies to music and scary stories - from the radio. <br /> <br /> Tom literally shakes in his shoes, listening to the story about the "phantom". In fact, he literally does everything the narrator says, such as "hair at the end, icy chills racing in her spine, her heart beating in the throat" etc. Jerry in the meantime watches Tom and laughs at his fear - Cat Antics. <br /> <br /> Then we get to know what we will see for many years after this 194-comic in which Jerry tortures Tom for no other reason than sadistic pleasure. If a cat asks for trouble, it's one thing, but when it has its own business in mind and Jerry is physically (and in this case mentally) abusing it, it's hard for me to cheer on a "little guy". <br /> <br /> These early T & M efforts were also one minute longer than all the next ones. Sometimes one minute makes a difference. He did it here because it really lasted for some time. It could be shortened to five minutes without losing anything, because the sketches lasted too long. It's typical for Tom and Jerry. They are usually faster.
