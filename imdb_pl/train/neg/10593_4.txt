In the infamous "classic" Plan of Ed Wood, 9 out of space is outraged by a stranger who calls the human race: "... stupid! Stupid, stupid stupid! "I have to say that the exhibition A in this process would probably be this movie, a ridiculously stupid science fiction movie. <br /> <br /> Falling action star Jean Claude Van Damme returns to the role of a hit for him from the original movie, Luke, a former Universal Soldier who is now doing really good universal soldiers. While Van Damme was too big to repeat the role in the first two sequels, he was too small to do anything else before the fourth movie from the Universal Soldier series appeared. So, probably cursing under his breath all the way, he kicks and murmurs and grimaces for ninety minutes of explosions and karate kicks. You will find many mindless acts of violence, but I advise you to get the coats to the brain at the door when you start to watch this thing. Otherwise, you can forget where you left it before it ends. <br /> <br /> Luke is called to action against other Universal soldiers after a really REALLY evil computer named Seth (makes HAL look like Ghandi) turns all other universal soldiers into evil, merciless killers. Of course, this is what these things are programmed, but in this case they kill their creators, not the "enemy", so this is a problem. <br /> <br /> I love the stupid logic of this movie. A logic that believes the supercomputer would create a body that looks as embarrassed, like Michael Jai White in this movie. The logic that requires the creator of Seth to be a blue-Italian cyber-stereotypical maniac who regularly spits out cliches than Old Faithful, he steams. Logic, which has a climactic karate fight, consists of two characters kicking each other through ten separate panes of glass breaking over three minutes of the screen. <br /> <br /> The film also features a dangerous daughter, wrestler Bill Goldberg as a wrestler disguised as a Universal Soldier and an affair to which I became attached, I think that writers on romance were really GOOD. And when this movie ends, it ends. Not a minute passed from the gigantic final explosion. No epilogue, no where they are now, no final kiss, just an explosion, a hug, an end. Even the creators want to get out of this as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> Although it is not Plan 9, US: TR is a silly little action movie that would be fun at parties full of noisy fans, Van Damme, who like to see how their hero really reaches new depths. You can not see him seriously.
