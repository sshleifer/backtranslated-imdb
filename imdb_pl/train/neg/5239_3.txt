I watched this movie based on very positive reviews that I read about others here. <br /> <br /> They must have seen something in this movie that I have not seen, that's for sure. <br /> <br /> The movie starts at a good pace, and the first 15 or 20 minutes is interesting, then it starts to log in and drag, not to mention completely unbelievable. <br /> <br /> In the end you find yourself saying: "What?!? Will he do it too? How far will it go with this thing? "<br /> <br /> The story begins with the character of Jeff Goldblum, John, entering the delicatessen to buy a bottle of wine. There was a theft, and a new salesman, Auggie Rose, was killed during the robbery. <br /> <br /> John gets into the ambulance and goes to the hospital with the guy. It seems a bit too big, but wait, there is more. <br /> <br /> John becomes totally obsessive about Auggie Rose. <br /> <br /> For reasons that never make sense, John, who has a very good life, beautiful, loving girl, safe, well-paid job, nice home, nice car, expensive suits - decides that I want to be a loser, like Auggie Rose, and experience life in low-paid jobs, living in a landfill with a skimpy girl and possible connections with dangerous people. <br /> <br /> clever, half-baked movie has positive reviews I will never know. Sure, Goldblum does a good job - he always does - and his appearance has improved with age - but if you do not have the GREAT enchantment with Jeff Goldblum and you do not need to watch every movie he's in, I would not recommend this turkey. You will not come back in two hours of your life - and believe me - you will not be grateful when these two hours are over, except for gratitude that you are still not sitting there watching this movie! <br /> <br />
