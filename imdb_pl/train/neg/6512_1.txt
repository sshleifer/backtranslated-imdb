Without being related to any kind of film and the healthy recognition of documentary films, I can honestly say that I was angry at myself that I was bothering myself with the seat the entire length of the "20 Date". I will not waste time on the story, you can read other reviews. I will say that despite Berkowitz's hyper, the style of Woody Allen was very annoying. Or you regretted not taking coffee or swallowing sedatives. For Berkowitz, it is obvious that this film was a bad idea, because its fragments describe in detail the process of financing a documentary. Forgive me for concealing insults as compliments, but I admit to Berkowitz that he has the ability to convince an idiot to fund this awful piece ****. I appreciate the limits and intentions of the film here, but even when it comes to the standards that Berkowitz sets for himself, he fires and misses on all levels. Finally, I'm sure that many of these companions were not on a date with a crazy filmmaker who wants to be a filmmaker, and that's why I'm questioning the film's sense of authenticity. Hey Myles, I loved your movie for the first time when I saw it ... when it appeared as an episode of Seinfeld or was a movie directed by Woody Allen or Kevin Smith.
