CAT O'NINE TAILS (Kod Il Gatto a Nove) <br /> <br /> Image format: 2.35: 1 (Cromoscope) <br /> <br /> Sound format: Mono <br /> <br / > (35 mm and 70 mm prints) <br /> <br /> A blind journalist (Karl Malden) hears a plot of blackmail outside the genetic research laboratory, and later collaborates with another reporter (James Franciscus) to investigate a series of murders in the lab, unconsciously placing their loved ones at the mercy of a psychopathic killer. <br /> <br /> They entered production after the unexpected global success of their directorial debut THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE (1969), Dario Argento invented CAT O'NINE TAILS as griallo-thriller in the same spirit as his predecessor, toplining the famous Hollywood actor Karl Malden - fresh after appearing in PATTON (1969) - and the rising star Franciscus (THE VALLEY OF GWANGI). Unfortunately, the resulting film - whose ads were "nine times more tense" than "Bird" - is a disappointing continuation, immaculately photographed and stylishly made, but too shapely and pointless for overall consumption. <br /> <br /> Malden and Franciscus are perfectly watched in friendly roles, and the cinematographer Enrico Menczer (THE DEAD ARE ALIVE) uses a wide frame of Cromoscope to convey the hi-tech world in which the dark Argento scenario develops, but the thread involving Euro Starlet Catherine Spaak (THE LIBERTINE) as the romantic interest of Franciscus is not much more than an unnecessary complement. The most important thing is an unforgettable meeting with a black gloves killer on a crowded railway station (edited with an elegant assurance by the iconic filmmaker Franco Fraticelli) and a nighttime episode where Malden and Franciscus seek an important clue in a crumbling grave and fall victim to the devious machinations of the killer. But despite these brilliant glitters, the film moves aimlessly from one scene to another, gently boiling, not even returning to the boiling point. It is not surprising that "Cat" failed to imitate the uncontrolled success of "Bird" when it was released in 1971. <br /> <br /> (English version)
