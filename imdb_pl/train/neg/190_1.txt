I always thought that a good movie should have a story. In this particular film, one was missing and I feel that it would be more effective with a story. It was even worse because it seemed to last forever; I wanted it to end eventually. However, I noticed that it was only 123 minutes; I felt like four hours. Not only was there no story, but the film also lacked a significant conflict. This is not the worst movie I've seen, but I used to say that I saw "The Fast And The Furious". So do not think that my opinion comes from someone who does not need anything but acting. Actually, I hate most action movies today; just this movie is on the other side of the spectrum. There is not much going on in this movie. However, the decorations and costumes were nice.
