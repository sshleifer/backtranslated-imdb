I went to see this movie with quite low expectations, thinking it would be a nice piece of fluff. Unfortunately, it was not like that. I could barely sit in the movie without wanting to leave. I went with two children (aged 10 and 13) and even they asked, "How much more?" After finishing to the end I was wondering who would approve this script. Even the infallible Fred Willard could not save a banal dialogue, state jokes and a banal plot. I suggest that anyone who wrote and directed this movie (I use this term loosely) should take part in a screen writing lesson or submit it at a local college for a movie lesson. At least there are many books on directing, screen writing and film production that would teach them something about structure, story, dialogue and stimulation.
