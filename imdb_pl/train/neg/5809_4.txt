I do not understand why the filmmakers are making this film. <br /> <br /> The movie from 1972 with McQueen and McGraw is almost classic. Steve McQueen was an outstanding actor, and Baldwin is just an insufficient actor. There is no passion in his game. The action in the original "Getaway" was fantastic. But the remake has no action! It's almost boring, although filming in 1972 was more difficult than in 1994. <br /> <br /> I do not understand how Baldwin imprisoned me from Mexico. I think it's a mistake in history. <br /> <br /> So I think there was no need to remake, or if they decided to convert the classics, they must choose the perfect actor for the first role, like Johnny Depp or Brad Pitt ...
