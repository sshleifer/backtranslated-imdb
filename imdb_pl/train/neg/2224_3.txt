I saw it for the first time when I was about 7 years old. I remembered what I thought was a vague outline of what had happened. 15 years later, it turned out that I remembered everything with great accuracy, because it seems that the writers never went beyond the outline of history. There is no plot for this movie / cartoon. There is no development of characters, stories, character arcs, nothing. Good guys do different things because they're good, while bad people only do everything because they're bad. One of the involuntarily funny parts is the death of someone you consider important and does not care. They simply shrug and move on. There is also almost no dialogue. If you cut battle scenes and running scenes, you lose 70% of the movie. <br /> <br /> Watch this because you want to see good animation and for no other reason. Or, if you like to look at scantily clad hot cartoon chicks (or scantily dressed hot cartoon guys).
