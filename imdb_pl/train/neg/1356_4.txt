First and completely and confidently, I do not agree with the user who calls it "falsification". Crispin Glover takes his film very seriously. He personally introduced the movie at a show that I saw in Chicago. He has been working on the film for years and is the first of the intended trilogy. "What is this?" This is an attempt of the artistic film Crispin Glover in the style of those who love Herzog, Lynch, etc. <br /> <br /> I heard the rumors about this film many years ago, "an epic porn video with the whole cast down, directed by a crunchy glover". When it finally came out, I looked at the on-line trailer and read the summary, and I foamed in my mouth impatiently. ... I went to Chicago to see it and it was a huge disappointment. If he took out a stupid sh * t, such as grandma's grandmother and dancing dolls, he would have stayed with something much better, but only about 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> In other words, just watch the trailer, have fun and leave it. There are several striking images and fantastic combinations and phrases, but lack of focus is a disappointment.
