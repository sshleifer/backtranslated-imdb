I noticed that "Fire" was on the cable that night and I started watching it because I could not remember anything special except that I remember it was a horrible movie when I saw it in '85. Twenty years later, the movie is still awful. In addition to the synthesizer, the saxophone was the most abused instrument in pop music in the 1980s, as can be seen in the title track. Hearing the song again, I wanted to stab a screwdriver in my ears to put misfortune on them. To combine this musical attack, Rob Lowe's character played the saxophone, and there was one scene in which he played a solo, and he was like Charlie Parker, only his keen tone and the game more like a monkey playing kazoo. All characters were very unattractive, although I must say that they did a great job, throwing equally uninteresting actors to present them. Actually, I thought Mare Winningham was appealing and I felt regret at first because she wore funny underwear, but at the end of the movie, she decides to have sex with Rob Lowe, who will probably be chosen to transfer the diversity of sexual diseases if such things have been voted .
