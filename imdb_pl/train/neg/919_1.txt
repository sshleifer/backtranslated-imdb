Although I must admit that I was laughing a lot more at watching this movie than the last few comedies I saw. <br /> <br /> The budget had to consist of a pocket change of actors. The production values ​​are so low that they actually make viewing a pleasure. It reminds me of a Robot Monster made up of a guy in a gorilla costume with a cardboard diving helmet. <br /> <br /> In one scene, the unfortunate victim cuts off his arm and leg. Shit, it's hard to believe, but the Black Knight scene of the Holy Grail was more realistic. I wondered why the victim did not start shouting "None Shall Pass" and "It's just a body wound, I had worse." It was one of the funniest scenes I've seen in the last year. <br /> <br /> "Gladiator / demon" was also a stitch. Between the monstrously cheap costume and the geeky look of the guy in him, the final result was hysterical. <br /> <br /> Really a movie that is bad enough that you can watch it. Something like seeing a car accident in slow motion on the film. <br /> <br />
