I'm not going to pack this movie for a whole lot of technical f | u | c k u | p s, it would take two days to figure out how the whole thing is not even possible. Others have already pointed out all the significant stupidities. <br /> <br /> Considering all this, I could still enjoy it if only they did not include all the weird, nauseous, annoying, sentimental nonsense that is so out of place anywhere, but nowhere more than in space, where the smallest the error can mean instant death. <br /> <br /> The "crew" as well as the "real" astronaut were equally guilty by putting all their stupid nonsense over everything else. It completely ruined all the value that production could have. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that NASA has released this trash so that so many people will receive so much disinformation about something so important to them. If you have not seen it yet, save yourself the irritation. See again Apollo 13. At least he tried to be a bit real.
