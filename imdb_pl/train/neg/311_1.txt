I just finished watching Going Overboard. I must say that we should send every copy of this film to Iraq and make them watch. I even tried to get the blind women to watch this, and she turned it off in about 20 minutes. Adam Sandler could not find a better project than this one? As for writing, if you want to name it, those responsible should be forced to watch this movie forever in hell !! I believe I read somewhere that the budget for this movie was $ 10,000 and they could not get it. Did Wallmart handle this well? Each store has a large basket of this shit that sits on the sales floor. The only good thing about this movie is that you can use a DVD as a stand or turn it into a friend, but then they may not be your friend anymore !!
