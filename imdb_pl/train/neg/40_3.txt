A model named Laura works in South America when she is kidnapped from a hotel room by a gang and taken to the jungle. They are demanding a huge ransom for their release. Peter is hired to secure her home, and is a bonus for him if he can get back the money as well as the girl. Peter is taken by helicopter to the jungle with his friend Jack. They try to give the hijackers false money in exchange for Laura, but the plan goes terribly bad and they have to jump out of the helicopter. The helicopter was shot, and they also have to fire him (so far not good). Also, the jungle hike is a kind of devil. In fact, this is just a naked black guy with strangely large eyes and a breathing problem. He begins to kill several hijackers, and Laura escapes only to be caught by some of the primitives. The rest of the movie is really a bit indistinct. <br /> <br /> Now I'm not a big fan of Jessa Franco, in fact so far it's only his second movie I've seen, but even I can say that it really is not one of his best efforts. Movies are running at a rather slow pace, without a major event. The whole could be easily edited in a 25 minute television program. There are many exaggerated long shots of people passing through the jungle, which could have been simply raised. <br /> <br /> Devil Hunter is poorly lit (in fact I do not think he's lit at all), badly baptized, poorly behaved and slow, but for some reason he did not bore me. I think the main reason for this was some of the funny, bad scenes. For example, the scene in which Laura walks along the street was, of course, shot on a real street, when crowds of people stopped looking straight at the camera as her shooting. Another funny scene has one of the gang that was killed, hung on a tree with dripping blood, when one of his friends stands directly under him, shouting about what seems like minutes. Then for no reason a man in the tree's head just falls down and hits the guy under him. You have to believe it. Then of course there is a real devil. This is just a naked black guy who, despite having massive eyes, has very blurred vision. <br /> <br /> The movie was included in the video part of terrible fear in the 80's here in the UK and was banned. Now why I have no idea. There is very little gore and this is not a shocking movie. Minus nudity I would say that you can run away from PG almost. The only thing I can think of is that it has never been viewed and has been added to the original list because of verbal words. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to watch this movie really unless you're a huge fan of Jess Franco. There are plenty of nudity that you do not fall asleep, as well as some scenes that are so bad that you can laugh at them, but on the other hand I would say that you simply pay for a ticket to South America and get lost in the jungle. It would probably be more fun. <br /> <br /> 3/10
