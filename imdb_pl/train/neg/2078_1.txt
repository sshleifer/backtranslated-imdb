Yesterday I went to see this movie and although I did not have much hope for this movie, I was still bitterly disappointed! Actually, I can not believe I spent 96 minutes of my life watching this movie ... it was so bad !!! The plot was shameful and the acting was terrible (though it had big names like Uma Thurman). This movie strongly relied on its special effects ... but they did not affect me personally. I sincerely wished that I would never watch it, and I strongly warn everyone to watch this movie. It's a total waste of money, and then you'll be disappointed. My advice is to save money, go shopping, treat yourself, just do not go and see this movie ...
