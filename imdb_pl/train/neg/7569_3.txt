It definitely suits the period in which Axis and Allies played spy games in most of North Africa and the rest of the world. This is not the best movie, but certainly not the worst budget movie, as described earlier in the War Classics compilation. <br /> <br /> Duncan "Cisco Kid" Renaldo was really very good at one of his first feature films. I really liked the performance of Harry Parke (saved as Parkyarkarkus). Why he never got bigger roles, he is beyond me. He played the role of a perfect partner / partner and recorded the film ... imho. <br /> <br /> As mentioned above, this movie was part of the Superbox-Mart budget package called War Classics. Eight films for eight bucks, including others never heard from movies that have decent stars trying to pay bills. <br /> <br /> This script is ... well, not so hot. Editing and photos are ... worse. If you can miss all this and want to see the future Cisco Kid and a great helper, who, unfortunately, never met his real potential, definitely choose it! Otherwise, there are other films from the times of World War II. <br /> <br /> -Thunderossa.
