Sistas in the hood. I am looking for revenge and bling bling. With the exception of the eaves, this is a wild western city at the end of the 19th century. When I grew up, I do not remember such westerns. What would Randolph Scott say? If he saw Lil 'Kim, he would say, "That's fine! I must admit that I just tuned in to see her. and they're fine. <br /> <br /> Now do not look for any important story here, and the usual things from the criminal ghetto play here are in a different place, and when was the last time you heard John Wayne calling someone "Dawg"? And I do not remember the Earp brothers hugging and kissing before they marched to OK Corral. <br /> <br /> I watch this on BET, so I missed the action, which is the rating of R, but I doubt if I will buy a DVD to see it, unless I can be sure it's Lil 'Kim in this action.
