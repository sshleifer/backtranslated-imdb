For me, every work is to be judged according to these criteria: form, function and meaning. Guernsey seems to be devoted to forms: nice shots and sometimes interesting acting. Long close-ups suggest a function that the viewer can fill himself. Due to the lack of texts, history becomes a quiz. An introvert person suggests to have depth, but sometimes it turns out that he has nothing to say. This movie works like an introvert. If you have not read the summary, you do not see that it was suicide (and the question is unanswered Why?), Which changes Anna's view of life and makes her suspicious. "Why do not you talk to me?" Sebastiaan asks. Anna does not answer, she just starts looking at him for a long time without a word. What is the function of this shot? What does it mean? My question is how Sebastiaans: What does this movie have to say? What does this movie mean? Answer for me: shows us a handful of passionate people with a glass of water. The story of their life is simple and boring. The motives behind their actions are not shown. The rest are: skins, residences, landscapes. Nice and artistic performance, but meaningless without having "instructions for use". In my opinion, this movie is intended for other artists, not for the ordinary viewer.
