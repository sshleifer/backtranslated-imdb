Penn dedicates time to developing her characters and we almost care about them. However, there are some real problems with this story, we do not see the real motivation for the behavior of the evil brother, and the timeline is screwed up. Apparently set in 1963. Music has late 60's / early 70's. References and dialogues are the 70s and 80s of the 20th century. The potential of a powerful climax is presented, and Penn lets him slip away. But even with all these difficulties it is worth watching, but not great.
