Steven, what have you done, you've come to a whole new level. It's weird because Steven's last film shadow was directed by the same director who made the trash. Shadow Man was good, it was diabolical bad, so bad it was not even funny Steven is not in the movie and he feels like he's in an episode, and when he's in the movie, he's called half-way. As for the action, let's say that the wizard from Oz had more action than this basket, there is almost no action in the movie, and when it finally arrives, boring depressing poorly shot so-called action scenes. Seagal hardly kills anyone, unlike his films, where he goes to one army, i.e. Under siege 1 and 2, and with starting wounds. the plot is so confusing with many story holes that sometimes it does not create scenes. escape from rage better be good, what a pity that I wasted 5 pounds on this trash 0 for 10 better luck next time
