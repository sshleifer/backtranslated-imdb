The sign of a classic movie is that it is aging like a good red wine. This movie is not Cabarnet, certainly not Casablanca. I agree with the other reviewers that the children in the film are an unfortunate mutation that plagues us at night in sit-coms, and the dialogue is stiff and preached. But let's look at the obsolete theme of the movie. <br /> <br /> With the passage of sixty years of history comes wisdom. Since the Watch on the Rhine, author Lillian Hellman was revealed as a plagiarist of Bidenesque with her so-called "Julia" life story from her book "Pentimento". As one of the most hideous surplus apologists of the USSR from the West, it is obvious that its theme in art and film was to stimulate America to act to save the bloody dictators of Stalin and international communism from fascists who have just proven their military superiority in Spain. <br /> <br /> As one reviewer rightly pointed out, this is not a pro-American game and movie, because Lillian went to the grave of a communist who repels the Americans. This film chronicles the homely stupidity of the intellectual elites that formed the American left at the time, as now the full moon Left of The Daily Kos and Michael Moore bought conspiracy theories and once again gave help and consolation to those who destroyed America.
