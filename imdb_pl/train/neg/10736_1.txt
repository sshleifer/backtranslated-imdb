The film starts with an intriguing scene, three people drink and talk in a bar. They all make up a bit outrageous stories. As the film progresses, it turns out that the truth is the most outrageous. However, apart from that the film is not very interesting, except for the scene in the bar and the scene in which the main secret is revealed. This revelation takes place only in the middle of the film and to be honest, there is little to see. The rest of the time director lives in a Russian village abandoned by Russia, full of pathetic and terrifying old ladies. Of course, these are fascinating and slightly shocking images, but admiring them takes too long, devoting all possible story or character development. I found this movie as another example of poor or lazy movie shooting, where instead of trying to create an interesting story, the filmmakers focus on bizarrely fascinating images and on a few almost unrelated stories (example - meat trader story) leave the viewer to find out all the trinkets. It has an artistic appearance on the surface, but in this particular case it is nothing more than a lack of talent.
