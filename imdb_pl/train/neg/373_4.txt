Blank Check is a movie that one day I saw on TV and how most of the films on Blank Check television were not very good. First of all, no one I've ever met has ever seen Blank Check and it includes people who grew up in the 90s. Blank Check will not be remembered in the 00's simply because it will be eclipsed by Pixar movies. I would not call Blank Check a bad movie, but it's not so much fun. (At least not for anyone over the age of 6) Blank Check is not an entertainment film, because nothing in it is original. Everything just makes you go "what I have not seen before?" Blank Check breaks up and tries to make money from everything from Richie Rich to Home Alone (oddly enough, both have Macaulay Culkin).
