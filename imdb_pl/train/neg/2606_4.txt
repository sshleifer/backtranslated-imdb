Drew Barrymore plays the young Holly Gooding, who introduces himself to the beginning screenwriter Patrick Highsmith (George Newbern) and completely disrupts his life, claiming that her "doppelganger", or the bad twin, is to kill her and her family. <br /> <br /> This stupid horror is quite difficult to take seriously, even if the filmmakers themselves and the actors themselves seem to be serious. The Doppelganger is tangled, with some unpleasantly silly dialogue. <br /> <br /> Some viewers will notice that Drew's name comes from the role of Audrey Hepburn in "Breakfast at Tiffany's" and the name of Newbern's character is a game in the name of the famous author Patricia Highsmith (in fact he tries to write "Breakfast" as horror, believe it or not!). <br /> <br /> I suppose it deserves to be recognized for not being your typical horror - I mean, the screenwriter / director Avi Nesher seems to really care about her heroes, and gives her movie more story than a standard slasher fare. <br /> <br /> After a stupid villain - everything explains - confrontation with the audience, the film presents an unfavorable, indefinite climax in which one should believe. This movie certainly does not skimp on the mountain. <br /> <br /> But hey! Drew is killing his mother in this. No, I'm not kidding. Jaid Barrymore appears close to the beginning just to be brutally killed. <br /> <br /> Drew is always very attentive and very sexy at it. Newbern comes out as a nice, "nice" guy. But the highlight of the film must be the scene with Sally Kellerman, an attractive veteran who is very professional in her one scene as a former nun who started sex-phone (!!!!!!). <br /> <br /> The film is basically junk, but it's quite funny on a poor, dirty, small level. <br /> <br /> 4/10
