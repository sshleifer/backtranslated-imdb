The film is bad. Nothing special - just a "child" movie without a serious matter. However, there is one reason why it is worth watching: a talk for animals. Some of them are so funny in what they say, you just can not stop laughing. So if you want to hear a dog in a pound dog saying "I'm Keyser Soze", or another animal saying "You're a dead walking cat" or many other fun liners, see this. Because there is no other good movie to watch. Voting: 4 out of 10.
