This is one of the worst movies I've seen lately. When a man says he would like to have great power to be able to enjoy himself, I think that the movie is in the realm of 14-year-old children's fantasies. The bedroom scene was over the top and reduced the intimate moment to the farce of biological functions, similar to transferring gas in public. From the beginning, each different scene was a discussion about how little sex they are in, how long it has been since they got it, when they will have their next sexual contact and who they should be with. Besides, the dialogue and acting were very weak and very forced, insensitive and filled with the lack of content of dingy sex scenes. It could have been really fun because the concept is really interesting, but here it is poorly made. Please do not even think about taking anyone under 16, if you have to see and see.
