The Wayward Cloud is a frustrating movie to watch. Annoyingly enigmatic, he treats every shot as a work of art. One gets the impression that the composition of each shot was designed and prepared with extreme care that borders on obsession; Explaining how far cinema has moved since the first films made in the 19th century and imitating their construction, the camera hardly ever moves? in addition to the camp and colorful music numbers. The ambient noise is kept to a minimum and almost no word is heard. This interesting, but effective device forces the public to focus only on visual stimuli, so that even when history develops at a snail's pace, we feel submerged. Unfortunately, at least for me, this immersion begins to unravel somewhere around the hour. I started to feel as if the movie was a challenge for me to watch, becoming more and more difficult as the minutes went on so that the ordinary act of watching became a battle of will. he was as sexual as he would no doubt be even more obscure to Western audiences. In fact, there are plenty of women's nakedness and acts of sexual abuse on an unconscious (or possibly dead) woman who is so repulsive, while she can talk a lot about the degradation that pornography subjects both men and women (users and used) to is so over-zealous the way in which he decides to make his point, to effectively make it ineffective. Of course, the worst and most enthusiastic participants in the explosion of available pornographic content will search for this movie for the wrong reasons and will watch it with a sticky finger on the button for fast scrolling the remote. <br /> <br /> Because of all the problems, the movie is definitely a remnant, and the more you think about it, the more it seems that some aspects of it seem to have. Ironically, in the case of a film where so little is happening, the viewer would probably be rewarded proportionally, watching the second or even the third time. For me, however, once it was enough?
