This film is the first step of Stephanie Beaton and her new production company. Although it suffers from several problems, like any low-budget production, it is a good start for Mrs. Beaton and her company. <br /> <br /> The story is not very new because it was made in movies like The Burning and every Friday 13 from part 2. But the performances are cordial. So many big budget movies just cause the actors to go through the moves, it's always nice to see actors really trying to improve their craft. <br /> <br /> The story concerns the murder (and possible return) of a disfigured colleague. The rest are sworn to secrecy, but the trauma of the event means that every person lives in different directions. Ten years later, friends are murdered one by one by the macabre persecutor known as "Bagman". Who will survive? You must watch. <br /> <br /> If you're Roger Ebert or any number of arrogant critics, you probably should not worry about it. But if your taste goes more towards Joe Bob Briggs and you want to see a group of people perfecting their craft, check out "Bagman".
