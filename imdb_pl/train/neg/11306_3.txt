Back (again) in Scotland, Lassie is (again) trying her life. Because the faithful dog is sleeping on his master's grave, he must be killed in accordance with the law. Oddly enough, it was also explained that Lassie did not have a "legal" owner, which apparently also contradicts the old Scottish law. If there is no owner after three days, the dogs must be destroyed. Edmund Gwenn (as John Traill) favors Lassie, which leads to a prolonged flashback showing Don Liseie's adoption by Donald Crisp (as John "Jock" Gray). <br /> <br /> Although based on an interesting, original story ("Greyfriars Bobby"), "Challenge to Lassie" returns to several previous Lassie situations; and it does not improve them. Relatively speaking, this one is careless and uninteresting; and this is a disappointing continuation of "The Sun Comes Up" (1949) *******. Geraldine Brooks (as Susan Brown) and several other artists can be charming, but can not pick up on it. Little Jimmy Hawkins (from "It's a Wonderful life") is one of the outstanding children supporting Lassie; much later will grow up to marry the enchanting "Angelique" "Dark Shadows" (Lara Parker).
