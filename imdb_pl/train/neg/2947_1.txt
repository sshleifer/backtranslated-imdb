There were very few films through which I could not sit. I was able to go through Battle Field Earth without any problems. But this is one of the worst movies ever made. I understand that Whoopi Goldberg tried to play in it. I do not blame her. I would be ashamed that I would have it on my CV. I believe that this is a rare opportunity when almost every gag in the film falls flat on his face. Well, it's happening here. Not to mention SFX, look for a dinosaur with control cables hanging from behind! In the middle of the movie, I was still looking for a story. I never found him. Save yourself the hassle of borrowing and save 90 minutes of your life.
