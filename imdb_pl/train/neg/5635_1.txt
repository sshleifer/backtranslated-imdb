I also like Dafoe as an actor, but I've wasted several hours of my life watching this movie, I still can not believe that I was able to see it in its entirety. Was there really a point for the movie? And the end, well, I'm glad I never paid to see this horrible senseless piece of pathetic excuse for the movie! <br /> <br /> I'm not sure without the facts, but did Dafoe get married or see a horrible actress in this movie in real life, if so, was it an attempt to start her career? if I'm so afraid it would siÄ™ nierocie ... <br /> <br /> I publish in the hope that I can tear someone away from watching this movie, even if one person will pay attention to my comments and decide that I would rather watch the drying of the paint, I will feel that I did something good in the world, if only I had the same advice ...
