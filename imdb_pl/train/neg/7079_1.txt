There is no reason to bother about borrowing this movie. I knew that I was in trouble from the initial subtitles. <br /> <br /> It was filmed as if it were a soft porn movie, but there really is nothing erotic about it. A look at the world of sex addiction is intriguing, but only to some extent. <br /> <br /> Boring erotic scenes, bad plot and episodes Ed Begley Jr. and Rosanna Arquette are not enough to save this movie.
