There is no doubt that this movie has an impressive cast, but unfortunately it does not help in the main drawbacks of the film. I never understand why directors ask actors / actresses to use accents rather than their own when it is obvious to everyone they can not convince. Fiennes simply can not do Irish, and Fitzgerald is not much better in Russian. When the voice is wrong, no matter how well acting is never convincing. As the main problem .... plot ... there was one? I think it was a story, but it was so full of holes that I could not wait for the movie to end ... it was ridiculous. Save 90 minutes of your life and do not watch this movie!
