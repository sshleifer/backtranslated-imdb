It's not just that SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION has little potential. Indeed, the unexplored title phenomenon is quite intriguing, and at least in the first half of this effort, Tobe Hooper promises to be entertained in a way that can only be a shoddy horror of the 90s. But somewhere between Brad Dourif's performances and the overly intricate thread, this would-be thriller loses its importance. <br /> <br /> Dourif, who appeared here before his fan base of fans gathered, is the average guy Sam. Of course, average guys do not stay on average for long periods of horror, so after a well-made outline of origin, we see that Sam's various parts of the body begin to light up. Soon, he also lights up other people, to the gale constellation of Lisa, played flawlessly by Cynthia Bain. <br /> <br /> Although the title of the movie suggests that the fire is engulfing the monster in the wild, director Hooper chose to make Sam an unwilling assassin. Such an approach gives the film an additional human depth which otherwise would not be lacking, but also prevents us from real fears of a human flamethrower. We wonder if it would be better if we wanted to make an effort against everyone, and also NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. <br /> <br /> SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION is quite a nominal effort when everything has been said and done. It will add attractiveness to Dourifa fans and those who can not afford the horror of the 90s, whether it's good, bad or between, but only on a free night.
