I can not explain throughout my life the popularity of the children's TV program, commandos. <br /> <br /> I never understood why unsuspecting children like this program because characters seem so idiotic and not worth taking care of. <br /> <br /> Costumes look completely awful, like the multicolored spandex that people wear to go to the gym. <br /> <br /> What is the purpose of this? show anyway, but for children to learn to fight to solve their problems? What is happening with these terrible hairstyles and clothes at this show? Not to mention the fact that the program is still playing on cable television to make money to teach children to fight with each other when they do not agree with a certain problem. <br /> <br /> For today's children there is much better entertainment, hopefully they are not as gullible as the children from the 90s who watched this concert. <br /> <br /> Oh, what about the homosexual tension between the red and green guards?
