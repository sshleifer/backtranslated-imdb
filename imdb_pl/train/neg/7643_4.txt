Once a big action star that fell off the face of the earth goes to a small town with the problem of drug traffickers and the dead body of a federal agent. Connecting with some former stars to clean up the city. <br /> <br /> A low key, often to insolence, the action comedy mostly does not work. Part of the problem is throwing Chris Klien on the former hero of the action. he is not bad, but he is not really credible as someone who was considered a tough guy. As I said, he's not bad, he's just badly tracked down about his story. The real problem here is the combination of a script that is not really funny and sometimes it seems artificial, and the direction that is walking to the port of dementia. There is no life in the way of creating things. It's as if the director had a list of photos and went to the list. This makes the film not addictive. And yet the movie comes to life from time to time, for example in the last screening that ends the movie. This sequence works, but because the earlier parts of the movie shook with its great power. <br /> <br /> I can not really recommend a movie. It's worth it to shoot if you're a fan of actors or you're a huge fan of independent cinema in all its forms, but otherwise it's just a disappointment.
