You already know how painful it is to watch this movie. But I wonder why one of the worst movies should contain one of the most beautiful cars. Why cars should not only be a victim of a violation, but also the only real actors and performers in it. So when you land on a Porsche, Lamborghini or whatever, let these people contact your cars and ruin the reputation for which you give millions. It is painful for those who love cars. It is painful for those who love movies. <br /> <br /> I want to get my money back !!!
