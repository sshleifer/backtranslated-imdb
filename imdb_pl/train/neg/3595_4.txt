I was not as "happy" as some others commenting on this movie: I've never seen anything else from ... let's say ... Sarno's "prolific" mind. I agree with many: some actresses who spend a lot of time dancing topless and (go-go) are not that attractive. I liked Fraulein Crank (?) ... she was so homely, she was adorable! Acting was also quite outdated, although providing a line in a second language could be the cause of the problem. The attempt to follow the plot was a serious task: was there really one? I agree with another comment: there is not much blood in the vampire movie. Yes, if you want GOOD suppurating blood, check out Hammer classics like "Horror Dracula" and (my favorite) "Brides of Dracula". <br /> <br /> The most (unintentionally) funny part is there, the doctor removes the clothes from the bats' cloud ... which you never see! ... bats, I mean. <br /> <br /> Okay, just in time, if it happens that you will catch the cable here in the Great White North, but for God's sake, do not rent it!
