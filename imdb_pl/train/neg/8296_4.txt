Basically, the team of dentists and their 3 daughters deal with infidelity. The assumption is interesting, the game is good, and the music, although sometimes sudden and without direction, is pretty cool. <br /> <br /> The problem is the plot. The dentist's husband leaves his wife behind the scenes at the opera before the concert (plays a smaller role), then returns to give her something, but he sees her with another man. The rest of the movie concerns his anxiety connected with this episode, his visual hallucinations and macho alter-ego (Denis Leary, his former patient) and the fear of confronting his wife so that he does not have to "do something about it. "I will not tell you the end, but let me say that the film is not going anywhere, and the ending is like a gibbering whimper. Heroes' motivation is missing: why is he cheating on him? It's a dentist, a decent look, a good father. The movie does not speak. Who does she do with it? Do not expect any answers. Why does he want to keep marriage despite everything? Who knows. What is the purpose of all vomiting of children? Where is the movie? Good performances by Campbell Scott and Hope Davis (and Denis Leary as a comic relief) are completely wasted by this slim nonsense who does not know if he wants to be an American beauty or a family movie. The root canal is more interesting. Avoid this.
