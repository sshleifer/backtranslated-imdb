The main character Lance Barton is killed and to heaven before his time. When the sky learns of an error, he receives the body of the deceased rich, old and white Mr. Wellington. <br /> <br /> A young black guy in the old white body of a man still behaves like a young black man maybe he's funny if you see that an old white actor did it. In this movie, I remembered several times: "Chris Rock should be an old white guy". <br /> <br /> The whole concept does not play as intended: "illusion" is not well transported and the love story is not credible at all. The fact that everything you see is Chris Rock playing a young black guy, because the old white person that everyone should see is only shown in small stages, it is a challenge for many viewers to "suspend disbelief."
