Cash (now played by Khrystyne Haje in Angelina Jolie) went to the desert after the apocalypse (after her protector died of old age, the protector played Elias Koteas, a real decent actor), and now discovers that people are roaming rubble looking for cyborgs to trade in scrap metal and cash. He leads a group of burned cyborgs (including William Katt, Evan Lurie, and a human scientist played by Zach Galligan) against the bounty hunter Richard Lynch. Malcolm McDowell has two minutes on the screen as Lynch's employer. Cyborg 3 cope better than the other two entries, but it is still a boring function to a large extent. The problem this time is that ideas with potential are never well used, action sequences are routine, and names like McDowell, Katt and Galligan have little to do. Haje is indeed a capricious heroine, and Lynch is too exaggerated (as usual), and the film lacks inspiration or ambition to be as much fun as his funny predecessor. (The one from Van Damme, the other is just boring.) Also the science fiction angle that almost aggressively resists all good ideas is also disappointing. As an action movie, it's a routine and thanks to movies with B numbers and it's skillfully made, it's the only positive thing I can say about it. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 out of 4- (Poor)
