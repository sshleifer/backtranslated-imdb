OK, do not be fooled by my summary. This movie SUCKS HARD. But the worst movie ever? This movie was terrible in the way people should not be forced to describe. But in no way is it worse than Manos: hands of fate, hobgobbline, horror of spider islands or a small handful of movies. In the review the movie sucks, it's terrible. Do not notice this without MST or you may have health problems. But there are worse films.
