Absolutely terrible movie. A full waste of time. <br /> <br /> background music is so loud that you can not understand speech. Well, if you really listen carefully, whatever they say, it is actually incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> The camera's work is bad, the editing is not present, the background results in a headache, the action is tacky, the dialogues are incomprehensible, the acting is terrible and good, that Kareena looked like a wrestler, now looks like a starved wrestler . Hell that you can lose weight, but you can not gain grace. <br /> <br /> After spending three hours watching a movie that I would like to like, but this movie would not let me even enjoy it. <br /> <br /> If you want to torture, look boldly.
