Les Visiteurs, the first film about medieval travelers, was really funny. I like actor Jean Reno, but there were more. There were unexpected turns of action, funny situations, and of course a simple absurdity that would remind you a little about Louis de Funes. <br /> <br /> Now this sequel has the same characters, the same actors in large part and the same travel time. The story changes a bit because the heroes are supposed to be experienced travelers in time. So they jump up the story, not paying attention to the fact that as the film progresses it becomes absurd. Prince Jean Reno tries to keep the whole thing together with his game, but his character has been emptied, so he can not do much to save the movie. <br /> <br /> Now a slave to the prince / helper, he really has the full attention. The movie is just about him and his clumsiness / annoying / stupid or whatever he was supposed to be. It is a fact; this character tries to make the audience laugh, but he fails. It's as if someone was telling you a very, very bad joke, you already know, but he insists on telling this joke to the end, adding details to make your suffering a little bit longer. <br /> <br /> If you liked Les Visiteurs, do not spoil the mouth in a sequel. If you did not like Les Visiteurs, you would never have thought about seeing the continuation. If you liked this sequel ... well, I suppose you still have to see a lot of movies.
