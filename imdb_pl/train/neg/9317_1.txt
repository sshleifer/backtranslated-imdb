I bought it from Blockbuster for 99 pence. The guy behind the counter said the reason was so cheap because the disc was scratched, but he did not mention that the reason was so cheap, because the movie was a poor effort that sucked harder than Paris Hilton in the home video in the hotel room. Speaking of home movies, since it's fair to play them as movies - that is, movies used to employ actors and technicians and screenwriters, etc. - no longer - just gather your friends and lame ideas together for the weekend to distribute production for a budget of 8 , 00 pounds, and ask someone to get off the stairs using the Casio keyboard (soundtrack) - and then hit him on the shelves, for some bad juice (me) to take desperation home alone. But here's the clinker - I quickly scrolled through most of it and threw it aside, ready for hammers ... until the next night, watching the horror of Darren "Hellbreed" (Â£ 1.99 for taking home and keeping away from another Blockbuster) . Now this movie made "Grim Weekend" look like The Exorcist, so I threw Grim Weekend back to catch up on some of the great moments listed on the amazing IMDb discs that viewers thought were fun. Indeed, once I had survived misery, pain and horror, which was the implementation of Grim Weekend, it was completely gone on toast, I could enjoy, enjoy myself and even go down to funny things. And there is a lot of it. Check the boards. Then check the traffic. Hell, maybe it's worth it. AWWWWW CRAP!
