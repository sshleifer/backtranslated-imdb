I suppose it is cool and fashionable to watch wonderful things in the absolute emptiness of such a movie. Over time, the senseless excesses of many Hollywood movies, we can relax and enjoy the scene devoid of explosions, vulgar language and dingy single films. Minimalism has its place and can be very effective when it is used properly. However, this movie is not one of those cases. <br /> <br /> Take long scenes without dialogue and bleak, rare scenery. I am sure that they must have some great meaning and insight, because the hidden message is hidden. Acting is poor ... nondescript and walking ... and contains one of the worst scenes of crying in history (at the end of the movie, if you can sit to the end). The scenery is gray, and the ridiculously long sequence of a girl passing through a barren park is just as pleasant as pulling a tooth. I would call it anti-climatic, but because the film was not built at any climax ... even in "erotic" scenes ... it would be untrue. I am sure that the scenario was used during the filming, but I think that the conversation could be written on a cocktail napkin. Essentially, this movie is not interesting or surprising ... there is no great story, no stunning observations, no visual drama, no emotions. In addition to two or three funny moments, this movie is a waste of two hours. A tragically boring and grim movie.
