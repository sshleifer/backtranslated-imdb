I'm glad I borrowed this movie for one reason: his shortcomings prompted me to read the Allende book and get a full story. <br /> <br /> Pros: the film is beautiful, the period is well and consistently presented (to the best of my knowledge), and Meryl and Glenn do a good job. <br /> <br /> Cons: this is the worst acting I've ever seen from Jeremy Irons - I was wondering if something was wrong with his lips. (And I hate the English way in which she says "Transito"). Winona Ryder does nothing credible unless she looks young and idealistic. Most of the other performances are fine, but so few things combine in character arcs and relationship development, that I was frustrated and angry long before the end. <br /> <br /> I am very curious now if this film is typical of Bille August's works. Maybe I will have to dump a few bucks to rent Smilla's Sense of Snow.
