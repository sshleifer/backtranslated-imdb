The name "cult film" is often broadcast to films that are still shown or sold in the home movie format, more than a generation after their first release. The Superchick, which was released for the first time in 1973, now falls into this category. Its iconic status is to a large extent the result of the constant interest of women who consider it an early and effective feminist film. <br /> <br /> Despite the connotation of "Superwoman", "Superchick" is not a cartoon character, but a very competent young lady working as an air stewardess - a career option that in the seventies was widely regarded as one of the most enchanting open to every girl, and which also allows her to imitate the traditional matelot that apparently has a wife in every port. Because she has the status of a black belt in karate, she is able to explain that she is very pleased with the existence of a bachelor and is in no way dependent on any of her wide range of male devotees. This film is a situational comedy that avoids a generally shorter life fascination with a direct farce. Its attractiveness for feminists is also strengthened by the culmination in which our heroine uses her karate skills to prevent the abduction and save all other passengers on board against potentially unpleasant fate. To make sure that this film will appeal to both men and their partners, the director wisely ensured that he was richly sprinkled with sweets for his eyes. <br /> <br /> Superchick can enjoy people who are not too critical and want a very light, easy-to-view comedy that they will forget shortly after seeing. It is so unforgettable that they will probably find it equally enjoyable if they are observed in a year's time; in spite of his age, he may for a time maintain the status of a cult film. Dialogue and acting, however, would make it difficult to evaluate this film on over 4/10.
