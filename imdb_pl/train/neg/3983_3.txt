Irene Dunne has ended her great career thanks to such a film movie. She should have gone out with a bang, being a classic actress she was, not in this unforgettable, almost unknown film. <br /> <br /> This light comedy is fine, but nothing special. The first half is much better because it gets stupid in the second half. Perhaps Irene saw the writing on the wall and threw it. Even her high voice became a bit annoying. Rumor has it that she was not happy with the film. You can see why. <br /> <br /> History reminded me of a television sitcom from the 1950s. Speaking of that, I thought that David Nelson from the TV series Ozzie and Harriet was in this movie, but it turned out to be a very young Richard Crenna. He looked and sounded exactly the same as Nelson. <br /> <br /> In general, at best, yes and sub-par for a great actress.
