I bought Bloodsuckers some time ago on eBay. I watched the parts and thought it was too stupid to look through them again. Excessive watery "blood" at the beginning is simply outdated - not to mention the "whipping" of the wind sounds. My friends and I made a super low-budget movie, and the effects still outweighed this shitty fest. <br /> <br /> When it comes to the amount of bugs in this movie, it's much too much to count. I knew one of the actors - believe it or not, he was my teacher of THEATER. HA! <br /> <br /> Final verdict: Do not worry about this "horror film". <br /> <br /> 3 stars (possible 73)
