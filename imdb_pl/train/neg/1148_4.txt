A pedantic, long fabrication that attempts to describe the birth of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. It starts quite promising, with still an important probe for the explosion of the plane, but the melodrama of James Stewart and wife of Very Miles just bothers (Miles used to play summer forced wives, and her frayed nerves come here schedule). The esteemed director Mervyn LeRoy led the adaptation of Don Whitehead's book, but despite the talent involved, the picture does not really impress. The best performance is Murray Hamilton as Stewart's partner, but most of the dialogues are ridiculous, and stubborn stimulation makes the film seem twice as long as it is. * 1/2 of ****
