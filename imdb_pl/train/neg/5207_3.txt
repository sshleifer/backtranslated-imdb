Anemic comedy drama, an unhappy, seemingly hasty affair involving Cher as a woebegone housewife who slowly befriends a murderer who was hired to be killed by her husband. Chazz Palminteri, as a talkative hired gun, adapted the scenario from his own game, with amazing settings and dialogues back and forth, which quickly tire the eye and ear. The whole project is dark, and director Paul Mazursky can not tear Cher away from the eternal funk (he is apathetic). Despite all the best talents (including Robert De Niro as one of the producers), "Faithful" is deceptive, irrelevant to history and characters that rarely come alive. * 1/2 of ****
