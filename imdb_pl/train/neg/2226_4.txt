DD movies were damn trivial, damn stupid and had a storyline that seemed skinny, but in those days were at least a plot. <br /> <br /> This movie is not just a comedy, but a mix of melodrama, romance, everything br /> <br /> Every dramatic scene is unproportional <br /> <br /> Comedy is fun, but also banal. But the movie makes the entertainment, at that time Govinda movies were loud, stupid, but they had some fun moments that people enjoyed <br /> <br /> David Dhawan is good. Music is ok. <br /> <br /> Govinda works well in comedy, and Karisma's drama is decent in part and gets nervous in part Kader is Gulshan as usual, Chopra prem are typical for Shakti
