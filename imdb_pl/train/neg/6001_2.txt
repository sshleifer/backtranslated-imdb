Maybe it sounds crazy even for people who remember this program ... But I remembered it as a live action. I think I've never seen a cartoon. but a movie? maybe. I remember it very clearly. The guy was in the building a bit like a showroom. He even had a red jacket. It was dark, and he turned into a red car and there was this guy on the second level looking at him. The car / guy turned and hit the big showroom window and went out onto the street. And then he left. That's all I remember. I really hope someone remembers it too. If not, maybe I'm still crazy. But I hope not.
