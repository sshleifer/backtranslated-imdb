MAY be a good movie if he could examine something more interesting than just the surface of the lesbian union, if that was the meaning of the movie ... it's quite predictable, not to mention that both girls are reminiscent of the Russian group tATu. ..coincidence? I do not think so. In this movie there is nothing original to handle it, so they had to use something that is already known. You know the recipe. Other actors ... well, I just do not know what their role is. Most of them are well-known people in Romania and I have to mention that some of them are not even actors (eg Mihaela Radulescu). SO to sum up: "girl band tatty" + desperate / publicity needing "actors" + non-existent plot + opportunity to use the wrong language in order to shock = love sick ... pity ... the idea was good, though ... and I seriously refrain from commenting on the title ...
