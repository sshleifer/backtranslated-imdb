As Rick Sloane could have made five films, it's harder to believe than a cold fusion. This movie is absolutely criminal. Before I watched this movie, I thought Manos: Hands of Fate is the worst piece of shit I've ever seen, but at least Manos moves so slowly that you can fall asleep, saving your eyes from the pain she's going to feel. The biggest tragedy of this film is that the old man who holds Hobgoblins "blocked" goes to the final scene. Time spent watching this movie was an absolute loss of my life.
