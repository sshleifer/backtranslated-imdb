Television has an impact on society ... just look at the rise in the popularity of cappucino stores after this shallow piece of work debuted. In addition, real people who look as good as these people do not have any problems. <br /> <br /> Besides, does anyone really believe that these people can afford to live in a nice Manhattan loft, considering what they're doing? NBC simply loves to insult the viewer's intelligence, even if they are near Gump's level. I know a person who earns $ 100,000 a year as a web designer and lives in a tiny one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan that costs $ 2,200 a month. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see a program called Phriends, where there are six ugly nobic corners in dead ends, living in a nasty neighborhood where mermaids always fail and someone gets attacked every week ... and then the owner rents the rent. Now what I would watch.
