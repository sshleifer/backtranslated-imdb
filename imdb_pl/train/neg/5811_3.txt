I have not seen this movie for ages, but I have come to the conclusion that I will comment it anyway, mainly because the memory that I do not like it is burnt in my memory cells. The original THE GETAWAY was not a reward at first, but at least it had the distinction of being 1) A Sam Peckinpah movie, 2) Featured Steve McQueen, Ben Johnson and Slim Pickens, 3) Is a relatively painless way to blow the hour and half the time. <br /> <br /> For comparison, the 1994 version turns out to be nothing more than vanity for the then-hot Alec Baldwin and his soon divorced wife, Kim Basinger. McQueen and his then wife Allie McBride also split up shortly after their movie was made and you can imagine the Baldwins in their marriage counsel who are arguing about who the stupid idea is to make this movie. <br /> <br /> Just say it and off the beaten track - Alec Baldwin has never been and never will be close to Cooler King, and one of the reasons why this remake made me so upset is the arrogance of Baldwin, to insist on challenging Steve McQueen's memory in the lead role. As someone else points out, the vision of Peckinpah's 1972 film was a satirical work aimed at the parody of the heist action / adventure genre. In contrast, Baldwin, Bassinger and the company seem to be trying to evoke a more serious tone, and only the slimy, wicked forms of villains Michael Madsen and James Woods appear as real people. <br /> <br /> The film is also definitely impetuous and unlike the basic one at the basic level, which is difficult to express in words. One viewing was more than enough, not only because it had nothing new to offer, but because of how flawlessly it was made. Peckinpah's film was in fact a stylish little entertainment, which had an optimistic mood, where this version is a slogan that lasts too long to be little or nothing. There is no artistic need, and some of the more uncomfortable scenes are so uncomfortable that they make the film difficult to watch. <br /> <br /> So I do not know, it was probably one of the films that helped to initiate a wave of meaningless, artistically deplorable big budget remakes related to the then-named brand actress / actress, which is not a good thing in itself. I would always prefer a filmmaker to at least try to come up with a new idea for a film and fall into something original. This film made me want to pull my eyebrows and reveal that over the next 15 years after the premiere, Mr. Baldwin became widely known as one of the biggest jerks in Hollywood. Thank God for Team America for putting him in his place. <br /> <br /> 3/10
