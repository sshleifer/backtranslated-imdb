Watching Smothera was probably the longest less than 90 minutes of my life. There was no laughter; in fact, I do not remember ever smiling. Diane Keaton was terribly indecent as a storage room for middle-aged smokers, a textbook mother with an overbearing character, a persistently annoying woman who clearly suffers from a personality disorder. It is manipulative, clever, melodramatic, childish, narcissistic and, at worst, boring. <br /> <br /> I suppose I should briefly mention other characters, but why? It was just a long series of film stereotypes - a messy, socially inept distant relative who just tries to break into the "Industry", harsh and long-suffering, but somehow still a beloved father, a gentle wife who just can "Do not worry ( but eventually goes beyond disagreement and resigns to return home), a herd of unclosed dogs that like to chew with pillows when everyone is far away, etc. <br /> <br /> God, what a snore. I've never been a fan of Diane Keaton, and Smother only reminded me why. Excessive action is excessive, no matter how many photos you have made in your prime. Her attempts at physical comedy were particularly humiliating. What was the director thinking? <br /> <br /> Although I like Dax Shepard and sometimes even tolerate Liv Tyler, their performances were so weak and boring that it was clear that none of them cared about the movie. That was fine, because neither did I. Keaton's endless self-absorption was unbearable, and sometimes Shepard's dislike for her seemed real. At the end of the movie, I wanted to hit her. <br /> <br /> Awful.
