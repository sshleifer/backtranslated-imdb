The guy is a loser. I can not get girls, you have to build them, they are chosen by stronger, more successful guys, etc. I see it, I saw it, we moved on. I must say that Rob must go through part of his life Adam Sandler. And get out of the threads of Adam Sandler. There are two funny parts throughout the film. I could not even finish the last 5 minutes. I was bored. "Animal" is a good movie. I usually like Adam Sandler's films that have the same story. But it was too hard to impress. The jokes are very old. So trust me. This is not a movie that most people could really get. But some so, so I will be nice. <br /> <br /> 3/10
