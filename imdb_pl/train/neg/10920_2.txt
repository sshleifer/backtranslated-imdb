It must have been one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I have to disagree with another commentator who said that the special effects are fine. I found them quite wrong: it simply was not realistic and they were so false that they just distracted from the real story. <br /> <br /> Maybe this distraction is the reason why I do not fully understand the story. Archaeologists are looking for a "set". They do not bother to say what set or what is so special about it. It also causes that you do not know why they are looking for him in California, and the introduction to the film takes place in ancient Egypt. <br /> <br /> If you're shooting a movie that takes place in the desert, make an effort to actually go to the desert. The beginning - an ancient ceremony - looks like it was filmed in the studio instead of in the desert. <br /> <br /> The action level was constant throughout the film, without ups and downs, without climax. It made the movie look short, and it's definitely a pro for this particular movie.
