Kevin Spacey is very talented, but unfortunately directing is not his strong point. I had high expectations for the movie before I rented it and maybe that's why I did not like it so much. I admire Spacey's rehearsal of the film, which takes place mainly in one small environment, but the attempt is not important. I found the movie boring, boring and stretched out. Acting was not spectacular. Gary Sinise did much better, especially since he is aware of the majority of his other films. Skeet Ulrich was disappointed, but it was one of his first films (I got a kick from how the young and chubby star Scream looked). The only thing that impressed me in this film is one shot of a car wreck from above. The middle line of the road was perfectly centered, and the camera moved along the line and the wreck passed. However, this shot was very "ordinary suspect", and in my opinion Spacey had an idea from his earlier film (which is a very good idea). If you want to see a fantastic movie that takes place in one small area, watch the Hitchcock rescue boat. Maybe Spacey should have seen it before filming.
