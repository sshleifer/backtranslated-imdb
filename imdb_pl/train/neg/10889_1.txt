The worst movie I've seen since Gingerale Afternoon. I suppose it's horror / comedy. I almost predicted every scene in this movie. Special effects were not so special. I believe that I could come up with such good results from what I am at home. I would like to have something good to say about this movie, but I'm afraid not. Even Coolio should be ashamed to appear in such a turkey. After a short reflection, I have one good thing to say about this movie - it's over.
