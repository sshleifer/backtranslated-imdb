What was with all Turkish actors? No offense, but I thought it was all for nothing for all these actors. The film did not have a script for testing actors playing skills or abilities. He demanded almost nothing, I bought this movie to see Michael Madsen. He is one of my favorite actors, but this movie was another failure for him. The script was so bad. There was simply nothing that could sink your teeth, and all the characters were two-dimensional. Madsen tried to act like a hard ass, but the script and direction did not let him even do enough with his character to make it more interesting or three-dimensional. <br /> <br /> Even the sound effects of the shooting The beginning of the movie sounded like a noise of paint guns when they are fired in a skirmish. It was really strange and it did not sound like real guns. The video game had better sound effects than the movie. At the beginning of the movie there was also a very annoying guy who was a member of the robbery gang. He had this American groaning voice like a girl screaming like "Let F # $ k away" and "What will we do with a man". He sounded like a girl. I laugh too. For a few seconds, Whoo Hoo! Stupid movie Poor Madsen He will jump ...
