The cast, although nothing special, everything works well, the story seems like a good idea, the script is passable, and the end has a pretty good turnaround; so what's wrong with that? <br /> <br /> To start with, the special effects are really bad (if it was done in the 1960s) this may look good, but in 2003 there is no justification for such poor visual effects. It makes me laugh that the DVD cover is very proud "from the creator of the Jeepers Creepers special effects." <br /> <br /> Second, the direction is weak, this movie simply does not convey the essence of the story, the doctor feeding the hospital with the prisoners of souls Devil (or the creation of a demon type) should be strained or frightening; it simply is not. <br /> <br /> In all, it's a pretty bad movie, and although bearable, and sometimes slightly funny, it's probably best to leave it alone. <br /> <br /> Or rather sad 4/10
