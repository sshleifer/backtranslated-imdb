Do not knock on Korman because he was very funny at the Carol Burnett show. He was also good at playing secondary characters in the films of Mel Brooks (I think of "High Anxiety"). However, he is not a person who can carry a movie in duels. This one is basically a fake "Gremlin", according to the tradition of such films as "Critters" and "Ghoulies". It is also not a very good knockoff, as in the case of "Ghoulies", but with a much lighter tone, because it is not as dark as this movie. In fact, this is too light and foamy, and unfortunately many jokes end up in decline. Although I gave him 3 for the result, it's only because there is a movie that is even worse "Gremlin". If you've watched the Mystery Science Theater 3000, you know the one I'm talking about ... the infamous Hobgoblins. He's got a guy finding a little kid in some underground place (I've only seen this movie a long time ago, so I do not remember everything clearly) and it starts with friendships. However, this creature quickly becomes unfriendly and of course there is more, and this is a movie. More mischief than hits in the jokes department, and also a very bad view of Korman for the role of a bad brother. It's best to skip this one, but you can only check it for kicks.
