During the panel discussion in which I participated after watching the film, the filmmakers stated that it was necessary to look at it not as a film but as a provocateur of thought. Well, the only thoughts that have been provoked from me are the time when I wasted watching the movie. The tricks from the film (documentary style, futuristic surroundings) served as entertainment for what was meant to be a deliberate analysis of the abortion debate. This film illustrates the problem when people try to use the film as a platform for their political views - usually a very boring movie that the choir proclaims.
