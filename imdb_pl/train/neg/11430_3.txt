Okay, let me give you a new word here: polyphony: fear of polyamorous compounds. This is another of a long series of films that start with the excitement of the audience about a triangle, just to turn on a decade and teach how it is necessary and the only moral to find a monogamistic solution. Only one person in a thousand understands the joy that he can love more than one person, and this director is not one of them. Bleh. <br /> <br /> Mark my words: in a few dozen years, polyphony will be just as faux-pas as homophobia, but guess who was too close to realize that? For the first time: producers of this film. And so many likes it. Why even create a ridiculously conservative and old-fashioned movie type like this one? Based on unlimited openness to gays, it completely ignores the fact that we live in an era in which monogamy turns into a sequential monogamy, which in turn turns into rocking and polyamory. Open your eyes, people, please! <br /> <br /> This is a disappointing, clumsy hatchling. (But, damn, I must say, Heather Graham is the sweetest living thing.) <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
