Well! What can you say? First of all, this adaptation is too long in 4 hours due to the complexity (or lack thereof) of the story. Actors try to create something from this movie, but there is too little content for the time available. Swayzee is NOT a character of Quatermain. After seeing the interpretation of the great man in Sean Connery's "League of extraordinary gentlemen," Swayzee really does not make an assessment. This guy with a repeating winchester rifle does not have the strength, height, subtlety or humor needed for this part and is distorted by everyone, including the sorcerer, who from my point of view seems to be more convincing as an actor than the rest of the cast. Some views are pleasant, but there are stupid mistakes in the cinema. E.g. When a happy team comes to a waterhole in the middle of the desert, their traces are visible to the oasis, just waiting for them to come. Exiting the mine leads to the exit (next shot) like the exit visible from the passage through which they passed, and so on. I waited for Doug McClure to appear at any moment. In a sense, I would like to have. <br /> <br /> The leader of the Russians chasing Quatermain is a cheaply created stereotypical figure who simply shoots everything. <br /> <br /> Swayzee is doing well because his sad father has returned to London, who is not able to take care of his son. Swayzee should stick to that kind of thing. He is not able to carry the role of a brave gentleman with a hard heart, life experience and a sense of fair play. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
