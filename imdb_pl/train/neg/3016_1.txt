I am, like many, a fan of Tony Scott's films. When this movie came out, I had high hopes that it would be "Man On Fire". To find out that the movie is the farthest from it! History circulated on the water, and the choice of Mickey Rourke was not such a good idea. And the whole "arm of the arm was too free! <br /> <br /> The film is focused around Kiery Kinghtly, and this movie reveals that it will never become a movie star! The film brought one of the worst acts in history. <br /> <br /> I like the direction of Tony Scott, but it takes away the whole fucking cake! Sorry Ton, 1 out of 10!
