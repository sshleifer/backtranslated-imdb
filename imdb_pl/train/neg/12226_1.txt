I know, I know, "Plan 9 from outer space" is the worst movie, and maybe "Manos, hands of fate". But I can not make up for these monkey-sock movies. * Of course * are bad. How can they be good? But if you're talking about films with respectable values ​​and banking talents, T. rex of all turkeys must be "Yentl." All this treacherous reticence, all self-absorbed asynation that stains everything that Barbra Streisand has done since 1964, reaches its peak in this film. From the lonely summit of horrors, "Yentl" looks back at "A Star is Born" and then "The Mirror Has Two Faces". There is nothing like that. What emotional subtext Streisand pulled out to make this film, I'd rather not speculate and what kind of audience she played, I can not imagine it, although I'll bet it's nine out of ten that you're not a member. /> <br /> Nobel laureate and saint guardian of Yiddish literature Isaac Bashevis Singer was so outraged by what Streisand did with his story that he attacked her publicly. It is a tribute to Streisand's impassioned profanity that not only did she not commit suicide, but she began to do more horrible films.
