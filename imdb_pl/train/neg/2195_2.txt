A brain that will not die is a horrible movie that stinks with initial subtitles. It has all the classic signs of being evil: incredible plot, awful acting, poor sets and lighting. The plot looks as follows: when the doctor and his fianc√© are caught in an accident, he is deprived of his head, and he raises her head and takes her to his laboratory, where he sets his head in a pan with some special liquid alive. I bet that Virgnina Leath, who played her head in the pan, had to spend a lot of uncomfortable time, wearing her on the neck and crouching under the table. In any case, the doctor tries to find her a new body and employs two strippers so she can choose one to have a new body. Wrong all the time, so bad it was torn to pieces at the Mystery Science Theater 3000.
