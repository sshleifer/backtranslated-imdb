This is one of the worst movies I've seen in years. Apart from Cuba and Angie, acting is embarrassing. Was not Archer a decent actress? What happened to her? The action is decent, but completely unbelievable. The make-up is so bad that it's worth mentioning. I mean who ever thinks about makeup in a contemporary feature film. Someone should inform the make-up artist and the DOP that you should not see him. The ending is a huge disappointment - like "and then they understood that it was all a dream" <br /> <br /> Do not waste time or money. You'd better look into space for 2 hours.
