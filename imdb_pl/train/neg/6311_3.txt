It's a bad, very bad movie. <br /> <br /> Well, for real people a real movie is a good thing. It is not for me. Sometimes life is also predictable, bad, unpleasant, trivial, senseless. Maybe that's why people say that this movie is real. <br /> <br /> Too many common places: you are black, you are a criminal, you are condemned and cursed, whatever you do, you will end up by shooting or shooting by someone; do not let children play with weapons, it can be dangerous; and then there are those who go to church and then they are good, very good ... <br /> <br /> Before that, I have not seen such a bad movie. Perhaps that's why I did not notice how important the photography in the film is. In this, every scene shot in the day, outside, is clearly irritatingly blue. They did not even care about improving the color balance. ABOUT! So far, I "rated" over 300 films in this database, and this (3/10) is my lowest ever.
