A chemical spill turns people into zombies. This survival of the epidemic depends on two doctors. This is Andreas Schnaas' movie, so you know what the level of the course will be. Bad acting, horribly terrible special effects and lack of budget. Dubbing is ridiculous with a capital letter R and the saddest thing is that I feel compelled to write one word about this excrement, and the more so because ten lines are mandatory because of the guidelines placed on me by IMDb. My original review of only one word: Crap did not fly, so I have to revise it and go on, how bad it is. But I do not know if I can, so ... wait, I think I can have enough words or lines to make this review go well. That's cool. To sum up: this movie sucks, do not watch it. <br /> <br /> My class: F
