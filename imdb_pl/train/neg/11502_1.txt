This movie is painfully slow and has no plot. It transfers the life of a group of dismissed boat workers. One of the elders is sincere in his attempt to find a job. There may be some social comment here, but it is muddy because nobody is painted in a very nice light. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why he was 7.8 when I decided to watch it. I looked at the whole boring thing and built expectations for a huge payment. Lack of happiness. The IMDb rating has always been so good for my tastes. Anything above 6.5 was worth a look. <br /> <br /> And my wife says that Javier Bar does not look good in this film. He is not my type, so my consent does not mean much. <br /> <br /> Sigh. I give him 1.
