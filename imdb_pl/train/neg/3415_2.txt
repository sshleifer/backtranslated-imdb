In a standard view it is a totally awful movie. However, he evaluates an almost perfect result on the unintentional scale of comedy. I can come up with some real comedies that make me laugh as much as I watched the movie. The spirit of Andy Griffith, dressed in the dancing of an Indian outfit, sends me into hysterics every time. I would not waste gas or energy going to a video store to rent it, but if you happen to be on the couch at three in the morning and on TV, check it out.
