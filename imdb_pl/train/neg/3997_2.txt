After noticing the high IMDb rating, I decided to see this movie. In addition to the high grade, I deliberately avoided reading any reviews. I wanted to enter the theater with a clean account, without knowing the plot or predetermined expectations. <br /> <br /> Given my assessment, I see that I was disappointed. I liked the development of the main character, Mike Enslin. I also liked how the hotel manager tried to dissuade him from entering the hotel room. Before Enslin entered the room, I was ready for terrifying things. <br /> <br /> The first chocolates appear on the pillow and the toilet paper is folded. Enslin reacts in a reliable way. He is terrified. I am encouraged and think to myself, it will be good. People who created this movie understand that less is more. <br /> <br /> But what happens next was a big disappointment. Subtlety is quickly replaced by a predictable approach to the shotgun ... Just shoot the audience with every frightening Hollywood trick in the book and hope that something will work. Let's see, the clock radio that turns itself on? Well, it's always horrible. Objects that move in the room? Okay, you can not complain about it. Blood drips from the walls and drowns? Great. Spirits who commit suicide? Good. Something else? What about loud sounds, trembling, fire, more shocks, confusion in the room, more blood, etc. Everything is fine. And everything was done before. Overpower our disordered audience with attention deficit by using all sorts of things at short intervals and will not be able to look away. <br /> <br /> Well, it did not work for me. And you know what else? When I go to see a horror movie in a theater, it's typical to hear a few groups of girls in the audience shouting in fear at terrifying times. But this movie did not have horrible moments. The audience was quiet and selfless. I did not feel the cold on my spine. Nothing. The Shining was 100 times better than this movie. <br /> <br /> So who are all these people who say it is one of the best horror movies ever? Friends of the director? I'm sorry, I just do not understand it.
