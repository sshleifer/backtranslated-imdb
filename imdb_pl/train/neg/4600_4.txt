I have read all the reviews here about how it is such a good movie. Jesus, this movie was predictable and quite boring. Acting most of the time was below average, especially by Mckenna. I did not see a more pathetic attempt to make someone "bad" in the film. Oh boy, this movie was disappointed. I also read somewhere, it can be a cult classic. I know there are the director's supporters, but this movie was just an ordinary movie. <br /> <br /> The script was bad, most of the acting was bad, the movie was bad. > <br /> Oh, and pray for a guy who used to be in shouts. It looks really bad. <br /> <br /> The best actor in this movie was probably a guy in the office space, and he was only in this movie for about 8 minutes. <br /> <br /> 4/10
