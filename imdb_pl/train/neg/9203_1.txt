Many people like to point to this TV movie when he was arguing with the huge legions of Hanks-philes that Tom was actually making bad movies (I think "Bachelor Party" was great, but that's another story). The film focuses on a game in the style of "Dungeons and Dragons", which ultimately brings our young Gump to hallucinatory madness. The story is adorable in the early 80s, focusing on the imminent threat to our youth that these evil RPGs create. <br /> <br /> However, I prefer to watch "Mazes and monsters" as a turn point in "Whatever happened to Chris Makepeace?" plot. we all remember him as "Rudy the Rabbit" in "Meatballs" and as the unfortunate Clifford in "My Bodyguard", where he gave us all substitute emotions, defeating Matt Dillon's shit. Few could argue (especially those of us who read "Dynamite!" Regularly) that they were great things for him. <br /> <br /> And then came Rona Jaffe. The line between bad acting and bad writing is very thin, so I leave you the decision that Makepeace committed. All I know is that the last major release I saw was "Vamp," and it was 1986. He had a small role of Sean Penn's brother in "Falcon and the Snowman", but at that time the Brother Pack torch was passed on to others with simpler hair and brilliant biographies. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie with a clear conscience. See if it's only to see a younger, more idealistic Chris Makepeace before Ron Jaffe feels his soul.
