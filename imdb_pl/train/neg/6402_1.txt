When I saw this movie, around 1979, it became the first movie I ever went inside. There is nothing worse than a comedy that is just ridiculous, and this one misses every time (although I can not speak for the last 25 minutes of the movie). There was nothing original in any of the sketches. While I, if appropriate, like the humor of the flare, these skits were unnecessarily vulgar. Even more annoying was that the movie was advertised as the "first movie of Robin William", using his new fame in the TV series "Mork and Mindy." However, his role has been so small that it can not even be seen on the screen.
