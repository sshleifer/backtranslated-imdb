Why do people take good material and feel the need to change how? After reading the book where the movie was supposedly made a few years ago, I can say that the original book is very small. I went to this movie with low expectations - I knew it would be a bad feeling on telemovie - but they could not even be met. <br /> <br /> This is not a prequel - the only relationship it has with the original is the name. This is not the story of Carlito Brigante, it is a story of a completely different character, which was given the same name. They simply spat in the face of every fan of the Way, Carlito; adding an insult to injury by casting Luis Guzman, who plays a key character in the original movie, in a different role. <br /> <br /> The most disappointing thing is that now, when this movie was filmed, no other film will be made turning to the original, intact material of the Carlito's Way book - something that I would really like to see. I felt the same in the case of Chopper - they have four books, and fantastic intelligence material worthy of interviews and could create a great biography of the most terrifying Australian character from the underworld, instead they made a movie about madness, but a strangely pathetic little cheater of time (though Eric Bana's performance was at location). Now we will never see the real initial growth and fall of Carlito. <br /> <br /> Three stars, because looking at it only as a standalone movie, it's not so scary - there are some decent performances (Jay Hernandez is not Carlito, but he may be good in other roles), and the story does not it's so bad. Even Puffy Combs fits his role. But at this time they do not understand the nature of the underground (I am a fan of non-fiction crime) - something that the original film and books were right (they were written by a lawyer then, and now Judge Edwin Torres). <br /> <br /> The fact is, however, that it is not independent - this is probably the most disappointing prequel that has ever been filmed.
