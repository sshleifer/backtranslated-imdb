I watched the pilot and noticed more than a few similarities between 3 lbs and House, M.D. Tucci's character is a genius, but socially inept by choice, similar to the Laurie House character, but without the harsh joke Laurie brings to House. Meanwhile, Tucci's "simple guy", determined by Dr. Seger, does not become a more interesting figure than the fallacious "ordinary guys" Cuddy and Wilson. Indira Varmy's character, Adrienne Holland, is too similar to Jennifer Morrison's doctor Cameron to be co-present. <br /> <br /> Someone at CBS apparently noticed the success of House and MD, and his staff had a similar show, hoping that the mimicry would prove effective. However, copying a program like House requires the same high level of balance between wit and tension, and Tucci and the company are not able to meet this challenge. <br /> <br /> I did not know that the program was canceled until I read IMDb comments, but this is not a surprise for me.
