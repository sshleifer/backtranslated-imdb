I've seen a lot of bad movies. Most of the time, I can enjoy this horrible horror. But this really badly affects new extremes. <br /> <br /> It is bland, the plot of what it never has, never ends and requires time. There is no shock, no horror, no tension, just a load of men rubbing against you for an hour and a half, and then a quick finish. <br /> <br /> Blight for shit horror, avoid it at all costs. <br /> <br />
