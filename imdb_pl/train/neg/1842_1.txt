This is my first video review on IMDb. I was forced to register after watching this movie. I can not let this film be invisible by me with a clear conscience. People must be warned! <br /> <br /> First of all, my rating is: 0 (as in "zero") <br /> <br /> I love Jacek Black, Ben Stiller, Rachel Weis and Christopher Walken, and yet I hated the movie. There is a conspiracy, but who cares if there is no script. Dialogue is unrealistic and simply boring, situations are invented, the flow of events is slow and somewhat arbitrary, the characters are unpleasant and uninteresting, and the story, though based on a good premise, is stupid. This movie is a pile of poetry. <br /> <br /> It does not matter that you're wasting money on this movie, it's not even worth your TIME spent watching it. Please, do not look at this ... I'm begging you!
