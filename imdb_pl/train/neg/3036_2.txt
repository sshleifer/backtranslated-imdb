This movie was absolutely horrible! I can not understand how this film went into production. Of course, nothing against the cast of the film, it's all the fault of the writing team. You take the old average story - let's dance our way of being poor and destitute - or STEP in this case. But this one does not have the appearance of a real conspiracy - or at least that one would care about. With Canadian American-speaking actors - this movie is very flat. From a positive point of view, the director was quite good, and the photos were quite decent. It seems that the production budget was also very generous. My only demand is for this band to leave writing in peace and go to find real screenwriters who will help them revive the words in the movie. Net result - how it moves. How it sucks.
