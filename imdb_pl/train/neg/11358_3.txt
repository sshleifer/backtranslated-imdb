When I saw this trailer on TV, I was surprised. In May 2008 I was in Six Flags in New Jersey and it was seen in the 4-D attractions (you know, the attraction that the seats move). I think the version I saw was a short version (15 minutes) and also re-created to add motion effects. It was a charming movie ... but that was it. He was educational and talked about the first mission, but the ending of CGI spacecraft seemed a bit ... well ... trivial. I was not a big fan of this movie, but I recommend this movie to any parent who wants to inform their children in a fun way about the first moonwalk. I will say that the actors were well-matched and the characters themselves were adorable. So I would say that if you want to bring younger children ... go for it. But if you want to take your older children, take them to another movie ... they'll be grateful.
