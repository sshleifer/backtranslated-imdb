The most misogynist movie of all time? Not to mention '68, should not they have gone beyond white people in a brown face playing "Indians"? My favorite parts must be when the girls giggle and blush as cyclists pull them to rape them. Rape is great fun! Who knew? Let's see, this is a blatant scuffle of "The Hustler" (a thick figure is actually playing billiards while plotting to destroy Indians with the main rebel guy), terrifying acting, so-called maybe-just-good-well-just-told-you-what-to-think, music tips, no EVERYONE THAT REALLY Indian in this movie. Who should we cheer on? I must say that Quentin Tarantino loves this movie. Although his films tend to acquire strong women, I have heard from at least one source that he is in fact a misogynist idiot. Why did I watch it? Do not ask.
