While most of the film is very amateurish, it plays a kosher slaughter, but it is not true. The Kosher law says that an animal must be aware when the blade touches its skin. The kosher slaughter scene is accurate, just as everyone knows who saw it, or saw Pety's movie depicting a kosher slaughter in which the throat of animals was cut and the esophagus removed, while it is alive, conscious and obviously suffering. We must remember that the history is written by the winners. Is it even possible to even think that the Nazis were right? <br /> <br /> Does not it say anything that the Nazis forbade this cruel religious slaughter, and Jews are still practicing it today?
