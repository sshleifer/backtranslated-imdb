"The Home Front" by Frank Tashlin is one of the more life-less Private Snafu shorts, a series of cartoons made as instructional videos for the army. Instead of Snafu taking some undesirable actions leading to a catastrophe, the "Home Front" instead focuses on its loved ones at home and on how much they have to offer to the war effort. Snafu realizes that he was wrong when he thought it was easy. It's a concept with a few possibilities for good gags, and instead Tashlin plays risqu√© cards more intensively, expanding jokes with the participation of a stripper and scantily dressed dancing girls in place of much more effective comic relief. The result is a short sense that has little relevance or entertainment value today other than the historical artifact.
