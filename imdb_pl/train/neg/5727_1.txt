I would like to start by saying that this is the first review of the film I made on the web. I felt the need to warn people about this film because it's really one of the worst movies I've ever seen. After reading the interviews with the director, he says that he respects constructive criticism, so I will try to avoid pounding the film just because of it and offer my opinions why I found him so terribly horrible. <br /> <br /> 1. Actors. I know that the budget has not allowed the great thespian, but with Nicholson working in the industry for more than ten years, he certainly knew several actors who were at least average. <br /> <br /> 2. Extremely bad makeup and special effects. Once again, the budget, of course, collided with what was originally planned, but after many years of work on make-up there really is no excuse. <br /> <br /> 3. Obvious similarities to the hostel. Although it is not a rip off, he is surely trying to earn from the successes of previous films. The only problem is that Roth knew where he was going and how to get there ... <br /> <br /> 4. Music. Not at all frightening or persecuting, not even disgusting, just annoying. <br /> <br /> 5. The script in general. The whole dialogue was forced and scary! Also the threads about the theater and the guy who comes to save them were weak and almost like reflection. <br /> <br /> 6. Editing. WTF. How shocking, not in a good way. nuf said. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I'd like to hear the director's thoughts on my post (no doubt he visits his pages on IMDb.) because buddy ... what you thought. Certainly at some point during shooting or editing you realized what turquoise yol was on your hands ... I'm sorry I do not want to be harsh, but you must have more talent than I hope your next feature is a ball movie or wahtever is better, hopefully the practice makes progress. <br /> <br /> But in the meantime, avoid it like a plague. I want my 81 minutes to come back with interest. (At least I did not pay to watch it.)
