It must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This (I think) the story of a rebel college basketball player, his hard-core trainer, his girlfriend and student (played by Michael Margott) who has continuous nervous breakdowns. History does not exist anywhere, there is no character development, nobody cares, and performances, except for Bruce Dern as a trainer, are terrible. It's hard to believe that talent like Jack Nicholson could direct such a horrible movie. Avoid this turkey.
