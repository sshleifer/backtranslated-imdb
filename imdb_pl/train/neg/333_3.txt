I remember when THE GOLDEN CHILD was released in 1986, it was widely accepted by critics and I say so much that more or less ended up Eddie Murphy's brilliant career, so I think this film has something to do /> <br /> It starts wrong, where the Buddhist monks kneel in front of the child with an empty expression on their faces. The bad guys enter the temple <br /> <br /> The child sits with an empty expression <br /> <br /> The bad boys hack mnichowie <br /> <br /> The child sits with an empty expression <br /> <br / > Bad guys are pulling out a gigantic bird cage and hammering a kid inside, who's sitting with ... Go guess? One gets the impression that even if they took him to spend the night on Michael Jackson's ranch in the wonderland, he would still have the same empty expression, this movie would be better titled THE WOODEN CHILD <br /> <br /> The title sequence starts and is a movie with 80s. Of course it could be cool and cool then, but now in 2004 it seems very outdated. Not only this, but it is completely behaving with a slightly bloody opening. In fact, this is the main problem (and the boy is a serious problem) with this movie - The whole mood changes from stage to stage so much that sometimes it resembles watching scenes from completely different films connected with each other. Personally, I blame the director, but it should also be emphasized that both the screenwriter and the producer should be equally guilty. Did anyone know before the start of the shooting, what would the film be like? This is partly fantasy, part of the martial arts, part of a friend, part of the comedy and all this nonsense
