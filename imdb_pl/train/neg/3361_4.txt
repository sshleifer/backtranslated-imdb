This movie was one of the greatest films in history, it had everything to make the movie great. Awesome acting, amazing special effects ...... wait, I have to think about a good movie. Well, it was not one of them, it was just nothing. <br /> <br /> I want to know what kind of bone head would think that this movie was 10. When I voted, there were 206, God knows what's going on in their head. Regarding the other vote, 8 or 9 was even too high, but 10? Come on, what made this movie sooooo good to give it 10? I know they are the same 206 who thought that Jean Claude Van Damme is a great dramatic actor.
