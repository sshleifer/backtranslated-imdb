It seems that this is the only movie that John Saxon ever directed, and that it made a good sense to stop and stay in front of the camera after that. This movie is a dog, from beginning to end, and it is boring and wooden, there is nothing to do in it. The hero of the Vietnam War undertakes a job for a mafia boss, becomes a little too friendly with his wife, and then the wife is killed by the head of the mafia and a war hero bound and sent to prison, death cell. Now this particular prison experiments on prisoners and tests a formula that will turn people into a killing machine (zombie). Of course, everything goes wrong, and then there are all infected people trapped in prison, some of whom turn into zombies, and the rest who suddenly do not want to be there anymore. It just lasts and there is nothing special to show or tell yourself, and I stopped doing it before the end, which seemed to come several times, but no, apparently just started a different and equally boring path. If you've been guarding the rest of the way, you can become a zombie yourself, so do not take any chances. 2 out of 10.
