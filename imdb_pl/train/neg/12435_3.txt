Alex D. Linz replaces Macaulay Culkin as the main character in the third film in the Home Alone empire. Four industrial spies acquire a computer chip for guiding missiles and smuggle it through the airport inside a remote-controlled car. Because of the commotion in the luggage, the grumpy Mrs. Hess (Marian Seldes) gets a car. He gives it to his neighbor, Alex (Linz), just before the appearance of spies. The spies are renting a house to break into every house in the area until they locate the car. Alone at home with smallpox, Alex calls 911 every time he sees robbery in progress, but spies always manage to escape the police, while Alex is accused of doing jokes. The spies finally turn to Alex, unaware that he has faked the devices to cleverly hide the whole house. Home Alone 3 was not terrible, but probably should not be created, you can not just replace Macauley Culkin, Joe Pesci or Daniel Stern. Home Alone 3 had some fun parts, but I do not like it when characters are changed in a series of movies, see at your own risk.
