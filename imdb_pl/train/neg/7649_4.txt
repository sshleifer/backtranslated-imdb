Joyce Reynolds seems to be an adult in the role of Janie, a mad-haired sixteen-year-old boy in a small town in America who throws a guy on a visiting soldier and ends up on the cover of Life magazine (smooching at a party) all in the same week! Permanent wisecracks, put-downs, bull talking and indecent interests, such as younger sister Janie bribing family members, Hattie McDaniel (as a maid) constantly wandering around the sassy kid, mother Janie associated with the Red Cross, and father Janie trying to write an editorial on the problems of today's teenagers (as parents, stifling, sexless Edward Arnold and robust, talkative Ann Harding creates an unbelievable pair, even in 1944, it looks like he can not diminish the child's conception) raising two of them). Nominated for an Oscar (!) For editing Owen Marks, Warner Bros. he followed him in 1946 with the help of "Janie Gets Married". Until then, Reynolds had to surpass his cohorts - she was replaced by Joan Leslie. * 1/2 of ****
