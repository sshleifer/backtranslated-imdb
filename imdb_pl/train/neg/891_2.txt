Loving "Paris, Je T'aime," I was very much anticipating this movie and I admit that I met high expectations, but I was very disappointed for many reasons. <br /> <br /> Although I did not expect the transformation of "Paris" in New York, I expected the same structure. In 'Paris' I liked the break-up of districts. You feel the style of every director and the story they want to tell. In "NY" there is no clear separation of the story, in different moments of the film, the characters from different stories fall into each other, which caused that I was confused about who I am watching and what exactly is happening. Also the change in directing was obvious but misleading because there was no flow. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I loved in the movie "Paris" were different approaches to love. It was not all that romantic. There was love between the parents and their children, unrequited love, a middle-aged woman lonely, longing for love, etc., she explored so many layers of complexity of love between people. "NY" seemed to be just irritated by sexuality. There were several exchangeable shorts (the older couple spent their whole life together, Julie Christie is short), but overall the film "NY" did not arouse any emotions for me. I have not made contact with any of the characters, as in the case of "Paris". I remember watching "Paris" and feeling deep sadness, loneliness, longing, hope, wondering ... it had so much soul. For me, there was no soul in the movie "NY." <br /> <br /> Maybe, if I were going into it without "Parisian" delusion in the depths of my brain as a comparison, this movie could trigger a more positive response, but as an independent repetition of "Paris, Je T'aime" I was very disappointed .
