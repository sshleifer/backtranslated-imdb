In addition to the "Tarzan" series, prolific Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote many other books, although in addition to the popular "At the Earth's Core" several of them were filmed. The only exception is the novel "The Lad and the Lion", which was shown on the screen as "The Lion Man" (1936), over-talkative, static, old-hat, slow and rather boring movie, even though it was filmed on real desert places. Actually, "film" is a bad word. The narrative does not move, but it runs at a snail's pace in sudden series of jerks. For example, at least five characters get complicated opening scenes and then simply disappear. Even more frustrating to the enthusiasts of the movie are the characters that make an impression (eg Lass, who sits down with the drug), but are played by players who are not recognized! Thespian libraries usually give way to worse than the unknown. The exception is the Australian actress Finis Barton, who describes the kidnapped harem girl who saves the young Master Fairy. It must be admitted that most casts are burdened with terrible dialogue of King James, who should be heard to believe! But the way to play this trash is cheeky, a trick that does not seem to have appeared in any of the sets of actors without talent. Maybe the director J.P. McCarthy suggested this idea. In any case, it is sad that the charming Kathleen Burke is forced to trade with such fans as Richard Carlyle (her father) and Jon Hall (her competitor). It must be admitted that Hall issues his complaints with a little more conviction than Mr. Carlyle, but this is not a recommendation.
