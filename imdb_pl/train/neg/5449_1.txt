The idea is that something interesting will happen during the first ten minutes to keep the audience close. Late Night Shopping manages to avoid interest much longer. When we get to the point, it's so monumentally moronic that I kept thinking that I had to misunderstand it. But I do not. <br /> <br /> Sean tells the story of the owner from Osaka, who rented the same apartment to two people at the same time who worked on different shifts, so they did not realize that they were sharing. His friend asks: "What about weekends?" Sean does not have an adequate explanation. Sean then talks about his similar problem, which is that he is not sure if his girlfriend still lives at home, because he works at night and works during the day, so they never meet. It has been going on for three weeks. But his friend does not ask: "Yes, but as I said earlier, what about weekends? You must see her then. It does not make sense. What are you talking about, Sean? ? But let's be generous and suppose that they both work seven days a week. <br /> <br /> We see Sean checking if soap and towels were used. (In fact, oddly enough, he starts to carry soap.) But what about the conditioner and shampoo for his girlfriend, sanpro and moisturizing cream, toothpaste and toothbrush. Let's go to the kitchen. What about food and drink? Is something missing? Has it been bought? Has a shared bed been made in the bedroom? Are her clothes used and exchanged for clean? Is the laundry basket fuller? Is the seat raised or lowered in the toilet? I mean, good regret! <br /> <br /> And to stop it all, Paul prepares for an early departure from work to see if his girlfriend is still living at home. Why does not he just call her? <br /> <br /> But it's even worse. In the last act, although no one told Vincent, where the rest of the group is going, he manages to find them. Lenny's interest and Sean's girlfriend seem to be the best friends and also manage to find a group. There is not even a slightest attempt to explain any of these unbelievable coincidences. <br /> <br /> To be fair, dialogue is okay, but it's not good enough to catch up on weak characters or an annoyingly bad story. br /> <br /> I heard that one of the actors gave an interview and promised "no weapons, no drugs, no corsets." I thought "great." But after half an hour of boredom I shouted on the screen: "I want guns! I want drugs! I want gorset√≥w! "<br /> <br /> It would not take too much. but on the official website the director praises that the film was not scripted. That's all you need to know.
