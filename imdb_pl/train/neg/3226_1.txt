With this movie we have reached the limit of unbelievable. Essentially, dinosaurs board this ship piloted by some strange fart named Neweyes (which I needed after watching this movie). Apparently, Neweyes hears the wishes of children around the world and decides that he should fulfill the children's wish that the dinosaurs should be introduced into modern times, so that everyone can see them for shameless exploitation. Dinosaurs eat those things that make them smarter (It's a pity the writers did not have them). By the way, does it seem strange that of ALL the wishes of children in the world, Neweyes wants to bring dinosaurs to modern times? Why not let children stop hunger? Disease? War? Come on! Is Neweyes nothing better to do with all the power he has? Finally, when dinosaurs reach modern times, they start singing, dancing and destroying havoc (basically what can be seen on a bad LSD journey, I mean, where else can you see T-Rex playing golf and a Spider-man jumping on the balloon?) . They will end up in the circus, and Neweyes Brother Screweyes (???) will make the children who befriended the dinosaurs sign an empty contract. Why? Why should children sign an empty contract? Screweyes says that if the dinosaurs take ... "Brain-Drain" that it will let the children go. Dinosaurs, instead of tearing the evil limb of Screweyes from the limb, surrender and agree to its conditions. What?! This is stupid! They could just threaten him, force him to withdraw from the contract, eat him, and then leave with the children. I think filmmakers have tried to show that violence is bad, which is a contentious issue when, in the end, dinosaurs run away, and a bunch of crows covers Screweyes and apparently eats it completely. Oh yes, it is not violent at all! We're back, it does not make sense, it's not funny, it's stupid, it's stupid, it's badly written and it contains some of the biggest storylines ever made in the movie. Even for a children's movie ... it's BAD.
