Shocking! <br /> <br /> In 1965, I saw Jury Gagarin alive. He was honest, unpretentious and kind, he was calm and looked a well-educated and intellectual person. In this movie, I saw a clown! The actor looks like a mannequin with touched gestures and mimicry. They made a cartoon! Real Gagarin was someone else! Do not believe in this movie! <br /> <br /> I saw this movie after films such as "Taming of Fire" and "Apollo 13" and after reading the books "Rockets and People" Chertok and "Korolev: Myths and facts" by Golovanov. I was shocked by the tiresome scenario, poor acting and production as well as many inaccuracies of Space Race. <br /> <br /> The film is a tedious presentation of well-known historical facts in Russia. Many interesting facts about space projects have not been demonstrated. Some facts and details have been distorted. For example, in 1945 Korolev was no longer a prisoner (liberated in 1944), And in 1940. He was no longer in the prison in Kolyma, but in a special prison design office. Korolev was a designer in the prison design office and the dead prisoners were not buried. But in the film Korolev worked as a gravedigger after 1940 (Because the prison guard has braces on his uniform). IMHO, the film's authors have no deep knowledge of this part of the story and can not make interesting films.
