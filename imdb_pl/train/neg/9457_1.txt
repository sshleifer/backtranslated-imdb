Almost everything in this movie is bad, bad, bad. Take, for example, Mike Myers. He has reached the point where you realize that his shtick has not changed since the days of SNL, more than a decade ago. He does the same joking jokes of consciousness and the same voices. His cat is painfully uncomfortable. He's trying hard. This is some kind of comic type A, not a nice cat, which should be. The rest of the movie is just as bad. The sets are unbelievably ugly - and apparently a loss of millions of dollars. (Cutouts from cardboard for background buildings would make more sense than building the entire neighborhood and the main street.) Alec Balwin is trying to make a fun impression of the Big Santini, but it ends up looking and sounds inconsistent. There is even an inadequate moment for a cheesecake with an artificial fame Paris Hilton - which is in the head only because it is supposed to be the story of Dr. Seuss. Avoid this movie at all costs, people. This is not even an interesting wreck of a train. (I hope they'll make Horton hear Who with Robin Williams. Then we'll have a comedy trilogy with a movie about the evil Seussie).
