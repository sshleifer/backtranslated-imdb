I was so excited when I discovered that it is available! I could not wait to see it. What a waste of energy! It's a bit like this rare CD of your favorite band you found in the back of your wardrobe at your local music store. Being a hard fan, you were sure that it was a valuable discovery. But when you heard it, it became obvious why these dogs never hit a real album. This DVD is only recommended for "specialists" who must have everything Lynch did. "Six Men Getting Sick" is a bit visually interesting, but short and repetitive. He lacks the power of Lynch's later work. "Grandma" is simply an immature job. It's boring and looks like a student movie. But it was the seventies ... It's interesting if you're hoping for the psychoanalysis of the director. But you can see, briefly, the seeds of some of his trademarks and sounds. "The Alpahabet" is forgotten (really not! I do not remember it!) "The Amputee" is pointless. "Cowboy and French" is simply stupid. "Lumiere" is the only band worth attention. Without a dialog, Lynch tells a disturbing story comparable to his best job. I had to watch it several times. But it lasts less than 2 minutes. It is difficult to rent or buy a DVD.
