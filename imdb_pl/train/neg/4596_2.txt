A question for you: the family goes to a new home and is persecuted by demonic forces. What movie are I talking about? Any horror movie you've seen? Yes, it's true, but it's not the answer I'm looking for. I'm narrowing it down, saying there are many scenes with teenagers. It does not help Well, there are a lot of bits in which characters are tracked by the creature, and you see the characters through the creature's POV. Not again? Is it a sequence of dreams with a lot of blood? There can still be any horror you say. Oh, it may take a few weeks, so let me say that the movie I'm talking about contains a lot of Australians, many of whom have appeared in NEIGHBORS and HOME and DOWN. Yes, it's true that the film is THIRD CIRCLE (aka CUBBYHOUSE) and do you understand what the above exercise is about? The point is that I pay attention to how THIRD CIRCLE is absolutely different from any horror film
