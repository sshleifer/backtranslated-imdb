Imagine a Big Chill with a crew of twenty-something who are unacceptable characters, and a lizard like a iguana chases them and you have an idea of ​​stupidity. The positive aspect of the movie is not showing the monster. There are no pictures of the side and night scenes in which you must imagine what it looks like; he is there, people. Unfortunately, the design and construction are not inspired. A little secret could help. I think I've seen a lot worse, but if you're going to display it for hours, your monster will look better. <br /> <br /> Spoiler Ahead !!! <br /> <br /> Oh, and there is a crazy end with the participation of a supposedly dead brother who absolutely does not make sense. It was not a surprise, considering the cheap script writing. When it comes to acting; let's say that it was not painfully bad, but I do not expect that we will see many of these children in future film performances. <br /> <br /> Gore quotient: 2 out of 5; Nudity quotient: 1 in 5; IQ: negligible
