This film certainly has one of the strangest themes in history - out there with the passionate defender of Ed Wood in "Glen or Glenda?" <br /> <br /> Theme: bridge game. The set recreates Park Avenue; Bohemians are playing. The Russians - who speak very dubious "Russian" and have the most unconvincing accents when they speak English - play in the restaurant where they work. <br /> <br /> If you're not interested in the bridge, one - even in spite of a great cast - probably will not be too interested in this bizarre movie. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young and Paul Lukas are doing well. (Well - Frank McHugh is an unlikely writer of ghosts - because Lukas is an unbelievable Russian.) But all are sunk by fetishism.
