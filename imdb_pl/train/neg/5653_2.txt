Let's put it this way. Actually, I get this movie. I get what the writer / director tried to do. I understand that the dialogue was supposed to be dry and devoid of emotions. I understand that the plot was to be undefined and out of date. That's how the screenwriter / director went. Very, very dry humor / comedy. With all this understanding, I still think that the film is useless. It seemed that the screenwriter / director tried to recreate Napolean Dynamite with this film. It had all the same functions. Even the main character behaved similarly to Napoleon. But Napolean Dynamite was really funny. His script worked. This movie is not. Does not make sense. Well, let me reform it. His only goal is to break Napolean Dynamite and attempt to capture this appearance. It is a pity that it did not work.
