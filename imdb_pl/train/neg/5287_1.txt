I have no idea why they created this version of Persuasion when they had such a good mini-series with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. I suppose they wanted to create a full-length version, but of course many things had to be removed; Unfortunately, what ended on the floor in the cutting room was a wonderful joke and humor, leaving a film that was just a melodrama, not an entertaining display of English manners and manners. <br /> <br /> Also, the characters were shallow and uninteresting. They had poor Anne chasing down the streets after Captain Wentworth like a silly contemporary teenager (and if you happen to be a stupid, modern teenager who reads this, I'll tell you: running after a man like a woman in the heat is NOT cool). This is something that a well-behaved woman from the Napoleonic era would never do, and certainly not this level heroine. <br /> <br /> Some say they consider the antics funny; my reaction was not laughter, but indignation. The very idea of ​​such corruption of Austen's work is below contempt. <br /> <br /> It was terrible.
