I almost drowned in CHEESE watching this movie. Actually, I could not even finish it. I want my money back. One more weak attempt at Hollywood to come up with a new idea. It's good that I'm holding a bowl of lemons in the fridge. Just in case. They should give Nic Cage a cap and a whip. Swashbucklin ". Cage's performance at Raising Arizona or Leaving Las Vegas beats this "lemon". People who are completely and completely advertised (and most of them are) should love this movie. If this movie was animated, I would take it more seriously. I would rather pay to see a completely stupid movie that did not try to hide it. In my opinion it was an incredibly stupid movie and an even more amazingly sad attempt to hide this fact. <br /> <br /> The entire OWCA, however, seems to love.
