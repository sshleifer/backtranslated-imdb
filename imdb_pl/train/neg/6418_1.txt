Let me start by saying that I am not a fan of horror movies. I never watch them. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you about my experience ... <br /> <br /> The only reason I watched this movie was that my girlfriend and her friends wanted to see it Happy Feet . <br /> <br /> ... I've never seen Happy Feet, but I'm sure it's better than this ... movie? In any case, we did not expect it would be good ... actually we just went to laugh at it. Good with me ... I have a problem with ruining the movie for other people in the theater, but because it was only other couples who talked and thought about, it did not matter. <br /> <br /> After 15 minutes 2 other people left to sneak into Borat, a movie that I would like to see again. The movie was not scary and it was not stupid, so it would be fun ... it was just boring. It was not terrible, like "Baby Genuises" terrible, it was horrible as ... not fun. Avoid. <br /> <br /> Now I'm not an expert, but it seems that the problem with the horror industry is that you can have a PG-13 horror that is boring and not scary, or you can have R horrible horror, which is either too bloody or too disgusting to people. <br /> <br /> Do you want a PG-13 horror movie that sucks, but is it fun? See "The Grudge". Avoid this movie like a plague ... because it can literally bore you to death. <br /> <br /> 0/10
