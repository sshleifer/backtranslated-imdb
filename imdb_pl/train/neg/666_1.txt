I saw this trailer and thought that my god is a real movie who would like to see this movie, and at the same time I thought that my friend turned to me and said, "we have to go see this movie." ..I should say that I saw it for about 5 minutes and tried to put on a brave face and enjoy cheap horrors, but there were not even them. It must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The director has no influence, there is no perspective that the same shots are used again and again, he did not build tension. I'd like to see the script because the first 40 minutes are mainly annoying girl chuckles and bad music, there was absolutely no character development. <br /> <br /> The plot is just ... there was no story it was. Basically, I know that we terrorize a group of high school students on the night of a ball with a serial killer of persecutors, It's genius! hmmm Acting was what you expected from the Australian soap opera, hopeless, the main character that hurts me blonde. her longest line had to be half-correct, and every time she was in the camera, she just pulled another naughty expression on her face. <br /> <br /> Listen to me, if you have any taste in movies, do not go to see it, and if you're like me and you do not have a good choice, I wish you luck, maybe smuggle your iPod or magazine. I can not believe that this movie was made!
