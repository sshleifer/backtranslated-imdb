"Back of Beyond" takes place at the dive station / gas station in the middle of the Australian desert, led by Tom McGregor (Paul Mercurio), a shy guy who is suddenly in a difficult situation when some guests arrive unexpectedly. We get what initially seems misleading, like the retrospection in which he and his sister (although their relationships are better understood later in the film) run through the desert on a motorcycle. Then he appears as a terribly quiet and sometimes moody character in the presence of newcomers. <br /> <br /> We know that one thing is certain and that is McGregor's spiritual sense of prediction, his prediction of danger and such - his clairvoyance only slightly relates to history, most of which concerns three diamond thieves whose car is broken and who rely on Tom, who helps them out of place without getting in their way. Of course, Tom falls on one of the thieves, a young woman named Charlie, and suddenly falls into all three suspicious allies against each other. But not in a way that really causes some secret or action. In fact, the whole movie seems to want to build something meaningful, but it really does not. Even the ending, which unfolds like a trivial story about a bonfire (and which really reveals many narrative flaws), is almost as ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's worth a try if you do not remember about the terribly slow pace, but at least in the mood for something a bit different than usual.
