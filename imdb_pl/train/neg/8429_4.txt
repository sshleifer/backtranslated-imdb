This film does not offer anything new in the genre that traditionally shows a cultural love story based on politics in the mid-twentieth century / in India before World War II, where the British and their modern ways are bad, and primitive but honest and true Indians are good. Certainly such stereotypical images of the British are now rather pass√©. <br /> <br /> In addition to the drama that drives the second part of the film, the narrative is predictable, the acting is pedestrian and two-dimensional, and the director is obvious and unimaginable. <br /> <br /> The story really needed to be developed and it would certainly take half an hour on the screen to give the characters and narratives more depth and give the viewer something to sense of investment. <br /> <br /> In total, rather uninspiring. Oh, and Linus Roache just can not do a tragedy - looking at emotional pain just does not work for me!
