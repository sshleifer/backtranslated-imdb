I have never seen a bad movie for all the years, but what about the songs in the movie, what is physiological? WOW there is some crazy Pok√©mon that is breeding, I can take advantage of it. Animie makes no sense if the creators of this movie do not make sense, because his great marketing plan is limited to limiting the number of songs and will get a good rating. I think this movie would be fine if they sent a message. I understand what is happening and it is not a movie. This is just an animation that should be on the video. <br /> <br /> Ps: I will give her 1, because I got 5 bucks, I could not give her half because there are no halves.
