I am an ecologist for years and I really could not wait for this concert. I had to set the recording of all episodes because I thought I would really learn new great things. I probably could if I could get past Rachelle. <br /> <br /> I am sure that many of them are presented as a reality show and refer to this class of viewers. It does not work for someone who is really interested in improving the planet. <br /> <br /> This program should be called Nagging with Rachelle. <br /> <br /> Because Ed is such a large font of information, maybe a good idea will be a second concert that really takes the environment seriously. For some of us stupid things are not necessary. <br /> <br /> I do not record episodes anymore, nor do I watch the show, but let me know if there can be a real green show in the works.
