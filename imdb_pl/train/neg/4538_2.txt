I went to see this movie in the theater, but what a complete waste of time and money! Bad acting, I'm sorry to say it did not help me enjoy this rather sticky scenario. <br /> <br /> Some friends told me to go and see this movie because James Redfield, the author of the book, was very involved in the script. They really liked the book, so the movie had to be perfect. Maybe my hopes were too high, but I absolutely hated this movie! It was predictable, too sweet to the point that I actually left, that I had to vomit, and the worst is the continuation! Do the world a favor and stop this hideous crusade.
