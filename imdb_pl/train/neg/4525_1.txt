Nice scenery, but the story itself - in which the self-proclaimed Egyptologist (Lesley-Anne Down) visits Egypt and, while doing Egyptologists in the most egyptologistic way (eg shooting with a flash in tombs, handling old parchment, etc.), discovers a black market war for turf and somehow (within two days, no less!) becomes the epicenter of wearing war suits - it is more mysterious than any riddle he ever created. Down is just awful, like a British scholar visiting him (he seems to know absolutely nothing about the culture of Egypt, and even less about antiques, it's the writers' faults, but it's certainly annoying because everything comes out of their own fault), and the rest of the cast, including Sir John Gielgud and Frank Langella, seem as confused as I am. In short, not what you can expect from Schaffner (Planet of the Apes, Patton) and what. <br /> <br /> It is worth seeing a ridiculously outdated scene in which Down moves against all scholars, blaming them for her academic failure, bathed in the mildest light that Hollywood could collect. In addition, he spends the next hour filming, yelling and harassing and falling into the arms of every guy he can find. Wow, talk about your performative irony! <br /> <br /> * Note to future Egyptologists: attend a year or two in Arabic at a high school. It really will help in the long run ...
