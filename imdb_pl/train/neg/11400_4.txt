The Hazing is a confused mumbo-jumbo that the Evil Dead so desperately wants to refer to Bruce Campbell several times. The problem is that it's just not in the same league as this great movie. This movie is not nearly as original. The plot was used earlier by Kevin Tenney in the Night of the Demons, and it was much more fun. This move wastes time too much for complex exposition before bringing children into a terrible mansion and start demonic events. <br /> <br /> Brad Dourif does not have much to do, but when he's on the screen puts in another game that will make Christopher Walken jealous. When it comes to acting children, it is satisfactory, but it is not good at all. The camera's trembling work is more annoying than clever or moody. There are a few good moments when the first guy is possessed and throws cruel liners while sending his victims, but he has never been frightening. The gore level is medium to low, but the director is trying to make up for it by showing topless actresses several times. All in all, good, if you have 87 minutes to lose.
