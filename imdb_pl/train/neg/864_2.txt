Although there are over 180 films to choose from, this "Succubus" is often called the best film by Jess Franco. Heck, even the legendary filmmaker Fritz Lang counts "Succubus" to his favorites. So maybe it was me, but I thought it was a very boring and too confusing movie. The opening is great and shows Janine Reynaud performing the act of SM on the stage. All this is unfortunately off the hill. Reynaud's character is a maniac who finally kills his lovers in a trance. Franco had a decent budget for work and spends it in nice places, beautiful photography and mesmerizing music. This could actually be his biggest film, if it were not for a fragile and uninteresting story. This is to be psychedelic, but I would say that the sophomoric is a better term to describe what is shown here. For half the time you have no idea what is going on or what exactly has been said, so even a short 80 minute time seems to last forever. This is certainly not in my opinion the best Franco movie. I would not even recommend it to die-hard fans of exploitation. If you're looking for a better movie by Jess Franco, try to get "Las Vampiras", "The Horrible Dr. Orloff" or "Female Vampire".
