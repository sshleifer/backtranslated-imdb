It's a really bad movie. I destroyed my brain and I can not come up with a single positive comment. Acting is terrible. I saw more reliable results in access to cables. The story is ridiculous. Stolen diamonds, secret recordings of the President and a shark who attacks everything that comes close to him should be the worst in a bad game. Night of the Sharks is not even that bad, that's good. The dialogue sounds and is delivered as if it were written a few seconds before filming. And in addition, Night of the Sharks has the worst soundtrack I've ever heard. I'm surprised that my ears did not start bleeding from the techno synthesized sounds of the 80s that someone really wanted to record. <br /> <br /> From everything I read, the Italian film industry died until 1987. Sharks are like the last nail in the coffin.
