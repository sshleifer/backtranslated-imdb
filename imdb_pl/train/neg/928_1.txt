This movie is so horrible that it's difficult to find the right words to describe it! <br /> <br /> Initially, the story is so funny. A man with limited minds can write a better story! The actors are boring and uneducated, perhaps they were forced to play in this bad film. <br /> <br /> Receipt from the National Forest cameras is the only good in this entire movie. I should feel ashame because I paid for this bad picture. <br /> <br /> I hope that no one will do a sequel or make a similar movie with such a worse plot :-)
