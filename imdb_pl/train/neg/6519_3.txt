Filmed in a documentary style, but it's quite good to say that the participants were trained. Recently, a divorced would-be film producer (Myles Berkowitz) sees a chance to revive his love life and simultaneously enter the cinema. He intends to make a documentary about finding love by filming twenty dates, including consequences. Comedy is uneven at best; the rest is a disaster after misfortune. Also involved are Richard Arlook, Robert McKee and tempting Elisabeth Wagner. Trying to get credibility, downloading Tii Carrere is pronounced in an episode. This is enough as a guide on how to NOT get a satisfactory date.
