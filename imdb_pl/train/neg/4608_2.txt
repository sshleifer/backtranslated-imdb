I bought a DVD because it has a punishment and a rating of mpaa; "Rated R for strong violence and sexuality, nudity and language". <br /> <br />, which correctly, IMO, should; "Rated R because of strong violence, sexuality, nudity and language." <br /> <br /> the word "sexuality" should appear after the "comma", not "i" because of the huge difference in the meaning it does. I think that many people who have watched this movie will agree with me that some of the sexuality and nudity are ALONE. my first impression, when I look at the rating of mpaa, was that I would watch something like a "live" movie. that's why I felt cheated. in terms of history it was like that, after all, who really cares about history if there was a great punishment in it. I know not. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is just my opinion. <br /> <br /> Joseph
