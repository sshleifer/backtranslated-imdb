This appreciated production has its fans. But paraphrasing the classic bad review of Mary Reilly, Moby Dick is like a picture, only slower. <br /> <br /> This is because the philosophical foundations of the film "production" are never meant to be a great movie rather replace the lack of a strong guiding idea (in this case the transfer of books to the film) a list of hopelessly atomized, not dynamic but dazzling ideas in order to get viewers thinking that they have seen the size. As viewers and critics are willing to fall into it, Oscars appear, fueling the whole stupid equation. <br /> <br /> I do not share the pleasure that all reviewers have found. Moby Dick is stunningly uninvolved. Actors conscientiously recite essays about Jonah, Moby Dick, the ocean, Moby Dick, Moby Dick ... about all the things that can not be answered, and none of them absorbs in the slightest. He is dramatically indifferent. He does not build. In narrative categories, Moby Dick (as a movie) is not much more than an established conclusion in search of a true story. After half an hour, I mumbled: "Oh, terrible ... another oath ... another 4-minute monologue!" <br /> <br /> In an unsuccessful effort to get you involved, it's a pretty sumptuous business card. A lot of gray hair here. Starbuck is supposed to be a golden god. (!) <br /> <br /> It is known that someone looks at a great director when he creates his own film, instead of trying to recreate the feelings of someone's paintings and palettes, or respectfully embalm the classics, as Huston does. Images and books are nice, but they are different media. A film like this does not understand that a sincerely pleasant piece of shit (Village of the Damned) is better in many respects than the unbearable piece of culture. This is the filming school "Eat Your Vegetables". <br /> <br /> You appreciate the work that had to be done to make a movie, but not a narrative. Only a few segments reflecting marine research are interesting; registering shanty as a means of structuring work and various maritime efforts; and whaling technology. And it does not require a movie with two hours.
