I saw this movie at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2005. The film based on a novel by Brian Aldiss, a science fiction author, tries to tell the story of Tom and Barry Howe, the twins who have been pulled out of the family by the impresario to form a rock band. /> Almost on purpose, the movie is too wise by half (if you forgive the pun). Mixing genres, styles and moods, the directors (whose previous film was an excellent documentary of "Lost In La Mancha") quickly lose their orientation. I have never been sure whether to take it all seriously or not. Retrospections, dream sequences, everything was a bit too much. Besides, the promised rock and roll just did not move me. In the days of Hedwig and Angry Inch I remembered a bit too much, the movie I found original and moving. But in this case, the songs just were not as good, just like the main characters were not nice. A disadvantageous comparison would be the similarly disappointing Velvet Goldmine.
