"The Fox and the Child" is a new movie by French director Luc Jacquet who brought us the Oscar-winning documentary "March of the Penguins". It focuses on a young girl (wonderfully played by Bertille Noël-Bruneau) and her thriving friendship with a fox. <br /> <br /> There are really truly mesmerizing moments here; badgers mulching, lynx chasing a fox through a snow-covered forest; one scene, especially when the fox is tormented by a pack of wolves, is quite intense, and sometimes even frightening. However, there are simply too few of them. <br /> <br /> Beautifully filmed; cinematography is dazzling. The glossy look of the film is wonderful. It is undeniably a very lush production. <br /> <br /> The English version is narrated by Kate Winslet, but this little dialogue has already been very poorly named. The result is too fluffy, or at least that's my taste; and the script, although subtle, seems to jump from one scenario to another, ultimately leaving me almost surprised. <br /> <br /> Although the heart of the movie is a nice moral and the rather calm performance of Noël-Bruneau is quite adorable, the true star is the fox. These captivating moments that focus exclusively around our furry little friend are huge. However, once again there are too few of them. <br /> <br /> - To keep up with the latest videos, including reviews, news, discussions and more, visit www.mybluray. com.au
