The film tells about two stories: one is a political murder of a girl, the other is a political party of a higher class. The transition is the form of public relations Al Paccino, because he is a witness to the crime and initiator of the evening. <br /> <br /> If the script is horrible without any decent dialogues and directing the emptiness of any drama, Al's performance is memorable: how many people can be as convincing as a powerful and afraid man (like "Godfather") as here as a small servant (see also "Donnie Brasco"). /> <br /> Actually a large young lion became an old tired. This passing of the ages is very touching, because it makes the audience think about aging. <br /> <br /> But his slowness is just makeup because he can regain his energy on the church scene. > <br /> Maybe it's good that the movie is so horrible because it gives the stars Al's talent!
