I really would like to give this voice a negative voice, because I think I just wasted 83 minutes of my life watching the worst horror ever recorded. the acting was just ugly, I mean REALLLYYYY wrong, the dialogue was worse, the script sounded like written by .... I can not come up with anything terrible to say. And the day "outside" and the night "in the middle" make you think that the events lasted for several days. He worked terribly, directed, wrote, etc. Etc. Until the gofer, how everyone gets lunch. STOP ON THIS ONE COST. If my only salutary grace to stay out of hell is to do one good deed, I tell the world not to watch this shit. This movie is the reason why horror movies are never taken seriously.
