"Mojo" is the story of London in the 1950s, the world of beginner rock stars, violence and forced homosexuality. "Mojo" uses the technique of filming the 50s often seen in films that emphasize physical differences in our time, but also represent dialogue in a highly exaggerated way (largely due to the manner in which the speech was represented in films from that period); I have no idea if people said that outside of movies, but no films made today and embedded in modern times use such a stylized language. It is as if an honest discourse from 1950. Screenwriters served a common abbreviation for the past, which in reality appears to be a very distant country; and that's why it highlights a specific, not a universal story. "Mojo" presents the strong performance of Ian Hart and the annoying songs of Aiden Gillan and Ewan Bremner, who still have problems with building a career after "Training"; but it feels like a piece from the era, a modern movie unintelligible constructed in an obsolete idiom. Actually, it's boring.
