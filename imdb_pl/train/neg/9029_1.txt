This film wastes practically all the talents of every actor, what can best be called a "potboiler". <br /> <br /> Despite the full action of "Top Gun" the opening is from there with a lot of stereotypes and unlikely situations, following you until you try to choke on popcorn. <br /> <br /> There are so many blind stories in this movie that I guessed at one point that it was made by combining a rejected television series. <br /> <br /> The Mexican role of Quinn as a drug lord is ridiculous, and his "collaborators" are pulled out of the 1970 Quinn-Martin policemen. The Costner figure is wooden and does not give us reason to believe that he really fell in love with Mendez's wife. We do not convince convincingly that the wife hurts to be company and jumps over the first hot body. <br /> <br /> Definitely a "B" movie at best and a huge waste of time for everyone involved.
