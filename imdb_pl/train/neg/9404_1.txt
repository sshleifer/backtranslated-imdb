This absolute garbage is so closely based on the Friday's thirteenth series, which is practically a carbon copy, accepting it as an Australian movie with people who can not act. <br /> <br /> Once upon a time, a young boy accidentally burned while filming the music video at Lake Eildon. Now, many years later, the boy grew up and took revenge on anyone who came to the lake to shoot a music video. It is a cliche and a waste of time and money, see it only out of curiosity or if you are an aspiring actor trying to learn how NOT (not be able to) act. The main role was played by Alan Dale in the television soap opera Neighbors, but he found himself in the X files - how did it happen?
