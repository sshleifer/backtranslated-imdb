This movie was terrible. The screenplay is COMPLETELY unrealistic, but written in the real world, the effects of editing and lighting are worse than most of the first projects at the film school. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie to anyone who: A) knows all the details about the world of police or secret operations. B) knows all the details about creating a movie or recognition. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to the average or below average mind, I think it would be nice if I was dumber. If you have to watch this movie in full mind, I strongly recommend some kind of drunkenness. <br /> <br /> It is a total waste of small production value.
