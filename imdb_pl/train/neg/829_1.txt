I heard about this film and I knew it was not really good. But I started watching the movie (on my movie channel) and I was interested. This can be a really great, dark black satire on today's customs in the media. Small descriptions at each competition were good. It builds something that I would not want to miss. But when the so-called show begins, everything becomes unlikely, cheap and rather stupid. Here the writer should add something that will make people think. But instead it is packed and assuming that people are stupid. <br /> <br /> The ending is so bad that I give it to him 1. Even if the film starts promising.
