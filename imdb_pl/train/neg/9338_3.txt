Pam Grier as Coffy. She is a nurse looking for revenge on drug traffickers who attacked her sister with a bad heroine. Like any Blaxploitation flick from the '70s, you can expect racist guys to simply get desserts. <br /> <br /> In the 1970s dozens of these films were made and they were really degrading both for the black and white audience. This is mainly due to the persistent racial hostility in these films and humiliating, stereotypical figures. Especially female characters. <br /> <br /> Other popular threads between Coffy and other such films include brutal violence, corrupt cops, car chases, generous abundance of nakedness and the stunning sex of wonderful women. Not to mention urban ghettos inhabited by drug dealers, pimps, gangsters and other criminal scum. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier, she was the undisputed queen of the Blaxploitation heroines from the '70s. She was great, both hard as nails and gorgeous. As in other films, Pam eclipses other characters in Coffy. In fact, Pam is so charismatic on the screen that these kinds of movies are impossible to watch, without her as the main character. <br /> <br /> If you like Pam Grier, you'd better see her other films, like Foxy Brown or maybe Friday Foster. These films have a much less empty frame than Coffy. The character of Pam at Coffy degrades too much to get bad. Pam's characters in her other Blaxploitation films do not lean so low to take revenge as Coffy did. <br /> <br /> I would say you only watch Coffy if you can not see any of the other Pam Grier movies. Otherwise, Coffy is a waste of time. Only Pam's talent as an actress makes watching Coffy bearable.
