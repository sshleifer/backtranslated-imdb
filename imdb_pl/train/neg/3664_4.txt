Waldemar Daninsky (Paul Naschy) travels to Tibet and is bitten by yeti, which causes him to become a werewolf. He is accidentally killed after attacking his cheating wife and lover, and later he is revived by a woman scientist, Dr. Ilona Ermann, who uses it in mind control experiments. Daninsky later discovers an underground sanctuary inhabited by bizarre topics of doctor's unsuccessful experiments. <br /> <br /> After hearing about Naschy's death from his friend Jon Kitley, I searched my collection in search of the right movie to watch. In my fight, I discovered that I own not one, but three (!) Copies of "Fury of the Wolfman". The film has questionable video quality, the sound is dubbed in an average way, and the pictures are sometimes in the slapstick style. And American versions have deleted two love scenes. Honestly, without a remastered, uncommon copy, I did not get the right movie in all its glory. <br /> <br /> This movie claims to be the fourth of a long series of werewolf count Waldemar Daninsky. I suspect that's true, but you would not know about it from the movie itself. The plot is sometimes misleading and there really is no indication that it is a continuation. If you read the plot abstracts on Wikipedia and compare them with what is printed on the box, you will see that I am not alone in my confusion. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the shortcomings of the movie can be forgiven if you understand the production hell through which it passed. Floating for years, it was released only in 1973. Because of problems related to finding a distributor. And Naschy said in his autobiography that director Zabalza was an incompetent alcoholic and hated working with him. These are not really light accusations and I have no idea what Zabalza had to say on his own behalf. <br /> <br /> Chances are, sooner or later you will come across a low-quality version of "Fury Wolfman". It appears in sets of three packages and box sets, so you can accidentally get them and not even know. What really needs to happen is the American version uncut, with a decent sound and video mix and love scenes thrown back. As far as I know, it does not exist. Let us honor the heritage of Paul Nascha and transfer his films to a wider audience at the level it deserves.
