If you liked the first two movies, I'm sorry to say that you will not like this one. It is really nonsense and unnecessary straight to the video, probably a TV continuation. Constantly idiotic but nice scientist Wayne Szalinski (Rick Moranis) still lives with his family and has his own company Szalinski Inc. Unfortunately, his wife wants to get rid of the statue, Wayne is so stupid that he shrinks his statue and himself his brother. Then he shrinks his wife and sister-in-law. Now, adults must find a way to force the children home to enlarge them. Almost repeating the other two with only one or two new things, eg car queue with toys, swimming in bath, etc. Pretty poor!
