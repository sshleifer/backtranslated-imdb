An unmarried woman named Stella (Bette Midler) will become pregnant with a wealthy man (Stephen Collins). She offers to follow her out of duty, but she throws him aside and decides to raise her child on her own. Everything goes well until a child named Jenny (Trini Alvarado) becomes a teenager and things gradually (and predictably) become worse. <br /> <br /> I saw both the quiet version and the sound version of "Stella Dallas". None of them touched me too much (and I cry easily), but they were well made if they were dated. The attempt to remake in 1990 was simply a stupid idea. I think Midler had enough power after the incomprehensible success of the "Beach" to achieve this. It (predictably) bombed. The story is ridiculous and dated according to today's standards. Although Midler and Alvarado give good performances, this movie really drags on and I was bored to the end. Stephen Collins and Marsha Mason (both good actors) do not help in supporting roles. Thin and boring. Really - who thought it would work? Instead, see the version of Stanwyck from 1937. I give it to 1.
