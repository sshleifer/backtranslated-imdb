I rented this movie on Netflix after I won all the Oscars to see if it's really good. <br /> <br /> The Hurt Locker is a very realistic portrait of the (mostly) soldier rotation group in Iraq. The film focuses on Will James, a reckless soldier who gets the risk adrenaline and disarms the bombs. <br /> <br /> In my opinion the lack of this film is the plot and direction of the film. This movie does not have a clear storyline in contrast to other movies such as Black Hawk Down. What this film tries to do is focus more on heroes and their various attitudes about war. Bigelow does a good job focusing on characters, but there are many points in the movie where dialogue seems to be dragging. Hurt Locker has 131 minutes, but it seems to be a 3-hour movie. <br /> <br /> One of the scenes in the film, which was particularly horrible and ruined the excellent credibility of the films, was the scene of shooting in the middle of the movie. It was both unrealistic and very long. <br /> <br /> In general, I thought that this movie was OKAY, but the reason I gave him 6 instead of 7 was that winning the best shot was a big disappointment at the Oscars. I felt that this movie could be a lot better considering Saving Private Ryan, who lost Best Picture, but was much better than the movie. Another remarkable mention is Black Hawk Down, which only won 2 Oscars. Honestly, I do not know how it got the best picture. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a war action, rent a Black Hawk Down. This movie will be forgotten in a year or two.
