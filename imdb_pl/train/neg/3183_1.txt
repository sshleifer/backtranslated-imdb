Sergio Leone revolves in his grave ... If there was a movie that stumbles the life of a man, it's his job. The bravado of the "lone wolf" of the main character is uninspiring and bad, and the script was apparently written by a monkey with eight-grade education. Whoever thought this should beat the horse. The only reason I spend my time is that there is a minimum of 10 lines. Sergio Leone's family should sue, not because it's shit, but because now it's immortalized as nonsense by MST 3000. Shame. Disgust. I blame Hollywood ... at least Gary Busey is making nonsense that does not offend anyone but cocaine users and gun experts ... this movie is pure blasphemy.
