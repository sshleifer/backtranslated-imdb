Just think that "Clerks" costs a total of $ 250,000. How the hell did they spend $ 45 million to record this amazing video? Virtually unknown cast, two or three sets, no special effects that I saw ... I know, it had to be spent on this professionally made, economic scenario filled with tension. Shoot, this set of rods had to cost the package. Anyway, I think Jerry Bruckheimer would not be caught dead making anything for less. I'm just surprised that he did not blow anything up. <br /> <br /> In any case, it was not a horrible movie. Leading women seemed to have good chemistry, and the soundtrack was OK. IMO It is a pity that this fairly average project could have been realized for 5 million dollars without any loss of production, and 6 more films worth 5 million dollars could also be realized.
