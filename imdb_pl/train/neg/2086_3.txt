Ivan Reitman is something like a savior. The most tired threads (Ghostbusters, Evolution) come alive in his qualified hands. Even his occasional flop (Six Days, Seven Nights) shows signs of life and humor that make them worth watching. So I was disappointed that Reitman could not do enough of the original story (the man dumps the superhero, the superhero gets revenge driven by power) and transforms it into something enjoyable. The "girl" is a pointless exercise. The story of one pony takes a long time in the tooth after the first 20 minutes. The film can not decide whether it will be a romantic comedy or a superhero drama. The result is a film in which the flaps between the two parts are not well made. Uma Thurman is, as always, the best, and Luke Wilson also distracts himself from the role, although his crazy antics quickly tire. Even more annoying is the fact that in some scenes (such as when Uma turns over a headboard through the wall), you sense the witty, noisy work of Reitman practically screaming to leave. But after a few seconds, magic is lost, as fast as a superhero whose films are disappointing in almost every way.
