Underground Comedy is probably one of the worst comedies I've ever seen. I should have known it would be bad when the "guaranteed damage" mark appears on the box ... which means that the filmmakers will focus more on cutting than making you laugh. <br /> <br /> This film is an amateurish mix of children's sketches, bad characters and worse jokes ... from Bat-Man's sketchy sketch to Arnold Shvollenpecker's painfully simple sketch, it's just not funny. A few sketches that are a bit funny are few - for example, watching Michael Clark Duncan playing a gay virgin, for example - but even they last too long and are ruined because of Vince Offer's ineptitude in comedy. > Underground Comedy Movie Underground ... bury it!
