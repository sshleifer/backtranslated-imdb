I read all the reviews here AFTER watching this piece of cinema rubbish and it took me at least 2 pages to find out that someone else did not think that this frighteningly unfortunate assembly was not the height of humor in the 70s, or even any other era! If it's not the least funny set of sketches * comedy * I've ever seen, it will do so until it appears. Half of the skits have already been made (and infinitely better) by such acts as Monty Python and Woody Allen ... If I said that a nice piece of animation that lasts about 90 seconds is the main attraction of this movie, still do not come close to summarizing it as wasted and useless is to waste 75 minutes. Comedy seminar? Only in a world where the seed is really important. Scatological humor? Only in a world where scat is indeed feces. Are you kidding the precursor? Only if we mean that it is a textbook, like NOT to do comedy. Tits, bums and a strange beaver. It's nice ... if you're a boy with puberty, with at least one free hand, and you did not find out that Playboy exists. Give me a break because it was the beginning of the 70's? No way. At least a decade earlier, a sketch comedy appeared. The only way I could even forgive this movie is because it was a sight. Retro? Hardly. Sketches of subtly distorting children may be new in some circles (and it can be really fun), but it just comes really sad. What kept me for 75 minutes? Pure belief that they can save a really funny skit at the end. I gave it to film 1 because there was no lower score ... and I can only recommend it to sleepless or comatose patients ... or maybe to people who are suffering from sinhala ... their jaws will finally fall in disbelief.
