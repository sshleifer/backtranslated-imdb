The film is essentially a boring sequence of terrifying stereotypes that do not give a real insight into interculturalism. The middle-eastern part of the journey is described in a particularly annoying way: of course there are mud brick villages, paths in the middle of the desert, women dressed in black robes and belly dancers. I wonder how the whole picture lacked camels and palm trees. The personality of the two main heroes is very clumsy and many situations are not very reliable. <br /> <br /> The original idea might have been interesting, but at the end of the day, if you're looking for insight into the culture, you should skip this movie.
