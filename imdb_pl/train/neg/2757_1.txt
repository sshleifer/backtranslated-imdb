I am a guy who loves movies for guys ... I could not wait to see a dragon fighting the army for cool special effects. All this happened, however, this movie was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> The story was standard, but the presentation of this story was horrible. The scene transitions were the worst I have ever seen. Why would you go out to the beach to relax if your life was in danger? The very action of the dragon serpent was very poorly written ... and the snake's dragon attack possibilities were very diverse throughout the movie, the main characters should die a few times. <br /> <br /> The director tried to introduce a love story in the middle of the film in the most stressful times, this movie was not watched after filming, I loved movies, but I had to force myself to stop watching it, thank God I did not buy it I borrowed it from a friend. <br /> <br /> Do not buy it, do not rent it, just watch the discovery channel ... much more exciting.
