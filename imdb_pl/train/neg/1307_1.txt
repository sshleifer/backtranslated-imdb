It was a really bad movie. I am a big fan of Italian horror, Argento, Mario Bava, Fulci and yes, even our good friend Lamberto sometimes goes out with a good one. The first two films "Demons" were very funny - they were so bad that they were great, but this one is so bad that it is really, very bad. It is very boring, the story is never worn anywhere, and I hated the figure - the wife patting my husband and the tear of the baby-scream in my wife led me crazy, there was nowhere enough of a story dedicated to Ogre probably the best actor in the whole film. I turned it off about three-quarters, because I was very, very PLEASANT! Do not worry.
