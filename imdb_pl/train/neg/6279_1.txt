No, <br /> <br /> In principle, you are watching something that does not make sense. In order not to spoil the film for people who really want it, look at the movie that will explain the story to you. <br /> <br /> A normal everyday woman walks down the street and then rides in her own car. He follows her and at the same time many events take place, including her and her family. <br /> <br /> I made an account to comment on this movie, how terribly I wrote it. Acting was great, events were great, but history simply did not bring anything - it could have been added to a huge amount and become a global epidemic. I'm not sure what the writer tried to achieve by doing it, usually at the end of the movies most of your questions contain answers, but in this video you ask what just happened and 1 hour 20 minutes just passed by. /> <br /> Starts Spoiler__ <br /> <br /> They had this area between 2 dimensions (ours and behind the glass) that would enter our world and kill us. It has not been entirely developed during the movie and you never know how it happened, why it happened or when it happened. Nothing is explained during the movie. The main character should not even be the main character. At the end of the movie, the guy who will finally come up with everything and run away (her boy-sister) should be the main character, but unfortunately the movie ends 20 seconds after. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie for $ 10, I threw it out right after ... do not waste your time. I really hope that nothing will happen again.
