"Sleeping With the Enemy" is a predictable thriller "you've been there," which never seems to inspire, no matter how desperate they try to fill it and fill it. I can not believe that a group of my friends persuaded me to watch it in movies some sixteen years ago. <br /> <br /> The total lack of originality of Ronald Bass's script (based on Nancy Price's novel) does not help or outdated Joseph Ruben's direction or very average performance of Julia Roberts. The supporting cast, including Patrick Bergin and Kevin Anderson, does not help much. <br /> <br /> There really is not much to say. Just miss. <br /> <br /> Sunday, April 14, 1991 - Hoyts Cinema Center Melbourne
