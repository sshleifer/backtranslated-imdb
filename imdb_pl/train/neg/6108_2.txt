Tarzan the Ape Man is a remake of the 1932 film at the same time, and like the earlier film, it does not really resemble the literary character of Burroughs. But while Tarzan from 1932 was reduced to the speech "Tarzan - Jane", this Tarzan, played by Miles O'Keeffe, does not speak or even purr. He makes Tarzan scream a few times, which sounds like sampling from the previous movie. <br /> <br /> No, Tarzan plays a second banana for Bo Derek as Jane. Or rather as the third banana to the left breast of Bo Derek and her right breast. This movie does not make sense to show Derek naked. <br /> <br /> The two action scenes in the movie are presented in slow motion and are really bad. More evidence that no one cared. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, Tarzan has a kick on the side of an orangutan in this movie. Maybe he got into a car from Sumatra with Indian elephants that are also on display.
