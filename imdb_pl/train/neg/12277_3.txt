I found an "Arab conspiracy" in a container for occasions and thought I had discovered a lost treasure. People, there is a reason why you can not hear much about this film. The story is muddy, the pace is slow, Cornelia Sharpe is as alive as normal, cold tofu, and the end leaves you flat. Even Sean Connery can not save it.
