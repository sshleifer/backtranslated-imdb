Horrible use of stage cuts. All continuity is lost, either by a horrible script or a lethargic direction. This wicked robot ... he had to be a jazz dancer? In addition, one of the worst soundtracks I have ever heard (monologues usually drowned out by music). And ... where did they get their props from? This ship looks like a milk carton ... At the age of 13 I made better special effects on 8 mm! how to learn NOT to create a movie. Or ... was it the editor's fault? <br /> <br /> It's really a pity, because the script was actually a good idea ... just badly done. (I'm sorry Malcom.) You should have sent a "stunt double." You're too good an actor for a smelly bomb.)
