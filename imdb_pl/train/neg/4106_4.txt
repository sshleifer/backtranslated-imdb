It was almost incomprehensible to me that this film would be a bust, but I was really disappointed. Being a Beijingpah cinema connoisseur for years, I found this DVD, drastically reduced, for sale and I thought it was worth doing. The first few awards, characteristic of Beijing fans, connect people with animals, but here we have a non-dietary noise surrounding children playing on the school playground during the planting of the bomb. Fantastic tension. Then, when the perverts, Caan and Duval, go to the next mission, Duval drops the Cann bomb, that his date last night had a sexually transmitted disease, found only by sniffing her purse, while Cann was close to her. The resulting laughter is fantastic and clearly pays homage to Brian Depalma's Dressed to Kill, with Angle Dickenson's short-term spending. The problem with The Killer Elite is that after the credits, the movie falls. Even Bring Me The Head of Alfredo Garcia has more productive value, a bold call for anyone who knows what I'm talking about. I am using Pekinpah loans as an additional material for lectures, but after they are finished, turn off The Elite Killer.
