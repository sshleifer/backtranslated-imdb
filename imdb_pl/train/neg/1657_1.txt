This movie was worth five fists on my "hurter" card. I saw it during my stay in Virginia in the mid-1970s. I saw it myself, so I was not distracted when I watched it. It sucked. It was the most absurd, total celluloid waste I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I know that others who reviewed the movie thought he was amazing. I offer you this: if it was so great, what was it? End of discussion.
