American movies about the war and the Nazis simply can not be good. They can not refrain from being an idiot and following the program. All Nazis are bad, crazy, too proud, and Americans are so modest, but so capable, wise and human. Come on, stop this nonsense. The main character says something like "through this process, we have to make an aggressive war crime." Is America a peaceful country with its world budget of "defense" at the level of 420 billion dollars (# 2 China with just 51 billion dollars)? Is he just spent in this without ... ROI? Why present America as a peaceful nation when it is not? I do not really like movies with the program - they are throwing art into hell and trying to convince us to believe in something. Hollywood should stick the label on films, just like record companies have such a "parental advice". In some films, we should have "mushy advice", "propaganda advice" or "politically correct advice". It's one of them.
