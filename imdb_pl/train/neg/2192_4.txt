Another film based on the banal, rundown stereotype of a mad scientist who's gone crazy. The film focuses on a surgeon whose ambition is to bring the dead back to life. I know, I know ... You've never heard it before! Of course, like all these films, the experiment goes very, very badly and creates a manic, bloodthirsty creature. In this promising configuration, one would think that it would be a bit uncertain. Wrong. Like many films from this era, the idea is pretty, but the performance and script are mediocre. Not the worst horror I've seen (no, Abominator: Evilmaker 2 still takes the cake) ... but not one of the gems.
