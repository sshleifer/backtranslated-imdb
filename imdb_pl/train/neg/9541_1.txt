I suppose many people comment / review their first video on IMDb because the movie was spectacular or terrible - I'm writing about the latter. <br /> <br /> I was excited about the continuation of "Wargames" .. I thought the original was quite good, given its period and content, I felt that it was worth watching more than once. In 2008, I associated great hopes with what they will do with this film. Computers, games, terror, military overzealousness have grown so much since the first movie, and "Wargames: The Dead Code" had the opportunity to put it all into a great movie. <br /> <br /> The movie has failed in almost every level, but I particularly blame writers and anyone who has had any contribution to the realism of the game's aspects. "The Dead Code" is a flight simulator from the 90s with several people on the ground waving their hands. Meanwhile, Will Farmer presses around 7,000 commands - none of which affects what's happening on the screen. Finally, he "wins" by clicking the field on the screen with the mouse, which releases gas, which immediately kills 20,000 virtual people (no one is near gas). Because he defeated 5 LEVELS in 15 minutes, he tells RIPLEY (a real war machine) that he is a high level of terrorist threat. <br /> <br /> Although every 5-16-year-old can do the same task - the government believes that it is a deadly threat to humanity. They say things like "He has expert knowledge about bio-terror" ... He showed less knowledge than someone who read the first 3 paragraphs of the Wiki entry about Bio-Terror. So there's a movie scene with about 0.01% of the budget and excitement with any Bourne title. They have about 1,000 occasions to catch him and clean up the whole thing ... sometimes they're angry, they just miss him ... but sometimes they're masterful, just let him deliberately follow him. <br /> <br /> Ugh ... I would like to write more ... but I have already wasted 1.5 hours watching this, I would prefer to watch Broderick and Joshua play round and round for 1.5 hours.
