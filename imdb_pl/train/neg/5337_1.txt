There are so many negative reviews about "Stay Away, Joe" here, that I can not keep silent anymore and let this injustice happen. Here's a page you have not heard yet. <br /> <br /> Elvis Presley's films are my guilty pleasure for a simple reason: they are great movies for pure relaxation, because I do not have to think when I watch them. This means that I do not have to worry about the lack of a complex plot because there is never a proper story at the beginning. I can just put on my shoes, grab a beer, sit down, turn off the brain and enjoy the general crazy and catchy, easy-to-use rock'n'roll tunes from the thickest decade of them all. > In my books "Stay Away, Joe" definitely falls into the category "so bad that it's good". Now, if you are like me and appreciate the "value of junk", this is the best camp experience of the 1960s. It's so bad that watching is almost surreal, and when you think it can not be worse, it surprises you in the most conceivable way. In the end, you are so surprised by all the new levels of stupidity that you do not know whether to laugh or cry. In a nutshell: I love it because it's so damn funny that there used to be a generation that actually made such films. Still, I give 1 out of 10 - after hitting the bottom 100 it will become a classic movie with poor quality.
