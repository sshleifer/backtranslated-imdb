I must admit that since I remember, I was a sucker for Samurai films. I used to watch uncritically, be it "elite" songs, such as The Seven Samurai, or a bloody comic book, like Lone Wolf and Cub. I also liked the American / Japanese "Crossover", such as The Bushido Blade. And of course, everything that Sonny Chiba and Hiroyuki Sanada contain. I practically watched every Samurai at least twice. But not Kabuto. <br /> <br /> In 1993, I watched Kabuto for the first time, that even Samurai films can be boring. At the beginning I could not wait for Mayeda to reach Europe and the confrontations that would result from it, but before he came to Spain, I really did not care about this film. <br /> <br /> he would not do film justice to call it "bad". Technically, this is a pure entry to the genre. But it's just never quiet enough. Sho Kosugi has limited skills as both director and actor, and has only a fraction of the above-mentioned charisma of Japanese actors. Speaking of Sho Kosugis 'son Kane, who appears in almost all of Sho Kosugi's films as Shos' son: he inherited little or nothing of his limited acting abilities. The lack of blood and blood is added to the minuses, which until now was the trademark of the entire Samurai movie. This was of course intended for a younger American / European audience. <br /> <br /> Let's say it is a movie for the average historical-adventure fan, but boring for the hardened fans of the Samurai cinema. Fans who play in the genre of "Samurai meets ??" should rather watch Red Sun (1971), in which Charles Bronson appeared as a cowboy who must join forces with Samurai Toshiro Mifume to regain the samurai sword from the evil guy Alan Delon. That's how to do it right and where Kabuto went wrong. <br /> <br /> So, although the movie is only 100 minutes long, it seems to be a much longer movie. <br /> <br /> The reason why I released this honorary 4/10 points instead of 3/10: The first time I saw this movie, I saw it in the German synchronized version. In this version Kosugi can be properly understood. I must admit that his "Engrish" is sometimes funny, but it becomes tiring after about 30 minutes.
