"I'm working for an ominous corporation that leads industrial espionage in the future, and I'm starting to get confused with who I really am, sh * #t! I have headaches and everything goes unstable, oh, another, almost subliminal, fast muted, noisy montage of significant but mysterious images comes ... <br /> <br /> I rented this movie because a few reviews were all beneficial. Why? Cypher is a cheap, derivative, boring movie set in a poorly realized bland world of the future, with wooden tracks and a funny ending. <br /> <br /> The amazing feeling that something interesting can happen makes you watch a series of increasingly stupid and unconvincing events before the filmmakers hit you with the ending that connects the worst Bond with video Duran Duran. <br /> <br /> It's painfully obvious that they used the production with Dr. Who designs improvised special effects to include some good (if a little bit Babylon 5) CGI sets. This sub-Fight Club, sub Philip K Dick's future thriller, Noir is seeking a much wider range than his modest budget would allow. <br /> <br /> Cool blue mood served with seriousness - disappointing stupidity. This is not intelligent science fiction, it is the plot of a computer game.
