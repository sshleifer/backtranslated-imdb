Although, unfortunately, it is considered to be (a) intelligent, (b) important and (c) interesting, fortunately this movie fortunately ends quickly. The scenario does not make much sense, the whole idea of ​​a sado-masochistic relationship between the two main characters is strangely banal, and John Lydon shows us all, in the space of one movie, why he should never have left the music. His performance is one-ton and annoying. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing to say is that Harvey Keitel manages to secure a good turn. His later Bad Lieutenant will show how good actors can work, but fortunately his performance here is restrained.
