I have now written reviews of several episodes of MoH, and this is one of the worst. An interesting assumption at the beginning is completely abandoned until the inscription is rolling. If you watch things that you would never see in real life, it's fun ("let's check the basement!"), This is your program. Besides that it's not fun or fun - it's just annoying. <br /> <br /> The scope of the virus has never been shown. I can very much overlook the fact that it concerns only men, because the resulting situation is very, very frightening. But then the situation gets worse, when the daughter lets FULL MATTER dander into the house, and eventually dies with his hands. The woman escapes to the north and falls into several dozens of situations. Then a ghost or alien appears or something saves him (things that make you go HUH?). Or something. Then she is cuddled to warmth. End. <br /> <br /> Awful. These directors are sending these tripe.
