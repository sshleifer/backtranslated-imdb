That is why many people remain homeless. . . because stupid producers pay for their money to make such horrible movies, instead of giving, if they can be worried! <br /> <br /> This movie is even worse than white chicks! The Little Man has a bad excuse to put a dwarf as a child. The story is horrible because it was written by six people. The idea would still not be so bad if it was original, not a rip off of the comic strip. has fun moments, but some of them are exaggerated, and some are simply stupid. Acting was very, very bad. It was similar with directing. Everyone involved in this movie should be ashamed. he is racist and very offensive to dwarves. I mean, instead of showing them compassion, the creators of the film make fun of them! It really disgusts me how they do it. They see dwarves like children. And for a character who is a dwarf, pretending to be an abandoned child, to get a diamond from a certain family. This is his bad excuse to show something like that. It just was not worth it. Do not watch this movie. It is a huge waste of time and money.
