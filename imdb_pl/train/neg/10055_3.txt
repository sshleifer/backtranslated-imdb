I grew up in the theatrical version of "Superman II" ("S2T") and as a child I loved it more than part I, because it contained not only more Superman and three superman-type villains, but it started with a bang? ? the best transformations of Clark Kent in Superman and rescue scenes. The children did not have to wait impatiently for the appearance of Superman on the screen, as in part I. Now, as an adult, I can see how powerful they fell in S2T (see my review). I've always heard about the back story of how they prematurely and unreasonably dismissed the director of the original Richard Donner from part II. (It must have been a rarity when I was filming two separate films simultaneously, now it's common: "Back to the Future" and "Matrix" 2 and 3, for example.) Unfortunately, after I finally saw Richard Donner Cut (or , S2RD ") I still can not fully recommend it. Gone, there was a great scene of Superman changes, all of Paris's rescue, just like the wonderful summary of Part I in the opening of S2T. In fact, everyone wrote the words "Earlier on Superman ??" in S2RD. Special effects were not great either in part I or in S2T, but S2RD were mostly funny? such as Lois falling from the Daily Planet window. I admit that some new scenes have worked, and some of them have been welcomed, like every scene in the "honeymoon suite." In general, if you grew up on S2T like I did and I loved him as a child? without fooling around like me as an adult, you should definitely see S2RD, because it is a completely new childhood experience with dozens of new scenes. (Spoiler's Alert) Unfortunately, the worst change is the last: the strange kiss of amnesia with S2T has also disappeared with exactly the same ending as "I." It's not just a lazy, non-original copout, but it does not make sense why Clark will come back to this dinner if these events never happened. Will he continue to "withdraw time" for any confrontation?
