The dubious story of political intrigue and murder comes from Richard Condon's pen (The Mandchurian Candidate 1962). The story told in an almost comic book way is difficult to swallow. Considering the cast of all the stars, this weak effort is not solely the fault of the cast and crew: the novel was full of the same shortcomings. It seems that sometimes history mocks the more sincere effort in the "Manchurian Candidate". Disappointment in every respect.
