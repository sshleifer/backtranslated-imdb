* Spoilers and extreme brawls are waiting for you * <br /> <br /> When this concert started, I found it acceptable and pleasant. Pretty Oddparents is a kind of cartoon that children and adults like. He also had high ratings along with Spongebob. But it started to go down because of the crap that Butch Hartman and his band pushed into the show. <br /> <br /> First of all, the humor in the toilet is not so much fun. It's easy to get out of quick laughter from babble babble, but it's almost the only audience who would laugh at such a trivial joke. Then there are jokes for kids. Lol, we see people in underwear and we see people dressing up. LOLOLOL !!! I can not stop laughing at such a delight! Someone help me! But of course this show would not be so bad if it were not for stereotypes. Did you see how the band represented Australians? They regarded it as nothing more than a loving kangaroo, boomerang extensors who live in the hot desert. But now ... Is the swing of favors WHY this show really sucks the loudest of them ... NO USERS !!! The show constantly evokes the same jokes (most of them are obscene), thinking that it's the best thing in the world! Cosmo is mainly guilty. I hated it when they mentioned "Super Toilet" (which also has a mixture of humorous humor), and Cosmo went crazy. Who would forget this stupid joke that every damn Dimmsdale parent would use in this one e-mail? You know, the one in which every parent (unaware of what other parents say) would say exactly the same sentence before breaking into a child's room? Yes, for some people it may be first class humor, but for others it is pure ***. <br /> <br /> If I am not mistaken, I believe that Butch Hartman said something about the end of the series. Thank God! Everyone in my area says it's Nickelodeon's most fun performance in history. I can not agree with that? I think that this is another pile of horse dung, which we get every day on our cartoon stations, only worse.
