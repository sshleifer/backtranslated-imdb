Tarzan's last film with Johnny Weissmuller (in a surprisingly old age after "Tarzan and the Huntress") is bad, despite all the curiosities that can be added to make him look better. It is obvious that RKO tried to say goodbye to Weissmuller, shooting in the beautiful scenery in Mexico, with the star of this country (Andrea Palma) and the award-winning operator Gabriel Figueroa, and introducing the prestigious composer Dimitri Tiomkina the result. Although it may cost less for filming abroad, it looks more expensive than any other RKO movie in the series, using Acapulco beaches and real pyramids as Aquatania and impressive decors for all scenes associated with the temple of the god Bal (especially outdoors, built on steep rocks. ) Kurt Neumann should become the director, not Robert Florey, who gives him a very slow pace. Neumann did a great job with "Tarzan and the Amazons", "Tarzan and the Leopard Woman" and "Tarzan and the Huntress" and ended his career by directing the classic "The Fly" a year before his death; while Florey became a TV director, after the career of several great films. If Weissmuller looks tired, the Cheeta chimpanzee is not as good as the others, but the worst figure is Benji, a repulsive postman who sings scary songs (which have Caribbean air in a place that should be Africa and shot in Mexico!) Boring and definitely doubtful taste, it was a sad goodbye to Tarzan Weissmuller.
