Generally, I do not like movies directed by Sydney Pollack ("The Firm" is something special) and I have never been a fan of Robert Redford. Even so, I thought that "Three Days of the Condor" must be good because of the number of praised comments he received. <br /> <br /> Although widescreen cinematography is quite pleasing to the eye, Max von Sydow does a nice job. As a sinister professional killer, the whole thing was extremely disappointing. The film undeniably exudes a paranoid atmosphere, but everything is ruined by a chaotic plot that does not seem to make sense. <br /> <br /> The film also contains one of the most unsatisfactory endings I have ever seen, which really leave the viewer hanging in the air. And what can you say about this absurd affair between Redford and Dunaway? I would prefer to watch Hitchcock films five times in a row, than once again sit down at a piece of waste.
