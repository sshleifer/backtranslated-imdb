I can not believe anyone liked this movie. I have seen many low-budget indie movies, but this one is completely useless. A low budget does not mean that the movie has to be insane. Horror does not mean that the movie has to be insane. There was nothing terrible about this film. It was just gore-fest, and particularly disturbing. Acting was mediocre, given that everyone did not hear the actors, but the story was pathetic, the dialogue was pathetic. The film tries to leave as "artistic" or something like that. This is not one of those really great indie movies that only cost thousands of dollars, but they're amazingly well done. It was just an excuse for some very sick people to put their perverse obsessions on the film. Other reviews here also said that the soundtrack is good for nothing ... because most were written by the same person, and some of the songs were written by one of the film's authors. There were no advantages to this movie at all. A complete waste of time and money.
