I only watched the first 30 minutes of this, and what I saw was completely nonsense. The scenes I saw were just as bad as Ed Wood's. No, it was a hundred times WORSE. Ed Wood has the reputation of being the worst director, but that's not true; the idiot who directed the trash is WORST director in history. <br /> <br /> An American policeman has a German accent! The "police station" was a desk in a warehouse with the "police station" sign hanging on the wall. There is a fist fight, in which the blows clearly lack the TEN FOOT. <br /> <br /> This policeman pulls a woman, fastens it and leads to the warehouse. He tells his policeman to wait in the car. Then he leaves the warehouse with a sailor bag. The cop's partner thinks maybe something is wrong, that his partner may be a bad cop who murders these women, but he is not sure if this is happening because he is a moron! Dialogue is completely stupid, acting is terrible, and characters act in the stupidest way I've ever seen on screen. It is obvious to the cop's partner that he illegally kidnapped these women, and he pats them and takes them to the warehouse and returns to the car with a body bag with a body in it, and yet the partner who is there all the time does not know what's going on! <br /> <br /> The director of this movie is a total hack. I stopped the movie after 30 minutes because I could not take it anymore. It must be one of the WORST movies I've ever watched and I will not waste my time writing this review. <br /> <br /> Absolutely SAFE.
