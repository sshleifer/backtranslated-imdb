*** SPOILERS *** Let's start with the "good" of this movie - the smooth game of Cynthia Rothrock and Richard Norton. The rest of the game is horrible (this awful script does not help). The worst culprit is villain, Buntao, head of the Asian crime syndicate (played by Frans Tumbuana). I laughed at my head when he expressed his "fury" that he lost a lot of money; terrible performance. Patrick Muldoon is not much better, and his "hostile takeover" (the rest of the movie's title) has been delivered as badly as you can. There are no other main characters, but no other actor / actress has distinguished himself in this film. Then we come to the story. That should tell you everything you need to know: in the original "Rage and Honor" by Cynthia Rothrock, who plays Chris Fairchild, she was a teacher in the city center. Now is C.I.A. agent (was it some other government agency - sorry, but this movie was so bad that I do not even remember). Hmmm ... I can imagine what C.I.A. is. the application process was similar. Interviewer: What are your previous professional experience? Chris: I was a teacher. Interviewer: Good; you are employed! I only give him "2" because of decent action and a nice twist of the plot at the end (although we know that Tommy (Muldoon), a secret villain, will be caught).
