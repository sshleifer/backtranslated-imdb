Solid comedy entertainment, with musical interludes, generates a fast pace that carries with it a slow-moving process through a maze of humorous and cold complications. Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi and Peter Lorre form a strong team of sinister villains. The script contains all standard panels with props, secret passages, thunder and lightning, and poisoned darts. Karloff, Lugosi and Lorre enter the heavy and obvious melodrama of the gas age. Kay Kyser and his team offered great entertainment to people living in the 1940s who were trying to forget about the horror of World War II.
