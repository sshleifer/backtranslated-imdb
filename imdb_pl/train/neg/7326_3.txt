This movie has an interesting story, but the game is pretty bad, and the script is bad. I was very disappointed. The moral dilemma faced by the main character is intriguing, but due to the poor writing and manning of this potentially victorious premise, he is plundered. Two out of four people in the theater left after about 45 minutes, and the other two were laughing at how bad the movie was. I've put it to the end, but I have to admit that I played Blackjack on my mobile phone to withstand the last 30 minutes.
