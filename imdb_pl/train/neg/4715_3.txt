I recently watched Johnny Test, trying to find humor in him. I could not, terribly. Cartoon Network usually tends to make its performances more enjoyable for all viewers, but Johnny Test is "entertainment" in its lowest form. Writing is extremely predictable, and acting gags are not gags at all. Children will love it and that's all. <br /> <br /> It does not mean that everything is wrong. The original opening theme was basically quite catchy, but for some reason they took his skeleton and vividly crashed it with a figurative aluminum stick. It's a pity, because it was really one of the best things you've decided. <br /> <br /> Theoretically, some characters can be very interesting. With a bit of work, characters can work well together, but they are too one-dimensional. This in turn makes it easier for children to follow. <br /> <br /> The pace is also a bit too fast. The episodes are too busy, leaving little time for clever writing. It's a real shame because there are so many interesting concepts that the show brings. On the other hand, the fast pace will stop children from losing interest, and this is really the whole target group. <br /> <br /> In general, the performance looks very good on paper, but it just does not manage to be fun or interesting. It's a program I want to like, but I can not do it. There is so much potential that has not been realized. Children will like it, but that's it.
