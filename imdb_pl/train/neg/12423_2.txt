Cage (1989) was another of those low-budget "buddies" that were produced in the 80's, mainly thanks to films such as 48 hours. and Lethal Weapons. In this role Reb Brown and Lou Ferrigno as former vets from Vietnam, who run a local dive bar. Reb deals with Lou because he saved his life in Nam. But Lou has been shot in the head and is now quite soft. Although it is huge, Lou has the child's brain. One day, some thugs are waiting in the bar, and Lou and Rebb are winning from them. But the return is a mother. They break the bar, leaving Lou and Reba with nothing. That is, until these two bandits appear in the picture (one of them is a really nice guy) who have a plan. <br /> <br /> The movie is a waste of time. Perhaps if they went all the way and made a fluttering action, instead of trying to mitigate the horrible situation, maybe it would work. Unfortunately, no, and the audience is holding a bag. Well. It's a pity, because you've got all the elements for a great movie. And better next time, I think. <br /> <br /> Not recommended. <br /> <br /> xxx
