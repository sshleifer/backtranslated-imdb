When this film was released in 1997, "Special Effects" as they were were weak. They would have been dated even in the 1980s, and even some of the films from the 70s and 60s had the same or better job of SFX. Surely nobody involved in the production of this film was looking for an Oscar. This is a crazy departure from the usual things of director Fred Olen Ray, most of which have the word "Bikini" in the title (Bikini Pirates, Bikini Chain Gang, Bikini Girls with Lost Planet, etc.) And there is little more than a T & A cinema, but here we have a movie "U" and aimed straight at the kids. You must give him recognition for variety !! It was a small cult hit directly on the video, which later resulted in several sequels - Invisible Mom 2 and Invisible Dad. Dee Wallace-Stone (whose career went down after 1982, "ET" plays "invisible mom" from the film and would return to continue.) Russ Tamblyn (whose career has dropped even more since 1961 "West Side" Story ") plays the villain You can probably say that most of the actors were at the stage of their career, where they would be willing to work almost anything to pay bills this month - maybe with the exception of the young Trenton Knight as Josh It's quite eloquent, although he worked before that movie , this child actor did not act again after the sequel "Invisible Mom 2." Maybe the movie was cursed, this movie. For a child actor, it's pretty good - no better or worse than any of his more experienced co-stars. <br /> <br / > As mentioned above, the effects of "invisibility" are at least naive, the direction is weak, the writing is obvious and nothing works, what can to write at home, although movies are available there, and for anyone who is less than ten years old, this movie will no doubt be quite visible. Most adults will probably want to make their own disappearing act while it's on, and I will not blame them any more!
