How can anyone say that this movie is a comedy? If I did not go with my finacee, I would have fallen asleep and asked for a refund. I love Gwen Paltrow, but it was like she was on the wrong plan. I like most chick movies, but I hated it. It's the only time I've seen so many smarties and I have not been turned on. These costumes were exaggerated. Nobody says that anymore and I do not think they even do it then. The dance part was terrible. My ex told me later ... - Did not you like this part? Did not you think it was sensational? I said "yes" only to spare her feelings. Now I know why we never got married. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
