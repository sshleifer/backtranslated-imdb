I recently saw this movie and I had higher hopes. Not so much on the basis of a director who had not taken a cinematic picture before, but more based on his cast. Harvey Keitel, Scott Glenn and Craig Wasson (main role in Body double, the masterpiece of Brian De Palma) played in great films. Not together, and this fact has not changed exactly because of this. <br /> <br /> The movie is unbelievable, very predictable and trivial. The only thing that can make it somewhat attractive is the choice of the places where it was filmed. In my humble opinion: do not waste time on this one.
