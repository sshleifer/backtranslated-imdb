I wondered why John Wood did not play Dr. Falken until I watched the movie. BAD plot, bad science, bad acting and bad movie in general. Do not watch this movie. Rent original "war games" if you feel nostalgia. <br /> <br /> I did not like bending the story to the idea of ​​a terrorist threat. In the first film W.O.P.R was built, because Russia had 1000 heads pointing to U.S.A. Apart from politics, one of the good sides of the first movie was to emphasize that even a stupid computer can finally capture the idea of ​​the senselessness of war. There is no such insight in this film.
