OK, I'm blessed. I've seen two very strong stage productions, one in New York with an original cast and the other in San Diego Rep (Rosina Reynolds and Monique Gaffney, rock!) In comparison to one of them, the movie is almost unseeable. I went through the DVD for the last two nights Too many foreign dialogues and too many added scenes and people Yes, the four main performances are quite good, especially Mrs. Streep's ... But comparing the scene with the movie is definitely an example of "less is more." Thickening the performance to satisfy the need for movie viewers in terms of diversity and specificity was a bad choice, please, please, find a production somewhere nearby.
