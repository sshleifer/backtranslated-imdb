My roommate rented the movie that night, so we watched it together. <br /> <br /> The first impression is really positive, because the whole movie is filmed in this colorful, grainy, post-MTV texture. Quick sequences, nice angles, extensive camera movements - at the moment you feel that you are going to watch another "Snatch", for now ... feel like one excess of amphetamine. things do not make sense anymore. I would not like to spoil the fun by watching it, handing out some scenes, but then the movie is so bad that it's better not to watch it. <br /> <br /> First you think it's a crime story told in a conversation between Keiry Knightley and Lucy Liu. WRONG. This conversation does not provide any coherent narrative. On the contrary, Lesbian Domino plays Lucy Liu during the second part of the movie, simply introducing the audience into further confusion. <br /> <br /> Then I thought maybe it was a movie about a girl from a prosperous but dysfunctional background that became a hard bounty hunter. In any case, this is the message conveyed by the opening scenes. But then the matter of Domino's character is completely lost in a criminal plot. In short, NO is not a Domino movie. <br /> <br /> Then I thought it was probably the story of one robbery. Pretty bloody theft. 10 million are missing, bounty hunters chase after suspected thieves, mafia children are lost, hands are removed, Domino tries to break why this time they do not receive awards certificates etc. But soon this impression is dispelled by the next plot turn. <br /> <br /> This time we are dealing with a sad story of an obese Afro-American woman who fakes driving licenses at a local MVD and at the age of 28 is the youngest grandmother. The Stars of Lateesha show Jerry Springer, try to publicize some new, crazy racial theory, and at the same time try to find money for their sick granddaughter. <br /> <br /> What does this have to do with the main story? URgh, well, nobody knows. Only that the director had to explain to the audience where the bounty hunters would place a collector's fee of 300,000. <br /> <br /> Then at some point you start thinking: "Oh, it's about our society and the way the media distorts things ". There is a reality TV crew riding with bounty hunters and taking brutal pictures. Bounty hunters are also stuck with a group of Hollywood actors who just groan all the time about breaking their noses and dragging too many crime scenes. But NO, this is not a movie about the media, they appear sporadically throughout the film. <br /> <br /> There are many other subdivisions: a crazy Afghan guy who wants to free Afghanistan, a love story between Domino and Chocco, an episode of mescaline, an FBI surveillance operation ... <br /> <br /> Is it all items listed above can be packed in 2 hours of film? Judge for yourself, but my conclusion is clear - it's a real mess!
