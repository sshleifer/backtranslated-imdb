I saw the original "Chorus Line" on Broadway. God knows how many times I felt passion, despair and joy from this living experience in the theater. Michael Bennett knew he would have to imagine "Chorus" on the screen, but he would never understand how to do it. If the man who came up with the performance is embarrassed - that should answer your question. There are several programs that are simply watched live - with the audience. However, Richard Attenborough, freshly after the musical work "Ghandi" and dancing with animals in "Doctor Doolittle" finished directing this film, which did not have much to do with the performance on stage. Spooky songs (Surprise! Surprise!) Have been added, great songs have been dropped or given to other characters (which did not make sense). Michael Douglas was poorly manned. People who could not dance tried to act, and there was a sexy "Landers" woman who could not sing, play or dance - I think she just ended up being Gandhi's wife. Jeffrey Hornaday's dances look like nothing but discards from "Flashdance" and nothing works. I sat there stunned by how something so thrilling and emotional could be ruined. If you really love this concert and it's back in Broadway in 2006 - see, but do not think that the long-running music event "A Chorus Line" has something to do with this movie.
