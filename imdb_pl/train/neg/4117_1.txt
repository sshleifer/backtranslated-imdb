Two days after I saw it, I still suffer because I saw it. It's so bad that you have to wonder how anyone could write these tripe, let alone let it be loose to the public. Stilted actress, a leading man who looks like a sleepwalker, and Alison Eastwood shits herself. The action indicates low-budget film making, which means it is painfully bad. Story? If you were 6 years old, you could write this movie. Simple, idealistic and just lame.
