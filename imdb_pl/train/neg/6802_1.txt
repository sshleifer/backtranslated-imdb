Words can not describe how bad the movie is. I can not explain it just by writing. You also see it yourself, to understand how terrible a film can be. Not that I would recommend it to you. There are so many cliches, mistakes (and all other negative things you can imagine) that only make you cry. To start from the first, there are a lot of mistakes regarding the plane. I will not mention them here, just mention the coloring of the plane. They did not even manage to show the plane in the colors of the fictional airline, but instead used the 747 model painted in the original Boeing color. Very bad. The plot is stupid and it was done many times before, only much, much better. There are so many funny moments here that I lost it very early. Besides, I was on the bad guys side all the time because good guys were so stupid. The "execution decision" should undoubtedly be a choice over it, even the "Turbulence" films are better. In fact, every other movie in the world is better than this one.
