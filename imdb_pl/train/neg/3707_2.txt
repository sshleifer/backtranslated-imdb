This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen (yes, it's even worse than Dungeons and Dragons and any movie with Kevin Costner). they did not even seem to be trying to act. Chris Rock is a great comedian, but he just can not transfer his talent to this movie, which probably has only two tense laughs throughout the picture. <br /> <br /> If you have not watched the movie yet, avoid it like a plague. Go do something constructive and interesting, eg. Watch the weather channel or watch the paint on a brick wall. <br /> <br /> For Chris's efforts I give him 2/10! <br /> <br />
