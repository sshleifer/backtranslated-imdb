"Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow" was one of many films from the 1950s about teenagers with hot rods who meet with supernaturals. In this case, teenagers can not pay rent for a hangout and be evicted. With no place to go, they decide to visit a haunted house. As you probably guess, strange things start happening on arrival. And finally there is a surprise. <br /> <br /> There is nothing in this movie that you have not seen in other movies, but it's still nice entertainment. My favorite character was a parrot with a dirty mouth. Well, let me rewrite it: he did not speak like a character in Quentin Tarantino's movie, but he said things that we do not expect from a bird. A clean movie hokum, but harmless.
