I could not wait to get a DVD after hearing about the movie. What a disappointment! This has become one of the most confusing movies I've ever watched. So many characters have been introduced, some reminiscent of the fact that it was impossible to track the plot. I could not understand how George Clooney received the acting award for the film because he was not involved, at least in the first half of the movie. My wife and I gave up after about an hour of unhappiness and we stopped the DVD. Perhaps I was wondering about the quick transfer to see if the ending is better, but after so much confusion I decided that the chances of improvement are small. A colleague told me that many movies "meet" at the last minute or less. I was glad that I did not waste another hour waiting. I gave the DVD the next day.
