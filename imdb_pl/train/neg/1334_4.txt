Last night I finally saw the movie "My Left Foot" after years of telling my mother how amazing it is ... The central performance of Day-Lewis is really amazing and amazing, but everyone with minimal exposure to their second job should not expect anything less. <br /> <br /> A fatal mistake in my eyes was that he was obsessed with proving this man's normality; the movie decided to show it as a complete and complete jerk. On the one hand, I see that it is a logical correlation; humanity always has the ability to raise objections, and disability should not overshadow it. I just wish that impartial observers would not be so understanding of abnormal behavior and assumed that circumstances would automatically forgive him. They do not. Operation is normal and yes, disabled people work - but they do not do it because they are disabled; they do it because they are unreasonable. Physical disability does not give you the right to cast hissy on the audience, just because someone you love rejects you. <br /> <br /> There are some things that are not sensible if you are disabled or able-for-profit. One of them is to give someone tacit consent to put the football directly in the head only to match. (Although I once saved my face with a punishment from the school striker's star, but I already belonged at that time. It was not acceptable.) Taking a bar fight is another. Enjoying the fact that your father expands your company only after you have proved that you are able to metaphorically jump over physical hoops, masochism becomes a step too far. All these things are stupid, and suffering through them as a way to demonstrate your courage does not make them less reckless. <br /> <br /> So yes; just because you overcame the obstacles to achieve great things, you do not make him less of a jerk ... Being a good man takes precedence; setting an inspiring example for people with disabilities should appear down the list.
