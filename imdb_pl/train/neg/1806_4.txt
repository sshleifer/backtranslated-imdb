Antonioni's movies do not look good. What always surprised me is the fact that apart from the unquestionable visual beauty there is a boring and didactic "psychology" of the character and the situation. For example, let us remember Mastroianni's conversations with the "wicked capitalist" who wants to sing him in "La notte", or Monika Vitti laughing at peasants flirting on a train in "La aventura" or Ferzetti dropping a glass of ink at the end of the same film. <br /> <br /> I checked "Zabriskie Point" yesterday. In this movie there are many nice and sophisticated shots of Rod Taylor's office, LA streets and highways, advertising advertisements, deserts etc. That show the author's fascination on his American journey, in the same way that Wim Wenders years later. Unfortunately, there are too many hippie-leftist stereotypes that spoil the film: - The boy leaves the meeting, steals the plane and flies over the desert to free himself and find "something else". - The management of gray apartments is talking all the time about speculation. - The girl looks at the "woman-objects" at the pool and leaves because she does not want to be like them. - A couple of the middle-class middle class in caravan speaks about the beauty of nature, that he is building a hotel and earning a lot of money. - Last but not least, many couples loving in the desert. What a hippie attitude! <br /> <br /> I apologize, today, half a century after the "La Aventura" revolution, we see that the king is naked, and his films (with the exception of "Le amiche" and perhaps "Il grido") are just a handful of aesthetics and customs.
