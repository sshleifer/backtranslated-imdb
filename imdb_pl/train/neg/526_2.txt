Almost as tedious as watching, like reading, Evening is a wonderfully produced failure ... until Meryl Streep comes in and silently shows his cast members how to behave in such matters. Vanessa Redgrave is shockingly dressed in her role because dying Ann and Claire Danes are a cipher. Perhaps if Vanessa and Claire changed roles, we could see the exuberance of young Ann, who gave her an introduction to the sparse world of history, and we could imagine that Elder Ann actually dies. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that joining Michael Cunningham for the subtitles would smooth out the lively story, but unfortunately. It gave me a headache.
