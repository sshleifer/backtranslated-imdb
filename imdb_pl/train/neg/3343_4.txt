An interesting story about a soldier in a war who does not want to save a young girl's life from an enemy and is haunted by this event, despite the fact that he saved many other captives. The film shines head, and this soldier is now a teacher in high school, which is mainly managed by police patrolling corridors, bathrooms and even classes. In other words, high school is a prison and the majority of children devote little attention to their teachers or director. Dolph Lundgren (Sam Decker) plays a soldier / school teacher and decides to quit school and go to another field. However, the director asks him to act as the last duty class of detention. It is at this point in the movie that all hell is falling apart, and history becomes a complete BOMB. Try to enjoy it if you decide to watch IT!
