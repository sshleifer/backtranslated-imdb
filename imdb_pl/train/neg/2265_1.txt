I love watching Jerry the same as the rest of the world, but this weak excuse for a soft core core is unnecessarily offensive, he lacks something like a joke and serves only as a carrier of self-promotion for Springer. Although it lasts 90 minutes, the movie stretches hideously and I should have common sense to go out. Just awful.
