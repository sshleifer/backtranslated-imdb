Eric Rohmer's "The Lady and the Duke" is based on the journals of an English aristocrat who survived the French Revolution. But it is a stiff romance, with strange, painted backgrounds and mannerist conversational tone. Above all, this portrait of the age of terror takes place almost entirely in one of the real actions; there are very few ordinary people in this film, and not much of the chaos, poverty and terror that emerged from the salons of persecuted but spoiled aristocratic classes. The result is often boring, and ultimately non-enlightening forces that sometimes drive societies to the brink of destruction; it's a disappointing movie by a recognized director.
