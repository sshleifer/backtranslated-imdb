It was scary. It was not cool to watch at all. Even the scene in which the girl uses the vibrator, even in this movie is not fun. I repeat, the scene where the girl masturbates with a vibrator is not even pleasant to watch. Or maybe it was the only part of the movie you watched, just a girl on the couch with a vibrator. Maybe they should just release this one scene in cinemas, maybe then the film would be nice at a certain level. My advice, scroll to this point, watch it, rewind the video, watch again, rewind, repeat. Maybe in this way you can enjoy for 2 hours. This movie is next to me. I spit on your grave and the Doom generation in the worst movies category I've ever seen.
