I bought this movie on DVD, so I could get an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Luckily Mike, Crow and Tom Servo are watching because the movie itself is not. Although there is a conspiracy, a story that you can follow, and a few actors who can act, there is nothing else. The movie was so boring that I firmly confirmed that I will never see it again without Tom, Crowa and Mike. However, as summarized above, it was better than the film from the previous episode of MST3K; Mitchell.
