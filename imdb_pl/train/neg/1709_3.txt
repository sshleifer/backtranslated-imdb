I got a copy of this movie, thinking it was a 1964 movie from Zombie Bloodbath as one of its alternative titles. Perversely, this movie has a better rating on this page than the title mentioned above; which can mean that the other one is really angry! This movie is also very bad; of course you can not enter the movie, which is called "Zombie Bloodbath" and you expect to see a masterpiece, and honestly meets the requirements of the title with a lot of gore at the exhibition ... but all this is very old and tired, why not a terrible playing and stupid plot line. It's just your average nuclear leak, which causes people to turn into zombies, etc. The movie begins with a sequence in which people melt and you almost know what you're getting into; zombie trash of low quality. There are a lot of gore in the movie and this is really good work, otherwise the movie would be really boring. Zombie Bloodbath also looks really cheap and was created by inexperienced filmmakers! The main influence seemed to be Romero's Day of the Dead, although it can really be anything that contains zombies and gore. It all boils down to a typically predictable and pointless ending, and I can not say that I was impressed!
