the movie was as gay as his mother and son who have sex and are also afraid of little kittens. they set fire to them. cat is a strange thing killing a guy, stabbing him in the back with a corn duck? they are bulletproof. invisible. and what does not. The movie star, Clovis, is a cops cat, Clovis leads the cops to find a foreign mum, and after my mother kills the cops, Clovis kills her mother, eating her head, and then catches the fire. this movie sucks. it was much more fun than frightening, it was not that bad at all. the girl hits the head with a strange camera that throws him away. then he walks and hugs her. then he grabs her and starts raping. once again Clovis comes to the rescue
