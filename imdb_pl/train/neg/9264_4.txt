This lower continuation based on heroes created by David Selzer and Harvey Bernhard (also producer) concerns the marriage of Gene (Michael Woods) and Karen York (Faye Grant). They take a little girl named Delia from the monastery. Gene York on re-election to the Congressman and chairing the funding committee. Meanwhile, Delia seems to be around when there are inexplicable deaths. It creates wreaks of havoc when it comes to metaphysical fairs, because the numerology, therapy, medical counseling, yoga and tarot stores are destroyed. Karen York employs a private detective (Michael Lerner) to investigate strange and bizarre events. <br /> <br /> This TV sequel shows emotions, chills, horrific events and bloody killing. Delia, like Damien, seems to be sending new ghostly murders every few minutes of the movie, making horrible killings. The main excitement is watching how a new and innocent victim can be triggered by the average special effect. What's more, mediocre protagonists, Faye Grant and Michael Woods, however well-mannered secondary men like Michael Lerner, Madison Mason, Duncan Fraser and recently deceased Don S Davis, were army captain turned into acting. As always, an excellent musical score taken from Omen I and III by the great Jerry Goldsmith. The film is intended only for hardcore fans of the Omen saga. The film is poorly directed by Jorge Montesi and Dominique Othenin Girard. Previous and much better versions are as follows: Extremely excellent original "Omen" (Gregory Peck, Lee Remick) by Richard Donner; "Damien" (William Holden, Lee Grant) Don Taylor; "Ultimate Conflict" (Sam Neil and Tisa Harrow) by Grahame Baker. Rating: below average.
