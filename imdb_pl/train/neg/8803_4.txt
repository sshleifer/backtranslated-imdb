I loved "Anchorman; The Legend of Ron Burgundy "and I hoped it would be equally fun, but unfortunately it was not. Some pieces, however, are excellent. I thought that the sportsman, Champ Kind, confessing his love to Ron Burgundy in a car filled with other members of the team, was hilarious. Everyone ignores him and he gets louder and louder and finally he kisses Burgundy, which is also not recognized. But in general, history will not be washed away. However, this is a noble attempt to save the unused fragments from the first film, including the entire conspiracy about the quite steadfast, would-be domestic terrorists called "Alarm Clock". Maya Rudolph from Saturday Night Live is one of the members and has some fun lines, but basically this unused storyline has reasons not to be used in the first movie. The additions on this disk are quite good, and the top two are filmed rehearsals with lots of improvised comedies, and a fake commentary with Will Ferrell and the "producer exec" Ferrell discovers at the beginning was not even part of the movie any way, shape or form. It turns out that he is a "guy" who went to the side door of the recording studio and pretended to be a producer. It's a bit of fun stuff and it takes about 10 or 15 minutes
