Well, maybe the worst movie that has ever been the worst movie I've ever seen. They tried these 666 children of Satan in anti-Christ films about 1000 times, and none of them is good, and maybe the worst of them. They think it will be a better movie because they will use this false blood more. This film has no idea, the actors and filming are just awful. I can not even notice that there are 10 lines of this film. Really nothing to tell, but it's just awful. How can they make movies in a way that they can not understand. It can not be a Hollywood movie, right? Just do not watch it, use your money wisely.
