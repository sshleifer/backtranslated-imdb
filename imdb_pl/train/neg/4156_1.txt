Yes, this movie is bad. What's worse, there is no advantage over your own title !! Throughout the movie, zombies and vampires fight ONCE TOGETHER OR TWO. Besides, we're never sure if the main character of the movie is THE DEFINITELY vampire. One can argue that they were trying to "tone" or "realistically", but it ends simply boring. Over half of this movie takes place in the CAR. Scenes that take place anywhere else also have nothing to brag about. There is also no obvious antagonist, and finally you have no idea what really happened in the last 30 minutes of the movie. <br /> <br /> I will say, however, that in the case of a movie with such a low production value, the soundtrack was surprisingly appropriate and instrumental (with the original score or a sample of music from other sources). <br /> <br /> I am for independent films, but it looks like it has never been intended for a mass audience (if at all). <br /> <br /> "worse than a scarecrow scumbag".
