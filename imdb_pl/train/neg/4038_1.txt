To hear how horrible The Shield is, you would have to write pages and pages, so all you have to do is say that it is a monument to bad direction. <br /> <br /> "When the directors wake up" should be the title of this production. Indeed, directors should inspire their work with a sense of visual style and telling stories that drives the plot. <br /> <br /> How do you constantly shake the camera and play with the zoom lens "style"? How does it drive the story? Of course, there is also the nonsense "editing by random numbers". Apparently it has become fashionable just randomly. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that it's too much work to edit well. <br /> <br /> Well, that made most people watch The Shield, which is wasted as one of the most exaggerated and unnoticed shows of all time.
