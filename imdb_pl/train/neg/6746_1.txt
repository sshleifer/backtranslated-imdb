* ZAWIERAJÄ„CE SPOILERY * <br /> <br /> With a title such as "Bleed", you know that creative juices did not work at a high level when this puppy was conceived. The movie is your primary, low budget slass movie. Oh, yes, he's trying to be creative in the assumption of a "murder club", but we find out that it was just a joke anyway. Okay, for those who really care about these things, the basic intrigue is that a new girl in the city begins to meet with a coworker. She invites her to her circle of friends, and at the party they tell her how they have a "murder club" and murder people, blah blah. Well, we find out that it was just a joke, but before our heroine kills a woman in the garage. Now "members" of the Killing Club are killed one by one. Oh, and the bad guys win, and the movie ends up below. During this time, you will not worry about it. <br /> <br /> Looking back, the first 10 minutes of this movie do not make sense. The motivation for homicides at the beginning of the film is never explained. I would say that it was a way for the director to shoot a movie, but the scenes are removed on DVD! I'm not sure why anyone would like to see more than the full-length version of "Bleed", but apparently the people behind the DVD thought that viewers would demand more. The box says it's Easter Eggs, but why the hell would I waste my time looking for extras in this movie, it's outside of me. <br /> <br /> I was expecting a bad movie, and "Bleed" was released on this front. However, it was not a funny, bad movie. Everyone looks good in the movie and there's a lot of nudity, but acting is just awful. My least favorite character is a guy who is a killer ... I think he should be fun and funny, but it ends as a tool. I think the funniest moment of the movie is that our heroine kills a woman in the parking lot in a comically unconvincing manner. Heroin pushes women into a cement post in the garage, and the woman looks like she barely hits the object, and she spits out a sip of blood and "dies". <br /> <br /> For those who think that making movies is a complicated, creative process performed by professionals, check "Bleed". This will change your mind, and you will realize that any hack can make a movie. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, do not waste time or money on it.
