Despite some of the original touches, such as the "virtual sets" that are the backdrop for Victorian interiors with Ada Lovelace and her wheel, this movie is short and eventually disappoints. Novice Francesco Faridana seems to be talented, but she is wasted as Emma, ​​a character who is reduced to nothing in the middle of the movie except staring at the monitor watching Lady Ada telling her autobiography. "Conceiving Ada" will start shortly when Lady Ada (Tilda Swinton) arrives; the camera maintains facial expressions, manners, and even makes it appear transparent or temporarily invisible, dividing into scenes to dramatize her "virtual" Emma shot. it was worth it, but this movie unfortunately creates a mix of both Lady Adi's life and modern computer science (and her broadly drawn, doltisha boy).
