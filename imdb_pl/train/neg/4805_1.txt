I loved Adrianne Curry before this show. I thought she was great at the Top Model and she was really happy when she won. I also liked Chris Knight, he looks like a great guy. But this series is just sick of me! I am so angry at them for what happened at this concert. I do not care that they were of different ages, I know that age can not stand between love. But Adrianne, you were only ONE MONTH, ONE MONTH. It did not surprise me that he did not offer. And I do not see the appeal to force someone to marry you before they are ready. If this is the case, why not just enjoy the company of others and love each other and let it happen naturally? Turning the wedding ring into a ball and chain was completely unnecessary, it is stupidly obvious that Chris loves you, with or without a ring. And Chris, it's a shame for you that you broke down and offered her! Have you survived two failed marriages, how could you rush with your next marriage just because she quit matching? I hope that the relationship lasts, but I really feel that the marriage was hurried and for all the wrong reasons. Maybe now they can take a breath and find the right reasons to get married in a marriage.
