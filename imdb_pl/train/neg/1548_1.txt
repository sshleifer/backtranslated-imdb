Lorne Michaels proves once again that there is absolutely no interest in producing films. <br /> <br /> You would think that after such grim films like "Superstar", "Night at the Roxbury" and "Coneheads", start to understand that maybe you do not know what it does when it comes to movies (and many say that he does not know what he does when it comes to television). Trying to make feature films from skits that wore their greeting for the third time at SNL does not make sense. <br /> <br /> Personally, I like Tim Meadows and I think he would be great in the right movie. It is a pity that a talented guy is wasted in a film whose traits do not cause anxiety, and all this scares terribly bad song and dance scene. Any laughter will be because the movie is so bad, not because it's funny. <br /> <br /> Well, at least we can be grateful that there are many other tired SNL characters who will never have films made about them. It is a pity that he has reached the big screen.
