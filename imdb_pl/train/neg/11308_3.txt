<br /> <br /> Pull out your eyebrows and enjoy this misleading action. A considerable skill Speempman kempo (cool spin kicks, decent with sticks - a bad couch!) This is the only salutary quality of the movie that just screams badly. The plot is not half bad; just quite bad. But if you see this movie for something other than martial arts, you miss the boat altogether. And the film, which is to take place in Koreatown, there are too few Korean actors (even extras).
