At the end of the movie, I felt that it was too technical. I felt like I was in class, watching how our navy saves the sea. I liked the fact that the engines have fire extinguishers. I think I should have understood it before, but I never thought about it. Using 747 to transport precious old images with very little security is strange and unrealistic. Acting was pretty good because they're mostly experienced professionals, but if you're going to stretch so far away from what's most likely happened, it should be more fanciful, comical, etc. Everything was taken too seriously. At least the movie had Felix Ungar as a pilot, Buck Rogers, a night-time persecutor, and Dracula also on board. The film was full of well-known faces. I understand that Hollywood has to exaggerate a bit for the drama, but it damages the quality of the film when a serious subject becomes a caricature. That's why I said it should be more comical. My pet pees with films about air travel, that everyone just moves around freely. They go with drinks, put them down and pick them up 5 minutes later, like in a building or something, and behave as if turbulence simply did not exist. I also know that this is a disastrous movie, but the tension does not have to include a 30-second breakdown after hitting something. In any case, qualified actors and actresses keep this weak scenario in a film that was captured after the first show. I like Lee Grant, but it was great to watch a psychotic person dressed up ... :)
