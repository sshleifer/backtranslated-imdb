WOW! Pretty scary stuff. Richard Burton / Elizabeth Taylor's roadshow landed in Sardinia and teamed up with artistic director Joseph Losey for this unusually ill-conceived fiasco of Tennessee Williams. Taylor plays a rich, dying widow, holding a fort on his servants on the island, where he loudly dictates his memories to an extremely patient secretary. When Burton the bully appears, claiming to be a poet and an old friend, Taylor realizes that her time is over. Ludicrious in extreme conditions - it's hard to tell if Taylor and Burton are behaving badly, or whether Williams's intention was to make their characters so unattractive. If so, then acting is brilliant! Burton mutters a few words under his breath, including the word BOOM, and Taylor squeals. It is really terrible. Same as Noel Coward as Taylor's catty confidante, "Witch of Capri". <br /> <br /> Presumably, BOOM talks about how short the time is and how fast life moves - two standard Williams motifs, but Losey mispronounced them so badly that Taylor and Burton did not write it to the audience during their monologues mainly inane, any substance that has a film would be completely diluted. <br /> <br /> BOOM has a stunning photo --- the camera must have been out of focus to ruin the beauty of Sardinia! Supporting cast includes Joanna Shimkus, the wonderful Romolo Valli as a resourceful Taylor and Michael Dunn physician as her nasty dwarven guard ... both he and his dogs are making a Burton number!
