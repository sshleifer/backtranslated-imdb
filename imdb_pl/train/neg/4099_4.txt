Mulva is vaccinated by a teenage monkey. When it wakes up, it's much warmer (parties played by Debbie Rochon in this sequel) and revenge on those who made her mistake. As suggested by the subtitle and box art, it is actually a start in Kill Bill movies, but as a Chris Seaver movie, it is a terribly incompetent satire (and I use this last term extremely loosely). say it's better than the first movie, but to be honest, I was so incredibly drunk when I saw the previous movie that I can not even hope to compare the two at the moment. But I must have liked it since I bought a sequel (see, when I'm drunk I like, for lack of a better word, complete and totally bad movies) There are some laughter of loud moments (very little), but I remember Bonejack is more fun. Well, at least a little over an hour, he's too powerful for what he's worth. <br /> <br /> My class: D + <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: audio commentary by director Chris Seaver, actress Debbie Rochon and gang Lbp; Seaver's second comment; 31 minutes Creating a feature film; 6-minute tribute to Lloyd Kaufman for low-budget photos; A fake 2-minute syrup advertisement; gallery; Promotional trailer; and trailers for: Mulva "," Quest for the Egg Salad "," Fiilthy McNasty "1, 2 and 3," The Feral Man "," the Bonesetter "," Midnight Skater "," Demon Summer "and" Splatter Rampage Wrestling " "
