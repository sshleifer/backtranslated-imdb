Covering virtual reality, the potential of computers, communication with the past, ongoing struggle to express your identity in a limiting society, as well as the fascinating Ada Byron Lovelace presented by the fascinating Tilda Swinton, this movie should have been great. But it's bad, horrible if you consider the potential! Acting - apart from Tilda Swinton and Karen Black - he changes from tolerated to terrible. The plot's construction is at least awkward - a modern programmer is a boring one-act character, but half of the movie spends on setting up his character, and when Ada finally appears, she tells stories about her life, does not present an engaging story (though Swinton almost excludes it). You never fully recognize her as a real person, only an icon from the graduate's history newspaper. <br /> <br /> Digital effects such as digital dog and bird are poor and distracting, considering that it was 1997, not 1985. And finally the script is just bad. A bad, often pretentious dialogue - especially the struggle between the programmer and her boyfriend that forced me to twist - cold and distant figures and a zero attempt to create a sense of wonder. The programmer successfully contacts a person in the past! Amazing! But no one is surprised, and her boyfriend says: "Well, be careful." (Although we have no idea why it can be dangerous, and it never seems to be dangerous.) <br /> <br /> Besides that it's about computers and Ada Lovelace and her love of mathematics, it's clear that noone involved in the script had any knowledge of maths or computers - all references to these topics are treated as a complete mumbo jumbo that opposes suspension of disbelief. <br /> <br /> One scene, in the end the movie is quite good, Tilda Swinton's monologue expresses her sadness because of the fragility of life, but her joy in this life. Captivating, passionate and insightful, it seems that he has been moved from another movie. <br /> <br /> So I'm disappointed with this movie because it's a lost opportunity for a fascinating little cult movie. If you think the topic is interesting, you can rent it, but pre-issue it. See Orlando for another, much better analysis of gender roles in history thanks to the great performance of Tilda Swinton. <br /> <br /> *** spoiler / question: * * <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, Ada asks her to keep her memories (in what I thought was the best scene in the movie) . However, a modern programmer seems to be doing this by moving memories to his little girl (hence the title of the movie). Am I right that the programmer has violated Ada's wishes without even fighting for it? Is this another misleading storyline that I misinterpret?
