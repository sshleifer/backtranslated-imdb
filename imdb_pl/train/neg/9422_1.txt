This video describes the experiences of two hit (including Burt Reynolds), prostitutes and two queens in a few hours of one night in Miami. Convergent threads ultimately connect all people in one place and time. The film was a bit funny, but the big problem was that everything happened at night, and many scenes were literally underexposed to such an extent that you could not see what was going on. In several scenes, you can see where they have tried to "stretch" the creation process to save images. Someone did not know how to operate the camera. It's amazing that this movie has even been released!
