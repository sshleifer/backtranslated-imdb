This film is a traditional Bollywood charge when it comes to the power of the stars, sentimentality and the love triangle of emotions. What really bothered me in this film is the absurd idea of ​​the creators of the foster mother. The whore who conceived a child with someone after sex with a man (a family wanting a child) is not a substitute mother. He is not a good candidate for a substitute mother. I have seen Indian films and TV shows from 10 to 15 years ago, which dealt with this issue in a more intelligent way. The whole concept of the film is ridiculous and absolutely unbelievable. I realize that most Bollywood films are not supposed to be credible, but they do not pretend to be. This movie wants us to be released along with the characters, but this can not be done with such a ridiculous, imaginary conflict. I'd expect better from Abbas and Mustan.
