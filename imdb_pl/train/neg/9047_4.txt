This film has always impressed me. I watched him as Freshman in high school and I was alone at home that night. I think I lost all respect for Robert Reed as an actor who was a big fan of "Brady Bunch". I also thought that Chuck Connor's role was terrible and evil. However, this movie has had such a big impact on me that I am now a volunteer in women's state prison for biblical studies and church services and trying to change women's lives, individually. I'm fascinated by the fact that so few people watched this movie. None of my friends have seen this, and my family has no idea about this day when I'm discussing this movie because they have not seen it.
