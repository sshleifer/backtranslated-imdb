I wanted to see the movie because of the article in the film magazine. The critic did not recommend him too high. The plot is different and I'm sure it would be a good movie if it was in good hands. Directing and acting were terrible !! I had the impression that I was watching a movie that became a group of amateurs. Although the film began to promise, it became worse and worse. I think it is a non-original movie with clumsy characters. I still think it's worth watching because I have not seen movies that are subject to homosexual porn. Do not maintain high expectations, then you will be very disappointed. * except *****
