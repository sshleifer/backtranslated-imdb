This movie is a good example of how to destroy a book in 109 minutes. Apart from the names of the characters, the film is very similar to a book. A book full of strong Latin characters and represented mostly by non-Hispanics. There is no character development in the film and we have no reason to love or hate heroes. And removing the entire generation is inexcusable. Isabel Allende wrote a powerful book, and the book is what you should read!
