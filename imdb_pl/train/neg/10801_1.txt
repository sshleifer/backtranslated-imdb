Now I watch movies that have poor reviews and say, "Hmm ... it's not so bad!" I loved The Cable Guy and thought that My Big Fat Independent Movie was great. Remember, I did not really start to look at it with high hopes, but I came to the conclusion that maybe ... maybe just ... it would be bad in a way that I could laugh at it. I was wrong. At no time during my suffering through this "film" (and I use this term sparingly) I was even close to entertainment. For starters, Shaq makes Quentin Tarantino look like Marlon Brando when it comes to acting. I hate rap music, but as far as I know, an Amish priest would probably be a better rapper than he. The main character is just annoying, not a character that is easy to like. Honestly, I'd rather eat a fat shake from the bloody wounds of the Harlequin fetus than see it again.
