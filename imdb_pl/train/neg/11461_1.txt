Please do not waste +/- 2 hours of your life watching this movie - it's just not. Especially if someone is lucky to be at your side. Shit, if you ask me. I waited for something to happen - I never did. I'm not one of those people who stopped watching the movie on the road. I always have to see it to the end. What a huge mistake. Do yourself a favor and go, paint the wall and watch it dry - much more entertaining. Please do not waste +/- 2 hours of your life watching this movie - it's just not.
