I saw it for Gary Busey and Fred Williamson, who thought they were policemen. They are, but Busey is on the opening stage, and then appears only after 40 minutes of the movie. Although each scene is great. Especially when he disguises himself as a blind hobo. <br /> <br /> The plot is amazing in this film. In the film, Fred Williamson tries to find out who is persecuting and killing telephone sex operators. At some point, I think it's his Busey. But it turns out that I'm only partially right. Busey is not a killer, but she is ringing and harassing women on the phone. Why? I do not know. In no way is he connected to the killer, but he does it only for kicks.
