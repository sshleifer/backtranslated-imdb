Oh, my God, what a terrible movie. All the right people are involved in the movie, unfortunately it is not worth watching. I saw it for free in my local library. If I paid for watching this, I would be even more upset. This movie is unseeable. How Tarintino could be involved in such a slow, uninteresting movie. No wonder there was not much distribution, everyone involved had to be ashamed. I can make a better movie with Dated Camcorder and my Big Toe. It's not boring, I really hated it. Tarintino just lost some of the position in my eyes. It must be a sick joke. Do not worry about this movie. If someone tells you that you should watch it, kill them.
