And maybe, as Fred Sandford used to say, "one by mouth." This is for those who have published this film on unsuspecting audiences. And maybe the person from the "Rue Morgue" who called it "Fender Hellbender" and said it was good. <br /> <br /> Five young girls, apparently taking a short home from a football game, get lost and stop asking for directions in some small store in the middle of nowhere. While the driver accidentally gets in a parked off-road car and turns the headlamp, the girls decide to just leave and not find the driver. But the driver comes to find them, and it's not just that the headlight in her vehicle has been colored, but for another reason that the girls do not yet understand. When the driver first catches them, she (yes, she) wavers a rifle and makes them run away and they still shout at them "how much have you seen?". Of course, girls are afraid of death and do not know what he is talking about. <br /> <br /> As the night goes on, the girls end up playing a cat and a mouse with an SUV driver who manages to inflict injuries on girls that are extremely resistant to gunfire and screwdrivers where they are not they want. In the end, they come to the conclusion that something happened in this store after they left, which is the cause of the woman's psychotic rage. And finally they have the chance to take revenge and deal with it as far as they can. <br /> <br /> There are elements of this movie that are rather disturbing and frightening, but unfortunately these moments are weakened by bad acting, bad dialogue and huge lacks of credibility. One girl is hit by a shot from a firearm and seems to be mortally wounded, and she feels cold, her life passes in front of her eyes, but she has improved? And how much of a mini-van can drive an almost empty gas tank at 80 miles per hour? I need one of these things, apparently it's GREAT. <br /> <br /> There should be an end when the girls got their revenge, but the film lasts a bit later, which is an anti-climax, but at least they learn what scared the woman away and the driver is still worried about "messing up her mother's van" , which is of course the slightest concern of anyone. <br /> <br /> So this is not the worst movie I've seen, but it's too amateur to be good, and at the same time a bit frightening and gruesome to be completely horrible. But it takes a lot of high-pitched hysteria, and if you look at it, you'll want to put two ears on yourself. By the way, I do not necessarily recommend it. 4 out of 10.
