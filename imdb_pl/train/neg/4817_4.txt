When you do a spell thriller, I think you should do everything to help the audience suspend disbelief, let the movie work. Some photos (for example, "Rosemary's Baby") have done this; other (as "Necromancy") no, and the potentially terrifying material turns out to be trivial and goofy. This movie has a few atmospheric moments, but about half of the dialogues are difficult to understand (sometimes it is poorly recorded, sometimes unintelligible), and Orson Welles, who gets the best bills, has a role that is so USEFUL that you have to set up, that he was desperate for work. Or maybe he just had a good time ... (* 1/2)
