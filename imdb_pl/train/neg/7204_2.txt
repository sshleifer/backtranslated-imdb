This is one of those films that the author would refuse to release because it's so scary. Of course, they thought that children are stupid and perfectly suited to absorb endless advertisements and think they are entertainment because it is a fun slapstick. What's the talking car with buttons that Wendy's, McDonalds, M & M's and Skittles say? There was no talking car in the cartoon. (Dr.) Claw is going to be angry, not handsome and charming. Why and so Rupert Everet "Claw"? Did the writers about drugs write these scenes? It looks like they've done (wrong) Robo Cop's job, turning a man into an android fighting crime. I tried to get my money back, but there was a rule that if I watch more than 30 minutes of the movie, you will not get a refund. I'm sorry that I've been watching over 30 minutes of this pile of nonsense. After I was told that I had not received a refund, I decided to look at the rest of the filthy garbage called the Inspector Gadget.
