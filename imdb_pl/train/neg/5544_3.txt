Although this film certainly has the stench of a bad movie, it can be surprisingly seen on several levels. First of all, for old film fans, it's interesting to see the leading role of Dean Jagger (with no relation to Mick). While Jagger later went to a very respected role as a supporting actor (even winning an Oscar in this category for 12 O'CLOCK HIGH), here his performance is really special because he actually has a full head of hair (I've never seen him that way before ) and because he was by far the worst actor in the movie. This movie shows that if an actor can not play in earlier movies, it does not mean that he can not finally learn to be a great actor. Another good example of this phenomenon is Paul Newman, whose first film (THE SILVER CHALICE) is considered one of the worst films of the 50s. <br /> <br /> The second reason why the film is viewed is the cheapness of the film. Writing is wrong, the action is bad, and the special effects are bad. For example, when Jagger and the unnamed Cambodian wade through the water, it is obvious that they are just walking around and the background is poorly projected behind them. Plus, when they leave the water, their costumes are 100% dry! The whole movie is full of terrible continuity and mindlessly bad dialogue - so much so that it's hard to imagine why they did not ask Beli Lugosi or George Zucco for the star in the film - because they both appeared in many horror movies. In many ways it would be a great example of a film class about how to NOT make a movie. <br /> <br /> So, giving him 3 is probably a bit too generous, fun to laugh and short, so it's worth looking for bad movie fans.
