This movie is not as scary as most Sci-Fi Channel movies. I got used to CGI gray spots and amateur special effects, such as the close-up of false blood, which makes it very obvious that blood is a strawberry syrup or another type of syrup. However, I thought that I could see all the possible downs that the Sci-Fi channel might have. Then I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> Imagine a hand in a rubber sock that is glazed with syrup? These are the main Alien vampires in this movie. You can clearly see fingers in rubber socks. The talking hand comes out of the guts of the victims, and the Vampire who is on the Vampire Hunter team can talk to the Rubber Sock dolls in Transylvania. How did Alien Vampires learn Transylvania? And is Transylvania not in Romania? So they should not talk in Romanian? Why would a small town have its own language? If you can suspend your gag reflex and skip the talking rubber socks with your fingers clearly moving inside the alien heads; then you have to deal with other alien vampires. They are "Leather" that like to wear the faces of their victims. They are simply ugly, which seem to have many scars on the face. There are also annoying Valley Girls and their boys who are human traitors and slip into cosmic colonies so that they can sabotage Defense Systems so that these Cosmic Vampires can attack. the above is fun and worth laughing, you have to deal with the third cast of Network TV discards that make up this team of stereotypical evil heroes who are constantly fighting each other. Why does every movie in Sci-Fi Channel have to use annoying, rough, primitive or simply unpleasant heroes? I was hoping to win talking rubber socks.
