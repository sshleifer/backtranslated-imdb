Dreyfuss plays the mafia boss, who lost his mind, but is now "repaired". Lane is his girlfriend who's around his number one (Goldblum) who should have something to do with Lane's sister (Barkin). <br /> <br /> With what anyone would consider a versatile cast (Burt Reynolds, Gabriel Byrne, Kyle MacLachlan, and even Richard Pryor's performance) can not help with this conspiracy, because Dreyfuss proves that it is not "Repaired" and trying to kill almost everyone in sight. <br /> <br /> You know, it's not like you did not know what was coming. The first ten minutes are nothing but guys trying to tell Goldblum what awaits him when Dreyfuss leaves, but I will save you all the trouble: skip this movie. <br /> <br /> The right reason why I chose this movie is because recently I was on Diane Lane kicking and I tried to see all of her movies. The real disappointment was not a terrible plot for me, but also the fact that it does not appear until the last fifteen minutes of the film (although we hear about it throughout the film). Even being a fan of more than half the cast will not help me enjoy this movie. The parts in which the tension was supposed to occur made me laugh at what was going on. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 stars.
