The sentimental drama in Denmark in 1969, "We Shall Overcome" offers a pathetic Danish approach to American culture. Frits (Janus Dissing Rathke), obsessive about floral power, the naive 13-year-old, comes out with a half-ear hanging from the office of violent master Lindum-Svendsen (Bent Mejding). Lindum-Svendsen, director of the school, portrayed as a fascist tyrant, has control over the local community. This time Lindum-Svendsen went too far, and with his father, coming out of a mental breakdown (surely there was not enough drama anymore ..) and too stereotypical music teacher hippie Mr Svale ("Hello, call me Freddie"), Frits he is fighting for justice. <br /> <br /> Tell me what. It is so unconvincing, excessive (method) acted and so miserable, that as a "family" photo, grotesque - filled with banality - the pretext for the film fails miserably to convince the non-Scandinavian audience. I am sorry, kind Danish readers, to collide with your sentimental travels. But it definitely is NOT a story about "a boy who becomes a man fighting the system". The boy never becomes a man, but remains a naive, great eye. If you call the church of small people with small minds, led by a dictator like a cartoon character "system", I'm sorry if I miss something. <br /> <br /> If you like family photos, go to Happy Feet instead.
