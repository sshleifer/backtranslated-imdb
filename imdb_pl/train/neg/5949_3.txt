It often happens that American adaptations of foreign films fall on your face, but here is the other side !!! It's a horrible change of the British movie "Wide Awake"! <br /> <br /> "Wide Awake" is strange, but funny and fun! On the other hand, "Liam" is simply strange. I have to admit "Liam" first, and it clearly shows that I made the right choice in changing religion!
