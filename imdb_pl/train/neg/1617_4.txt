What an amazing movie. <br /> <br /> Absolutely no concessions for "Hollywood special effects" or entertainment. There is no music in the background, no special effects or enhanced sound. <br /> <br /> The facial expression is usually covered with thick beards, and the Spanish language is a strange monotonic smile that sounds the same whether in the middle of a battle or talking around a campfire. <br /> <br /> I watched these movies (parts 1 and 2) as an educational experience, not really something to have fun. It is quite long and sometimes boring. <br /> <br /> But I suspect that given the lack of any development of the story, I do not think it is very educational. <br /> <br /> It is also difficult to perceive any story from a film dialogue - it would be a good idea to read a little about history to understand the context of what is happening, because for some reason the director did not find it appropriate to inform the audience why the Che Team was moving like them - as a result, it seems that the groups are circling the forest for no special reason and shoot at him. <br /> <br /> I would like to give this film more stars for somehow arousing more empathy in me and developing depth of character, but somehow all characters were still alien to me at the end. The stars he gets are for realism and show the hardships of the guerrilla war.
