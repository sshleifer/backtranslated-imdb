Absolutely one of the worst movies of all time. <br /> <br /> Low production values, horrible idea for a story, bad script, bland acting ... and I can not even come up with an adjective adequately describing how poor director Joan River is. I know that there is a special place in hell for the people who funded the movie; just below the level reserved for violent genocidal maniacs. <br /> <br /> This movie is a train wreck. <br /> <br /> (Horrible) x (infinity) = Rabbit test. <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs. <br /> <br /> It's so bad, it's not even fun, it's bad.
