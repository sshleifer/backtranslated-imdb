I saw this movie at Sundance 2005 and I was stunned at how bad it was, although based on the catalog description I was excited to see it. Apparently the "mockumentary" of two high school students who make a documentary about life in high school, contained bad acting, bad directing, a complete lack of engaging characters, as was written, and everything around is a total bust. I love good movies about high school, and this is not one of them. Characters are one-dimensional and consciously "cool", although they should be outcasts. You get a general impression, like a group of people sitting around making a deliberately bad movie to show to your friends, but somehow got into Sundance. Hoax.
