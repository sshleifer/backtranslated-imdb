This is for Zatoichi movies, because "Star Trek" movies were for "Star Trek" - except that in this case each of the originals was more entertaining and interesting than the big, glossy repeat, and also better made if the substance is more important than the surface. If I had never seen them, I would have thought it handsome but empty; since I thought his style was inappropriate and its content insufficient. The idea of ​​a character's revival in a larger, smaller production had to sound good, but there was no point in it, apart from the hope of making money; it is simply a show that mostly did not capture the atmosphere of the character world and it completely fails to take the form wherever it was not yet (also the actor was not the best). I was hoping to see Ichi late in life, in a story that would see him gracefully and draw some conclusions from his experience; it simply transforms pieces from other movies, spiced with more sexual violence and sfx. Not the same experience.
