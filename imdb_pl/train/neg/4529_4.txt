I will not describe this story, as it was done elsewhere. We are great fans of Clive Owen, and when our Netflix film was recommended, we were intrigued. <br /> <br /> No wonder we've never heard of this "movie" because it was a 1992 BBC television movie. Hence poor production values, grainy image, sudden camera operation and weak sound. /> <br /> But you do not mind mechanics, because history itself will lull you. This is an interesting human story, but not addictive and almost endless. You do not care about heroes because their life is as boring as your life, watching this boring movie. Save two hours and do something to make the time more profitable.
