God, I had to see it when I was just 11 or 12 (do not ask me how) I could have been young, but I was not stupid. Everyone could see that this is a bad movie, nasty, disgusting, distrustful and very stupid. I've seen more impressive effects at Disneyland, I've seen better performances in a school play, and I've seen more convincing crocodiles in the zoo, where they do nothing, just sit in the water, ignore the kids knocking on the glass. <br /> <br /> The story takes place in northern Australia. A handful of ambitious young people are experimenting with a new water sport, surfing the shark-filled waters. Soon it becomes obvious that there is something more dangerous in the water. After they find out, they get help from a middle aged grizzly fisherman who wants to kill an animal to avenge his family's food. <br /> <br /> I think I've seen every crocodile film made in the last fifteen years, the best of which is Lake Placid, and the sequel is worse. Blood Surf would have to be the second worst Croc step, I think, with Primeval and Crocodile, which are close behind. <br /> <br /> An Australian saltwater Crododile is one of the most dangerous creatures that causes more than a hundred injuries or deaths each year. Films such as Blood Surf, however, destroy not only the cruel image of such a creature, but a good hour and a half of the viewer's life. If you really do not want to see this, avoid Blood Surf.
