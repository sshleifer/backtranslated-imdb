Raw, sometimes naughty - for me it is a summary of Madhur Bhandarkar's latest work - Page 3. There is no point of view - just shallow, fun copies on stereotypes. What's this movie about?? Is it about reporting a clan of people (so-called types 3) who are so busy socializing and developing their profiles in life - that they have no time for anything else. And you are in it or from it. Is it that there is no press at all to report daily events. Madhur Bhandarkar forgets that there is a major newspaper, and page 3 is just an addition; maybe an artist who checks who is who and what is. Do not mix these two. And then the game for power - so that it would happen in every area of ​​life. So what did you say at the end of it all - nothing - just a few primitive jokes connected in a movie in a different direction less.
