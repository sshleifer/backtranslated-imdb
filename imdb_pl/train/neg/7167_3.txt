I saw it on a different movie and decided to rent it when it appeared. Boy, I was disappointed! The story is extremely boring, the acting (except for Christopher Walken) is bad, and I could not worry about the heroes, except that I really wanted to see how Nora's husband was beaten up. The role of Christopher Walken is such an outcast, what a teasing!
