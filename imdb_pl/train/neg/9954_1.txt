From start to finish, this is the most emotional movie I've ever seen. The characteristics and interactions between the title character and Marthe Kller's character are pure torture. The racetrack as a metaphorical trick is so overcrowded that it borders on clich√©s, but the director Pollack treats every stanza as if it were something deeply important. <br /> <br /> Maybe there is some value for recreating some MSFT3000 scenes, such as Pacino, making contact with your inner woman, for value. But even such random humor is difficult to find in this complete turkey.
