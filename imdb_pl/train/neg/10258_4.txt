Earth has nothing to do with Pergado's father and a group of nuns. Christopher Lee (who has since said that he was involved in it by his producers who told him a lot of great actors), is the father of Pergado and performs his usual serious and terrible routine. The cast is not so bad, although most of them withdrew from the game. The film has horrible sound effects (created mainly by pressing the keys on the old computer, it seems) and sometimes it is ridiculous to wonder - showing the scene of the sky, for example, what seems like hours. Nevertheless, the story is quite humorous and its production is adequate. Interestingly, Albert Band and wife Jackie appear in one scene; Meda Band; Writer Frank Ray Perilli and assistant of Charles Banda Bennah Burton. In spite of my miserable nature, I really wanted to see how it all worked out and I liked it the same.
