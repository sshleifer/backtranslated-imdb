Generally, I've found that if you do not hear about the movie before watching it on DVD, there's probably a good reason for it. I did not hear about the movie at all until I was in the Blockbuster blockbuster and saw it on the shelf. Because all the good films have already been rented (the ones I wanted to see, anyway), I thought I would give this movie back. <br /> <br /> It does not really differ much from other genre movies like The Singles Ward or RM If you like this type of movie, you'll probably like it. <br /> <br /> If you're not a Mormon, you probably will not like this movie. There is no way of avoiding the overtly religious (Mormon) message contained within her, and sometimes it turns out that she is tired and shoddy. Ultimately, if you do not fall into the Mormon demographics, it's probably better to watch something else. <br /> <br /> Although there were some very funny moments in the film, I did not think it was enough to save the film.
