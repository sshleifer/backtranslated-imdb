This film had mediocrity, laziness and thoughtlessness written on it. If you're going to make a vampire movie that's been performed a thousand times, it's better to do a good job. I will be the first to say that this movie just did not cut it. Some scary / horror movies just do not break the form "lets do something forbidden and abandoned for fun, because all stories are just a lie." This, unfortunately, was not different, and like all terrifying films, when you get down this road, there is no return. <br /> <br /> And the end? How do the characters do the same work over and over in the whole movie, but mysteriously get caught up in the moment and can not do the job at last? The ending was a very anti-climatic and spelled part 3, which I will never see. Scary Movie.
