Rodney Dangerfield is not the main character of this movie. He is almost in this. Most of the time on the screen is dominated by the ridiculous jokes. One of them is that the character is called Jerk Off. There are also many erection jokes, where the punch line is someone who has an erection. This movie is as entertaining as the British accent Kirstie Ally is convincing. <br /> <br /> This movie started with a weak action movie: five minutes of history, and then bam! Awesome jokes. But apart from the terrible script, the film is poorly directed, and acting is terrible. Also, this movie makes old bad comedy phrases about having many famous movie actors B. Harland Williams, Gilbert Godfried, Randy Quaid and Phil La Mar. These are just some people who spend more time on the screen than Rodney, even though it's the main character. Do not be surprised when you find this movie in a pharmacy for five bucks. Even this is too much.
