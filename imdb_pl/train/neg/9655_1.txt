I ended up watching the movie before even reviewing some reviews, at the woman's request. Just out of curiosity, I thought, let me find out if there are people who actually recommend watching this movie. I am shocked that I found such long and positive reviews on this site that I come to the conclusion that this is a scam. <br /> <br /> Regarding my opinion, I have to ask: "are these filmmakers delayed or do not assume that viewers are delayed? "The movie is horrible on many levels and I do not even talk about history or presentation. <br /> <br /> So these guys plus one girl (main actress) form a music band; guessing from the constant presence of guitars, this is supposed to be a ROCK band. Hell, when the dancers started to be part of the rock band ??? In any case, let me accept it as a Bollywood rock band, but it's quite funny all the scores that had these two guitarists performing all kinds of cool "ROCK GESTURES", I assume they were playing instruments, the guitar was missing !!! I just can not grasp the enormity of stupidity here ... <br /> <br /> I'm going to finish here, because it's absolutely not worth pointing to further defects in the movie. It seems that the Bollywood directors have no shame !!!!!!!!
