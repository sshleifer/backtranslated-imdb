It is fascinating for me that so many reviewers consider it a masterpiece. I am not stupid when it comes to high-quality films, and I agree that from a technical filming point of view, as well as from several portrayed characters, the film is in the award-winning class. But it makes no sense (for me) that this film will not appear anywhere; I mean taking the viewer anywhere. This is a series of atmospheric scenes, perhaps unusual, but I want more from the movie. I am looking for history and movement and fulfillment of arrival, none of which I have found in this film. Yes, it can be considered poetry on film. . . but there are many poetry that I can not live with for the same reason: that I paint pictures without being anywhere. <br /> <br /> It must be said that it documents English childhood from the middle of the century, which is necessarily limited in its universality. I was personally terrified of what a young British boy had to experience at this time and place. Growing up in America just ten years ago, I can authoritatively say that the contrast is huge. I can not help but wonder if this contrast had an effect on people who positively judge the film. In other words, is there a tendency to judge a film entirely based on its "film magic" (which I confirm is there) and completely ignores its lack of connection with the nature of the real experience invoked?
