One of the main disadvantages of this movie is that although the mockery of the pretentious yuppies is satisfying, he does not realize that the filmmakers themselves are guilty of being one of those who deserve to be ridiculed. One of the characteristics of these types of yuppie is the conceited misunderstanding that they (yuppies) are the only ones sophisticated enough to understand art. While the film ignores this feature and focuses instead on their eating disagreements, I find it ironic that only people who like this movie have the same arrogant taste in the movies as the characters in the choice of dinner. If these pompous characters in this movie have a video library at home, I'll bet that one of these movies will be American Psycho.
