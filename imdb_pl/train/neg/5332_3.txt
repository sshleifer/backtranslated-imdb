OK, presenting the stereotypical "Indians" in this story is simply BAD. I agree that Elvis looks quite good here, but yes, his skin color seems to change during the movie. I thought, OK, he has never been so tanned in real life. This is one of the most obvious brown "Indian" makeups I've ever seen. It's as bad as "Indians" on "F-Troop" and old Westerns from Hollywood, who played Jewish and Italian actors, not real Native Americans! <br /> <br /> This movie is fine, but usually a bad story and mediocre songs, like in all of Elvis' later movies. He just did it because Colonel Parker told him to get attached to long-term film contacts to get the most out of Elvis! I still think "thank God" that Elvis stopped making films forever after the film's release. It's nice to see the actors of the character Joan Blondell, Katy Jurado, L.Q. Jones, Henry Jones and Burgess Meredith in this movie. <br /> <br /> "Indian" Burgess Meredith makeup is absolutely AMAZING. This is definitely the worst of this group. What did the filmmakers think? Did Mr. Meredith only do it for money or what? However, I love some of Elvis's films. For example: "Love Me Tender", "Jailhouse Rock", "Viva Las Vegas". I can even watch his movie with future TV stars, Mary Tyler Moore and Ed Asner, "Change of Habit", in which Elvis plays in the city center. <br /> <br /> Well, at least Elvis, I made a few good movies, but the average and bad overwhelm decent and good ones. <br /> <br /> I will always love ELVIS! Thank you thank you very much!
