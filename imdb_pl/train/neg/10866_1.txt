Let's see where to start ... bad acting; I'm not sure I would even call it that way, as I read it. The actors did not even seem to be in their part and seemed quite deprived of life and apathetic. Sure there was a scene with nudity, but it could not save the movie from dead characters. <br /> <br /> Calling the main character a rapper is an insult to people who actually do it. The lyrics did not have a rhythm or flow and seemed more akin to senseless cuts. <br /> <br /> Budget? Did this movie even have a budget? It looked like they were using less money than I saw in a YouTube home movie. Bad lighting, props, poor sound post-production. Bad special effects if you want to go so far as to call them that. History could be good if people really seemed interested in its creation, but there was no life in that movement; I do not care who directed it. <br /> <br /> I saw some really bad movies last year and this one is definitely at the bottom. Do not waste time because you will want to hear this unbiased review. Check the scores, you'll see that the 1s are fast ahead of the fluffy 10s, with almost nothing in between. I would like to look a little closer before I lose my time. What a fest!
