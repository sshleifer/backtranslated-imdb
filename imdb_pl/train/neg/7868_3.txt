I've seen a lot of Guy Maddin's films and I liked most of them, but it literally hurts me. Editing John Gurdebeke is too crazy, and apart from a tour-de-force sequence showing a line of crackling heads to look at one object, it does nothing but disturb the actors' ability to communicate with the audience. <br /> <br /> Another thing I did not like about this movie was that it seemed more brutal than Maddin's earlier works - although his films always had dark elements, his sympathy for the characters gave movies the supreme feeling of humanity . This one seemed more harsh for austerity. <br /> <br /> Because I have to add more lines of text before IMDb accepts my review, I will mention that the actor playing "Guy Maddin" is able to express facial expressions well.
