One Stinko from a movie about a feature plot and to be good, acting less than Oscar. But for me the worst drawback was the total falseness of the jet plane, especially 747. Some of the main mistakes: <br /> <br /> 1. No flight engineer (or even an in-flight engineer) 2. Faulty identification of F-16 interceptors as F- 15 (lack of any resmblance) 3. Loading passengers into the "rear luggage compartment" supposedly available from the cabin - Even if such a compartment existed, placing so much weight that it would make the aircraft far away aft impossible to fly. " they will not damage the plane. "5. The whole landing procedure was so bad that I wanted to puke: SR-71 (from all planes) with a manhole with a pressure seal 7. Opening the cabin door outside - w wiatr - wieie !! <br / > <br /> Ah, it was a really bad movie, a list of the bottom 10 years.
