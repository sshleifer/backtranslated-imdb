I can not believe I actually watched it, but I think I wanted to know if this movie will not be accidentally more fun and fun at the end. and that's how it happened. The highlight was the worst performance ever made by a defender - so from real life, even in fictitious stories, it was too weird. in no way can anyone on this planet behave before the court like her. and probably the worst prosecutor on earth. Why was he in court anyway? he did nothing and absolutely nothing to prove her guilt. a simple search of her house would lead to finding rings. but do not go. he preferred to say "objection" 2 or 3 times during the whole process - that was it. the blond woman got a drug to prove she was innocent, but not Brett. the madman almost had the Brett's altar in her house that could prove her sick obsession. but do not go again. during the outdoor scene I felt a quiet desire to remove the needle from her hand and hit her on the head several times. even the real weirdies do not look as stupid as I am. and what does this movie tell us? never marry a woman with life insurance: as soon as she falls down the stairs, her husband will be thrown in jail, guilty or not. bad, bad people.
