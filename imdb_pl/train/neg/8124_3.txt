A movie that shoots scenes from picturesque caves. <br /> <br /> Remember none of this movie, except for Michael Pataki, who gave extreme pain as JC in "Five the Hard Way". This is really an annoying sheriff whom I applauded when he practiced the club on our furious doctor. Probably you are the most laughing of Dr Beck's epileptic seizures out of nowhere. Can Mrs. Beck be wooden anymore? Seriously, if you took a 4-foot branch, put it in a hot tub, you would not be able to see the difference. Horror and tension look at the clock, wondering when loans will start appearing. <br /> <br /> Watch it as a movie late at night, MSTified, but do not go out of yourself.
