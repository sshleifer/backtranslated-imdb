It must be accompanied by a special assessment and warning: NOT RECOMMENDED TO NORMAL PEOPLE. <br /> <br /> Daneliuc's obsession with the most filthy body functions becomes a real nightmare here. It is also obvious that the man is a misanthrope, he hates everyone - his country, his people, his actors, his work. And this hatred makes him blind and he forgets the profession he knew long ago. <br /> <br /> This so-called "movie" is simply a hideous series of disgusting images, without artistic value and without professional knowledge. This is an insult to good taste and common sense. Shame, shame, shame!
