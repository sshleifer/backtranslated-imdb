My girlfriend chose this one; as a born in the South and raised African American, I found the plot and premise of this film completely without credibility. The belief that class and racial prejudices will be so easily and comfortably suspended would only come from someone completely unknown to the southern ante. Completely absurd !!! I wonder where they got a good actor like Harvey Keitel and a good actress like Andie McDowell (who's better in the south) to take part in this shit
