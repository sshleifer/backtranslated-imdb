Marie Dressler wears this drama from the Depression era about a polite bank owner who recently aired in TCM during the April Fool's comedy month. If you come with big laughter, courtesy of the Dressler-Polly Moran band, you'll be disappointed because it's really a very slow movie. It is also very poorly made, which is surprising, given that it comes from MGM. Naked photos of Leonard Smith come only from the school "set the camera and do not move," often to the disadvantage of the cast, which is off the screen (like a frying pan and print scan before they existed!) Or with cut off heads. The film does not even have an acclaimed director who is the basis of the apparent nature of production. In general, this is an unsatisfactory mess, and Dressler often experiences emotions and only this bizarre, last roll reaches the bathroom to separate it.
