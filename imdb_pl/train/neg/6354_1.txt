Woody Allen has lost the ability to write dialogues or characters that are clearly distinguishable from each other. This is the case of Melinda and Melinda, where all the characters speak of Allen's general pseudo-sophistication and have problems and points of view that can not be linked to anyone outside the four block radius where Allen lives. They also share the same strange condition that they can afford a multi-million-dollar Manhattan apartment that seems to be designed by professional decorators, regardless of their financial situation or what they do for their lives. <br /> <br /> The only character that exists beyond this boring way of thinking is Will Ferrel as a compulsory surrogate for Woody Allen. Though he just does not just feel like Woody Allen (like Kenneth Branagh in terrible "Celebrity"), Ferrel lacks the charm and charisma that Woody had when he played that role in his best films. <br /> <br /> The end result is a series of complacencies from a great filmmaker who has been trading his old reputation for years.
