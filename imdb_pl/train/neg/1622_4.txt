The only reason I remember it is that it was shown a week after giving the great serial number of Nigel Kneale's QUATERMASS. The trailers placed great emphasis on the fact that the main character had a crippled arm, which meant that I hoped he would be like Victor Caroon from the QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT experiment on the streets of London. <br /> <br /> There is no luck, because GRA RACING is simply an uninteresting thriller with a trick of having a hero with a physical disability trying to get to the heart of the investigation into corrupt horse races. I suppose if you're a fan of Dick Francis, you can enjoy it, but setting it in the context of the late '70s, when THE SWEENEY just ended and THE PROFESSIONALS was still being produced, is something that is missing in THE RACING GAME. One trailer contained a car that was passing by on a motorized road, if it was the trailer of THE SWEENEY, you would see Jack Regan, who took a car and confessed from a slag who made a blame while the PROFESSIONALS would take the car and smash the terrorists inside. I think it sums up what is wrong in this series
