let's appreciate it. <br /> <br /> entertainment: a tacky script that thousands of people typed unintelligent people before typewriters .. pathetic behavior that is thwarted by history ... OK, production value, including good set / location and gorgeous girl .. -rating 4/10 <br /> <br /> social message: the film has no social message. it's free ... but if I pretend to be 10 years old and my IQ is 70. I feel that the message is: do not be afraid to love? - 0/10 <br /> <br /> objecting objections: nothing special, just a gentle Jewish hedonistic and arrogant attitude presented by the writer / director. generally, good, nothing zdegenerowanego -8/10 <br /> <br /> overall rating is 4/10
