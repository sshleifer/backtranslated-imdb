Description of the plot: When his wife, a news reporter, is kidnapped and replaced with a double android, the Secret Service agent Eric Phillips follows her and discovers the weapons dealer's plan to create an army of invincible androids to kill world leaders. /> <br /> I did not expect much when I saw the sequel of the low-budget sci-fi / action hybrid by Richard Pepin "Cyber ​​Tracker" for the first time. This film was nothing special, not to mention the blatant rip off of both The Terminator and RoboCop. This continuation is the same as before, with the action sequence opening the movie. There are a lot of explosions, heavy shots and a huge amount of body, and some martial arts are moved by the courtesy of the movie star, Don "The Dragon" Wilson. The whole movie seems to be a series of action scenes combined with a minimal plot. Wilson is a bad actor on the acting front. I really need a personality transplant.
