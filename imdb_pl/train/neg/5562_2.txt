This unpleasant film has little to say. Dolph Lundgren gives a performance that is better than this script or his other action movies. From time to time, fragments of dialogues appear that suggest that the film could provide insight into a bizarre subculture. <br /> <br /> But no. The motifs are either dark or trivial. Most of the operating is below. The script creates unnecessary confusion. And the director's unnecessary fascination with focusing on gore is distracting. <br /> <br /> It's hard to imagine who the audience is for this movie.
