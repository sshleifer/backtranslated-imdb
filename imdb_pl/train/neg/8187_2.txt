I went to this movie, expecting it to be really awful. And it was. I was really sorry about the cast of the stars - Kathy Bates was a great actress ... before she made the film - Vince Vaughn and Paul Giamatti were disappointed as usual, but Miranda Richardson could not count on one of the fabulous performances I know and love her for . Fred's father, played by Trevor Peacock (among others from Vicar Dibley), had one line. <br /> <br /> The plot was predictable and everywhere, and the humor ... was missing. (However, there was one part of the movie in which Miko≈Çaj enters the Jewish family ... what made me laugh just because their expression was classical) Do not watch this movie unless your only other alternative has a head-on collision with the train (actually - maybe the train would be better ...)
