Horrible!!! I do not want to be too negative, but this movie has the quotient of the stupid monkey's intelligence. What a disaster. I just could not believe how bad the movie is. just awful, music sometimes like the soundtrack to Lawrence of Arabia, I just watched this movie to see how it could be worse. Some of the "kicks" on the side are totally devastating. who can hang down on my body, falls to the ground. Harvey Keitle is a great actor, but who knows, maybe he is in a financial crisis to take part in such a fiasco. . . . . this film should be presented to all students in all film schools to teach them how to not make a movie
