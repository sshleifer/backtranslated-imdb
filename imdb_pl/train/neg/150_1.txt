Old, really !!!! where have you been in the last 20 years, shocking in every way, horror? It's a joke, there's nothing wrong with being a low budget, but it's a laugh, If you want to look at the classics, Freaks of Tod Browning, Dracula and Frankenstein, Undying Monster, Ernest Thesiger, Paul Wegener's Golem and The Ghost Train, you can not compare it, give it a bad reputation, bad acting, bad script etc. The whole deck of money and free time watched many movies, and the horror was my favorite all the time, I'm really speechless, I have nothing more to say, please, do not make any effort to watch something so stupid, please, understand
