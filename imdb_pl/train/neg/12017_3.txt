I'm a huge fan of Ludlum's work and Covert-one books, and I've often thought about how amazing they would be from the movie. Imagine my excitement when I found out that such a movie really existed! "Hades Factor" as the first in the series seemed an obvious place to start. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning, the film was disappointing. Simple elements from the film, such as Griffin's first meeting with Smith, needlessly differ from the book and much less joyful. Several characters are also poorly manned. At first, Dorff is as pathetic as Smith. Not a bad actor, just an unbelievably bad choice, because it's too soft and does not show many traits that are final to John Smith. <br /> <br /> Renaming, reassigning and even omitting some characters further degrades this movie. For example, the removal of Victor Tremont and the entire history of the virus, including the involvement of VAXHAM, makes the whole movie a bit foggy. Marta Zellerbach is a very large part of the book, and the chair has a different seating (not to mention that the character of the movie has nothing to do with the character from the book) is another big mistake. <br /> <br /> Rachel Russel is supposed to be Randi Russel from the book. Not only should she be sister Sophie Amsden (she should be called Sophia Russel), but she also has to work with the CIA, not "Covert-one." Which brings me to the last point and I think one of the most important. COVERT-ONE does not exist even at this moment! Only the second book in the series is Covert-One developed by the president as a preventive measure against further biological terrorism. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I could continue the whole day. In short - if you like books and want to see a good adaptation, I'm afraid you'll be bitterly disappointed. Even as an action movie it is completely average, mainly due to very poor editing and weak effects. The tangled plot and boring scenario are the last nails in the very cheap coffin of this film.
