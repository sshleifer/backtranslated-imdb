I really saw and loved the first two. Especially since the second one is not just an attempt to make the other as good as the first. And this is a story standing alone. You do not need to know the first movie. I liked it also in "Free Willy" movies. <br /> <br /> But ... third, here is absolutely useless! I tried with my friend because we both liked the first two. We decided to stop after a good half hour. The movie is fine, there are fun parts in it. But why? Timon and Pumba were funny creatures in the first two films. What is Lion King 1 1/2 for me is: a difficult attempt to get even more joy from the first film than before, and telling stories from their point of view. But why? I really would like to know. You know, the idea that they both sat at the cinema watching the first one is really nice. But what is coming is mostly unnecessary. My guess is that many people liked Timon and Puma, and I really did. However, for me, many parts were very structured with an attempt to be funny. No chance, most of them were not fun at all, at least for me. Btw. what was the movie about? Was it a) about Timon and Pumba, or b) about trying to get more fun from the first movie? I tend to choose b and I am very disappointed with this. <br /> <br /> If you like to watch stories like "history for xy", you should see "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead" by Tom Stoppard with Tim Roth and Gary Oldman. It's really fun and I'm not trying to get more out of "Hamlet".
