Before watching this movie I was expecting a fictional drama based loosely on the ideas of the book; instead, it is a book, interrupted by dramatic scenes illustrating various "diseases". It did not bother me much, but it made it difficult for me to enjoy the movie. One story, or even two or three long stories with fragments of a book intertwined by a movie would be better in my opinion. If you intend to base a movie on a psychological text, you need to find a more interesting (and preferably accurate) text than that. The film stretches in places where there is little more than a video encyclopedia of nineteenth-century sexual psychology and would be totally unbearable if it were not sexual in nature (because "sex = interesting" for most of us, even me). Fortunately, there are several stories with the actual development of characters that draw us in. <br /> <br /> But disappointing, Krafft-Ebing's theories of sexuality were mostly undisputed. I hoped he would use stories to show how the imperfections of his archaic view of psychology, which still holds to many. <br /> <br /> So, in the end, what have you got? A detailed catalog of several fetishes and orientations, with a few mildly interesting stories showing the trials and anguish of several "sex deviants" before they are cured. For most of the movie, the movie moves with the crawling speed (and mood) of the awakening. And, as a low budget movie, the photos and acting are not exactly top notch. Although * I was * happy with music, costumes and interior design. <br /> <br /> I felt that the subject of this movie is in my alley and I still feel that it is a film below average. He deserves 3/10; 4/10, if I felt exceptionally generous. I can not imagine anyone who would enjoy it if they were not interested in sexual fetishism.
