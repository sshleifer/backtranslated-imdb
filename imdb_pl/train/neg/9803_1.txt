Power Rangers is by far the worst TV program and a completely absurd line of plastic toys in US history. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely nothing interesting about this totally awful television program. <br /> <br /> It's simply the worst performance in history, with horrible actors dressing up in colorful spandex outfits that look completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The owners of this show should be ashamed, lack of unnecessary value for this nonsense. <br /> <br /> Today's children should try to watch better programs like Toy Story movies instead of those trash.
