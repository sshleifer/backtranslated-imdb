I will keep this short as a movie like this one does not deserve a full review. <br /> <br /> Given the setting, this movie could be something really special. It could have been another "28 days later" and even "Blair Witch Project" <br /> <br /> The first 20 minutes of the movie was really excited, the director did a decent job of cinematography and tension, although I do not think he managed to to capture the real strangeness of an empty London subway. <br /> <br /> Characters were a huge disappointment. Our "heroine" in this movie is a worthless piece of shit, and you really do not care if she dies or not. As many people have said before, I supported the homeless and black guy who managed to give me a giggle or two (whether it was intended by the authors or not). <br /> <br /> The main villain is kept in the dark for the first half of the movie, but when it's revealed, I was very disappointed. I will not spoil it, but let's say my 10-year-old sister would probably beat him in a wrestling match. <br /> <br /> In total, this is just another average horror story that falls into the trap of a simple Hollywood formula. This movie had a lot of potential, but it failed to hit the target. <br /> <br /> To emphasize how bad the movie was, the characters in this movie had at least FIVE TIMES to finish and kill the main villain. INSTEAD YOURSELF.
