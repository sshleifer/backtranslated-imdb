There was a great movie about Steve Biko. Unfortunately, that was not it. Denzel Washington - never the most flexible actor - is not able to convey the great charisma Biko had. The scenes of the great Attenborough crowd are ridiculous. The Soweto massacre was not like that, three shapely lines of children (some doing prams!) Marching happily in the soldiers' guns. With the dead Biko, the movie quickly goes into farce. If the fight against Apartheid was anything, it was a Black fight, but somehow we should all be captured by the escape of the white man and his family. I'm sure Donald Woods was a decent man and he would be the first to say that Biko was important when he was not. Penelope's accent Wilton is pure Hampshire and it seems completely unaware that he is in South Africa at all. at all. Wood's family dog ​​gets more lines than a black maid. When the family escapes, the women with whom I saw the film - incidentally, one of just a dozen blacks in a large, full of cinema - whispered, "It's like the sound of music." She was right. <br /> <br /> In general, it is a film with good intentions, though somewhat inept, white liberal about radical black fight. Actually, South Africa needs white, liberal liberals who need a hole in their heads.
