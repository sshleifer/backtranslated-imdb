The little helper of Satan is one of the better B Horror movies I've seen. When I say better, I mean history. The film hides a new story, something not so banal in the genre of Horror - something fresh. But there are also some funny questions. Questions that you'll make during the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie first caught my attention during the cruise in the Horror section of the HMV. I was tired of all the so-called "scary" Hollywood blockbusters and wanted something else. The cover of "Little Satan's helper" immediately caught my attention. As you can see, the picture attracts you - it's cold! I knew it was straight on DVD - but I took a chance. I mean, I saw "Boogey Man" the previous evening - so it could not be worse! After watching the movie, I was half satisfied. I loved the story of the film. It was really scary how the killer pretended to be a boy's friend, so he could kill. Somehow he thought that he and the little boy would become partners - a duet of terror. It was a great idea to set the movie on Halloween night. In this way, nobody would think about a masked man next to a small child. They just think he is his guardian. But in this place "holes in the story" begin to appear. <br /> <br /> If your son came home with a "friend", he got to know the trick or treatment - it's okay. You would not think about it - if he was 9 years old! Or he was about the same age as he. If, however, he appears with a strange man in a mask, you would be surprised and protect your child. You would ask a man to remove the mask and identify. You ask why he is with your son. He does not know him. You tell him to leave. He is not a friend of the family. He is a stranger. Now we are to teach our child not to talk to strangers. In this case, my mother is fine. What? They never seem to think that it is strange that "man" does not speak at all. Gruanted thinks it's a daughters boy, but after 10 minutes you do not say you take off the mask and ask him why he does not say a word. <br /> <br /> From there, the film descends from the hill. What attracted me most was what my mother said, "Do you want some cider?" I can not count how many times it says in the movie. It's like, oh, you die - we have cider, all right !! The film started promising and could not be realized. It was more horror / comedy, and even that he failed to deliver. I think it can be called "Dud", "Flop", etc. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the film is the cover. Although something tells me that it is not worth $ 12!
