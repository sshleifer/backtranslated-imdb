Final Justice has a great Joe Don Baker running around Texas, shooting people who shoot people. Then he goes to Malta, where he shoots more people. He is closed many times for shooting people. Then he goes into a shootout with a bad guy who is dressed like a monk. There's a chase on the boat, and Joe Don goes to jail again. Finally, Joe Don, with the help of Elaine from "Seinfeld", kills the bad guy, blew up a boat or two and someone is shot with a flame. All this and a catchy theme song, like Mitchell!
