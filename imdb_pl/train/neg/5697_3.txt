This is the most elementary type of the traditional ghost story, not even animated to a large extent by the use of Irish locations. If the great M.R. James ever thought of this story so thin - is not James having a story called "The Thin Spirit"? - he would not have bothered to publish it. <br /> <br /> Orson Welles appears in inert pieces as a favor for old friends, producers of this film. His presence and the joke of one film industry would deserve this Oscar nomination. This is another proof, if it was needed, that the Academy Awards have never been a guarantee of merit.
