Mercilessly boring and painfully distasteful attempt to transpose Sheriff Bart's character from Blazing Saddles Mel Brooks to his own weekly sitcom, it's really as bad as some say it is! <br /> <br /> Laughter Only serves to remind the viewer of an unintended view of what is supposed to be a joke in this alleged comedy and how desperate laughter is! <br /> <br /> However, it is a bit interesting to see Louis Gossett Jr. it's best to impersonate Cleaver Little. His embarrassment manifests itself in every scene. He was much more fun in the HBO movie El Diablo than in this piece of cheese! <br /> <br /> The really best and the funniest thing about Black Bart is the name of his horse!
