The writer / director of this film obviously does not know anything about the film. I think DP in this project was connected and replaced by a monkey, because each vision was either too dark or had hotter hot spots than the sun. <br /> <br /> The story was terrible, the characters were very one-dimensional. For someone who said that this movie was created for fans of poker, not for movie fans, that someone is joking with himself (probably a writer / director). No poker fan in this world likes this movie. Even your money man hates this project. To enter the casino and play a few hands, you have no experience writing poker. Keep your daily work. And if you play poker, you must be hurt.
