Tenants Two writers struggle to finish their books in an empty residential home. Initially they help each other, and then slowly build up the tension between them. <br /> <br /> It is based on the novel by Bernard Malamud and unfortunately everyone is talking as if they were in this novel. Very few dialogs are natural, purple and full of shades of meaning. It's as if the script was written by a major English student with a head full of grudges. It's terrible and I found myself immune to everything the film had to say, which is a shame because the film is filled with great performances from top to bottom. Snoop Dog on down is a great form, unfortunately none of them is able to falsify words and premises. <br /> <br /> I can not really recommend this movie. Although it is not really bad, it is very polite and pretentious to the point that you want to leave. I lost interest in less than a third of the way and had to fight to reach the end. If you're interested, I'll try it out on the cable, but I would not spread the money to see it.
