R O B O T O O X. <br /> <br /> Burn the master. <br /> <br /> Grotesque horrible. <br /> <br /> No end; no closing. <br /> <br /> Completely and the worst movie ever made. <br /> <br /> Replaces the "Adventures of Pluto Nasha" as the worst movie of all time. <br /> <br /> I hate this completely unedited, unedited, unprinted, undirected, unmanaged mess called "Robot Jox" - and I just found out - THEY WERE SECOND! I apologize to Adma Sandler (Zohar the Beauticin) and Eddie Murphy (Pluto Nash) for the hatred of their films. This mess makes these movies just bad - not terrible horrible and grotesque like this thing. This is the only movie I ever said - REMOVE IT FROM NETFLIX - NOW !!! 10,000 out of 10 people found this comment helpful.
