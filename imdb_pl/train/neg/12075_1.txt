This Hamlet created one of the most boring sections of MST3000 in history. I'm not a fan of Shakespeare, but I do not believe that he ever intended his work to be so slow and colorless. It is also one of the most difficult films to find, because there are so many mentioned Hamlets. As I said, although this one is quite boring. It is black and white, the stimulation is slow and there is minimal scenery. All actors are also called, so it does not help. This is the MST 3000, which I can not watch at one sitting, because the way a guy playing Hamlet says his lines can sleep.
