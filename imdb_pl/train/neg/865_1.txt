I had the misfortune to sit for a full 102 minutes of what I think is this shockingly bad movie. It fails on almost all levels; the cast is horrible, the acting ham at best, and the plot is devoid of any depth, which makes me feel brutally apathetic about the outcome of any of the intricate plot lines. <br /> <br /> Plan B has no charm, this genre has a range that can be passed, and I myself physically shuddered at various points, in which the script makes his regular misjudgment travel anywhere in the direction of comedy. <br /> <br /> A real saccharin film coated.
