After watching the subtitles with one name that I recognized and who was a preacher in this film (Russ Conway), I did not expect much after this film and I was not disappointed. The man plans to kill his new wife, convincing others that he is crazy and will take his own life. It is not her husband's knowledge that the plastic skull he uses, unlike the woman's spirit, is apparently his first wife who has taken revenge on her mind and uses a real skull. A simple storyline with a bit of irony at the end. If you are tired late at night and need sleep, it will help you sleep.
