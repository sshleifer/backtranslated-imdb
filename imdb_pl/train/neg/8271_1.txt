"Handsome guys with bad hairstyles !!" "Beautiful girls without any hints !!" "Stupid gangsters who can not shoot straight!" Dragon Hong Kong is the gangster drama "Hong Kong". For reasons that will be completely obscured forever, the production and cast of the film "criminals on steroids" somehow provided both Maggie Q and Michael Biehn to sign up as villains. But they do not have much to do in this horrible festivity. <br /> <br /> They are the two best contemporary actors, each with their own CV and list of achievements, and Biehn in particular had the courage to take on rather difficult and non-heroic roles. <br /> <br /> Maggie Q was a super-bad "Mai" in "Live Free Or Die Hard", so "nuff said". /> <br /> Biehn is obviously known for being a soldier from the future who made "The Terminator" from 1984 such a believable science fiction / fantasy romp, smashing himself against Big Arnold, who is now the governor of California !! <br /> <br /> Michael Biehn is almost completely wasted in this terrible wreck of a police drama train. There is absolutely no reason, because the incredibly complicated plot - mainly in Chinese, because it is a story from Hong Kong - could be better developed for non-Chinese recipients with a foreign narrator. <br /> <br /> In other words, if Biehn were used as an Interpol observer or coordinator, or an agent under a deep cover that would have to give him something for every five or ten minutes, it would be great. But no, he was brought in as part of a strange group of evil special-forces guys who seem to freelance their own corrupt system, in the middle of someone's completely corrupt deal, in which the local king of corrupt transactions takes part. <br /> <br /> Yes, I said it all. Confused? Me too. "Welcome to the party, buddy". <br /> <br /> In the really excellent crime drama in Hong Kong, known in English as "Breaking News", there are also many fascinating characters at work, but there is only one plot in the story. <br /> <br /> Bad guys versus good policemen. In this miserable and overly brutal expedition into the world of a triad in Hong Kong, a gang, it seems that policemen with hot police are not much more than a parade of ducks in the shooting range, just as their criminals steal. br /> <br /> So, no wonder there is an almost unintelligible scene (several scenes in reality) in which children try to shoot wooden ducks in an arcade game to win stuffed animal prizes. And so the policemen from a good shooter naturally intervene on their behalf, so the arcade owner has to give up the Kewpie dolls. <br /> <br /> There is also a carefree attempt to create a "love" interest "between" visiting cops "and the only" visiting policewoman ". <br /> <br /> Visitor cops should be material witnesses against the leader of the gangster Triad, who is kidnapped on the way to his appearance, but not by his own team, but by mercenaries (Biehn, Maggie Q and a few others). All assassins want something, but we do not know what it is until the very end of the movie !! It was a stupid mistake in all of history. <br /> <br /> You can not build tension in the crime drama without something that you can get, get or run away from the introduction of the story. <Br /> <br /> Add to this a few "cut scenes" made for purely artistic effects, all of which depict the recent mines of bad guys and ordinary bad guys, and any film lover can easily understand why this barking dog gets 1 point from this fan of all cinematic things with criminals and conspirators and Hong Kong.
