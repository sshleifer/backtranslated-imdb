This film had a great cast: Christopher Lee, Dean Jagger, Macdonald Carey, Lew Ayres - solid actors of the film b. But this filmmaker did not use any of them to any advantage, and none of his characters even met on the screen (though Christopher Lee can not play against each other in several scenes). <br /> <br /> The motivations for aliens in this movie seem to change over time. First of all, they just want to fix their ship and leave, and then turn on the main character, killing most of their friends and not letting go of his wife after he gets the necessary part. Then, out of nowhere, this "calm" race decides that it must destroy the planet because it causes too many "diseases" (though they offer the main character and his wife a place in their society). <br /> <br /> Most of the movie is spent watching as a man and wife ride, walk, stand or sit at their desks and do nothing. You almost regret that they did not end up with the rest of the planet at the end, only revenge for boredom to death. <br /> <br /> Unless you really like Chris Lee or the low-budget science fiction of the seventies I miss it. It falls into this narrow range of wasted celluloid between Star Odyssey and UFO: Target Earth.
