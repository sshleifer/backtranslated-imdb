One wonders why someone would try to convert successful movie stories that have already been seen, just like in the case of this film. "The Wedding Date" is one of the best examples, why not even try to remake, under the guise of a new story, something that should be left alone. If a project like this goes hand in hand with the approval of a great studio studio, then go with big stars and shining production values, that way people will come for the stars. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is not happening in this mistaken attempt at comedy. The problem seems to be the way screenwriters transplanted this story to London, when it basically seems to be a typical American situation that even the setting will not be able to fix. Then there is the problem with the stars. Debra Messing and Dermot Mulrooney? They have the same chemistry as oil and vinegar! <br /> <br /> Because Kat and Nick have no conflict from the very beginning, the viewer is not dragged into the movie as the creators thought. It is clear that Kat will run into Nick and vice versa in this predictable story. Amy Adams, who was the best asset in "Junebug", turns out to be a shallow girl who wants to keep her lie and does not come to a man who loves her and intends to marry her. <br /> <br /> For anyone interested, credits at the end of the film last almost seven minutes!
