I went to see this film with the crowd, which consisted mainly of "spiritual" New Age types, which, unlike me, I really liked this movie --- although according to those who also knew the book (apparently there is a book that contains more of this nonsense), the movie is not so good. So, if you have a tendency to think of yourself as "spiritual", believe or at least tolerate things like "aura" and "astral body", and do not bother with the frequent use of the term "energy" out of context. When it comes to physics or technology, you may like this movie, and you'll probably enjoy the book that it is most apparently based on. <br /> <br /> But if you are mostly in contact with the physical universe, if your ability to suspend disbelief is easily exhausted by New Age nonsenses and stories based on them, if you also have low tolerance for tacky lighting effects that define the history of spirituality, or maybe even you expect a reasonable wooden dialogue and action, this is my recommendation for this film: Stay. On a trip. <br /> <br /> Do not even think about it. That evening, the movie replaced Dungeons and Dragons as the worst movie I've ever seen in the cinema (I do not count the movies I watched, expecting to be bad, like Plan 9, etc.). At the same time, it raised the total number of films from which I almost went to two (the second was D & D). I do not go out on movies, not even on this one, but I should have seen the visual aura for the first time because New Age BS is getting thicker and thicker from that moment. <br /> <br /> The plot is about a group of people engaging in old prophecies, striving for spiritual enlightenment and aiming at bringing humanity to the next step in its evolution. Or something like that. They are talking about this spiritual material being the next step in human evolution, which should make everyone who has even the weakest idea about how human evolution evolves. The film is full of shock with such cheats. Sometimes people send to what they would certainly describe as a "different dimension" and maybe a "different plane" to become invisible to those who have not yet achieved enlightenment. Kindness. <br /> <br /> Finally, the director patronizes the audience, shifting the "insights" that make up the prophecy, painfully slowly, probably so that we can remember them and leave cinema as better, more enlightened individuals. <br /> <br /> Good things about the movie? A few very nice pictures of nature and some decent performances supporting Elizondo and de Almeida. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I can say that it seriously affects my ability to treat a person seriously if they find the film interesting or acceptable. It is really cheap spiritualism of the most naive kind, and if it is not your business, you'd better do something else with your time and money.
