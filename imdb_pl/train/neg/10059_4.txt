I was expecting a document that would focus on the tobacco industry in North Carolina. Instead, I watched a man who regrets the fact that his great-grandfather lost his tobacco empire to the Duke family. And it lasted and lasted. If Mr McElwee's family won over the princes, I doubt Mr. McElwee would have any problems with the fatalities caused by tobacco-related diseases. I grew up near the place where the McElwee family started to deal with tobacco; I was expecting more than McEwee's constant focus on the family. I learned very little about the history of tobacco in the NC economy and the consequences for the state's economy through stricter tobacco regulation. Countless references to "Bright Leaves" are out of place - So what if Gary Cooper played Mr. McElwee's great-grandfather? Do viewers understand the role of tobacco in North Carolina's economy by showing old movie clips from a fictionalized film? I did not do it.
