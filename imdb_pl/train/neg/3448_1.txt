I checked this movie when he had six more voices and said like 7.2 or something like that, but seriously it's a scary movie. It allows to break down. The first thing you'll notice in this movie is that it was shot on a handheld digital camera owned by a freshman in a social college. The next thing you will notice is that all the actors are friends of the first-grader (probably met them last night in the pub.) Thirdly you will notice that the music montage is awful and try to piss off many songs for this film, in 30-second intervals ... the entire digital edition is done on the home computer of this first year ... probably using a movie program for Windows, I would not recommend this movie to anyone I know, but I condemned the writer and director to watch this movie in hell for eternity.
