This movie is the worst movie excuse I've ever seen. At the beginning I would like to say that the front cover of this movie is in many respects misleading, if you think that in a moment you will see a really horrifying horror with a clown of monsters, you are very angry. In fact, the killer's face is not even like the front cover, it's just an image they had to find on Google and they thought it looked great. Talking about the things they found and thought they looked cool, there is a scene in this movie in which part of the gang is looking for a friend in the old forest, and then suddenly the screen moves to the stage where the deer are feeding the young in the sunshine. .. I mean WTF seriously ??? How is it to the dark forests through which they wander? I bought this movie from a man at the market, hoping it would be fun if it was not a horror movie, at least it would be fun, right? WRONG! The next day I gave it to a colleague from work who freed himself from the plague S.I.C.K <br /> <br /> The conclusion is: do not look at this movie !!!
