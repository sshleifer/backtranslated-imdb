This film is about a very young girl, Cassie (Melissa Sagemiller), who leaves the family and goes to the first year student. One night Cassie and her friends decide on a wild party with lots of drinking and dancing, and Cassie rides with her boyfriend she likes, but she never told him she loved him. When Cassie rode, the car stopped in the middle of the road and she was not able to avoid the accident, and as a result, along with the boy comes to the bloody loss of life. Cassie gets very upset emotionally and has nightmares that cause him to hallucinate about returning to life and meets men trying to murder her, and she's trying to find out who her real friends are, who wants to die for her and survive the horror Passion. Cassie dreams that she loves her boyfriend after he dies and finds another guy in her bed and is said to beg him for love. This is a film that is not very good.
