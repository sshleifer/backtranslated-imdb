Thunderbirds (2004) <br /> <br /> Director: Jonathan Frakes <br /> <br /> Performers: Bill Paxton, Ben Kingsley, Brady Corbet <br /> <br /> 5 ?? 4 ?? 3? ? 2 ?? 1! Thunderbirds is GO! <br /> <br /> And so began Thunderbirds, my childhood favorite. When I heard that they were going to make a Thunderbirds movie, I was delighted. I could not wait to see the roar of Thunderbird 2 to save people, while Thunderbird 4 would sink deep into the idea. I can not wait. Then came August 2004, when the film was finally released. The critics picked it up, but I still wanted to go. After all, as long as the heart was in the same place, it was the most important thing for me. So I sat in the theater, the only teenager in the 50-person crowd, all the others were over thirty and less than ten years old. Quite possibly the most awkward theatrical experience I've ever had? <br /> <br /> The film (which is supposed to be a prequel) focuses on Alan Tracy (Brady Corbet), the youngest from the Tracy family. The days he spends regretting that he can not save people, just like the rest of his family, but he is too young. One day he finally gets his chance when The Hood (Ben Kingsley) catches the rest of his family on Thunderbird 5 (space station). This means that he must outwit the supporters of The Hood and save his family in time before The Hood can steal all the money from the Bank of England. <br /> <br /> Trust me, the story sounds like an ordinary episode of Thunderbirds when you read it on paper. When we start filming, we have a mess on our hands. First of all, the movie was intended for children, just like the original program. However, Gerry Anderson treated us like adults and gave us stories that were quite advanced for programming children. On the other hand, stupid storylines when trying to make a franchise of Spy Kids. The ultimate product is a movie that tries to appeal to fans of the Thunderbirds series and children, while they are missing completely. Lame jokes, caricatures and stupid antics that no one really enjoys, are all over this movie and I'm sure Jonathan Frakes regrets that he never directed it. he gave solid results, considering the scenario that they were all given. Ben Kingsley was exceptional as The Hood, playing this role extremely well. My only complaint about the characters concerns The Hood's supporters, who were reduced to the remnants of old Looney Tunes cartoons, stunned how amazing, children take them easily. <br /> <br /> What's so strange about the movie is that while watching the movie, I was having fun. But when the lights went out, I realized that the movie was quite bad, I was 8 dollars lighter and two hours of my time was gone. Guilty pleasure? Perhaps. Nevertheless, Thunderbirds is an unforgettable mess. Instead of the big "go," I will have to recommend keeping away from this movie. If the rest of the movie could look like the first ten minutes, it would be an amazing movie worthy of the Thunderbirds name. However, we get a movie in which only hardcore Thunderbird fans (if you would like to watch the torn childhood) or very bored should worry about it. <br /> <br /> My rating for Thunderbirds is 1Â½ stars.
