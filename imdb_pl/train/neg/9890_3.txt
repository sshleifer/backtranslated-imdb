Another rape on history <br /> <br /> This movie is a disaster; he simply uses historical history and creates a sweet love story, with bad acting and low-budget production. <br /> <br /> The film should be 1/3 of the time, it just stretched the time to make a mini series. <br /> <br /> The battle scenes are so stupid and illogical that the soldiers log in stupidly and the costumes disaster. The Romans were good at fighting in open areas, one of their armies was completely destroyed by the Germans, when they tried to fight in the forest, in this movie the Romans decide to fight on the side of the city, that is, become real. > <br /> And by the way, Cleopatra came from Macedonia, which means a person with a fair complexion.
