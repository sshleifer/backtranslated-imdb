I was very excited to see that they made a movie from my favorite book. I did not realize it was Disney until it was too late. I was terrified by many omissions in key parts of history. It's as if someone made a movie from the fourth-grader's book report about the novel. Meg did well at school, and neither her father nor her father wore glasses. Mrs. Murray (Meg's mother) was not portrayed as a scientist at all; they left the kitchen laboratory and replaced it with the internet. And this is just the beginning. In the middle of the movie, I discovered that I was shouting at the screen, to the horror of other people who watched the movie, who did not read the book. I would like to have more thumbs, so I could give four thumbs for it. The only good thing I can say is that for a person who has not read the book, this movie is fine.
