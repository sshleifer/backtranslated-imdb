It was such a waste of time. Danger: If you watch it, you will be tempted to snatch the DVD out of the wall and throw it through the window. <br /> <br /> Amateur production: a terrible, repeatable, vain dialogue; thin paper line; wooden shows; Lucy Lawless was pathetically trite. <br /> <br /> A seriously wrong story, completely unbelievable characters. The two worst concepts in the film and t.v. they are: (1) bad twin, (2) amnesia. There are no twins. <br /> <br /> The story "turns"? Scandalously simplified and obvious - like watching a train sliding down the track in the middle of the day on the prairies. It does not work even correctly. Evil is not punished for the original crime. <br /> <br /> Please, please, please - do not watch it, even if it is free, and your only choice is to go to the synagogue.
