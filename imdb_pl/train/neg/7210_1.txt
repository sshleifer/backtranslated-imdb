Once again, Disney manages to create a children's film that completely ignores its origins. The only common feature of this and the original cartoon gadgets are names. The most blatant mistakes are the characters - Penny does not have his book, Brain has been reduced from a character to a fancy prop, Dr. Claw is more demonstrative than a bad villain, etc., But there are more. Horror begins with the first minutes of the movie - having a gadget as a security guard named John Brown does not help to identify him as a classic Inspector gadget. And at the very beginning we see a glaring test of Disney, to turn every story into a romance between a man and a woman - they present Brenda, which only serves to make this movie compatible with Disney. Add to this the fact that the "claw" visible in this film and the classic Dr Claw are almost diagonally, and you will see that nowhere will be near the original story. What would help would be a better plot that could replace it - but you guessed Disney was not successful either. The whole movie is simply a Gadget acting stupid because of Brenda's stupidity and lust. As if an insult to the injury suffered, Disney introduced a "new" gadget gadget - it does not look at all, does not work or think like an old gadget, it's just a canonical "comical relief". Disney apparently knew that gadgets were a comedy, so they made a comedy, but they removed all smart gags (such as paper exploding on the boss's face) and replaced them with a gadget that is a moron, Gadgetmobile is a wise asshole, and " Claw "shows off. Someone should tell Disney that a "movie for children" does not mean "the total absence of any brain use". The gadget should be aimed at children aged 10-12 ... not children aged 10-12 months, like this movie. Regardless of what the movie is supposed to be, it is NOT a repeat NOT the real gadget of the Inspector. Because I love the old gadget, I hate it.
