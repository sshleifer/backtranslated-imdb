Freeway Killer, This is a madman who shoots people on the highway and yells on a car phone. The police think he is an accidental killer, but Sunny, a blond heroine played by Darlanne Fluegel, detects the pattern. Similarly, a former policeman, played by James Russo, who join forces and bodies in search of a villain who got rid of his spouses. This movie, in which Richard Belzer played, has its own special moments, especially if you like car chases, but in reality it is not a good movie, check if you are really bored and have seen The Hitcher, Joy Ride or Breakdown, otherwise keep away from the highway.
