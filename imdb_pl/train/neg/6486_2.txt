If there is one thing that Disney can count on, it's their amazing ability to make a story and repeat it again and again. Even watching the Lady and the Tramp II ad was a terrible experience. Disney will ruin one of the most amazing classics in history. He even had a spaghetti scene with meatballs. It's been done before! And that's what I'm saying, I'm sorry, directly to the video (the whole concept should be banned). Everything is just a modification of the original movie, and even some really bad Bluth movies. The duo of penguins and walrus (I even forgot their names) is just a very poor copy of Timon and Pumba. Morgana is another Ursula. He repeats practically all his old lines. The songs are pathetic, really fatal. So far, I've never heard about them so badly before. And dialogue is terrible. It is pathetic and simplified. On the plus side, at least some time for the animation to be decent. All ordinary characters are not as annoying as they used to be (or maybe a minus for Little Mermaid fans). Returning to the negative, Melody is so disgustingly sweet that you can vomit. I almost did it. Do yourself a favor with your little Mermaid fan. Do not waste money on it. It is true that it is not as frightening as Return of Jafar or Pocahontas II, but it is a small consolation.
