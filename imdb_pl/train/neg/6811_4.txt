When I first saw the movie at the cinema 11 years ago, I loved it. I still think that directing and photos are excellent, just like music. But really a script that started to bother me over time. I believe that writing Emma Thompson is absorbed by herself and unfaithful to the original book; reduced Marianne to a side character, second violin to her much too old, too strict Elinor - she in the film receives many "moments of concentration" and often seem to be there just to show Thompson alone. <br /> <br /> I understand that it cuts off a few characters from the book, but omits one scene in which Willoughby in the book is redeemed? For someone who red and valued the book well before the film, these are always hard to digest. <br /> <br /> When it comes to actors, I love Kate Winslet as Marianne. There is no best scenario in the world that she could collaborate with, but she is still gracefully approaching without much sentiment. Alan Rickman is great, maybe a bit old, but he plays beautifully. And Elizabeth Spriggs is absolutely fantastic as always.
