How does a Scot in a kilt love a lovely purple heather? Very, very carefully. Now I have a clear advantage over many other reviewers that I was born in Scotland. Too many Americans treat this simplified nonsense seriously. It's a joke, people, "four good legs - two legs bad," as Orwell had. Jessica Lange has an accent that the production of "Brigadoon" of the Wells - next - the - sea Amateur Dramatic Society may decrease. Liam Neeson - apparently popular with women - wears his kilt with the entire authority of the man whom Great Grandmother left the train at Edinburgh Waverley. And Auld Enemy? Where the Scots would be hating without them and blamed for everything? Gentlemen, Roth, Cox and Hurt should be ashamed for such racist stereotypes. "Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves" seems a masterpiece of historical accuracy in comparison. At least Alan Rickman was funny.
