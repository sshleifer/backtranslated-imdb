The vast, wonderfully observed satirical novel about the life of Tom Wolfe in a snobbish snobbish New York looks shiny but is not well served. The film suffers not only from the bad behavior of everyman Tom Hanks as an untamed Yuppie, Kewpie-doll Melanie Griffith as a manipulative southern belle and Bruce Willis (?!) As the favorite of New York writers. The most serious evil was in the director's chair. Robert Altman could breathe life into these dissimilar characters and make them interesting, but Brian De Palma, due to his visual sophistication, never paid attention to the nuances of human experience. The resulting film looks good, but it seems a blahem to its dehumanization in favor of status. Honestly, if satire does not make the viewer angry, what's the point?
