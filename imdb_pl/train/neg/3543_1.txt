I lurked for several years. I've never been moved to a position before, so maybe this movie is worth being a star, but I doubt it. I just watched it on DVD, I missed it in movies because of illness and never looked it up so far. I did not read much about it, I certainly did not even think about the movie in a few months. It was what the buddy picked up in the store, so he looked at it. <br /> <br /> Bad error. <br /> <br /> The shot I mentioned in the summary is in the trailer and on the poster. From the beginning, Jason Statham has hair. Like in any other GR movie. Or any JS movie that I saw. At least not in the displayed amounts. And Ray Liotta in pants SHOULD be alerted in advance. It's frightening and fun, but not in a ha-ha-humor-way. It's more like an almost office, but a bit mutated and unsuccessful. Each of them says the same: "This movie is not what you expect from this movie." <br /> <br /> Now, based on previous, extensive movie viewing experience, I expected that this movie will be several things. Jak: <br /> <br /> () Coherent, <br /> <br /> () Interesting or engaging, <br /> <br /> () Not complete and full of farrago viewing na pępek, <br / > <br /> () Something more substantive than a variegated group of badly realized fairy tales from what is a standard Eastern mystical ideology disguised as a "cool, modern, self-aware form of art", <br /> <br /> () I hope that's better than "The Idiots." <br /> <br /> As you probably guessed in my tone, it was impossible to check exactly any field above. Instead, it was: <br /> <br /> (x) Badly edited pace in the whole store, amateur jumps in the style of the '70s, incomprehensible' storylines'! provided by slack flash-back assemblies, I could continue ...}, <br /> <br /> (x) Filmed like a depressed 14-year-old goth who just spent the weekend watching Truffaut and Godard with a curtain drawn <br /> < br /> (x) So with the whole theme / message "I'm really smart, I" that I feel determined to repeat it every 20 minutes, just make sure that stupid people (i.e. all who do not like it) on the audience make sure they are right, <br /> <br /> (x) A real waste of my time. <br /> <br /> Regarding the unquestionable ability of some people to "get" something from this, okay. I'm glad you enjoyed it. One poster said something that caught my attention: people under the age of 25 probably understood it better because of editing. Maybe, but the edition aims to make your work more accessible, not less. As for "Genius is recognized only by the enlightened" brigade, go suck onions and grow up. There is nothing more conceited and selfish than people who say that the reason someone else does not know that there is great art is that they do not understand the "cycle of craft / materials / moon / fibers of the highest rational thought" that " autor / poeta / artysta / czytelnik palm / idiota-idiota "uses to explain his" wizji / wielkim schemacie / jedności z Gają / great large spoon of a sick dog ". <br /> <br /> For me and many, many more people, his trash. <br /> <br /> Movies, art, stories, poetry, everything to be seen by another person, is to be engaging and moving. In some direction, be metaphorical, spiritual, emotional or whatever you have. <br /> <br /> The only way I have been moved is to move forward in time, two hours closer to my inevitable death. "The biggest trick I've ever drawn was the belief that every part of the movie meant something at all. <br /> <br /> And now, please, at all costs, raise my rolls for me.
