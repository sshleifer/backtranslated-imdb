I bought this movie blindly and I am very upset that I paid as much as I did, but I would say it is worth at least rent for a few cool deaths and funny acting. This is not a good movie in any way, but I must say that I was quite funny. I think you can call it that bad - it's good. <br /> <br /> As I said, acting is terrible, I feel that I could do a better job, showing at least all the emotions. History is nothing new and has been done better. I think I have a weakness for any carnival type movie. I would say that you would like to rent or download, but definitely do not buy. It is not worth more than one watch.
