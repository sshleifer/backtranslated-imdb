Yes, this movie makes me feel really scared when I realized that I paid for it and spent over 1 hour of my life trying to watch it. The bald guy just gives me the impression of being a psycho - actor Junkie, and the girl is the worst actress I've ever seen. Believe me, if you value your time, avoid this movie, I understand that the movie requires money, and some movies do not have that kind of money, but that does not justify stupid plot and bad acting. I always support independent films when it deserves support, but movies like this make this kind of movie bad. I'm still shocked. I will not trust any nice cover anymore.
