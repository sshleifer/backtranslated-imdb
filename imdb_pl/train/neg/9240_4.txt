The idea of ​​making a miniseries about Berlin air transport seemed to me one of the most interesting German (post) war movies. This is a topic that has not been researched too much yet. The creators of this series, however, stuffed it with cliches. It starts with the DVD cover of the film, which is a direct copy of the "Pearl Harbor" cover. <br /> <br /> Luise Kielberg (Bettina Zimmermann) hears that her husband, who is a doctor, (Ulrich Noethen) died in Russia and fights for survival after the war. He finds a job in an American base, works for the coolest and highest-ranking officer (Heino Ferch) in the city, falls in love with him, gets pregnant and suddenly her husband reappears. Come on!!! Too often we saw it. Heino Ferch and Ulrich Noethen play their role quite well; Bettina Zimmermann, however, never seems to convince. For some reason, it always seems that it is too late to give an adequate emotional response to the scene. It just did not work for me. <br /> <br /> Action scenes with airplanes and an air lift, sometimes we get exciting, often not. Nasty things always happened to the same pilot. <br /> <br /> If you're not a big fan of World War II movies, I suggest you spend money on something else: chocolate ice cream brings a lot more satisfaction! <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10!
