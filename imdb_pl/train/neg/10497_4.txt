Steve Irwin. You have to admire a man who not only wants to throw himself into the river, which is clearly filled with crocodiles, snakes, lizards, tons of piles of reptiles mentioned above and mud not only every day, but with enthusiasm. He was never able to force ME to do it, but he managed to bring his wife closer. <br /> <br /> This movie does not fit in my parallel world of movies - movies for people who have just drilled teeth, migraines or lack of experience with film, and therefore quiet mediocrity (now well populated by Disney films). It is too loud. Steve is too loud. He is so happy all the time and will go through a blase teenager (I can hear it now: "this movie was so STUPID") or Tylenol with codeine. I would say that his enthusiasm catches, but if it was, I would have a room full of snakes, and that has not happened yet. I agreed that I am beautiful, but I still do not intend to caress them. <br /> <br /> The plot was really predictable. The bad guys were so bad, I thought for a moment that I was shopping at an electronics supermarket. But the movie was full of animals, Steve and Terri, that's why I watched him. This plot (if you can call it that) was really the reason to take another step into the truck. My expectations were low and I stayed that way. <br /> <br /> I was hoping, however, that there will be a little sequel in which Steve and Terri (working on their acting skills) have a movie with a real plot and more animals with fur. I still can not believe we will not see Steve again. I hope that Terri and the children will still be involved in the Australian Zoo and at least the discovery channel. I can not imagine seeing a crocodile without someone from the Irwin family telling me how wonderful this crocodile is. Crikey!
