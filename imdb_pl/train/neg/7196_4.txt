INSPEKTOR GADGET (1999) ** <br /> <br /> Performers: Matthew Broderick, Rupert Everett, Joely Fisher, Andy Dick, Dabney Coleman Director: David Kellogg 80 minutes Rated PG <br /> <br /> By Blake French : <br /> <br /> The new Disney movie, Inspector Gadget, is about a police officer named John who survived a serious accident and was saved by a state-of-the-art experimental operation that turns him into a robot-like agent that has tools and equipment all kinds of built-in in his body when using it when he says "Go Go", just to be called the Inspector Gadget! <br /> <br /> The actual structure of the film is very similar to the body being created by the Inspector's Gadget itself. It is noisy, fragmented, energetic and consists of a handful of depressed devices thrown together to create something that has nothing to do with anything else. The film is basically a series of bizarre action sequences that are stuck together with characters and an uneven story that would appeal only to children aged 6-9. <br /> <br /> A policeman who has been rediscovered dramatically is played by Matthew Broderick who, until "Inspector Gadget", has been successful in films such as "Election". His character becomes the Gadget of the Inspector after meeting a hard-faced villain named Claw. He is played by Rupert Everett, who already this year suffered a catastrophe because of the awful "Dream of William Shakespeare's summer night". <br /> <br /> In the film there is a romantic story, as well as a lot of scenes involving Looney body parts and elements of the Inspector Gadget mechanism. Gadget and Claw are salivating over the attractive character of Brenda, played by Joely Fisher, both for her appearance and for her knowledge of a specific invention created by her late father, who was previously killed by Claw. Competition changes into battle scenes and is the reason for many events in the film. An important figure is also Gadget Mobil, a car similar to life, which was created for the Inspector Gadget itself. This is D.L. Hughly from the sitcom comedy "The Hughly's." <br /> <br /> "Inspector Gadget" is a movie that I found quite bad. I know, I'm not exactly the target group of filmmakers, but even my ten-year-old relative considered this movie unpopular. The film is full of clear defects and obvious problems. I never cared about heroes. In contrast to the much worse film from 1997, "Mr. Magoo", which opened with the help of clips from the original comic, there is no development of mood outside carefully chosen subtitles. Is it too much to ask for the same kind of thing in this comedy, which is rarely funny and almost never convincing. The overall production design is nothing but a mess of incomplete visual gags and consists of one joke: the stupid stupidity of the Gadget Inspector. <br /> <br /> In such films the audience wants boundaries - something that will help to understand what can happen and what can not. There are no such limits in the Inspector's Gadget. This is a real party for actors who had a good time. I am reminded of another missing comedy released a few years ago under the title "Blankman", which again contained many props and energy, and the actors certainly had fun with all gadgets and props, but they also lacked something needed for each film: audience participation. <br /> <br /> The character, which I often left, is the Gadgets' daughter, who at the end of the film still has no idea what her name was. It's only used as a story device - and I ask how it was used to keep the story going. Her presence brings nothing important or productive to the film. We never know her reaction to her father's operations or incidents. So it is someone who could be completely omitted and would not affect the movie in any way. <br /> <br /> Finally, I would like to say that the Inspector's Gadget is a horrible, insufficient excuse for a children's comedy. And believe it or not, but I compare this film to the brutal and very young generation of the "Blade" action image. Once again I say that I had a film where nothing happens than a movie in which everything is happening. "Inspector Gadget" had so much to do at the same time, it made me literally bewildered. <br /> <br />
