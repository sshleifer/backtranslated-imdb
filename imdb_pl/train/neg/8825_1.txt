The only reason a movie can be even one star is how much the ending has made me laugh. I had high hopes, because I usually love bad holiday horrors in a bad camp, but it just did not qualify. It's a really bad attempt to show that the character is slowly going crazy, which is not a bad deal again, but it's badly done here. There are several scenes (such as ending) that are not meant to be fun, but they really made me laugh. Several times I thought that the film would indeed go in an interesting direction, but it never meets what it could and should be. In my opinion, if you are looking for Christmas, try Silent Night, Deadly Night.
