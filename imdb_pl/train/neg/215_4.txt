I'm not as much like Love Sick as I am. In the end, the film expresses Alex's and kik's sexual connections, Sandu, their triangular love was full of intensity, frustration and jealousy, in the end Alex woke up and realized that they would have no results and no future. <br /> Director Tudor Giurgiu was in the AMC theater on Sunday at 12:00 on 08.10.06, we watched the film with us. After the film, he told the audience that the purpose of creating this film, which was supposed to express the sexual relations of Romania, was quite complicated. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, sex life is always complicated everywhere, I do not feel any particular impression and effect from the movie. The love advances of Alex and Kiki and Kiki and her brother Sand were a kind of a neighborhood story. <br /> <br /> Two main reasons why I do not like this movie are: the movie did not tell us how they fell in love? It seems that after Alex moved into the building where Kiki lived, two girls fall in love. It does not make any sense at all. How a girl would fall in love with another girl than in a man. Too many fragments, you have to visualize and combine these stories with your mind. Second, the whole movie did not have Alex and Kik's sexual intercourse, what was I waiting for? Still, some parts deserved a recommendation. Part of "ear piercing" was quite interesting. Alex was inclined to suffer the pain of ear piercing to appreciate Kik's love. It was a moving scene that gave you a bit of a clue about their love. Also the scene in which they lay on the football field, the conversation expresses their love was true and passionate.
