Someone has to send this guy from Uli Lommel back to the FILM SCHOOL. Who told him he knew how to make a movie? Can EVERYONE make movies now? In the past, it always required TALENT before someone could make a movie. After watching this bad movie, BTK and others, which he did, it seems obvious that the poor guy has the same amount of filming as me. Actually, I think that even I could create better movies than Uli LAME-ALL. This movie has absolutely nothing to do with BTK Killer, except the names of the victims and the killer. THIS IS IT. Where did this guy get the idea that BTK is killing people with rodents and other ridiculous nonsense in the film? This is a classic example of someone trying to get people to watch their movie based on the term "BTK" because of the fame he achieved. Absolutely pathetic. The only movie of a serial killer I would consider a WORSE is the lame movie "DAHMER". The kid smoked so many cigarettes that I felt sick. Whoever did this must be shot.
