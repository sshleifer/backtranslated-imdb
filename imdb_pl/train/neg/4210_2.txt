Richard Tyler is a little boy who is afraid of everything. He does not like riding a bike or climbing a treehouse because he knows what accidents can happen to him. So one day he rides a bike and because it starts to rain, he decides to wait in the library until it stops raining. That's where the whole story happens. He experiences all kinds of staff, and finally he is not afraid anymore. But the whole story is unbelievable, and even good actors like Macaulay Culkin could not improve this story.
