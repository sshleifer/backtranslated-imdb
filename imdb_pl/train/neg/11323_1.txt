This movie will promote mental improvement. Read a book! It's amazing that everyone would think that this movie deserves time and investment. I've seen "B" movies before, but the movie "C" was just invented. I did not think I would ever enjoy the Power Rangers, because my children stopped watching, but I found films fifteen minutes in "Knights". High school productions are better than this, and engaged actors should remove this from their CV. Embarrassment is one of the many descriptions that come to mind. My roommate, who loves this type of movie, even turned it off. Now he must tell you something. If you watch this movie and like it, I will pray for you.
