Ulises is a literature teacher who comes to the seaside city. There he falls in love with Martin, the most beautiful girl in the city. They will start a hot romance that will end with the tragic death of Ulises at sea. A few years later, Martina married Sierra, the richest man in the city and lives a peaceful, happy life surrounded by money. One day the revelation of Ulises will make her passion rise and work without thinking about the consequences. The plot is quite absurd and none of the actors play a decent part. In addition, three quarters of the film are sexual acts that, although well-filmed, are quite tiring, because we want to see more development of this story. It's just the bad movie of Bigas Luna, with lots of sex, no quarrels and stupid characters around the world.
