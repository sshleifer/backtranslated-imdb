"Home Alone 3" is the first of the films Home Alone, in which there is no Culkina in the main role and the same villains. However, the plot is very similar to the original movie "Home Alone". Instead of two comic villains, we get three or four of them. This movie contains several pitfalls, but it also has a long scene with a remote control. Slapstick humor is also consistent, but young boy and villain really do not influence this movie. (There is no word play for this purpose). This movie does not offer anything new or different from the previous movies, and it does not have the warm, holiday feelings or threads that the other two movies have. It's a more pure comedy, but I could not make you laugh because the characters did not really do it for me. I do not recommend this movie; It's quite boring. If you're looking for a good family movie with comedy, watch the original movie "Home Alone".
