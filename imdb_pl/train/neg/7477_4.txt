A very dense road movie with some comical relief provided by the illustrious John Cleese (although he really sends his performance at Fawlty Towers). It looks like I'm jumping from above into a slapstick to disperse sentiment in one fell swoop, and the worst part of the movie is that Martin and Hawn have to "find out" who they are, etc.
