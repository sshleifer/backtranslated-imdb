This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There is absolutely no story, gags are only for supporters and there is absolutely nothing else that could make this movie worth watching. In the whole movie, Fredi (oh my God, what a funny name, ha ha) does not ask ONE how he came from the plane to the middle ground. There are a lot of stupid and completely un-funny characters whose names should be funny. for example: Gandalf is called Almghandi, Sam is called Pupsi ... and so on. I did not even smile throughout the whole movie. Gags seem to be created by people whose IQ is negative. If you laugh when someone is trapped in the door (this happens about 5 times), then this movie may be for you. Another funny scene: they try to guess the code word for a closed door (do not ask why - never ask "why" in this movie), and the code word is (ha ha): dung. So if you were laughing at this example, you might like this movie. For everyone: Go to YouTube and watch "Lord of the Weed": much, much more fun.
