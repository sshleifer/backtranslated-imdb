I still have not seen it all; now it works on the cable and it seems to me still inside. My main reason for interest is that I am a fan of Bill Paxton; he is quite a good actor and has consistently worked in good form throughout his career. <br /> <br /> Another thing is that although he was never a fan of the old series, I liked Thunderbirds for ships and the effect of action. Derek Meddings was probably the best in the industry in the sixties and seventies, and his designs for international emergency craft are great. The current team did a great job explaining their work to the big screen. <br /> <br /> ALE ... <br /> <br /> This is one lame story. Children are asked to drive a car, and when they do a good job, it's hard to suspend your disbelief, especially when you have an eight-year-old son Brains flying T2, a huge multitone transport with all Buick aerodynamics. Wherever you look, you'll see the Ford logo. Product placement here is definitely worse, and it's annoying. Ben Kingsley does a good job as The Hood, but he can only do so with a one-dimensional role. If you can accept the film for its very narrow merits, Thunderbirds are great fun. Just do not look carefully at the machine that drives it. <br /> <br /> SUPPLEMENT: Finally, I saw it all and it is worse than I thought. Acting is fairly homogeneous, and although the effects are quite good, the story of many viewing has gained even more significance. Excessive product distribution for Ford is annoying, and children as central figures regret my remaining nerves. As with The Avengers, if you ignore the source material, this is unbearable. But not really. Watch the original program and you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br /> And some tips for Jon Frakes. Take a refresher course at the Director's Guild. You can do better, old friend. <br /> <br /> Another note ... <br /> <br /> I saw it again. Last night. On Telemundo. Called in Spanish, with bad comedy effects. And yes, I walked in more or less inside, with Ben, Ron and Sophia in their fight scene on Tracy Island. <br /> <br /> I did not think it was possible for the lame movie to be worse, but it was. It was embarrassingly bad. <br /> <br /> If it was done simply, without children to save, without language jokes, it could work. In fact, it is another beloved childhood joy that has been ruined.
