This movie is not funny in any way, he tries to be funny with his bad mood, which is so dry and boring that the movie is just 2 hours of torture. Throughout the movie, I thought about one thing: "when it will end". One thing you have to tell them is that they have very few funny moments, which is why I gave it 2 stars. It is unoriginal and consumes almost every old joke in the book, even those that were not fun the first time. Essentially, it's a movie that diminishes the blonde and records all the repetition of blonde jokes. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this movie is a broken blond humor, it's not worth paying any amount to see, it's so bad.
