The name (Frau) of the main character is the German word "Woman". I do not know if it was intentional or not, but I certainly got giggles from the German audience at the Fancy Film Festival last year, when it was shown. <br /> <br /> But that was the only movie giggles I have. It was not about giggles, but about a horrible movie for God's sake! A scary movie in more than one sense. It is a pity that such a message was wasted with terrible even unbearable moments for the viewer (definitely not for the weak Heart !!)! And it was not even necessary to show all the things shown. I do not even enter into a moral duty (because films do not really have that kind of task or function), discussing what is shown here, but this is a new trend in the whole "torture movement" that has grown in the last few years!
