The story goes this way, Netflix was late with sending my DVDs, so I went to an analogue rental company known as "Blockbuster Video". Really bad, they have 150 copies of the latest lame movies for viewing pleasure yet I never want to see any of them. So I saw BTK Killer on the shelf, all through his lonely self. I like watching movies based on serial killers. It's only a part of humanity that I will never understand, that's why I want to see that kind of thing. In any case, I put this DVD in and suddenly sucks from the first second. I am sitting there with my b.f. and we're like "what's that shit?" Unstable camera service, horrible acting - the first scene where a woman is killed, she wonders if she would simply prefer gab instead, then the rat is pushed into her throat. I really wonder if the director is in trouble with this shit. There is nothing decent about this "film". All I have to tell the director is: "Are you the owner of a bizarre tripod?" Every shot was brutally unstable. The music was terrible. It was like they decided to make a movie one day. They probably gathered people from WalMart to show them and "act" for them. Just awful. If you shoot such a movie, directing is your hobby, NOT what you should do for a living. You should not reach DVD stores for movie lovers like me. You better stay at home for your friends when you have a party and there are not enough interesting things to play with ... You then take out your movie BTK KIller and say, "Do you want to see this bad movie that I once did?
