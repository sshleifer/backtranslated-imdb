To Die For (1989) was just another d.t.v. function that appeared on the nas ad nasuem cable in the early nineties. The only thing worth noting in this feature was the last movie in which Duane Jones appeared. Besides, there's no reason to watch this vampire movie unless you like pseudo-chick movies that pretend to be a horror movie. Tired vampire longing for love and looking on the streets of L.A. I am looking for him. Will he succeed or will Vlad simply start attacking again, just like the last century? <br /> <br /> This movie had to be big because soon there were a few sequels. They are so bad that they look like classic. I know it's a vampire movie, but movie makers could get used to lighting. <br /> <br /> He did not recommend me because I did not like it. <br /> <br /> 'nuff said?
