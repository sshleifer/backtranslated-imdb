Hey, if you have a little over an hour to kill and finding paint is too exciting, I suggest it. If you like cheap B movies like me, it's good to giggle! Besides, I would not suggest you rent it, wait for it to come on the tube, say 4 in the free access channel of your cable / satellite provider. The band that made this soundtrack on the way was already on tour for about two years after this movie, and it did not sound so bad live, according to the two small town reviews I could find on them. So once again, if the grass grows into a lot of fun, but it's good to watch if you want to see how NOT to shoot a movie with a low budget.
