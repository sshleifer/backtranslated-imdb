Once upon a time, in the mid-90s, I wrote for the fanzines DOCTOR WHO, and the whole fandom breathed about the new American DOCTOR WHO TVM. As soon as it was announced that the doctor's enemy champion will be played by Eric Roberts, everyone scratched their heads and shouted, "Who is Eric Roberts?". I should point out that it was before IMDB appeared on the Internet, when all you had to do was enter the name on this page for your CV, but one helpful soul wrote for the publication I was writing to explain that Eric Roberts was the most known for the role in which he appeared alongside Murray Abraham, the film was called BY SWORD and concerned the fencing school. Looking back, Roberts is best known for POPE GREENWICH POPE and RUNAWAY TRAIN, but that did not stop the person putting the boot on both Roberts and THROUGH THE SWORD, and his mind was invented that this American champion with his southern stroke would go down. Strange that most of the fans were mad at Robert playing Master, but after they saw the DIRECTOR WHO TVM, many fans (including me) considered Roberts to be the best thing in the disappointing American production <br /> <br /> Yes, I digress, but THROUGH A SWORD is a movie that I wanted to see only because I first heard the name of Eric Roberts, but I had no opportunity to see him until this weekend and I was quite disappointed. I do not know anything about fencing (everyone else on this site seems obliged to mention whether they are fencing or not. I do not fence), so I do not know how accurate it is, but as mentioned, the film is a bit anachronistic, even if you saw it on the 1991 edition, hairstyles seem to be outdated by a few years, and its mixed teenage cast does a little dance routine that makes you wonder if it would be much better if Jerry Bruckheimer were produced halfway eighties. One would argue that this would mean that the relationship between Max Sola and Alexander Villard would be excluded from the central part of the film, but I was not convinced of their love / hatred relationship, and Abraham and Roberts gave much better performances before and from THE WORLD
