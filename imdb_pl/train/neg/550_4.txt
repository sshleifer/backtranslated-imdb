After the great AANKHEN (2002), which was a remake of the Gujarati game, it comes with WAQT, which also looks like a stage play. <br /> <br /> In the performing arts, we have screaming characters who also take the same thing here <br /> <br /> The first half shows that Amitabh almost jokes with 40+ Akshay Kumar, who is acting too funny like a little loser <br /> <br /> The movie has a good message, how not to spoil his son, but unfortunately Amitabh wants to make Akki responsible for being completely fake <br /> <br /> Even his reason to hide the illness, escape from the hospital and melodramatic speech Akki is put off <br /> <br /> Some emotions touch you, but most are too przesadna <br /> <br /> Rajpala's comedy is fun, but too stretched in the second half. <br /> <br /> The director Vipul Shah is too exaggerated, though some of the scenes are good. Music to ok. <br / > <br /> Amitabh among the actors it's in the first half, but it's great in exciting scenes. Akshay Kumar is doing well too, but looks uncomfortable in some too small dust scenes. His chemistry with Bachchan is unparalleled Rajpal is the main attraction, he makes you laugh, not caring and only his presence and his stupid behavior and mortal humor Boman is good in some comic parts, but too loud in places Priyanka is a hero so nothing to do, this is her last movie from Akko so far Shefali is amazing, although it looks too young for Bachchana
