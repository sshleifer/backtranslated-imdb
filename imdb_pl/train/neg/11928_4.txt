The Lives of the Saints starts with the London vision of the city as a bustling city of bustling, charming streets and sunshine. I was hoping that it would keep this atmosphere, but it would get stuck in a story that does not end anywhere. <br /> <br /> Othello works for a big, fat Mr. Karvy, his stepfather with a criminal boss (at least I think that he should be because he is never really defined, but he drops the kittens into deep fries, so believe me, he's a dick.) One of his colleagues is Runner, a black dude who always runs from point A to B. Until the day when he encounters a nearly dumb homeless child who gives him the desire to stop running Runner dumps a missing boy in the apartment Otella, where he immediately begins to grant more wishes, Karva has kidnapped the boy, but he is not sure what happiness will bring him, is it the innocence of being a child again or is it another job? Anyway, I do not want to see how a little boy gives him a second one. <br /> <br /> It only takes ages to go and there are a lot of repetitive scenes. Ending trying to be s that's because, as there is hardly any story about investing in any of these characters, it only serves as an edition for a bored audience. <br /> <br /> Writer Tony Grisoni, Terry Gilliam's favorite, tries to blend in with some religious allegory that ironically ends up pretentiously as hell. If he gave us something more accessible or at least had better explanations for the characters who suddenly acted weird, it would be a more enjoyable movie. It just so happens that we meet a group of annoying speakers that seem to miraculously develop intelligence in the face of a mysterious boy. Whoever comes, never reveals himself. It's just annoying! <br /> <br /> In addition to occasional atmospheric moments and moody results, this film has little to say.
