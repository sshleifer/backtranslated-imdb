I refused to watch it when it was originally broadcast, preserving the memory of a late, mourned series from the 1960s with Mike Pratt and Kennet Cope, but I can never resist the challenge. I should have known better. Not quite a remake, and more parody than homage, this program did not quite know how to play it, and full of childish comedies and cartoons and characters. The three main characters were little more than the caricatures of the actors, and only Emilia Fox could act (Bob Mortimer hurts in a simple role). The supporting staff are just friends comedian Vic and Bob who want to be part of a joke, and too aware of the situation to be persuasive. And CGI, although the effects could not help to improve those available 30 years earlier, only blinded the viewer with light and camera work, and did little to mask the poor quality of scenarios and dialogue. All style and no substance. (And while the show from the 1960s is ridiculed for the fact that there is a lot of time, this "update" is now also very outdated, with "Matrix" style mods, mandatory scenes of "girly strength" and less than subtle tension between living tips.)
