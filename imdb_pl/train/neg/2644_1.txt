The Sentinel represents everything about the lack of soul in Hollywood and the sad lack of imagination present in many films these days. I can not come up with one good thing about it, it's so general, so factory-made and so lazy that it really only exists as an infomercial about how to make money from unsuspecting, not deserving of the audience. <br /> <br /> A plot about the Secret Service agent who plans to murder Prez can be fun. If it is supported by a good director or a caring cast. Douglas is the one who is framed. Basinger is the First Lady with whom she has an affair (undeveloped, unresolved plot plot). Sutherland is the best friend who believes he is guilty because he would not have a film if he did not. And Longoria is nothing. A woman with Maybelline's fortune and ... that's all. I think that when entering secret services, women have fewer requirements. As usual in such a film, the role of Preza is nothing but a tool, a token and very badly written. <br /> <br /> Clark Johnson, who also gave us a pathetic SWAT back in 2003, the mechanical direction has no signature and has all the visual sophistication of a cheap TV movie. Douglas, Basinger and Sutherland look incredibly bored and telephoned in their performances from a distance. Eva Longoria, the most overexposed woman of the 21st century, is basically just to attract the audience of Desperate Housewives. Her role is 100% pointless, and she does nothing to lead the story or contribute to character development. He barely has two lines to touch. A truly shameless marketing gimmick. <br /> <br /> If you are a glutton for punishment, do not let me stop you. But it's time and money that you will not get back.
