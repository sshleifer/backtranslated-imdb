Sharp, yes, but I call them as I see them. <br /> <br /> I saw it at the end of the 80's and it was really one of the scariest, boring movies I had to watch. <br /> <br /> Yes, the pictures are beautiful. Czech settings are really stunning. The political background is tempting, but unlike similar "historically arranged" stories (eg "Dr. Å»iwago" (qv)), this did not make politics relevant to history, or even interesting. Olin and Binoche are beautiful. But this movie makes even "erotic" scenes rot and slow. I am for romanticism, but this movie was so boring, I began to hope that the Russians would shoot them all and put an end to my misery. <br /> <br /> I'm sure I read the book, the story would make more sense. However, life is too short to devote more time to it.
