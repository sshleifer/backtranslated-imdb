In my book "Basic Instinct" was a great movie. He had outstanding acting in the role of Stone, Douglas and all supporting actors in the smallest role. He had wonderful photography, music and the latest noir script. All this adds up to a movie that is as good as it ever can be! <br /> <br /> This continuation is exactly the opposite, it can not get worse, it works badly and a bad scenario, combined with a totally inept direction, it is really bad, boring, annoying. The only thing that allows you to concentrate is the relatively short waiting time for the next scene, which is an exact reproduced copy of the original. These copies are so bad that they make you laugh, and I laughed very often because it was like watching the destruction of a glowing monument. The only thing that is good about this terrible mess is the fragments of Jerry Goldsmith's BI1 result. Michael Caton-Jones and the half-joke responsible for the screenplay even included the dialogue "No smoking in this room" on the interrogation scene, and yes, he sends his attorney (who is now a lawyer)! <br /> <br /> I'm sorry that I saw this horrible movie that should never have been made! It will destroy the original, so bad. The only salvific value is knowing that plastic surgery (and I'm sure Mrs. Stone has provided the surgeon's best money) can do a good job, but of course he can not restore the perfection of the original. And what concerns the human body also concerns the creation of films. There should be a law: never make a perfect movie to continue!
