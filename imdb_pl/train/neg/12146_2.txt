This apocalyptic zombie movie tries to be malicious and shocking; but FEEDING MASS is bad when some of the stiff zombie legs slip through the streets. In Rhode Island, government manipulation of newspapers and television stations causes a zombie outbreak called the Lazarus virus. Some brave, but stupid souls from Channel 5 TV News think that her audience receives false hope and has no idea about the real danger. An eager reporter (Racheal Morris) and her cameraman (William Garberina), with the help of a military escort (Patrick Cohen), risk their lives and horses to present live broadcasts to show their annihilation. Do yourself a favor and do not watch. This is, of course, a very low budget and meets with the feeling that playing in high school went wrong. Acting is terrible, and hungry zombie bodies are almost comical. There are also: Michael Propster, William DeCoff and Brenda Hogan. FEEDING MASSES should be left to starve.
