And this is the category of "incredibly evil" - i.e. Film drunk students are hiring to throw away. I was at the sci fi film festival and everything I remember is a wave of hysterical laughter when this movie premiered. Other critics better describe the nature of the feces of this movie, and I felt so bad in this poor guy from a production company who appeared, of course, to judge the reaction of the audience. What he got was the equivalent of a drunk student sci fi, and after a "serious" anime movie, I think he was "heavenly", the audience was in a moody mood, and then the movie opened and within seconds everyone was peace in it on the islands. I point the worst parts; <br /> <br /> Screenplay: The funniest and worst part of this movie focuses on a linear and predictable road, occasionally badly thought out. Garbage, but very funny. <br /> <br /> Animation: Poorly captured and combined, if you can endure gray backgrounds and gradually skimp costumes for the heroine (I know I can!), then watch out for the assembly in which "transforms" from the Swedish peasant in LADY DEATH !!! <br /> <br /> Characters: This is a one-dimensional painful, there is a short story (with side lines of dialogue) and a small light shines on the real motivation of some of the main characters. <br /> <br /> So, in a nutshell, if you have a trapped audience and a few drinks lying around (try to make sure that the alcoholic again to relieve the pain), then insert the movie on DVD and enter the mindset 'mysterious theater science 3000 ". There is no other motivation to watch this movie than to laugh at it, and this is not meant to be a comedy. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE INDIVIDUALLY. Perhaps even more boring will be watching a solo than "New World" with Colin Farrell, because you will not be able to laugh at the ridiculousness of a friend or two.
