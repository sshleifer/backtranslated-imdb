As an army veteran I was deeply offended by this film. In my opinion, it is a disgrace to those who fought in the Vietnam War. To say that the real SF soldiers I knew were offended by this shit, that's hardly said. If the film was presented as a satire and even as a cartoon (it was), it would be better received. But many of my people were taken seriously, especially abroad. Stupid, it seems, wherever I went to Europe at the end of the 80's, it seemed that this film assessed me and the Americans in general. Unrealistic? Hmm, let's see. Monosyllabic, associated with the moron's muscles, is pulled from the prison gang to embark on a secret mission to SE Asia to free the American prisoners of war. In an ongoing battle, he kills about 500 enemy soldiers using the M-60 machine gun, which never ends in ammunition and never overheats. And he never misses running with a 32lb pistol with one hand. I can go on, but my head hurts. I gave it 2/10 only because it is slightly better than Rambo III.
