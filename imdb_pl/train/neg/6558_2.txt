We rented five movies for the New Year's weekend and watched the first one. All I can say is that after seeing it there was no place to go, but up. It was pointless and vulgar. Harvey Keitel's script had to be easy to write - just make two or three words from the curse. Andie McDowell is surprisingly good in the role of the character, but the movie has nothing else to command.
