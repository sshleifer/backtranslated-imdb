Where to even start? Creepy acting? A meaningless plot? The effects of a bargain basement? Completely disgusting characters? Uncertain editing? The result of the Casio keyboard causing a headache? Embarrassingly racist remarks ("Watch it, Charlie!", "Back off, Jackie Chan !!" "Constant misogyny?" It's a movie trend. But it's a bad piece of junk. I think I felt more pain watching it than characters, which are dying in it! soft cores of porn and I think lines like "I'll find that b **** and cut it off *** close !!" are clever, LIVE FEED is for you., I feel the need to wash eyes with oven cleaner to prevent seeing this movie again!
