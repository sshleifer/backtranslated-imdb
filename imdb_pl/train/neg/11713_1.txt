It's just a warning ... It's the worst movie I've seen in years ... I could not see it until the end ... It's a waste of time ... I'm really sorry about Snipes, which ended in such a movie. There really is not much to say about it. Horrible acting, incredibly bad lines, history, everything. The only reason I would advise you to watch this movie is if you really want to see how the movie should not be. To tell you one scene: the police are looking for Shreds and surround the building with helicopters and cars, they shoot inside the building, but they still whisper that the Chicks will not suspect anything.
