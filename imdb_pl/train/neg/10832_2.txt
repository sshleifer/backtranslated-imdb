Usually I have no problem with unjustified swearing of movies, but this one really annoys me. They just took the oath. For the whole movie. (And, as someone else has noted, get cancer) It was boring, chaotic and pretentious. I would not be if I was you. <br /> <br /> It's not that I do not like movies that, like most people who like it, claim to "watch life." I love Eat Drink Man Woman, and everything that happens in this is that the life of Taiwanese people leads their lives. But I could relate to them. I have never met anyone who would swear as much as the "actors" in this film, and I worked on a construction site. So go. Having said that William H. Macy smiled me. Once. <br /> <br /> 2/10. Avoid unless you like boredom.
