It must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen, the graphics are ridiculous, and the scenario pathetic, and the biggest question is how this rather low frontal script went through the selection process. <br /> <br /> I like all kinds of movies, from deep dramas to more masculine ones, they kill everything you see, the kind of film, so I can not say I'm picky. I tried to find something that I could compare with, but I just can not think of anything that would suit, maybe soldiers from a star ship. in comparison, its effects are great. Acting and screenplay should be rewarded. You know, when a movie is bad in a fun way, well, it's not one of those that kills your soul minute by minute.
