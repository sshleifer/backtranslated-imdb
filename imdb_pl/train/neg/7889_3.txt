I just finished watching this movie. It was not funny, but I'm very disappointed with it. I'm not sure why someone would make such a movie. It was not very funny, but I feel that the people who did it had a lot of misunderstanding about what they were doing. Monday, the author was responsible; Tuesday, director; Wednesday, the guy who gets coffee; etc. It looks like they really wanted to do some different movies, but they only had time and money to make them. <br /> <br /> Someone else commented that the acting was really good, but I would not agree. On the other hand, if the actors were able to keep a good face when filming, they might be better actors than I think. <br /> <br /> The back side of the DVD gives the impression that the movie will be a secret ... something like a historic Law and Order or National Treasure. It starts like this, but then, no one knows from where, there is a turn towards the wrong episode of Twilight Zone, or ... what was it for another program that was not so good ... Bad episode of The Outer Limits. <br /> <br /> My main complaint about the movie is that it is played out. There is a bad guy with gray hair. There is an interest in love which, when it first appears, the wind blows through her hair. Seriously. When you realize that this is a Christian film, the end is also quite easy to see. <br /> <br /> The photos were poorly made, especially in the opening scenes - a way to put your best foot forward. It was not terrible for most of the movie, but there were absurdly bad pictures of an old woman praying, hands in a dark room while brightening is striking. watch the movie.
