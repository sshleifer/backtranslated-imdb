Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. What else can I say. Kate Jackson must have been desperate to guide. Maybe she should return to acting ... secondly she thought she was a bad actress. Who would put money into producing something so bad. I like anti-Christ movies and I usually have good laughter and strange fear, but this one is just bad bad. Acting stars was worse than what you can find on the soap opera. Special effects, if you can call them that way, where it's funny. I would not be surprised if you played scenes in slow motion, you would see what lamps the blood shoots from. We had to turn off the disk after only 30 minutes. These so-called original prints of films should be destroyed, all CDs and tapes destroyed, and all people involved in the creation of the film must return the money to people who have rented the film. Then one should not let these people act, direct or film anything but their own home movies.
