This makes the third Errola Morris movie I've seen and more and more I do not like his style. It seems that he finds very interesting and diverse characters, great personalities to create documentaries, and then with a stormy edition, they mock everything they are about. It's never really their direct caricature, and Morris seems to be saying most of the time: "No no, these people are really fascinating, really!" But there are always subtle little angles and not so subtle editing techniques that show that Morris seems to be mocking them behind their backs. <br /> <br /> This film follows four people who break the traditional boundaries of organic separation ... a man who explores African hairless molerates to discover that they are amazingly ant, tamer of lions, a man who maintains a garden full of shrubs in animal shape and robot designer. The general theme of the film seems to revolve around the question, what does animal, human and life characteristics mean? So the title Fast, Cheap and Out of Control does not seem to mean in terms of film ... right? Except, of course, that Morris seems a bit concerned about the passions of these people (he could call them "obsessions"), creating synthetic patterns for life. I do not share this fear and I honestly underestimate the links Morris creates in the film. <br /> <br /> However, I emphasize its subtlety. Without the narrative of the lector and leaving words entirely to the interlocutors, it is not that Morris ever thumps this anxiety into the collective head of the viewer. Instead, he mixes circus material and formic material, often at a time when removed from the circus and ant context, showing a kind of collective absurdity for what all these people are talking about. I do not consider them absurd, I consider them very neat and interesting people. <br /> <br /> Unless, of course, he did not want such combinations, which means that he is just a bad craftsman, not a silent social system violator. Given that none of the films I've seen so far have made a great impression on me, I really do not care to find out what I'm trying to do. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
