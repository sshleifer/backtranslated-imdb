Twenty years ago, five-year-old boy Michael Hawthorne witnessed his father kill his mother with an ax on an empty road and commit suicide later. Nowadays, Michael (Gordon Currie) invites his girlfriend Peg (Stacy Grant) and his best friends Chris (Myc Agnew), Jennifer (Emmanuelle Vaugier), Lisa Ann (Kelly Benson), Ned (Brendon Beiser), Mitch Maldive (Phillip Rhys ) and Trish (Rachel Hayward) to spend Halloween in the country with their grandparents on the farm. He asks his friends to wear costumes that represent their greatest deepest fear, and together with their Indian friend Crow (Byron Chief Moon), they would do an ancient Indian ceremony using Morty's carved wooden dummy (Jon Fedele), which would eliminate their fears forever . The greatest fear for Michael is to be a serial killer like his father, but something goes wrong and Morty turns into a father, killing friends. <br /> <br /> "Fear: Resurrection" is a disappointing and meaningless film cut that uses an interesting concept of eliminating the greatest deepest fear of each friend before it grows, but in a messy scenario full of stereotypes. There are some exaggerated performances, such as Mrs. Betsy Palmer; other very weak, but overall the operation is good. Unfortunately, there is no explanation why the mannequin was brought back to life; moreover, despite being surrounded by close friends, the group does not feel pain or sadness when each of them dies. A low rate of over fifty minutes could have been used to build a better dramatic situation. At the end, Michael shows the charm that interested his father that I have not noticed it throughout history. I do not know if the previous reference was written on a DVD issued in Brazil with an 87-minute working time. Special effects are very reasonable for film B. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Fear 2: Uma Noite de Halloween" ("Fear 2: One Halloween Night")
