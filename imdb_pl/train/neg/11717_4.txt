Many themes or parts of the story are the same as in Leon, then other parts were like other films, I do not know what, but the whole movie has a familiar feeling. It was nice to watch, but it would be fantastic! if the story would be more original. Thematic little girl, the evil killer of Leona, is a bit improved. Opening scenes are really good :-) It is strange that people like to fight in the kitchen, in movies :-) My biggest problem was to remember which parts come from Leon, Nikita and whether they come from the French or American version. If you have not seen Leon, it's a good movie. If you liked this movie, I can recommend Leon. <br /> <br /> Z prawaniem / Rick
