This movie was o.k. but it could have been much better. There are some terrible moments, but there are not enough to make me ever want to see this movie. There are several scenes that you can scroll forward and not miss anything. The biggest disadvantage is that it is so predictable and that's why I rate it so low. You can watch it, but do not expect anything big.
