I'm really starting to believe that Seagal has a mission to see how ugly his films can become. This particular movie was a complete and total waste of time to see it. My first objection was the DVD cover, on which they wrote their photo and made him look slimmer and younger when he looks like shit in the movie. He has a big belly on his stomach and a double chin for him and the most unhappy and bored expression on his face. <br /> <br /> The storyline at the beginning was funny and stretched too long. The whole film led to the final, in which Seagal and his team had to face a group of people under the influence of a top-secret military adrenaline chemical amplifier. a lot of useless dialogue and not to mention the absurd and continuous dubbing of Seagals' voice even in the middle of the speech. The named voice sounded like a man with a frog in his throat and was quite comical. <br /> <br /> the fight scenes in the film were terrible. Half the time Seagal foug You could not even see what was going on. There will be tight shots as he waves his hands towards the camera, then a person flying through the wall or something like that. This is similar to the old Kung Fu series on television. too much slow motion for battle scenes. <br /> <br /> I think this is Seagals' worst movie and I'm glad I did not buy this movie because I would be very upset because I'm a big fan of Seagal the Aikidoist. The action star quickly disappears and seems to be worse with every performance.
