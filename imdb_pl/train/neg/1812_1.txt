Go immediately and rent this movie. It will be placed on the bottom shelf of the local video store and will be covered with dust. Nobody will touch him for years. It can even be an extra $ 50! It's worth ten bucks, I swear! Buy it! There are not many movies than you could compare with it - the celluloid version of this mazy, which is formed at the bottom of the basket after a few years. Yes, I gave him "1", but he really deserves a lot lower. 1-10 weights have not been designed for such things.
