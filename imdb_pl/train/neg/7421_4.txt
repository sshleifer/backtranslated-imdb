Watching beautiful women sneaking around, playing cops and thieves is one of the most beautiful guilty pleasures that allows me to enjoy an average movie. So The House on Carroll Street was not a waste of time, although the story is made up and the script is not inspired and a bit irritating. <br /> <br /> There are many allusions to various photos of Hitchcock, not just the choice of Kelly McGillis in the lead role. She is disguised as Grace Kelly, and she is not far from the mark. Not at all. But her character is not convincing. The way in which it is presented to viewers should be a person with political convictions and purpose in life. After all, the film deals with a clearly defined period of time, real events and a specific problem. But the story turns into a deplorable criminal tale in the first minutes with incredible coincidences, high predictability and a set of two-dimensional figures. It is even more regrettable that the performances of the actors are good, as well as photography and stage design. <br /> <br /> The final in Central Station in New York is breathtaking. It starts in the underground part and then moves to the roof. The film can be proud of the good use of architecture.
