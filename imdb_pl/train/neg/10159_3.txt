A more extensive, hysterical hyper-cheerfulness of the 1950s, which gives new meaning to antisocial, pathological behaviors. Danza and Grayson leave you begging for mercy. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that all the people involved in making this movie are now dead (or in nursing homes). I was thinking about suing them for torture. As this movie began to unleash a shamelessly aggressive attack on my poor, vulnerable ear drums, I felt immediately that all my pain was under intense pain. It's a damned, muscular vibrato that can smash Soviet tanks into small pieces, no matter glass. <br /> <br /> "Why did not you change the channel if you did not like it?", you can ask with anger. Honest point, honest point ... The answer is that I wanted to, but the pain was so sudden and excruciating that I fell to the floor, writhing in agony. With my last ounce of energy, I tried to reach the pilot, but I could not. <br /> <br /> Stupid little fisherman with dubious talent for singing with an irritating operatic voice was discovered by Niven, who then goes to "pigmalionize" him. Lanza is in love with the asymmetrical Grayson, but in a predictable way treats him with contempt, until he finally joins. It may seem like a pretty thin story, but this noisy movie is so full of singing and music that there is almost no dialogue. This movie is RELIABLE. Forget about torturing hippies and prisoners of war with Slayer's "Reign In Blood" (as in the South Park episode). Regardless of what is the small conversation between stupid adults who attack this strange musical world of the 1950s, it is all infantile - as if they were all six-year-olds impersonating adults. I can only envy people who find such movies as funny. It must be great to be easy to please: what a wonderful world would open to me if only I could enjoy some stupid old gag, like a comic comedy about a funny character. <br /> <br /> But let's look at this phenomenon, music of the 50s. My best guess is that the musicals from the 1950s offered the more dreaming idealists between us looking at the utopia or the sky (depending on whether it is a church or Lenin's tomb), or at least a very bad version of these fantasies. inspired places. TTONO is more like the representation of hell, but it's just me. It seems to me that I do not "get" musicals. People say, there is a story - but suddenly everyone starts singing for about 4 minutes, then they suddenly calm down and then pretend that nothing has happened! When you think about it, musicals are stranger than any sci-fi movie. <br /> <br /> Worse, TTONO (my favorite type of pizza, btw) is not only a musical from the 50s, but with an operatic screech. Opera is proof that there is such a thing as excessive voice training - to the extent that it becomes a weapon to pierce the ears, not a means to bring pleasure to the listener. The clearest example of this travesty is that Lanza and Grayson combine the vocal powers of the Dark Side into a truly unbearable duo. I tried to lower the volume. I lowered it from 18 to 14. Then from 14 to 10. Then 8. I finished lowering it to 1, which is usually so low that only specially trained dogs and some types of marsupials hear it, and yet I AM hearing those two roaring like donkeys ! <br /> <br /> Take the scene in a small boat on the river. Danza starts with one of his deafening, brain-killing melodies, and then ... nothing. Animals are nowhere to be seen. Even crocodiles that are deaf have everything left. If you look carefully, you can even see that the trees change from green to yellow in a few minutes. No, it was not a continuity error, it was just an old torture of flora. And these trees were just dull paintings! Imagine how real trees would react. <br /> <br /> The reason why the glass breaks when high C is ejected from the overweight of the opera's belly is not the result of any laws of physics regarding waves and frequencies, but because glass is only human - that's why it can only take so much pain before committing suicide by spontaneous explosion. I can listen for hours to the loudest, least friendly death metal band, but give me only one minute of soprano and I get a tearing headache.
