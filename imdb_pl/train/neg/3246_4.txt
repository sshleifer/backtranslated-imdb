The plot of the game "House of Games" is the strongest thing: a successful author and psychologist is cheated by a band of rodents, but discovering the wicked part of herself that enjoys the thrill of what she does, she finally gets revenge. This is on the pitch: but someone has to take responsibility for being treated by dolls. This must be the director of Mamet: Lindsay Crouse had a diverse and fairly stable television and film career, so she can not play that bad all the time. She should go from a tense, cool, controlled professional to a calculating, wicked, fast lady playing, as evidenced by the change from a beige trouser suit (which seems to wear for three days straight, including underwear) to a soft floral dress. But it seems that everyone speaks in the same way with their lines in a precisely cut, precise way; I imagine that Mamet wants to be sure that he will not miss the syllable of his brilliant script. The effect is disturbing and spoils the atmosphere of mystery and tension that you are probably trying to create. Sometimes "House of Games" loses any connection with how people actually behave or speak, and becomes just a mechanism to throw away a conspiracy. The fresco-sounding vibes'n'oboe soundtrack also does not help. The final result is that the only entertainment is to guess the result and the sooner you do it, the sooner you get bored with robotic, two-dimensional performances. And they burn too much !!!
