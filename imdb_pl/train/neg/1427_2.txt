The British claymation series of "witty" conversations recorded by "average" people in the mouths of "cute" fanciful creatures had at least an advantage for non-British viewers who had seemingly crazy humor and a kind of disheveled cultural humor that could not be obtained by American television. Someone made a mistake by imposing it on American television. <br /> <br /> It's a bit like a badly directed American version of the sublime Brit-com COUPLING, who died a month in NBC, when the same basic scripts do not "translate" from English to American English, which seemed to be drol and iconic (and only boring BIT) in England, appears in CREATURE COMFORTS, in the American version, as simply boredom with dolls, no plot line, no characters and after one and a half episodes watched (from three finally issued), there is no reason to suffer more. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing to say about the new summer series and the mercifully short series is that claymation is at least professionally made and comes as a set for the worst performance in the CBS schedule, The New Adventures of Old Christine (or "how to be a BABY mother - or a person - in one endless, unpalatable lesson") kids who wanted to stay before bedtime, they did not go to bed instead of sitting in this program, and adults could wait until 21:00, when "Two and a half men" "(blame) and" How I Met Your Mother "(actual writing quality) .
