Basically, it's a couple who wants to adopt a second child. In an adoption agency they meet a mouse (Stuart) and decide to adopt him. If you think it's stupid, hold it because it's getting worse. <br /> <br /> Stuart arrives at his new home, where he is treated like a human child. (Save me!) The rest is almost an ordinary phrase about family problems, jealousy from the older "brother", and finally all problems are solved and everyone is a "happy family". It is boring and exhausted, but it is also shown in the most dull and uncomplicated way. <br /> <br /> I do not know if the director thought he was creative, introducing a stereotype mouse, or just tried to fill in a few minutes, but he only picked up a boring clich√© to the hideous. <br /> <br /> So why did I give 3 instead of ZERO? Because of a family cat who loves Stuart just like a "brother". And because of the fun concerts in which Stuart uses his small size well. <br /> <br /> In general, I think the movie will work quite well if: a. Stuart was a PET, not a "sibling". b. It lasted for fun concerts, such as Stuart trying to outsmart the cat, and left the boring cliches that do not even match anything else.
