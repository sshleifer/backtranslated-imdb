This inept adaptation of probably one of the weaker novels of Martin Amis does not even allow comparison with other drug works, such as Requiem For A Dream or anything written by Irvine Walsh, because he tries to decide whether it is a cartoon with a tap or a hyperrealistic hallucination. <br /> <br /> William Marsh's boring directing in a supersaturated group of people abandoning a public school coincides in a mansion awaiting the arrival of three American friends on a weekend of decadent drug use. And that's all. With the exception of the ridiculous nonsense sub-story plot that is about to happen in connection with the extremist cult group, which is expressed by the brutal killings of world elites, whether political or spoiled. In the first drum you know exactly where it happens. <br /> <br /> What talented actor, like Paul Bettany, does in this tiring, badly written boredom? Made before the rise of fame and Jennifer Connelly, you can be sure that if you were offered garbage, he would immediately change the agents! Avoid.
