What starts out as a pretty clever farce about a somewhat suspicious security monitoring company, almost instantly turns into an uninteresting and completely innocent murder mystery. David Arquette and the great Stanley Tucci are trying to make this train able to destroy, but some things are simply not humanly possible. <br /> <br /> What causes Gale to suddenly change from a sweet mother figure to a drunken devil in Tommy's parents' house? Why does Heinrich, though he undoubtedly dreams, want to destroy the interest to which he sacrifices his life, robbing and possibly murdering his clients? Why seemingly reasonable Tommy believes that Heinrich could be a murderer (based almost exclusively on sleep), and even if it was reliable, why not go to the police? And why did not Gale activate the alarm when she returned home, especially after Howie was unleashed? Of course, all these events are necessary to make the plot (and I use this term very, very loosely) to develop. And it can be forgivable if it results in even a bit of comedy. But everything, from Howie's description of his date rape, to Gale's erroneous identification by the coroner, to the final "joke" about the deaths of Gale and Howie, is more tasteless and pathetic than anything else. <br /> <br /> I have marked the box indicating that my comments contained "spoilers", but there is nothing that I or anyone else could do to spoil what already stinks with high sky.
