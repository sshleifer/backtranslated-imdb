A three-part movie "horror" with some guy in a boarding house begging the viewer not to "go out" and (unfortunately) give us three stories to prove why. <br /> <br /> The first story concerns a young couple in a car accident who meets two psychos. It leads to two completely predictable twists. Despite this, it is fast (about 15 minutes), violent, well made and well made. Predictable, but pleasant. <br /> <br /> The second involves the man on the run after stealing a lot of money. The car breaks down, gets attacked by a dog and falls into a nearby clinic. VERY obvious, badly done and very slow. Even after 30 minutes it is too long. Good acting. <br /> <br /> Third is just a horror movie. It's a beautiful, lonely woman who is looking for your right. He has beautiful scenography, pleasant erotic atmosphere and a nice sex scene. But (again) predictable and not even frightening. <br /> <br /> It ends very stupid. <br /> <br /> In total, the first is worth a look, but that's all. Set it on and then turn it off.
