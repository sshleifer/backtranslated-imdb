I do not know much about making movies, but good movies have to tell a story ... Your characters have to start and finish their journey. In Last Exit, Brooklyn may, but not in any satisfactory way, and I do not mean a happy ending, just EVERY ending. <br /> <br /> The last exit to Brooklyn takes place in Brooklyn in 1952. During a very brutal workers strike starts many plot lines. Most of them engage some of the most unusual characters that ever walk around the screen of the movie. But Last Exit to Brooklyn can not lead these stories to any conclusion ... leaves some of them endlessly or fires into some bizarre stratosphere for an "artistic" ending. <br /> <br /> Two boxes at the point, and contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> A sad transvestite (an important character in the film) is hit by a car and killed. And this is for him in the film .... he's gone for good, erased from the memory of everyone ... not the reactions of his friends, enemies, lovers ... nothing. <br /> <br /> In another thread, the stupid, unconscious and secretly homosexual leaders of the strike, after he was rejected by the workers, his gay lover and the bandits from the neighborhood learned about him. The final scene of the beating shows the streets of Brooklyn, and the street lamps are very, very similar to those of the Nazi death camps ... and the scene drags on and rolls and continues ... and the camera moves down to the body of a workers' leader and was crucified .. ... ppppuuuulllleeeeeez. And of course it was also for him ... erasing the brain ..... it disappeared. <br /> <br /> Bottom line ... no matter what reviewers in 1989 said about this movie ... This movie is a depressing piece of slime. Avoid this. And if you're not prejudiced, it really deserves to be rated NC-17 for huge amounts of physical, emotional and sexual brutality ... do not even let teenagers look.
