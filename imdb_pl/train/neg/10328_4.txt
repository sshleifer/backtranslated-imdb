I think the program had a pretty good idea for cooperation. But the execution was weak. The script is poor, and the acting is bad. There were many problems that could be presented in a better way, such as protesting against homosexual marriages or finding a cemetery. The performance can not be properly described as a comedy show because it lacks pitiful humor. I should say that this program has barely succeeded in the life of the Muslim community to some extent. <br /> <br /> Up to now, the second season is worse than the first one. I had great hopes for this concert, but I was a little disappointed. Nevertheless, I appreciate CBC for putting such a concept in front of viewers. In any case, I wish you good luck in the future.
