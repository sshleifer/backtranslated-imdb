Ira Levin's Broadway smash appears on the screen almost without meat on the bones, a mysterious plot with just a few tricks and twists, but no one is worth attention. Frustrated writer Michael Caine intrigues the theft of the genius work of a young man and passes it as his own; his cunning plan may include the murder of a talented kid who has the wonderful wife of Cain in his arms. The first act in which everyone is introduced is terribly dead, and Caine does everything an actor can do to keep up the pace. Dyan Cannon is a misunderstanding, because his wife (she's too clever and clever to be sent back as a ditz), and Christopher Reeve (in the middle of the movie) seems awkward as a better writer. These three characters and the distressing neighbor Irene Worth are so vague that what happens after setting up, barely registers, until the second act begins. Sidney Lumet's direction is stagy and fuzzy, the set design is unconvincing and poorly lit, and the finale is a total disaster. The actors try to give the script some content, but with such a thin material we only see their tedious efforts. * 1/2 of ****
