This is not a good movie. It's chaotic, the whole game is bad and has a lame story that you've seen a thousand times better than anywhere else. Not to mention that every feature point comes from a mile away. Worse, no one bothered to tell Lonette Mckee that he could not sing. But who cares, she is sooooo damn pretty. But digression, nothing new here. Eventually, a hot group of girls is taken advantage of, someone becomes addicted to drugs, someone becomes addicted to a guy, someone moves out of hell, and then terrible things happen. Surprise surprise. Welcome to the music industry. I can not believe that many people think it's a good movie. It seems that many of you want to use a movable scale to rate Black movies. I do not play it! If you want to support these movies, watching them - great! If you liked it - great! For each of his properties. But do not try to tell me that it was good. Pleeeease! I want color people not to pee in this type of movie just because they have black actors. Want to see a good African-American movie? See Love Jones. Radius. Or Purple. These would be great films regardless of the color of the actors' skin. Why? Because they told fascinating stories with great acting, which made you feel something long after you left the theater. Just because it's our experience does not make it a good movie. That's good - when it's good. Dot.
