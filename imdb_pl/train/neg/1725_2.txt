- The film starts with a meteor striking the lake. Without the local knowledge, the dinosaur's egg is also found at the bottom of the lake. Meteor heats the lake, turning it into a giant incubator. You guessed that the egg is hatching, releasing the dinosaur that terrorizes the community. <br /> <br /> - What a complete trash. It is not that I am disturbed by a clay dinosaur in time-lapse motion. Acting is terrible. Dialogue is completely ridiculous. Comical relief is not comical. Logic does not exist. Any resemblance between the "scientists" in this film and the real scientist is completely accidental. I could go on eternity about the bad aspects of this movie, but you have an idea. I feel it is quite safe to call this catastrophe "MST3K Worthy".
