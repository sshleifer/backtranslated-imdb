Summary: Ron is about to marry Mel. They are deeply and lovingly and confident that they are perfect for each other, even though they met only a few months ago. Todd, Ron's brother-in-law, is not so happy. He fears that marriage is a threat to his delicate work in the family business and decides to organize a bachelor party of Ron. But his real plan is to put Ron in a compromising situation, get evidence and break Ron and Mel. <br /> <br /> Comments: Presumably supposed to be a continuation of a comedy classic, but it is not funny at all. This is mainly a period of puberty and a youthful excuse to show scantily clad women. Actually, in a sense, it's almost impressive that many can be placed there because they are everywhere. Unfortunately, this is also one of the symptoms of the film, which can not be maintained. It just is not good enough. <br /> <br /> However, it has three buy-out points, or actually three actors that are worth a better script than this. It's the main actor, Josh Cooke, that gives the impression of common sense. I know Sara Foster has more talent than making movies, and Emanuelle Vaugier seems to have a lot more talent than the movie. <br /> <br /> What is suspicious is good jokes. In fact, bad jokes are also rare. It just is not funny. <br /> <br /> 3/10
