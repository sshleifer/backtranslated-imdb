And how she did it amazes me. The main character is an unbearable show, which is not funny at all. I can not stand this character. It's a stupid ass who has nothing to offer. <br /> <br /> This is the worst cartoon on the surface in the last 10 years, no joke. The plot lines are both badly written and made. The jokes are as bad as those on Disney's Sweet Life of Zack and Cody. I could not dislike this show, it is terrible and should be canceled. Even the cover song is bad. The title, even worse. <br /> <br /> It's like this series was written by a couple of 15-year-olds who have based themselves on themselves and think that they are hot things when they are simply arrogant and devoid of creativity and humor. <br /> <br /> Johnny Test, go far and quickly!
