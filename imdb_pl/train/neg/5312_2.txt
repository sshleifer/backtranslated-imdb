Usually terrible trash from director Fred Olen Ray about the cyborg hunter (Teagan) ordered by the Guardian Jan-Michael Vincent to find and kill the escapee from space Ross Hagen, who set the course to Earth. Soon, ranger John Phillip Law will have to protect a group of unbearable college kids headed by criminal Richard Wiley, who rode Hagen from his RV on a camping expedition. Soon, the cyborg would shoot one innocent drunk alcoholic doctor (Robert Quarry of the count Yorga-fame vampire) with a laser finger, proving that no one would be able to recover the skin of the condemned man whose collar is a tracking device that weakens his body. The law finds an ally in Leo Gordon, an old Vietnamese veterinarian with too many weapons hidden in his cabin. <br /> <br /> Maybe it has deliberately gone terribly, it is characteristic of fans of "rancid cinema". effects, acting and premise. At least the movie has PJ Soles for sweets for eyes ... even in '89, it was quite hot. This laser weapon is fun ... it can burn a few more houses when Cyborg shoots right, barely leaves marks on the shot location.
