Shaq played the genie. His name was Kazaam and he was beaten. His nursery rhymes were trivial, these lines were bad, stupid kid was crying over his stupid father, bad actor, bad casting, bad special effects. What's next? this movie sucks, Prolly has not earned 20 bucks, he lives in a boombox, no lamp hurts like a shrink like a wet stamp of food ... <br /> <br /> Yes, you understand, stupid rhyming gin who can act in a stupid movie with terrible special effects. Oh, and this is confusing as hell. I do not even intend to go further. Let's say it belongs to the category "so bad, fun". Watch it once with friends and make yourself laugh. But do not expect anything spectacular.
