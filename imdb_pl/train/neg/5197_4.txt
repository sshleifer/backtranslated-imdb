Weaker entry in the Bulldog Drummond series, with John Howard in the role. Usually funny jokes and antics, but not much plot. Barrymore has something to do as an inspector, changing disguises to follow Drummond, Algy and Tenny in a wild chase (mostly in circles, maybe the budget was more than usual) to save the poor Phyllis, who is being held captive by people who want to lure Drummond to his doom. For those who retain the result, Drummond plans to ask Phyllis to marry him, and Algy worries that he will not be baptizing the child. It's nice to see Algy and Tenny dress up as fishermen to blend in with The Angler's Rest, but few of them rise above stupidity.
