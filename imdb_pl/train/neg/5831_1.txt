This movie is boring and pretentious. There is only one good moment when the sailor is shaving Mr. Barney's eyebrows (I think purple is pretend without dinosaurs). The music is inexpressibly depressing - it is sad that Bjork, someone with such a large inner beauty, has been brought to pretentious falsehood in his art. The glamor of tea services makes the beautiful ritual seem foggy. mythology and culture are not respected in this film, they are abolished. Not only from Japanese culture, but from another filmmaker ... (be vigilant) At the perfect moment, "art imitates life", the ship's crew finds a gigantic piece of sh * t. This is what the viewers found in the theater. There are a few sets that are very composed and artistic without heart - then get ready for spoilers - I'm talking to you MR BARNEY. <br /> <br /> The Emperor has no clothes! Mr Barney, you have been fired! I saw HOLY GREECE by Jodorowski. And your thin, false BS veil has been raised. You stole your photos from your style and the ART ALL CATALOG. Now, when HOLY SAC is released, let's hope that the powers that will be on the World Council of Art STOP FINANCING! Poor Jodorowsky - lost in a financial battle with a Beatles lawyer, when he is a filmmaker of Lennon / McCartney. And by the way, when Jodorowsky is Beatles-YOU ARE THE MONKEES! Cheap thin, soulless skatek, like only easy, kitschy students of the first year. And BTW I am a filmmaker. If you are interested in a movie about reality - I fight you legally in the ring defending Jodorowsky, defending straight thievery.
