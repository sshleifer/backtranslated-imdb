I was not as surprised as many other reviewers. Sure, she has a couple of cute girls playing erotic, lesbian vampires. Marianne Morris and Anulka D. play these two lovely mermaids with sharp teeth that run to the cars on the road, on the way home (at dusk) and invite their victim ... hungry for men to go to the boudoir. What's going on ... well, after they strip and kiss each other, they kill their guests. Director Jose Ramon Larraz has some brilliance in his camera. Some scenes are very strange and effective, but sex alone does not hold the movie (no pun intended ... at least consciously). There are not many stories here. We have two girls. We were shown some inexplicable and unexplained origins, where we see them shot dead with a gun. Why? What does it mean "Why do we have a guy who stays for a few days, welcoming a guy at a hotel who insists he knows him from years ago? Does it have any purpose? Of course, I have even more general questions, what is a pair of nice looking girls doing like vampires in the English countryside and having a wine cellar from the Carpathian Mountains? In any case, the script is full of such flaws, it is also very rare in action except for the victims of fishing, wine and eating them (literally), and then we go to sleep in the crypt, and end up a little more juicy scenes, but it is anti-climatic. I said, some effective director scenes ... the way the girls dressed and were filmed in the woods in search of prey. The house is also the most impressive set. Both girls are like I said, very cute. Marianne Morris in particular stands out - in many ways. older film fans, a silent screen veteran, Bessie Love, have a short episode of the end of the movie.
