I am a big fan of B5, who caught up with me only at the end of the third season. I faithfully watched all the previous seasons when he was a consortium, stating that it was one of the best thought-out plot stories ever to hit television. Even sections of fillers were interesting. The films were also well-produced and as much fun as the cinema hit. <br /> <br /> Which leads us to the "River of Souls". Of course, after seeing everything, I had high expectations. Martin Sheen seems to be acting in the movie Ed Wood, not in a serious science fiction story. The story itself could look good in outline form and even reach the board. However, he suffers, of course, when it's time to complete this idea for a two-hour movie. There are no special effects that would keep us entertained with a complete lack of fascinating history. There are places where apparently there was no time and just improvised to fill the story. If it had become a regular season, this would be the worst episode.
