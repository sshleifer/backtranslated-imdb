... it was so that I could in a clear conscience tell everyone how scary this film is. I barely had time for twenty minutes before I started to think to myself, "Wow, this is very bad." And to be honest, I would give this film one star if it was not for Esai Morales (though he had very little time on the screen). He is the only well-played role in the film, which is a shame because I really like Gil Bellows ... or at least I thought so. <br /> <br /> Watching this, I started thinking about his role in "Shawshank Redemption" and realized that it was not as good as I thought. Problem: his action in a prison / tough guy seems like it's act, his dialogue sounded like he was making a very bad impression, did he ever meet someone who speaks like his character? I doubt it, but maybe he should. <br /> <br /> And to make matters worse, they managed to inject some prison philosophy and make it seem nothing more than imaginary, especially when you consider that rhetoric was pronounced by "rasta", whose accent was so strong that it seemed unnatural. <br /> <br /> Normally I would not flutter like that the movie, but when I saw the movie, it had a pretty good review, I felt like I was cheated and lied to, and I thought I should try and save someone unhappily watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I say BOOOOOOO ABOUT.
