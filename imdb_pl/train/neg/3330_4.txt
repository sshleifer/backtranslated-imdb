This movie contains o.k. the result and good result of David Muir as dr. Hackensteina. Initial and final subtitles show together with the majority of actors and "special effects" that it is a low-budget film. There is nothing in this movie that can not be found in other crazy scientist, horror / comedy or low-budget movies. It is also not unique for lovers of naked scenes or bad movie lovers. This movie is just here. Anne Ramsey and Phillis Diller are also not excited. If you are curious how I was and I can find it, you will understand the truth of the summary of one line.
