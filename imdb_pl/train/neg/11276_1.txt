I will not waste my time writing anything more about how every aspect of this movie is indescribably bad. This has been done in great detail many times already. The "plot" started as a very uninspiring bore-cockney / gangster-after-bored and very quickly fell into total chaos. Anyone who pretends to see some hidden masterpiece in this terrible mess just jokes. It's been 7 or 8 years since I watched it in the first week of the cinema work before it was downloaded, but it seems to me that it's the scariest movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I only make these comments, and the only reason I went to see this movie is the funny fact that my brother Eddie appeared in it as the second "heavy" on the pub scene. It was his hands that pushed the zippo lighter into Rhys Ifan's face at the bar in "Russia" (he was filmed in the former Butlins camp on Barry Island). My brother has absolutely no acting experience - he recently joined the add-on agency and it was his first part. After watching the film, it turned out that no one required any acting experience in it. <br /> <br /> I remember that there were about 8 people in the whole cinema - and it was only a few days after its release. I have never heard of another film that would be so unpopular and disappear so quickly - and rightly so. In case you would like to rent this movie on DVD, I would advise you to place two pound coins in a fire instead until they are warmed up to redness and then clamp them in the sockets. Probably it will be much less painful than watching a movie.
