There are a lot of handsome women in this movie. But unfortunately this movie is free from nakedness. Grrrrrrrrrr Strike one. <br /> <br /> Ahem. One story in this film takes place in 1971. So why the hell are the main characters leading Kia Sportage? Good morning? Continuity, anyone? <br /> <br /> As you probably know, this movie was released in stereoscopic 3D. And this is the most hideous effect I've ever seen. I'm not sure if someone bothered this task, but it was NOT 3D, only double vision smears. I did not have the same problem with other 3D films from this company, HUNTING SEASON and CAMP BLOOD. Of course, 3D in those sucks too, but with them I saw the appearance of a 3D effect. <br /> <br /> This is a big bullet of nothing. women played daughter irritating ear, yum! I would like to see her more. In films. It looks like Janet Margolin at a young age. Purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr <br /> <br />
