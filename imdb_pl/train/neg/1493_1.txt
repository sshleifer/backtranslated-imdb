I really do not understand how people made this film and thought it worthwhile to devote all the work they put into it. Even more puzzling are the people who watched the movie, not feeling cheated for 88 minutes of doing something worthwhile, like cleaning under the sofa or reading the Book of Priests. <br /> <br /> First of all, they could certainly find 2 real Irishmen and handsome women who could better present their lines than thrown, haggard porn stars sprinkled with this film. Yes, it's gonna work - but strangely, it's not as embarrassing as it might seem to see organs tearing out of the hot (formerly) tight bodies of porn stars left and right. It probably has something to do with the fact that after their terrifying, inhuman action, you just want them to die of pain. <br /> <br /> So if you do not care: <br /> <br. the film does not make sense unless you are as damaged as, of course, writers). <br /> <br /> - theme (Nothing you can learn from this movie, nothing to be afraid of in bed at night, nothing to contemplate or capture or explain to others). <br /> <br /> - soundtrack (Crap, crap, crap. Music as ordinary and boring as the script). <br /> <br /> - scenery (she could be a grace of this movie, but no ... nothing pleasant, even the rocks are false). <br /> <br /> Yes, yes. If you do not care about it, and you're just a horny teenager with bad taste in music and "women", this movie is for you. Positive comments: interesting photos, sometimes wasted on other items. Very realistic gore; wasted again. But the intestinal scene is classic. I agree with the mutant-debauchery solves the problem of a false accent.
