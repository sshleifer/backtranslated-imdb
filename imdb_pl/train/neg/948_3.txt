I tried to watch this program a few times, but for the show entitled "That '70s Show", I can not find much except a few hairstyles and sporadic disco references that actually recall the 70s in which I grew up. From the episodes I've seen, most of the stories and jokes can be set up in any period of time. Take away the novelty (apparently) set in the 70s, and the show is neither interesting nor entertaining. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a program that successfully represents the youth experience in America in the '70s, in my humble opinion, nothing better than' Wonderful years' can be done.
