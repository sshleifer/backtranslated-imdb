Unlike most other commentators, I deeply hate this series. <br /> <br /> It starts to look interesting, with mysterious aliens and gigantic robots, and I kept my hopes until the last episode. At the end I still did not understand what the alien attacks were about (maybe I missed something, who knows?) And I realized that I was sitting in 26 episodes consisting mainly of my own hatred of heroes, selfishness and self-pity. In fact, it changes between the fights of strangers / robots and those dark, depressing scenes in which one or more characters can just say or shout "I Hate Me / you / it" 10-12 times in a row. /> <br /> I really do not see either Shinji or Asuka (the two main characters) showing growth or change. (I do not see other learners or adolescents, for that matter.) I wanted to kick them and tell them to get a bloody life during the first episode, and that feeling did not change during the last episode. Shinji really has a kind of helpless hopelessness that makes people more angry than charitable, and Asuka is such an annoying knowledge that I wanted to break the TV screen every time it appeared in view. Oh, and more than anyone else, those two hate everything and often talk about it very much. <br /> <br /> I am also a big fan of anim√© and manga and I've never liked it so much. I read that the creator / writer of the series wrote this suffering from depression and I can believe it; it depressed me to watch it. Is this the goal of this series? I really ask. Is it intended to make the viewer confused and irritated? And if you suffer from depression, why do not you just write a book or a biography about it, instead of mixing it with strangers and mechs? This foreign war theme, as far as I know, leads to absolute emptiness. <br /> <br /> Finally, because I'm really fascinated by how many people say that they love this patchwork of blind stories, I can help, but I wonder how many of them actually think it's good, and how many say that it is because they were told that it is.
