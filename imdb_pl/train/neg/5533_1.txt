Before the release of the definitive species of the Night of the Living Dead genre George Romero, zombies were relatively well-bred creatures. In the old days, they had much better manners at the table. But apart from the social label, what thrills did these early zombies offer to the film audience? Judging by this movie, not at all. <br /> <br /> The story tells of an expedition to Cambodia, whose aim is to find and destroy the mystery of zombiefication. One of the parties reveals secrets on his own and builds his army of zombies. <br /> <br /> This movie is basically a love triangle with zombies. But considering it's a 30-year movie, the zombies are more like somnambulists than the meat-eating variety. It seems that they respond rather to mind control than to insatiable appetites. And, to be honest, "rebellion" is also a bit disappointing. The whole is really very boring. In addition to the lack of horror, there are no top melodramatic movies that could entertain us. It seems unlikely that it could provide much entertainment even 70 years ago. See if you have to see everything with the title "zombie", but otherwise I would advise you to skip this one.
