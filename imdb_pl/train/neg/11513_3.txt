* May contain spoilers * <br /> <br /> I leaned back to be honest with this movie. I knew that Madonna had performed. I knew that it lasted a whole week in theaters. I knew she had many bad opinions. I did not expect a deep and thoughtful study of class, culture and sexuality, as in the Italian original. The benefit of the doubt lasted for ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Madonna plays rich, pretentious Gorgona who goes on holiday with her husband and nonchalan friends (brunette is as mad as Madonna, showing some really stupid facial expressions). Adriano Giannini plays the first ship officer, whose character Madonna likes to humiliate and treat as dirt in every scene. Why is such a slut for him? Simply because the story requires that later, when both of them are trapped on a deserted Mediterranean island, the tables will be reversed and he will teach her the lesson. It's just as inexplicable how they fall in love, even though they have nothing to do with each other and abuse each other for two-thirds of the movie. <br /> <br /> "Swept Away" is a stupid, simplified, superficial movie from the beginning to the end. Madonna gives a typical wooden performance. There are many stupid scenes: Madonna sings and dances terribly at Giannini's request, a fantasy scene with Madonna and many scenes where she hits her and kicks her ass. Guy Ritchie performs his "stylish" edition, which is funny here. The film contains some of the worst dialogues I've heard in a big film for several years. The ending is unhappy and unbelievable. In principle, "The Blue Lagoon" meets with "Overboard", without the nakedness of the first and the sense of humor of the other. <br /> <br /> Maybe the Madonna's ego is so big that he insists on continuing to show himself as a competent actress. Please, give it to me, Madge, both for us and for you. But this is not her worst movie. This distinction still belongs to "Shanghai Surprise". She did nothing worse ... yet.
