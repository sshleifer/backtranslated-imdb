This movie is absolutely horrible, but sometimes it can be funny, although this humor is completely unintentional. <br /> <br /> The plot was ridiculous. I do not even think that a two-year-old would be convinced of the absurd idiocy, which the creators of the film tried to combine in history. On the other hand, some of the terrifyingly unpredictable twists of action give a lot of humor. For example: "Wow, Lady Hogbottom has a giant rocket hidden in her yard!" It gets worse (and even more fun), but I will save you. <br /> <br /> Acting is generally ridiculous. Most of the roles of children are charming, but not very reliable. On the other hand, Annie is very horrible. Adults do not take their roles seriously at all, but this is a good thing to a large extent. If they tried to be credible, the movie would be even worse. It is hard to imagine. <br /> <br /> Once you've exceeded the overall poor quality of the film, there are actually a few special moments almost un-shit. The scene in which the son of Lady Hogbottom escapes from the maid is surprisingly fun, although it is an annoying disappointment when the police catch them. The butler's character, although very small, is a ray of sunlight that almost, but never penetrates through the darkness. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie caused me physical pain. Nevertheless, there were several exchangeable parts that made it almost impossible to see without internal hemorrhage. Evaluating only its good parts, the film will be around 5; Unfortunately, the rest of the movie does not deserve 1. That's why I give it 3. <br /> <br /> It's quite generous, I would say.
