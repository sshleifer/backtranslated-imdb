This film concerns two former players, who are Fred Williamson (Mack Derringer) and Gary Busey (Lenny), who work as private eyes and meet all kinds of women and men with bad bases. His wife Vanity (Jennifer Derringer) comes to Macka Derringer and works on the phone. Jennifer is threatened by one interlocutor who wants to do her terrible things, and she asks for his help along with some other women. Mack and Lenny have more time and often go to Miami, Fl. golf courses or spending time in the sports bar, where various types of city events take place. There are many blows, killings and a lot of double-meaning words that completely bring this movie to ZERO. Do not waste your time, this movie cost me only 50 cents and that was too much.
