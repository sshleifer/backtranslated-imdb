Me and my friend rented this movie because it sounded really good. But we were wrong. First, acting ... wow ... acting was the worst, the effects were really bad, it seemed to be a movie made by a college kid. The plot was quite good, but it was made. What most ruined the films are the actors. The main guy was the worst actor in history ... I wish I even called him an actor ... The only good thing about this movie was that it was so bad it was fun ... so if you want to laugh, see this. ... but otherwise ... stay away from it. I usually love movies with letters B and such, but this one ... I do not know how it was transmitted to put them on video ... this is the worst I've seen ... and I've seen bad things.
