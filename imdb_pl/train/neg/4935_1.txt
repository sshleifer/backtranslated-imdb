"Cavemen" exceeded my expectations, not in a good way. It was even worse than I thought. Essentially, this is a show: Cavemen are an alternative race, they meet prejudices, etc. Perhaps the dumbest idea ever made; he almost deserves a prison time for writers. In one of the shows, cavemen entered the club, trying to pick up girls, and then nothing more happened. It was like listening to Andy Rooney's 22-minute dialogue, and then death by the knives to the steaks by dwarfish cannibals. For those who have not seen this show, here is an example dialog: "You are sure that you can go out with a caveman". "Yes alright. I already had 10,000! "Funny ... Probably the best I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 22 minutes of cavemen with horrible make-up, struggling with difficult social issues ... Sounds like a fun night. I also love how bad the latest ideas are that they resort to making comedy from car ads. I wonder if they will do the next Gecko so that I can have a new title for the worst show I've ever seen. I would even say that it is worse than "Viva Laughlin". At least "Viva Laughlin" was taken out of something that was somewhat inspired. <br /> <br /> Such shows make me hope that there is a comet to the Earth somewhere. <br /> <br /> (Honestly unacceptable ...)
