If he wanted to be precise, he should have chosen some of the natives of Frisco, not a group of actors from New York who know nothing about the free Sucka (not Sucker Free). I've lived in SF all my life and people do not talk or behave like the actors did. Everything was over-dramatized, and the only cat I saw from the Bay was JT Bigga Figga with his little episode as rapper. There is no shock that he was the only movie that really dressed like cats (eg T-shirt Warriors). I never noticed anyone wearing some giants or nine-seater equipment; instead, he mounted them in tacky SF or Oakland T-shirts that are not even sold here. HP does not have bowling alleys, blacks and Asian gangbangers do NOT wear heads or armbands with the colors of Africa or the Chinese Olympic team, nor do any Chinese gangsters wear Yao Ming shirts and try to sound black while shooting the hoop. What's more, while there is a significant yuppie community that has invaded the Mission, everything that has been shown is some white guy and self-proclaimed "100% West Coast Boriqua." This is NOT New York! Puerto Ricans are few here, and Hispanics in the Mission are very, very different from ONE, which was shown here, which was undoubtedly from New York. In addition, HP is not the only black district in the city. A thorough presentation would show the drama between HP sets in their own hood, as well as Fillmore, Sunnydale, Lakeview, etc. <br /> <br /> This film could be much better if Lee did more homework and had a better plot to work.
