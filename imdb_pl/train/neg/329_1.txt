First of all: I bought it in a video store. Second: I watched it. Third: It was boring. Fourth: it was not funny. Fifth, most of the antics were bad. And finally: not only a bad movie, it's a total fiasco. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of Adam Sandler despite this disappointing and forgotten movie. I felt sorry for him because it was his first film. Even if you're a big fan of Adam Sandler, do not worry about watching this movie. Instead, take a movie, go to the yacht and throw it overboard.
