Here is one that you can watch with a simple face, with a script so bad, even Will Ferrell would not be present in it. <br /> <br /> There are two laughs at HOT ROD. <br /> <br /> 1 The Punch-Dance. Rod "must go to his peaceful place" and before anyone tells Kevin Bacon, he is a supporter of the passionate, overpowered body for team strains, who wants them to have great Italian chops from Europe. > <br /> 2. John Farnham's You're The Voice. In one of those epic sequences in which the star and his cohorts make The Slomo Walk down Main Street, and the townfolk follow them in support, the soundtrack is a gag. How did the filmmakers even come across this Australian recording artist? A great Australian singer (and a real talent), who became famous in the early 1970s, including Raindrops Keep Fallin 'On My Head, and then disappeared in 1986 in The Big Comeback with You're The Voice, John Farnham's hymn is so charmingly tacky leveled the mountains in Switzerland. <br /> <br /> In addition to these two important points in the film - and so both ruined writing on the slippery scenery - the rest of the movie is like choking on someone's vomit. <br /> <br /> Andy Samberg is Rod, an unsuccessful stunt jumper who never jumped. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that he drives a moped into the very heart of darkness. Or his false mustache. Yes, someone actually thought it was fun. <br /> <br /> Without one jump under his starry streak, he plans a 15-bus extravaganza - which would surely kill a less evil comedian like Jason Biggs or Rob Schneider - win this day and save his stepfather and at the same time erase cancer and whatever ... Who is watching these films anyway? Along the way (as usual in the case of crete creations in these comedies), he gains a healthy cane (Isla Fisher), which must certainly be delayed to consider changing the chromosomes of the loser. <br /> <br /> Sissy Spacek (CARRIE, 1976) has so little to do that she almost called in her performance - then she changed her mind and hung up. Ian McShane had to lose the bet to be here.
