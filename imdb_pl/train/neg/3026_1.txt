presumably based on the life of Domino Harvey, who became a bounty hunter. I would say that 95% is fabricated. I always have an open mind when it comes to movies, but this movie lost its chances when it became obvious that it had a narrative throughout the movie, something I can not stand, and in addition the heroine of this story is so hateful and depicted as arrogant b ! I just wanted it to end up being shot in the head. it's too incoherent, too flashy and too boring, it's a story that seems ridiculous, and I really think that great directors have to make movies based on their own imagination or imagination, not on the basis of some unconscious snobbish brat.
