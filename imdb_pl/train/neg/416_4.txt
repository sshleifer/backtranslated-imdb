(some spoilers) - if you did not know how it would end <br /> <br /> My expectations for HOLLOW MAN were high. Very good advertisement, director like Paul Verhoeven and actors such as Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue, as well as a very interesting topic - invisibility. All the assumptions of the great film have been realized. Unfortunately, these things did not matter at all. The film was very week-long, without tension and terribly predictable. <br /> <br /> It's about a group of scientists who discovered invisibility. After successful tests on animals, Kevin Bacon decides to test them on himself. When invisible, he changes completely, realizing the benefits of invisibility. There is a very thin line from this to the murder. <br /> <br /> Hollow Man is a bad movie. He suffers from a disease that has many new films: special effects. From a difficult subject that could lead producers to a great tense psychological thriller, Verhoeven ruins everything, focusing only on special effects, without worrying about the real value of the film. I must admit that fx is amazing, probably the best I've seen since the Matrix, but that's not enough for the movie to be good. Actually, this is a problem with today's movies. Like Verhoeven, most directors only care about spectacular scenes - and nothing more. The exceptions are very few and probably the Matrix is ​​the only movie that combines perfectly great special effects and a great story. <br /> <br /> After Starship Troopers, Verhoeven fails again. Instead of a great movie, HM is cr * p. There are only 2 reasons why you can watch this movie: 1. special effects 2. a joke with Superman and Wonder Woman (I will not spoil this moment ...) <br /> <br /> Okay, so what went wrong with the movie? Everything. Let's see what I remember. <br /> <br /> --- It is not tight at all. It should be, but it is not. <br /> <br /> --- This is too predictable. You know from the beginning who will die and who will live. <br /> <br /> --- Instead of focusing on the psychological part, Verhoeven only cares about the effects. <br /> <br /> - - A lot of cliches. <br /> <br /> --- Of course, a bad man wakes up several times before he dies. <br /> <br /> --- As with any low quality horror movie, the first rule is to let the characters split as much as possible. Every time there is someone in the lab, the perfect victim for Bacon. <br /> <br /> --- Some holes in the storyline. Example: in the beginning, Bacon must scan his finger to enter the laboratory. After he is invisible, how can he do it? <br /> <br /> --- Ending: absolutely horrible. <br /> <br /> --- After Shue hits Bacon in the head, Bacon drops Earth. Then Shue and Brolin leave quietly and slowly, without looking back. Is it normal? Then Bacon gets up, attacks them, "kills" him again. And then Shue screams "I heard an explosion" (it happened a few minutes ago) and they suddenly fall inside. Had she not heard this explosion before? <br /> <br /> --- There is a scene in which you can see microphones hanging over the actors. Come on, Mr. Verhoeven, I was expecting a lot more from you! <br /> <br /> So it's about Hollow Man. What was supposed to be a great movie turned into a scam. <br /> <br /> Voting: 4 out of 10 (for special effects)
