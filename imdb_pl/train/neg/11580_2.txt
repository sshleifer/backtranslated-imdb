If you want to see the secret, do not watch it. Although there are elements straight from the territory of Elmore Leonard, this is closer to the episode of "Dynasty", because the filmmaker focuses on "character development" - ie. Long, boring conversations between stupid, non-engaging characters. Some people can create fascinating movies without real action (see "Exotica"), but not this one. Avoid this, especially if you like actors involved in this.
