Well, at first I was excited about downloading an animated open source movie that was ruined by a demo drum. The animation is great, lip synchronization is awful, and you're still watching the movie, hoping you'll understand what's going on, just to understand that nothing is happening. You do not feel emotions for the characters, which is a pity for the creators for wasting time. I saw short films with twice as much emotion in the middle of the time! It could have been an excellent short film, if only he would take the time to hire a real director. I am sure that everyone in Blender is excited about the possibility of presenting their software and rendering capabilities, but I'm sorry that what makes a movie is telling stories.
