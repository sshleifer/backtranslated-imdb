Again I took a chance and rented this shit bag. Announced as a horror movie, there was not a single scene, not even one that was even distant. NOT ONE!! There must have been nudity, but the whole lesbian action was getting old. I think it could have been the grace of this film? And Dan, what an annoying butt bag !! From the very beginning I knew that I was good at it when the first good Dan spoke first. And he was supposed to be intimidating? What a laugh !! All in all, this movie is terribly horrible! How the hell do you make such movies? If you want to have a movie with a few emotions, do not rent it. This movie is as exciting as Teletubbies.
