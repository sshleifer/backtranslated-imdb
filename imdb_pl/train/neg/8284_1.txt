Who wrote it? Some guy named John Cohen. I think it was the first scenario he was working on. Someone should tell him that you have to write a dialogue that sounds like something someone could say. <br /> <br /> And who directed it? Scott Marshal? Son of Gerry Marshall. My nut fell away from the tree. Someone might want to inform him that you can actually shoot a taxi scene in New York, and it will look real and you will not have to pretend to be a blue screen for a reason. He could also tell him that he should stay away from Jessica Simpson, but I hope he learned this lesson now. <br /> <br /> And Jessica Simpson ... naturally can not work. Hell, she makes Jessica Alba look like Audry Hepburn, and yet she's in this movie. OH wait, it was produced by her father. Okay, that's why she got a role. This is really the only reason I can think. <br /> <br /> So I should be surprised that it is wrong? No. Should I be surprised how bad it is? I think many people would do it if they saw the same as me. This means that you expect the movie with Jessica Simpson to be bad, but this ... it's not just bad, it's the opposite of the classic movie. Think of the great film by Woody Allen, this movie is just as bad as this movie is good. This is Anty-Annie Hall. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I did not pay to see it, I stopped watching ten minutes because I could not go on. No doubt I would have left the theater before. In fact, I wonder how many of the six people who saw it in the theater really remained and watched the whole thing. The film starts off badly, and then it is so bad that it becomes a kind of Chinese water torture. And then, when the first act ends, you realize that it will only get worse, and then you either have to go away or kill yourself. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this movie belongs to the category that it is so bad, it should be used at the entrance to the water in Guant√°namo Bay. Although some prefer a water deck.
