ANDY HARDY MEETS DEBUTANTE (1940) is the ninth (9) film from the series and shows the direction in which he was heading inevitably. Heroes ANDY HARDY (Mickey Rooney) and JUDGE HARDY (Lewis Stone) were to lead the way. The rest of the cast also wanted to hit the clock and collect checks. The series will be an opportunity again and will have their moments, but a fatal fall took place. <br /> <br /> Lewis Stone throughout the series would also continue to sympathize with the character of the Judge HARDY. The rest of the cast would be professional, though less and less. On the other hand, Mickey Rooney would continue his character, as if there was no learning curve. ANDY's reaction to each situation was na√Øve and unbelievable. Even after his return as a veteran of the service of World War II in Death of LOVE IN ANDY HARDY (1946) his reaction to the "storm with teapots" was the same, youthful. <br /> <br /> This is clearly illustrated in this video. ANDY falls into a few unbelievable situations that would be solved with a simple explanation. This typewriter on screen was known as the 'plot of the idiot'. The way of stretching a badly written scenario. Maybe it's less of the fault of Mickey Rooneys than the director and writers. Most likely, George B. Seitz directed one too much and a stronger hand was needed to control the Rooneys excesses. To see our review of the entire series, go to YOU'RE ONLY YOUNG ONCE (1937).
