I do not know what was missing here, but I can not believe all the positive comments from so many people in this film. I thought it was stupid and a bit over the top. I liked the performances of Gregg Henry and Michael Rooker, but others were just ... boring. <br /> <br /> Now I like B movies, really, but it was a bit further in the alphabet myself. I saw someone compare humor and horror to "Army Of Darkness" and "Shaun of the Dead", and also "Equally with The Re-Animator". You must joke. I did not consider this movie to be funny, tried, made an effort (probably too much effort), but in my opinion it did not work. Before I hit the third or fourth one, I rolled my eyes and checked my watch. <br /> <br /> A lot of tribute has been paid to several other films that are always a good inner joke for horror fans. But here can simply be the lack of original thoughts. It must be admitted that there were some cool special effects, good gore, but it can not carry the whole movie. Mutated Grant looked like the Jabby the Hut crossroads and in the early stages of the Chet mutation with "Weird Science" (after it was turned into a monster) and one of the alien creatures / children from "The Explorers". It just does not work. I thought it looked like something that could have designed a 5th grade child. Then there was Brenda, the woman whom Grant impregnated and caught in the barn. When the help finally arrived, she looked like a giant tick waiting to be fired. The project was once again unimaginable. A round, colorful balloon with a face in the middle. * ziewanie * <br /> <br /> Now about the zombie - the more movies I see with the zombies these days, the more I wish George A. Romero a patent on them and was the only writer / director who was allowed to make films about them. He's the only person who has done it so far, except for Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg (but it was a comedy). Oh, and Danny Boyle, but it was a different Zombie style. Maybe Mr. Romero ruined my zombie movie because of his ingenious ability to get actors to moan, moan and embarrass, as if their joints were dry and they missed even a drop of synovial fluid, and their muscles struggle with the effects of a severe death that began to appear before re-animation. The people at Wheels simply did not have the right motivation ... they were terrible zombies. <br /> <br /> I finally give "Slither" 3, for a few laughs and some nice gore scenes.
