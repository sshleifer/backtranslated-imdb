Acting, despite other reviews, was extremely well done. Brad Pitt copes well with the annoying, unbearable Austrian climber. Other activities are fine. History may have been riveting, but it somehow misses - it never really understands or cares about the characters shown, so a story that could be quite dramatic does not attract that audience. > Beautiful landscapes and photos, extremely dramatic real history, important events that shaped the world in which we live - but I could not, try as much as I can, get involved in this story. As an undisturbed fan of Brad Pitt (I consider him one of the top 5 actors of his generation), I expected * to love * this move - and yet he left me cold. I failed in myself, but I tend to point to the creative end of this film - direction, scenario, production, editing - somehow they lost me. It's a pity, because it could have been wonderful. <br /> <br /> Good acting, dramatic story, beautifully made - it should be great. There was no. It's probably worth a look to see for yourself - but do not expect too much, or maybe you will not be as disappointed as me. Mostly it bored me.
