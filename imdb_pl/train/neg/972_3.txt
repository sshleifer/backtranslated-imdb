It was a disappointing horror about a snotty young girl and her nightmares. When it comes to horror or "thriller" and noise, it's too tame. There are only a few tight moments here, not anywhere as close as it should be in the case of this genre. Even these "strained" scenes were not very much. Music made them more dramatic than they were. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of symbolism here, so elitist critics call it "the horror of a thinking person." Well, if they think about it, I'm sure they'll come to the same conclusion as me - a waste of money in the movie rental shop. <br /> <br /> Summary: a sifter that offers a dissimilar main character and generally poor acting. Hugely overrated and certainly not what is advertised.
