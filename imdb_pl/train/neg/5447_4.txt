Only the most ardent DORIS DAY fan could find this even bearable to watch. When you think about the wealth of material available for a story about the most famous blackout in New York, a movie that could deal with many real stories about what people had to deal with, rubs against the bottom of the barrel due to lack of originality story telling. <br /> <br /> Once again Doris is outraged because she suspects that she might have been compromised at night when the blackout occurred at night, when she returned to her apartment in Connecticut, took a sleeping potion and woke up with a man in the morning, who did the same by mistakenly entering the house. <br /> <br /> No one can save this mess - not Doris, no ROBERT MORSE, TERRY-THOMAS, PATRICK O'NEAL or LOLA ALBRIGHT. Directed by Hy Averback, it is the weakest vehicle in which Day was found, devoted to the film due to the machinations of her husband and unable to leave it. Detriment.
