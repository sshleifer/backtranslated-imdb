I usually do not comment (I read the opinions of others) ... but what I have to comment on ... I was convinced that I watch this movie by worlds like action, F-117 and other hi-tech stuff, but only for the first few minutes and changed my mind ... Poor actor, bad script and great science fiction. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... <br /> <br /> Just ... do not worry ... <br /> <br /> And one more thing , before each movie I usually check comments and ratings of users on this site ... 3.7 points and I give this movie a try, now I wonder WHO judges this movie, giving him more than 2 points ??????????
