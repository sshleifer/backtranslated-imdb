The final film by Ernst Lubitsch, produced by Otto Preminger after the premature death of Lubitsch during production, is a juggling act of sophistication and stupidity, romance and music, fantasies and costumes. In a nineteenth-century castle in southeastern Europe, the countess falls in love with his sworn enemy, the leader of the Hungarian rebellion; help her ancestor, whose painted picture comes alive magically. Betty Grable, in a long blond wig decorated with flowers, has never been more beautiful, and her songs are very pleasant. Unfortunately, this scenario (by Samson Raphaelson, taken from the operetta by Rudolf Schanzer and E. Welisch) is full of different ideas that can not engage or entertain. The results are nice but not absorbent. * 1/2 of ****
