Essentially, Cruel Intentions 2 is Cruel Intentions 1, again, only badly done. The story is exactly the same as the first (even some lines), with a few exceptions. The cast is more unknown and definitely less talented. Instead of being seductive and attracting me to watch, I ended up feeling dirty because it compares to watching porn with a soft core. I'm not sure if you blame some of the idiotic lines about actors or writers ... and I always disagree with it, because I know how hard it is to do both ... but that was basically a two-hour waste of my life. Literally, I am surprised that some films are made and that is no exception ... I can not believe that they will do the third one.
