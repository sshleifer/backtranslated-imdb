This film has such a small class compared to Strangers on the train, and even accidental meeting, because despite the plot similarities, I would not be right, comparing it with one of them. The character of Yancy Butler turned out to be such a stupid asshole. I was too embarrassed to see the screenwriter and director. <br /> <br /> I do not like many Lifetime movies, but I feel compelled to watch from time to time in the interest of promoting harmony at home. I often moan quietly, but this movie made me protest loudly, I got up from the room and walked around the house mumbling to myself before I returned to my favorite chair to undergo more torture. <br /> <br /> Dean Morgan, Rochester, NY
