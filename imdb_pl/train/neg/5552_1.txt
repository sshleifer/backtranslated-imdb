This program has interesting locations as fast as the travel channel. This is billed as reality, but in reality it is a pure soap opera with prime time. He tries to use exotic places as fa√ßades to lead people to a fake competition and then accosts viewers in the style of a soap opera. <br /> <br /> Also borrows from the beginner CBS game pioneer - Beat The Clock - inventing situations for his players to try and defeat. Then he rewards the winner. If they can vary this with a small interaction between characters, even better. While the format of the game is in slow motion compared to Beat The Clock - the real achievement of this series is escape from reality. <br /> <br /> This program contains elements of several types of successful programs from the past. Actual television, almost, but if you're addicted to players, a place or competition, this is your cup of tea. If not, the whole series is as I say, it drips with sauce. This is another show hiding behind the reality label, which is a trend started in 2000. <br /> <br /> It is slippery and well-made, so it may take some time. After all, the same as Gilligan's Island, Green Acres, The Beverly Hillbillies and The Brady Bunch. It simply does not employ professional actors. The level of intelligence is almost the same.
