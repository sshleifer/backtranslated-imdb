You believe in God or not. Believe in Jesus or not. You believe he is the Son of God, and you do not. The choice is yours. <br /> <br /> Director Denys Arcand really did everything he could to restore Jesus to the usual form, a social worker, the son of two people, and not the Son of God, Holy Spirit and Mary, who opened heaven again for us. Encouraging the Big Bang, the world comes from evolution, instead of seeing the beauty of creation. The film presents a theologian who brings certain "modern discoveries" to an actor who plays Jesus in the Passion who joyfully includes them in his game. <br /> <br /> Presented priest who runs a sanctuary in which he is a passion performance in Montreal has a sexual relationship with one of the women playing the Passion, instead of showing his love for God through celibacy. Often the director's disgust to the church is clearly visible. <br /> <br /> The director tried to make a parallel between the life of Jesus and the life of the actor of the Lord's Passion. This is an admirable rehearsal, but the presentation of the resurrection with the transplantation of the bodies of the actor of the Passion in other bodies means how the director thinks about Jesus. <br /> <br /> My opinion is not important, God's opinion is, but I would not like to lead the director and the actors standing before the throne of Jesus.
