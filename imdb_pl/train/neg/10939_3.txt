This movie has the worst acting I've ever seen! Some of the scenes are original, such as nails passing through the floor. This nail trap catches those bad guys. The rest of the movie gets worse over time. I can not believe that this movie is not even in the 100 best films of all time. I can not believe that there are sequels! The next movie that I want to watch is R.O.T.O.R. Can R.O.T.O.R really be much worse than this? <br /> <br />
