There is only one problem with this site, you can not give a negative rating. In addition, the partner rated it as a class D movie. I say it was too nice. A piece of wood could show more emotion that the actors in the film and the money used to make the film would be better used to start the fire. This is absolutely horrible, 2 hours of life, which anyone who endures this unjustified bath will never come back. After watching 5 minutes, I and the boys wondered if the sinking of heavy weights would make it all fun. In the middle of carton and bottle 151, I finally found a bit of this G genre that works remotely. It's an insult to the entire planet that the director thought that whoever could find something more beneficial would go and buy the rope. And for the actors in this movie, I hope you paid well, that you are in a joke, because I doubt you will ever work again. In conclusion, everyone in this movie is doing well when 100,000 and 12 evidence show your acting license.
