The Christmas mystery was advertised as a great movie, but I was really disappointed. They even sold copies of the VHS and DVD of the film, when it ended, which leads me to believe that the producers were really proud of this project. As a screen actor, I felt that most of the performances were telephoned, although Beau Bridges, like Nick, had a moment or two. If I was Richard Thomas, I would not put this movie on my other great CV. It was embarrassment. I was a fan of his Walton days, but I did not try to see any of his later works, so poor was the offer. <br /> <br /> In the defense of the actors, the director was rigid, mechanical and completely amateur. <br /> <br /> I hope that this is not considered a malicious review and negative assumptions about my qualifications as a critic. I turned on the movie because I had a good cast and I was prepared to enjoy the movie. However, I would like to challenge anyone who would watch this movie, and would not want a refund, even though it was on T.V.
