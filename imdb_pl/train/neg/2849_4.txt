The comparison between this movie and "The Last Detail" is made by some, but "Chasers" is more flat than the interstate highway in West Texas. And like the landscape in the desert, there is not much to distinguish, even the fact that this time the prisoner is being transported by two navy escorts. Nobody in the cast is going too well; with this bad script this is not surprising. Dennis Hopper, the director, will not sacrifice much of it, if you ever write a diary, I do not think so.
