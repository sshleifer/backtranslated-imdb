OK, this movie was made for one reason and only to MAKE MONEY! The producers obviously did not care about killing the classic horror movie. I knew that this movie would be sucked when it was pg-13, how many pg-13 videos turned out to be good? How to ask how many women were on the moon? The answer is NO! Prom Night 1980 was not a masterpiece, but it certainly deserves recognition for a film that remains true to its genre, and deosnt tries to be more than that. <br /> <br /> My problem with Prom night 2008 is the way I deal with the killer and I have three main problems with him .................... . <br /> <br /> 1) A way of escape, he was locked up in a psychiatric institute and escapes through the vent !! WHAT THE HELL? why should they have ventilation in the patients' room? Do they want them to feel comfortable during their stay? 2) His intentions are somewhat uncertain that the killer wants all the main families of the victims and friends to be dead so he can take her home, says he loves her, but in the next minute he tries to kill her, so he wants to kill her, love her or just rape her? 3) The killer is too good, how did he develop all his skills? He used to be a teacher, so in this one scene where he kills the main boy-victim, while he's basically on top of her, and she does not notice, it's all stupid 2 stars for 10 horrible, stupid, stupid horror trials
