I will try to use words to describe it .... <br /> <br /> I saw the original, which in its own way was good, but then I should have been afraid of the sequel. <br /> <br /> And "I was scared" when I chose it, but now that I've seen it, I have to say it's even worse than I thought. Why are these movies still making money, I'm still dizzy. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the actors who are not that good, but it must be said that some people make their heads just terrible. But what can an actor do with a script like this one. He tries to be a copy of the original only this time, when the places have changed, every form of the story has disappeared, and every attempt to invent something that has not been done before, fails miserably. In a futile attempt to upgrade, they try to raise excitement, using the whole theme of "big brother", which, however, has been worn down ages and offers nothing but a filler from the beginning and the end. An attempt was made to save the film, creating a lot of references to the original from '83, but it ended up being fun and sometimes a bit sad. In conclusion, if you have nothing and I do not mean anything to do ... go watch it or play Frisbee ... from DVD ... alone. This will give you the same amount of fun ... I promise
