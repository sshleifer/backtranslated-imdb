RATING STAR: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> This second part of the Che movie shifts history to the late 1960s when a man moved his resistance fighters to the hills of South America, experiencing without enough food and water, and tensions growing between the group. Everything comes to light when it crosses the border with Bolivia, and government forces intensify the campaign to bring it back. <br /> <br /> Without moving between the times and places of the last movie, the second part of Soderbergh focuses in action on the hills and manages to be even more boring experience. And more pretentiously, the score was drowned out, giving the second installment an unpleasant atmosphere of art that turns out to be equally alienated. In the film, which never gives up, there is an undisturbed boredom. You can not blame Soderbergh's ambition or Del Toro drive in the lead role, it's a pity that somewhere in production things have managed to take such a disappointing turn. **
