Not very impressed. It is difficult to offer any spoilers for this movie, because there is almost no development on the story. Everything becomes clear in the first ten minutes, and from there like watching dry paint. Acting also seems very weak and reminds me of old black and white films from the Maoist era shown occasionally on Chinese daily television. Although it is difficult to describe it as a woman, Yuwen, because history seems to require her only to walk like a wooden mannequin. It reminds me of the disappearing Gong Li star, which somehow gained the reputation of being a good actress in the West for a constant grimace on the face. <br /> <br /> Tian Zhuangzhuanga film "Blue Kite" was a much better movie. But do not be fooled by the fact that Spring in a small town was set in the late 1940s. Unlike Blue Kite, the fact that this movie takes place during a coup, it does not matter for the story itself, the ruins of the city seem to be nothing more than a stage background. <br /> <br /> I wonder if Tian Zhuangzhuang is simply trying to take advantage of the popularity of Chinese films in the West and turn to foreign audiences who can not distinguish a "beautiful" "deep" or "hypnotic" movie from a film that it is simply boring and irrelevant. <br /> <br /> If a movie matches the description of "overrated", that's it. I see no reason to stop worrying about the state of the Chinese film industry.
