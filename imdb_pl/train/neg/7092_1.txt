<br /> <br /> This movie (not a movie - clearly recorded on a cheap camera) may be one of the biggest cinema bombs stinking in history. Take care: the pack advertises the film as an erotic discovery of sex addiction. The film is not exploration of anything and is not more erotic than looking at your own warts. The scenario is pointless and revolves, and all the elements of the story serve as a segregation between the putative sex scenes. However, even sex scenes are lame lame lame. With the exception of the first, they have about three seconds (and again my version has been cut out) and comically enlarged. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a decent movie, you do not want it. If you're looking for exciting sex, you do not want it. Regardless of the goals, desires or prospects of your life, you do not want to watch this movie. How they got Rosanna Arquette, Natasha Kinski and Ed Begly to play this smelly bomb, it's mysterious.
