Rich ditzy Joan Winfield (unfortunate poorly staffed Bette Davis) is engaged to stupid selfish Allen Brice (Jack Carson looks lost). Her father (Eugene Palette) is determined to stop the marriage and was kidnapped by pilot Steve Collins (James Cagney.) Seriously. They break up in the desert and hate each other, but (sigh) they start to fall in love. <br /> <br /> It looks like the reviewers have high scores just because Cagney and Davis are in it. They were both genius actors, but they were known for the drama of NOT comedy, and this movie shows why! The screenplay is simply awful - there is not one real laugh in the whole movie. The joke in this is that Cagney and Davis fall into the first crab in the cactus (it's THREE TIME!). Only their significant talents save them from total humiliation. They both do everything in their power, with bad material. Cagney tries his best, and Davis squeaks with all his strength, but it does not work. Carson has this "hell" look at his face throughout the movie (probably because the emotions of his characters change in a few seconds). Only a palette with its characteristic voice and above the upper readings changes to evoke a few smiles. But overall, it was boring and carefree - a real job. He gets two stars only for the acting of Cagney and Davis and beautiful pictures, but in fact - it's not worth watching. Cagney and Davis hated the movie in later years and you can see why.
