This film is a calculated attempt to earn the success of sex in the city and four weddings and funerals. In fact, if they called it Sex at a Funeral, they could do better at the box office. <br /> <br /> But the movie falls between two stools and can not get up. Characters spew an incredibly bright dialog window, but they never work in any way remotely recognizable as a human being. One arbitrary, nonsensical action follows others to advance what speaks for the plot, and one soon gets tired of the falsehood of the whole enterprise. <br /> <br /> Andie MacDowell gets points for playing his little heart, but for the honorary achievements they were stolen by Imelda Staunton, as well as all police detectives (do they not have to grow there?). Mrs. Staunton seems unable to make a false move. Could we say the same about the writer-director. <br /> <br /> If Notting Hill would annoy you as a fake, stay away from it. Phonus bolognus on half-shell.
