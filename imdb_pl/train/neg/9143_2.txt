as an actor, I really like independent films, but this one is at best amateur. <br /> <br /> The boys are going to Vermont for civil service, but when the plane lands, it flies over the palm - were the executives aware of the palm trees are not in Vermont? Pines yes - hands are not. The same applies to the wedding service - again a nice palm grove. <br /> <br /> When the boys leave VT, they apparently could not get a ticket to any of the larger airlines because the filmed plane is Federal Express. Have they sent to the chest at night? Come along small details, such as the one that separates the indi movie from the completely amateur one. <br /> <br /> The Christian brother is far more gay than Arthur with his bleached hair and tribal band tattoo. Both should have changed roles. <br /> <br /> Smaller characters are funny and take on something terrible. <br /> <br /> Applause for directors for making a gay movie, but pay attention to your location and throwing it next time
