My interest in Dorothy Stratten caused me to buy this movie. Although he had great actors / actresses, there were too many threads that could be of interest. Plus it was not that interesting. The dialogue was stiff and confusing, and history simply turned too much to be credible. I was very disappointed with what I thought was one of Audrey Hepburn's recent films. I will always love John Ritter best in Slapstick. He was too pathetic here.
