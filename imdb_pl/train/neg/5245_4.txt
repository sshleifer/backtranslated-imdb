I am current A.S.L. Pupil and he was forced to watch this movie in class, and what came out of it, are glaring prejudices involved in the film. Of course, the film is leaning towards P.O.V. "Universal perception deaf" is not an indirect measure. In addition, the film did not mention or take into account other situations that are also discussed in this topic. IT MEANS. Deaf people who were born hearing and later became deaf. Is it good or bad in this case? The film is biased and practically everything in Deaf's opinion with a large "D". This does not mean that it is bad, but to make it a real documentary, you should try to be somewhat impartial.
