This review may contain several spoilers. <br /> <br /> The remake of the classic car film from 1974, Gone in 60 Seconds, starts well. It is actually well-preserved and the plot moves quite well. But even the big budget of Hollywood does not change the fact that the original plot was more credible. For those who do not know, the original conspiracy meant that the thieves worked as insurance inspectors. Who would suspect them. But even with the change of almost every aspect of H.B. The original of Halicki, remake is a very good movie, until we reach the final scene of the chase, part of the version 74, which made it great. This in this version is diluted, only 10 minutes, and its culmination is a special monster effect that removes all the credibility of the pursuit. Where the original pursuit was very credible, the star was a stuntman who did all his trick, the remake falls in the last 15 minutes. My advice, if you want to watch a classic chasing movie, refine the original in the container for bargains at the local rental company and stay away from the new remake.
