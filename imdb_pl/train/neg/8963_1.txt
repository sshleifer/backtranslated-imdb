The killings in this movie are not that bad, but it's definitely a movie. It's even worse. It is not even worth wearing that it can cause when you slide it into the DVD player. <br /> <br /> Even the wear it causes on your shoulders, moving it from the DVD store, not to mention money and the time you spend on renting and watching. Terrible. <br /> <br /> It is not understandable how anyone could say something positive about this film. It was my naked masochistic tendency that made me stop watching, add to the group pressure from my observers. <br /> <br /> The manuscript is terrible, the direction is even worse, and the acting is just plain despicable. <br /> <br /> I hope you do not perceive it as a spoiling game, I would rather treat it as an honest warning: Do not waste your time watching this trash!
