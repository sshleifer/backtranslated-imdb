Personally, I think that this program looks quite cheap. Some actors are horrible. They do it and they seem false. I can always say how it will end in the first 10 minutes or less watching, because it makes it so transparent. It is also not well written. I love to watch it. You know the saying, "Is it so bad that it is good?" This saying applies to this program. I also like to see if I'm right when I'm guessing how it all ends. I've always been right so far. It's like a little game I play. It's nice when you're bored and want to laugh at something.
