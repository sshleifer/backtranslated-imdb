Initially, the film looked great, they had set profiles of heroes ... the plot seemed to be heading in the right direction ... but as the film progressed it seemed that the director focused on the wrong things. ... or only a lot has been assembled from the film. The heroes' identities have changed in the movie for worse. Besides, there seemed to be many hidden meanings - in other words - they had things in the movie that did not fit the movie itself. And the title ... no, where the title fits the movie in the movie ... I suppose the title works for announcements ... The actors did well with what they had ... if they had a better director and writer, maybe That would be better. But it was not like that. So now there is a new scary movie that comes out Friday ... My opinion! .... do not waste time or money.
