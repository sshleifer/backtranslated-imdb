let's start with the statement that Robert Englund Doug Bradley and Melinda Clark should be praised for having to be involved with this piece of bullshit. I had to give it 1 so I would not give it zero. Do you want to know how bad this movie is? my mother calls me from all over the city and tells me: "son, I just watched the stupidest movie in history. I answered, saying: "a deadly language, huh? ", She was like, how do you know about it? such a bad movie. it looked like a good movie at the beginning of Freddy pinhead Melinda. OK, I'll give him a chance. I sat for the rest of the movie just because I wrote a column of horror movies. time money, and even brain cells in this funny shit run away, if you see him on the shelf in the Hollywood blockbuster video, and even in the local video store, turn it over and go away ... and I still want my two hours to come back
