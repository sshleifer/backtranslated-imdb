Priyadarshan - whenever someone heard his name, his first thought would be "comedy". This is what this man is known for, but rather known to. After giving amazing comedy hits, such as Hungama, Hera Pheri and Hunchul, his train slowly derailed in films such as Chupke Chupke and several others whose names I do not remember for the moment. Now with hideous movies like Dhol, the first word that comes to our minds after hearing his name - "torture". <br /> <br /> Dhol is a mixture of bad, uncomfortable toilet jokes, some drama, poor tension and idiocracy. The only good thing about Dhol was one or two scenes that were fun, though not witty, and second, except for Kunala Khemu and hysterical grandma, the acting was decent. <br /> <br /> Speaking of acting, I felt that Rajpal Yadav and Sharman Joshi were at the top (if you compare them with others in the movie), then came Tusshar Kapoor, then Tanushree and at the end of the two above-mentioned idiots. The disadvantage of Kunal Khemu was that he was loud in his jokes and even in acting. At first my grandmother looked like a ghost, and she was not funny at all, but rather stupid. <br /> <br /> The plot was the same, seen earlier. Four boys for girls and those who need money, but with a few twists and turns. There is a "bad" man who is ridiculously stupid and stupid. And finally good wins over the bad and everything is fine. The idea of ​​having Dhol with a tone full of cash is not simply witty. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about the movie is its length. After about an hour, you're exhausted and you want to leave the theater. But being a critic, it is my duty to tolerate the whole two and a half hours of film. The film lasts and the same kind of jokes is repeated over and over again, and situations are only eternal elsewhere. <br /> <br /> If your mother-in-law came to your home and starts to ridicule you of everything, then send her to this movie and have fun. 3 out of 10.
