This combined piece of feces adds so many absurd scenarios that in the end it is a laugh of absolute cheerfulness. It is a pity, because the premise is promising (as it often happens in Duhllywood), but in the hands of this scriptwriter enters the la la land. <br /> <br /> Lowe is in jail in time for DUI who killed his lover. We see that he has nightmares only to know that he feels really angry about it. Then his neighbor from the cell hangs himself. If he? Lowe has some suspicions, but he leaves them quickly. His suspicions are so weak that the bad ones have nothing to worry about. Why did they kill him then? Ah, that's where the story might be interesting. That's where he falls off the tracks, and when he gets off the rails, he decides he can run away from the viewers' attention to the next dull hour. <br /> <br /> ************ **** SPOILERS ************************* *** <br /> <br /> I will not be bored with an endless story of the irrationality of what follows, but consider this ending. Lowe was trapped by the bad guys on the train. They want to have a tape, because this tape will screw their boss and them. So three policemen arrive on the train, out of their pistols, ready to rescue Lowe. The bad guys are killing cops, half the passengers, then ... they're still chasing Lowe to get the tape. GOOD MORNING!!!! killing 3 cops in public will lead you to a deep spirit, to hell with tape. Despite this, they go through the shopping center, shooting at this place, as if the audience did not exist as witnesses, and finally Lowe gets caught, and the bad guy still wants the tape !!!
