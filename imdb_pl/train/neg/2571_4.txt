With Goldie Hawn and Peter Sellers in the film you can see that this one will not go wrong. But what can I say? It was a terrible mistake. The film tells about Peter Sellers as an older gentleman who suddenly found himself in a relationship with a really strange young, not to mention the attractive hippie at Goldie Hawn. The film is incredibly chaotic and I did not understand anything about it. Peter Sellers and Goldie Hawn are very funny people, but this movie does not prove this. <br /> <br /> This song about Arabella Cinderella is pretty cool, but that's all. I recommend this movie only to people who like to watch an extreme movie of novelties, it is almost one definition. I believe that this film more than anything else is a sign of the times when it comes to its specific experiment and around unconventionality, the problem is that quality is totally filmed and writing, not to mention the direction is just that. <br /> <br /> In particular, Peter Sellers is a very big hit, from Dr. Strangelove and Being There throughout his career, to stupid films like this and Magic Christian, which was very similar to the context and style, but this movie had some fun moments. This one is pointless and I'm sad that someone as great as Peter Sellers was in this movie. I do not recommend it to anyone.
