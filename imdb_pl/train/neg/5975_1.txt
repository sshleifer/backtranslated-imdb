I never wanted to watch this movie, then one day, for a joke, I watched it to see how bad it was; my prejudices have been confirmed. <br /> <br /> At the beginning I would like to challenge the film's policy. He hides behind the mask of women "making her big in the city," but the only way women can do this is to use their sexuality, not intelligence or skill. These women are nothing more than whores. Are slightly less attractive girls can not be successful? This is not the only right message of the film, there are hundreds of shots of American flags and huge money. A great example of how the only powerful thing in America is capitalism and everything that has a spiritual, moral or artistic value can not even be seen in this film. Money is presented as the only important thing for young people. <br /> <br /> The head of the bar claims that she does not allow the use of drugs in the bar, and then goes to the poor gallons of hard alcoholic beverages her own neck, and then sews her staff and clients. Anyone who knows something about drugs will know that alcohol can be as dangerous as heroin and more dangerous than most illegal drugs. <br /> <br /> And finally, why the scenes in which the main character is the sexual point. The interest of the audience (when she gets undressed or with her boyfriend) is her father always involved? We watch her undressing the camera virtually caressing her legs while she is calling her father. She "bids" her father, just as she "bids" her boyfriend. I find this the most strange. <br /> <br /> In summary, this film is immoral, fascist, degrading for women and, to be honest, disturbing. But what else do you expect from Jerry Bruckhiemer?
