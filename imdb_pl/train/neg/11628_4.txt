Wow you guys are too kind !!! Corny, Corny, Corny That's what I think about this movie. It started with a good idea, the guy (Edward Asner) escaped from prison dressed as Santa Claus, a group of kids found him and his true Santa Claus believe that False Santa encourages children to help him find a bag of stolen money. The movie is like the Christmas version of "Whistle in the Wind". The film begins well, but gradually Cheesier and Cheesier become so much so that at the end it becomes ridiculous and you simply can not take this movie seriously. For example, you get a Scrooge character called Sumner (Rene Auberjonois), who is a total Douchebag who treats his young son like a junk, treats his son so badly that he does not even buy him decent clothes, the poor kid wears jeans with holes! but a 45-second scene with Fake Santa visiting Sumner and at the end of the movie you get a guy who is happy, singing a carol and giving his neglected son a hug ... this is Corny ... I'm all for a good movie, especially during Christmas Nativity and I am a big fan of the seasonal television movie, but this one is too exaggerated for me, it's a shame because it started well, but the other half of the movie is a supernatural movie element that just does not fit the rest. This is not exactly bad, there are some solid acting, especially from children, but there are much better Christmas movies.
