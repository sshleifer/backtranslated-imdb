Dear Dear ... I! I had the strength to look through it ... But why ?! <br /> <br /> The first two films in which the game is good, actually a bit good. But it's so bad that we had problems seeing the whole thing. It was a tremor for children. I can not believe that this movie was made at all ... resembles props that come from some bad western (for kids) and they just did everything they could with it. <br /> <br /> Who is this film for? I can only think about 12-14 year olds. If you are more than 14 years old, you will have serious problems with this movie. It's not only slow, but so boring. The characters are overused (not just a bit) and so stereotypical that it's fun for a while ... but not long enough not to want to throw tomatoes on the screen. You also know everything that's going to happen, because yes ... you've seen this BILLION before in the children's show. I chose all the survivors and all fodder with trepidation when the character was introduced. It's so bad .. so bad ... so ... nonsense. <br /> <br /> But OK, we laughed from time to time. Not only in stupid conspiracies, but in some scenes worth repeating or two ... or one scene in which two trembling babies throw themselves at one of the obvious trembling boys from the feed. Play it over and over and laugh with all your heart. I'm still smiling when I think about it. But it only happened once again sadly ... and then the bandit "badass" appears and brilliantly breaks its part ... and one commentary "Growing out of the ground like DEMONIC TROUT!" At this point, we almost cry with laughter. But then ... nothing can be believed ... (?) .. so it's almost downhill. <br /> <br /> So here the peaks are demonic trout and they care. If anyone tells you that it's a good movie ... it's either a "plant", a vegetable, or someone very bad. This film must definitely be the worst shock. I can not wait to see Tremors 3, it will be a blockbuster in comparison ... it's ... * goosebump * no ... I will leave it.
