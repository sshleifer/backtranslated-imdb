... well, put it on DVD, waste an hour and a half of your life that you will never recover and find out. <br /> <br /> Acting? What works? <br /> <br /> Production values? ...Production? ... Values? <br /> <br /> History? Do not start me. <br /> <br /> After many years of publishing on IMDb, I never thought that I would see a movie so bad that I really wanted a lower rating than one. I have always seen at least one reason to see merit - even the intentions or efforts of a writer, director, cast or producer? <br /> <br /> In this case, I'm the same guy (!) who really has to deal with the fact, as you can see from the example of this worthless waste of videotape that he has no talent. My point is that a reasonable justification would be if it was the "production" of a junior high school student for his first cinema class, but the called "artist" behind the dredge player was twenty-six at the time of this miscarriage. <br /> <br /> How did this happen? Who in his right mind ever wrote a check? What's more, do not be fooled by the cover of the box: there is not even anything that remotely resembles a good sex scene or any good "exposure" of a piece on this cover. <br /> <br /> The last two things: there was one second when this "movie" had a buy-back value: the "talent" was rounded by his lover. Cheered! And I learned one thing from this "movie". There are times when something is so bad that it is really very fun. But not in any comic way; it's just sad. Very sad mood.
