When I talk about Malice as a film noir, I do not compare it to such masterpieces as Sunset Boulevard, Double Indemnity or The Maltese Falcon, nor compare director Becker to Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, Stanley Kramer or Luis Bunuel. I simply register a protest against the darkness that permeates this film from beginning to end, to the point that most of the time you simply can not understand what is happening. I understand darkness in night scenes, but this movie was dark even in broad daylight, why I do not understand. In reality, however, it would not matter if director Becker filmed him in complete darkness.
