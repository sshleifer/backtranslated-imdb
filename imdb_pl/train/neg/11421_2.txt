I will probably get a lot of money for the hatred of this movie - I guess I have not approached him with the proper jealous nostalgia of the generation before me. But suffice it to say - St Elmo's Fire was quite bizarre, even when it comes to Brother Pack movies. <br /> <br /> Here is another beautiful example of a satisfied neurosis, which is everything in the 80s (RENT, someone?). The story is virtually non-existent, and philosophies are at best bizarre, poorly provided for the rest of the time. The total lack of anything reminiscent of nice characters does not help the situation. There really was no growth, no moving forward. Even the climactic scene of suicide has been effectively neutralized, again refusing to let death or anything resembling reality or adult life. <br /> <br /> Each cookie cookie figurine simply makes you hate them in the darkest, most predictable way possible. Stalker is a creep for no apparent reason, except that he is a Stalker and Andie MacDowell is wonderful. Jackass does everything in his power to constantly remind him that he is, well, an asshole. Gorgeous Slut has a really spiritual, deep pain in a wild lifestyle. Poet tuned and desperate for a whole 3/4 of the movie until he can reveal (!) That he is full of teddy bears, sun and rainbow. The Virgin finally becomes a whole, a happy human being, after he wants every Virgin one hot storm in a sack with Jackassi, before he rejects her, that he really change (this time really). The Cheating Bastard cheats until it's time to catch him. Finally, the Feminist is washing the holy water of every soul who says "commitment". <br /> <br /> What brings me back to the last beef - what bond of super cement kept these people as friends? I can not imagine being with one of them. Now think about the vortex created by all this narcissism focused in one measure. And everyone was so terrible for each other - in toilets, near rape and sleeping with everrrryone. Cherry was after the two BFF behaved like total baboons after screwing feminin, she is like "umm, I do not want to be with any of you anymore, let's be friends! And we can spend time in a completely unconscious way every day knowing that I can connect with one or the other at any time, but neither of you is satisfactory enough (NOT THIS WORD!) And everyone smiles as if to say, "Shit, I never thought about it! What a great idea! "<br /> <br /> Only not. Just as I do not watch this movie.
