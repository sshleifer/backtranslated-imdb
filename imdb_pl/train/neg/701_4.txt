During the Christmas break, a group of friends from the university stays to help prepare dorms for dismantling and replacing with apartment buildings. For the song to be a bit more difficult, murderous, wearing Chuck psycho wanders around the halls of the dormitory, feeding on the group in various brutal ways. <br /> <br /> Registered as one of the 74 video films "The Dorm exchanged by Great Britain in the 1980s, who dripped blood, gained a good reputation before the first viewing. The term "nasty video" brings to mind some great pictures, violence, sex, etc.: All the things that a fan of horror dreams about. So, after hearing all this information, I decided on Pranks (title alt.) Expecting a seedy experience. . . and that's what it was trying to be, but it failed completely. Visually, the movie is not great. Cinematography, gore (except for a few scenes) and general direction fail. It's just not nice to watch. The original script is missing and often throws random things for no real reason (such as opening kills). There are some nice scenes of death, including a pretty good melting of the face (which you can see on the poster), but that's all for the positive. Acting is very bad, the story does not seem to matter, the killer is not cool or frightening, and suffers from one major mistake that every sloppy move should always avoid: it's a bit boring. In general, for a movie made by several UCLA students for $ 90,000 (which would be more than twice as many as today), The Dorm That Dripped Blood is not a complete mess. He has a few good things and is quite worth seeing. . . But as a more modest movie that wants to be at the level of movies like The House on Sorority Row and Pieces. . . it just can not match. Do not expect too much, or at least you can have fun. I hate to say it, but it's one of the few movies I've seen that would be better with the remake. . . and yet they go after great works, such as Black Christmas. Well. . . <br /> <br /> Obligatory elements of the horror: <br /> <br /> - Subgroup: Slasher <br /> <br /> - Violence / Gore: There are some brutally killed homicides, and the gore is fine by the bigger Hello. . . but nothing special. In addition, they screened some of the best murders. <br /> <br /> - Sex / Nudity: There is some unpleasant (for me) nakedness, but not really. <br /> <br /> - Cool Killer (s): No. The final monologue (s) of the killer made him quite uninteresting. <br /> <br /> - Horror / suspension: fear of jump or two, but nothing too effective. <br /> <br /> - Mystery: I suppose it was, but I just did not care and it was as obvious as the killer's face. <br /> <br /> - - - <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 3.75 / 10. Bah! Humbug! <br /> <br /> -AP3-
