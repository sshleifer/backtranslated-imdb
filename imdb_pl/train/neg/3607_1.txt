I'm starting this review from a giant giant spoiler about this movie. Do not read further ... here comes, turn your eyes away! The main character, a girl who always experiences in other movies, is murdered here. That's where I saved you 79 minutes of your life. <br /> <br /> This is one of those cheap movies that have been collected in the middle of the 80s slasher era. Despite killing the heroine, it is simply not the best garbage. <br /> <br /> Both priests and students get bad rap here. They are portrayed as exaggerated, sociopathic morons who have too many internal problems to cope with life reminiscent of life on the junior campus ... and students even worse. <br /> <br /> "Splatter University" just drop into a VCR when you have nothing better to do, although I suggest you watch your cleaner tape, which would be more fun. <br /> <br /> This is rated (R) for strong physical violence, gore, profanity, very short nudity of women and sexual references. <br /> <br />
