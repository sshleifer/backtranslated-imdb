I love all of Tom Robbins' books, so I was very excited and interested in watching a film made after one of his books. I knew that the movie would not be able to capture even half of Robbins' magic, but after watching the movie, I never wanted to read the book again. Film Even the Get the Blues cowgirl does not contain the eighth contents of the book and it seems that it focuses more on the love between Bonanza Jellybean and Sissy than anything else. In addition to the incredibly weak plot line in the film, I think that better actors could definitely be chosen to play the character. The only actors in the movie that I thought were playing roles matching Robbins' descriptions in the book were Julian's friends in a five-minute clip at the beginning of the movie. The one who has not read the book can enjoy the movie, but as a big fan of Tom Robbins, this movie was just a disappointment.
