My friend's mom worked in a video store and had to watch movies before they appeared, so when she brought The Convent, horror, home, I could not wait to see him. Given that it's going to be frightening, but it's actually funny, I can say that I like this movie in some strange way. <br /> <br /> Yes, acting is bad, and yes, it's the cheapest movie I've ever seen, but it's so damn funny! "WHAT ARE YOU CAINING CA-RACK ?!" I did not know that even this movie was ever released ... I came to the conclusion that it was too bad ... <br /> <br /> Yes, so ... overall the movie is pretty bad (you have to admit it at least), but I promise you that you'll laugh at it. <br /> <br /> * this movie sucks, but it's good for a laugh ... especially for a guy who holds a "dagger of despair" ... THE DAGGER OF DESPAAAAAAAIR!
