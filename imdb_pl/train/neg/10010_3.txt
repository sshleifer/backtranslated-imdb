The plot is not worth discussing, even if it points to corruption, murder, power and other topics related to the thriller. Characters are sometimes interesting. Not realistic, but interesting. <br /> <br /> Development is slow as a tea ceremony. Visualizations not stunning, but good enough to relieve eye strain. A good movie to watch after dinner before going to sleep - nothing shocking too much, nothing exciting. The style of film sitcoms. <br /> <br /> I liked Woody - excellent performance. He had to fight the imperfection of the plot and did the job quite well. The rest is bearable, though very predictable. The whole is watched and better than most television programs.
