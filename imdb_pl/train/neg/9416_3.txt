Steve McQueen certainly has many loyal fans. He was certainly a charismatic guy, one of the most charismatic people he'd ever known a big screen. But even McQueen can not save this turkey from the movie, shot with what looks like a camera in real locations in St. Louis. <br /> <br /> McQueen is a new kid who has not been included in the criminal plan of a bank robbery by one of the other gangs. There is more than a broad indication that there is a homosexual relationship between young Steve and David Clarke. The other members of the band do not like him, mainly due to the lack of a criminal resumption. <br /> <br /> Steve also has a friend in Molly McCarthy and suspects something is happening, especially when he starts to shoot with Crahan Denton and James Dukes, and with Clarke, some pretty rough characters. That would certainly raise my suspicions. <br /> <br /> Big bank robbery in St. Louis had two directors, Charles Guggenheim and John Stix. Guggenheim mainly made documentaries, and Stix did little. One of these two jokers found that Steve's performance best served the bad imitation of Marlon Brando. <br /> <br /> This movie may worsen as the worst Steve McQueen ever did. I'm willing to bet that Dick Powell and Four Star Productions have already signed a contract with Wanted Dead or Alive because I can not believe they would have it if they saw it. <br /> <br /> Or they would see something society would overlook, except for the turkey dressing.
