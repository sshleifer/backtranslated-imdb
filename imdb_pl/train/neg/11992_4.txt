I have never read Gary Paulsen's novel "Hatchet", for which "A Cry in the Wild" is an adaptation, so I can not make any comparisons with the book. I will say, however, that as a film in itself, adaptation or without adaptation, it was an underdeveloped adventure that does not explain many of its characters. <br /> <br /> Think of "A Cry in the Wild" as a less luxurious, teenage mountaineer (or Quincy, California is the only place where you filmed?) "Cast Away" version. Jared Rushton is 13-year-old Brian Roebson, a kid who went to a small plane to visit his father until the ship crashed on deserted mountain terrain, leaving the child left for a long while and forced to defend. > <br /> There are three parts of the movie. It is obvious to introduce ten or fifteen minutes of character, namely Brian and his mother. <br /> <br /> The next third part of the movie (which really absorbs almost the entire movie) is Brian "rough". These scenes do not contain a particularly amazing action, nothing spectacular except a lot of beautiful pictures of the beautiful landscape of the Yukon. There is nothing that can cool you, no real encounters (except for a quick confrontation with the cub) and no major dilemmas to initiate any pleasure or connection with the character on the screen. You may even feel bored with the passage of time when we are witnessing how Brian deals with his situation through the first, primitive means and then improved (with the help of tools, etc.) for his survival. It's more of the usual time that passes if you're really stuck in a situation, and that's almost about it. In other words, they did not translate Paulsen's words when they translated them into visual media. <br /> <br /> And of course, the third part of the movie is his rescue. <br /> <br /> However, there is a subplot that constantly tries to reveal at this time. Some conflict between Brian and his parents who created a rocky, awkward relationship between them. However, in most cases this is only explained in short, intermittent, minimal dialog flashbacks that look more like a historical tale for a music video. At any moment, the singer from Jefferson Starship should start singing "Sarah". In addition to what the viewer may have the implications or guessing for the need to fill the gaps in the narrative, we get a very underdeveloped story that was probably necessary to enjoy at least part of the movie and create a connection with the characters, regardless of whether it really it's something to do with Brian's adventure in the third part of the movie. These are the disadvantages of the narrative that the viewer is watching in stupor when he tries to figure out what the hell people are doing on the screen, and for me they almost finished shouting on TV to say something and tell me more! <br /> <br /> It certainly was not a good adventure story for me. But for fans of Jared Rushton, it was one of the last movies he made. So, watch it only for nostalgia, if nothing else.
