Jason Lee's pecks is back! If you're looking for it, look no further. If not, go ahead ... <br /> <br /> But about the movie. Clich√©s galore, some poorly shot but a bit exotic fighting scenes (used JKD) and many bad acting and cheap effects. Poor Lee looks like he suffered through the whole movie and no wonder. This is not a pleasant return. <br /> <br /> The movie does not even cut it off as a B movie - it was definitely a rude, pale, blond-haired Rutger, but there is not a free sex scene, or even a single shot of loot. No. ZIP. Nada. Even in Starship Troopers 2, they had common sense to turn mandatory nudity scenes (as with all my comments on this great piece of classic cinema, please check out our upcoming review of this amazing sequel ...). I had the impression that the writer took revenge on someone for that reason - that's why I do not enter the "plot" of the film or anything else. Except that he had some non-heterosexual undertones, so "nuff said. <br /> <br /> However, this movie has one thing to do - not Jean-Claude :)
