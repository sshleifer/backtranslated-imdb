I saw it last evening at the Midnight Slam Festival des films du Monde in Montreal. What a disappointment. This video is explicitly rated by IMDb fans. Acting was only regular. Directing did not bring anything new or interesting. The plot is very poor: the film tells about those graduates of higher education and the game they play, causing jokes (seventy-five). In addition, you can predict the end of the movie in the first five minutes. If you like jokes and slash with an ax that makes you jump only once or twice during the entire movie, you might like it. If not, this movie is not worth it.
