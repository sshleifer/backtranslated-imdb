Oh, yes, in the 1980s, in the days of Reaganomica and Sly, Chuck and many other action stars hiding in the distant jungle, blowing the communists. At that time, I could not believe how films such as RAMBO, MISSING IN ACTION and UNCOMMON VALOR (and who can forget about the funny RED WITTLE?) They made money at the box office, they are disgusting because they do not play well the agenda of wings and they meet very badly . WAR TROMA`S is a furious look at this type of films, but you must ask yourself if they need falsification at all? Of course not . TROMA`S WAR does not have any sophistication - although it indicates that there is no real difference between right-wing tyrants and leftists - and sometimes more like a movie of a class than sending. Maybe it is?
