I read a running man from Kings books, just like Bachman and I felt to be the main character of John and his family. This movie could have been SO much. Problem? He was set during madness in a big action movie. I watched the movie and felt pain throughout the whole affair. I felt nothing for the characters and less for his case. Yes, he had funny scenes (or laughter), though I think he did not save the movie in my eyes. If you read a book, you will feel the culmination and fire in John's heart when he gets his last revenge. <br /> <br /> I gave the film a small number. Maybe it was not so low if I did not read the book.
