Cradle of Fear <br /> <br /> This is not a movie in which intricate delicate narrative nuances occupy our attention. This is not a movie in which special effects are supposed to leave us motionless, uttering the sense of whoa. However, this is a piece of gothic horror lo-fi that leaves little imagination, created in the eyes of director Alex Chandon, as "a return to the obscure horror of the 70s and 80s." <br /> <br /> This is a very intuitive experience for 2 hours, where the four lines of the story are connected by a lot of watery blood, the risk of fragmented parts of the body and guts, bound by intestinal revenge. <br /> <br /> The provider of such frightening violence is Dani Filth, the lead vocalist of the metal band Cradle of Filth, playing the role he was intended for. <br /> <br /> As others have said, there is nothing new in wanting to do occult revenge. In this particular context, the condemned sexual predator and murderer, Kemper, the father of our devil angel-revenge, forces his son to exact punishment of those who are somehow connected with condemning him to purgatory in a mad hospital. <br /> <Br /> What provides Chandon, who should be congratulated also on writing and editing this song, is an opportunity to free the sick mind. It seems that he enjoys the idea of ​​splashing blood on the openings of those on the screen and to every nook and cranny that can be reached. We are also treated to zoom in on the crushed skull, demonic rape and other various images to engage those who like to approach their horror. And for some of those who are closely following this type of video, there is a strange sequence in which you can think, "Did I just see what I thought I did," because of course Pretty Woman is "no". It reminds me of some of the gore-fests created from the Italian horror some 20-30 years ago and many other works in which the disgusting images have left their mark, but not the context in which they were viewed. <br /> <Br /> The history of the 4th set is particularly intriguing when the idea of ​​obsession can ultimately lead to death in the pursuit of violence on the Internet through the "Sick Room", where the user controls how to put out his life. The next thank you should also include the booming soundtrack, which allows Filth to practice his talent during the day and the effective use of drums and bass, often overlooked in making movies as a real form of supporting visual effects. The use of the city of London as a background with real people, in contrast to film stand-ups, also adds support for commando film. OK, classic may not be, but blood, guts, intestines, occults and demons in a somewhat perverse, trouble-free way.
