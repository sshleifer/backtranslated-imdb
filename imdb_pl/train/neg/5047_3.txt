I really did not want to comment, but I thought I had something to say. I saw this movie two days ago and although I think it is not a complete waste of time (although it may be money for producers), it is obvious that it has serious problems. He has really good photos and (a little, but) cool music. Much has been said about Ana Cristina Oliveira, but let's be honest about what? She is not really an actress and she balances permanently between excessive acting and absurd retardence. Her performance is gone for good, because there has never been anyone like Odete in any other movie: crazy? sad? childish? fraud? no one knows, guys. So she dictates the rules a little here. <br /> <br /> I thought that this movie was also a good example of a problem that most of the Portuguese films suffer from: the soundtrack. In the case of dubbing there is a constant NO, and the result is the usual mass of noise that comes out of the blue. People in other countries may think that Portugal is the loudest place. However, what fascinated me was the fact that some of the dialogues were named, but this did not necessarily solve the syndrome. I must also admit that I have dubbed badly. It is strange to watch a movie in which the first thing that strikes me in the first scene when the first character speaks is: it's dubbed. And all this to say that the film has technical problems. <br /> <br /> Also has problems with scripts. Trying to be classic from the first to the last scene. There was a desperate fear of leaving things hanging and it shows. The writer apparently tried to get everything straight, but he does it ... it shows !! All dialogues are too clear and there is not a single piece of conversation that sounds like a line from a movie. Everything is a bit harsh and a bit unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Not that the movie was total, I have to stress. I think that good parties are so obvious that I prefer to focus on the bad guys. <br /> <br /> The direction brings a little to a poor scenario. All shots are classic and non-innovative, but they are beautiful. Great job Rui Po√ßas, by the way. <br /> <br /> Now, I think it was a problem that keeps people from believing in this story and laughs through the whole movie instead of taking it seriously: a guy who plays a guy who DIES is obviously not an actor. Actually, it's rather an important role and I do not see the reason why the actors are cast in such parts. This guy is not an actor or a handsome man. Which means that the whole movie goes downhill because we do not believe for a moment that this beautiful woman is obsessed with him, even though he is not there, and his hunky lover who survives has a bad time to defeat We see that this figure is apathy. Detriment. The world is full of beautiful people who are even nice, seductive lovers. The world is full of good actors who are also cute boys and can be obsessed with people after they leave. The world is full of great movies, and not great movies. C'est la vie!
