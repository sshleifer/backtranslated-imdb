Young people get a bad hair day, go up the hill and run into a place where they can not escape. Then he meets MR. ATLAS, a "mythological" guy from 2,000 years ago, as his best friend, and looking just like Arnold Schwarzenegger. His Hercules strength helps the boy escape danger and later he adapts to modern life. So what's going on? This is the worst idea for a "family" trip! Either way, it really should not be taken, really! Our fictional form of power and fuss is nothing but a typical stranger who seems ordinary to the rest of the universe. Adding to blasphemy is a lack of something new or attractive, and before you know it, there is an attempt of violence that does not qualify him as "family" entertainment. The scene in which Atlas complains about his T-shirts is, however, reflexive. Just spend a nice, quiet afternoon in the park for a change.
