I do not often watch a movie as horrible as this one. I continued to look at it every minute, hoping it was a joke, only to say that it was to be taken seriously. Well, as seriously as the genre requires. <br /> <br /> Acting was disgraceful, and situations were horribly invented and banal. If the film was made in 1920 (For example) and it had the quality of Hide & Seek (Cord) in its direction, we would think that the cinema was na√Øve at that time. It just so happens that this movie was made in 2000, and I have not seen a movie of a silent era that has such a small charm as this one. <br /> <br /> Definitely not for a serious film viewer. <Br /> <br /> [Not worth the assessment]
