The premise of the film is that the son of Thomas Archer was murdered and his wife was brutally wounded - and has a chance of revenge when (after treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder) he is placed in a room with a man tied to a chair and said he is the perpetrator. He receives a large table of tools with which he can offer a retribution: exercises, bats, nails, hammers, torches, whatever one might think that someone might want to use to physically hurt another human being. <br /> <br /> Too many scenes of torture before we find out that The Man Archer is torturing, not the man who committed the crime. Then they form an uncomfortable alliance; who put them in this situation and why. <br /> <br /> Well, when everything is said and done, we do not care ...
