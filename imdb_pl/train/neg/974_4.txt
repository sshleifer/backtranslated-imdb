This movie sounded as if it was funny and interesting from its description. But for me it was a bit disappointed. Very slow and difficult to follow and see what is happening. It looked as if the director took individual pieces of the film and threw them in the air and ordered them to be combined in any way (certainly not in order). Nothing was filmed either. I watched several different Korean films and noticed that a good part is well done and requires thinking in the part of the viewer, which is different from a typical Hollywood movie. But this one did not give me an end. I watched the movie for the second and third time and still did nothing for me. I still do not understand what the director tried to convey. If only to show the typical mundane part of a person's life, he probably succeeded. But I was looking for more. I do not have to add that I can not recommend this movie to anyone.
