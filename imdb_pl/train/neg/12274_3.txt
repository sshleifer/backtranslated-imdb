I usually do not say that the movie is not worth watching, but it is certainly a mitigating factor. The only real advantage of this film is Cornelia Sharpe, which looks rather attractive, and the fact that this movie is REALLY short. <br /> <br /> The plot in the film is incredibly boring and nowhere appears in the whole movie. None of the characters is so interesting and there is no reason to care about anyone. I'm not sure why on land Sean Connery agreed to do this movie, but he should definitely pass this movie. <br /> <br /> The only reason I could see this movie is death-Hard Sean Connery, a fan and you just want to see everything he did. Keep this one last. <br /> <br /> Well, if for some miracle you see it despite my review (or any other review on this page), I hope you enjoy it more than I did. Thank you for reading.
