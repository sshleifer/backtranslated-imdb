A really bad movie, with some good moments or features. <br /> <br /> It starts with a pregnant Linda Blair, who runs down the hall to escape from monsters or people with a pitchfork, I'm uncertain. He jumps out of the window and wakes up, and we can see she is pregnant. The degree in which she is pregnant varies widely throughout the film. <br /> <br /> She and an annoying and probably delayed little boy who thought her son was traveling to an abandoned hotel on the island. Italian horror directors consider the most annoying boys for their videos! David Hasselhoff and his German-speaking virgin are already on the island (you know how it is said that Germany loves Hasselhoff ...). He takes pictures, and I think he translates the esoteric German book on witches. <br /> <br /> Also, the trip to the island is the older couple who bought it, and the real estate agent and the woman I thought was their daughter. Apparently she was an architect, and Linda Blair and a boy are children of an older couple. I think they all traveled to the island together, but it seemed that Linda and the boy were separated from the rest (perhaps they were filmed separately). <br /> <br /> The hotel seems clean, certainly outside, but is not used to any great effect. An old woman with bad makeup and a black cloak still appears to the boy and sometimes chants something in German, which he eventually records on his recorder Sesame Street. <br /> <br /> People start dying, either in their dreams or sucked into hell or something like that. Some of these scenes are fine, but not enough to recommend a movie. Although the copy I was watching stated that it was not on the cover of the box, the death of one person whose veins they explode seems to be cut out. A significant part of the scene shows the arrows of the reaction of another character, because we can not see anything alone. The scariest scene is when someone or a demon with a really dirty lip wounds someone. He looked particularly nasty. There is a funny and painfully bad scene in which Linda Blair is possessed. I would like the horror to throw it, make something original with their role, and let her leave the Exorcist behind her (except for annual conventions of horror movies). <br /> <br /> In the strange, largely Italian, tradition of claiming to be a continuation of something with which there is no connection, it is also AKA La Casa 4 and Ghosthouse 2. That is, it is supposedly a continuation of Casa 3 - Ghosthouse, La (1988) - it is not (it is also a better movie than this one). La Casa 1 and two are The Evil Dead (1981) and Evil Dead II (1987) - again unrelated to Witchery and La Casa 3 (and much better than these). There is also Casa 5, La (1990) AKA House 5, which seems to be a continuation of the fake La Casa series House: House (1986) House II: The Second Story (1987), The Horror Show (1989) AKA House III i House IV (1992). How does The Horror Show fit there? It really is not, he claimed to be a sequel, requiring that the entry of the real series would change the numbering, causing a smaller (or more?) Confusion. Oddly enough, The Horror Show is also AKA Horror House, and La Casa 5 is also AKA Horror House 2. Did your head still hurt?
