The worst movie of all time is to call "House of the Dead" that it really is not. There are worse films there. I watch many Hong Kong ninja movies, which are basically the result of an unfinished Japanese police drama, in which at the end were pictures of ninja to create something that could technically be called a "movie". <br /> <br /> The Dead House is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in theaters. Going half way through, I really felt that I was a bit stupid because I walked through this piece of garbage for 45 minutes.
