The form of the film is a shocking surprise. There are surprises, twists, twists and emotions. Sometimes it is really a movie "on the edge". But it disappoints and seriously disappoints. <br /> <br /> The villain's character is unbelievable; his character does not stick together. I refuse to "spoil" the film, but let me just say that the character we meet at the beginning simply could not be the one we see at the end. <br /> <br /> The second major disappointment of the movie is - In the end, it becomes a more bloody movie. There is a slight quality difference between this and one of the films "PiÄ…tek trzynastego". It's not that every movie always has to be completely tasteful, but sometimes the film drips with water. <br /> <br /> Although gorgeous Sean Connery appears in the movie, even he does not meet his normal standards and often only seems to walk around the steps.
