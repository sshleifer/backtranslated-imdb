It's the worst movie I've ever seen. This film fits the quality of movies such as "THEY" and "Cabin Fever", but even those who had the names of actors, they could not. "Candy to the eyes" of this film looked like a 50-year-old woman with a bad facelift. (only a quality example). I would rate this video negatively, if possible. Lord, I must tell you that men were not bad to look at, but not much. If you planned to see this movie, I would definitely recommend saving money.
