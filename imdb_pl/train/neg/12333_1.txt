Un-bleeping-credible! Meg Ryan does not even look like a simple, nice self, which normally makes me forgive her shallow, irritating action. It is hard to believe that she was the producer of this dog. Plus Kevin Kline: on what suicide trip he had his career? Whoosh ... Banzai !!! After all, he was the guy who made the Big Chill? It must be a replay with Jonestown - Hollywood style. Wooofff!
