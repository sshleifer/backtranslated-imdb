If Edward Woodward was the movie that watched the movie, he would scream in horror. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but enough. We had Get Carter, The Italian Job, Alfie, and now this. What are the similarities? No. It is no coincidence that the first three artists play Maurice Micklewhite, while others are another great British actor. The main common component of these originals is the Britishness of films. They did not get the impression of Hollywood. They were quirky English films with a unique charm / atmosphere that can not be repeated in the USA. The word "CULT" is a better way to destroy a cult movie than to steal it from a remake or even a sequel. <br /> <br /> Wicker 06 had a difficult task before he even set off. Wiklina 73 is even more mysterious than other iconic films; it defies genre, intelligent scenarios, A-class actors, musical score, fragments that contradict the description and all the stories surrounding the film. <br /> <br /> Here comes the remake. Do not worry. The creation of this remake did not hurt any originals. Some major aspects of history had to be worked for the modern US - communication, paganism, virgins. But that's almost the whole premise. So we give the cop a traumatic past in the style of Nam, combined with flashbacks of shock music for cheap fears. Then without a mast for a mobile phone on the island, which sorts communication - but in the real world this will not happen. Cops simply do not die. Give him a connection with blood for motivation, not a clash of beliefs and you have a remake. A thin waffle, right? <br /> <br /> The point is that everything was laid with a trowel. The name changes were just hamsters, almost Carry On, there was no sense of community on the island, no city center that would capture your location, only a few houses scattered all over the forest. Willow was just annoying because she did not give any information, and Cage was useless, letting her escape. When he entered the well, you knew he would be blocked. The script was marked until the end - and you wanted him to hurry up and finish. The epilogue was completely funny and did not know when to stop. <br /> <br /> This ending is probably the best way to summarize the difference between them. One ends with the most beautiful sunset after the most terrifying day. The second ends with a summary of the post-production explanation of the all-to-the-the-thickies type. <br /> <br /> I loved the original, but I went to the cinema with an open mind and I was excited about the movie. I left gratitude, knowing that this film will probably be under the highway, where only this time, mercifully forgotten forever.
