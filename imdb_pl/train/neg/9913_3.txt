This is one of those cheap TV movies in which characters seem to lose all sense. The foundation of a story, kidnapping a son by a boy's father is very good. But history seems to beg for faith. Whenever I advise my mother not to do anything that you know well, she will do well. It is a bit far-reaching and not worth watching.
