This movie is really brilliant. It is whirling through the clich√© to nonsense with such speed that you do not even see good sense and common decency for humanity that flits past. But that's not the end! This film hits the heart of the barrel so much that it is reflected in the ridiculous comedy: here is how Kor The Beergutted Conan dreams about the abundance of hair around his neck, unbuttoning his things, waving his sword as if there was no tomorrow (and the way I turned it around, really I'm amazed that * was for him tomorrow, or at least his brew entrails, do not miss this movie, it's a fantastic idiocy game and a pure bloody mentality, and when you finish watching this song, wipe away the tears of joy (or tears of frustration because of such an inept trying to tell a story) from your eyes, because some stupid f00l gave these people $ 5 to make a sequel!
