The family moves to an old home in Japan. But he is so haunted (BOO !!!). I did not want to jump you. It's just a review. Sit back. Ahem, in any case, is haunted by an old samurai who killed his wife and her lover in slow motion. This of course makes the 3-minute scene extend to around 7 or 8. Horrid acting. A terrifying story. But how bad can you ask? Well, it was so bad that my brain started to melt and leak through my nose in thoughtful drops. It was so bad when Doug McClure appeared on the screen, I was praying to have a flashback of the Small Wonder (Yes, I know Doug was in "Out of this world" and not "small Wonder", but it's almost the same damn program & I can better hum the subject of "little miracle") There are films that are so bad that they are good. to jest jestia≈Çem: Showtime Beyond <br /> <br /> My class: F- <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Mako Hattori gets topless, Susan George gets 2 love scenes (one nude, the other only topless) <br /> <br />
