This will be the most useless comment I've ever described, but I have to do this to warn you of the cruelty of the cinema that is 'Freddy's Dead'. This is not only the worst chapter in the Nightmare series, but also the worst sequel to the horror of all time! It was boring, pointless and almost free of death. The terrible ending of the 3-D and the worst killings of CORNY are enough to drive this "film" into the ground. However, do not end it, just add bad acting, terrible script and some bad scenes, and you have that pile of guano! No wonder Freddy, as Robert Englund has always played, did two post-mortem performances. I would also like to if I went this way. This is a movie only for fans, do not look at our shame.
