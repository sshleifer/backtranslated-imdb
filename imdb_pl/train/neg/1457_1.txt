I have watched the movie several times and I can say that it is a low budget trash and that it has nothing to do with historical facts. The performances of actors are very weak, but they result from limited acting. Anyone who has watched this movie probably thinks of Hitler as a crazy skinny madman who runs with a gun like a Chicago gangster. I can only say that in these years there are much better films about Hitler and Germany, and this increase in evil is well below average. I can recommend the German movie Downfall, in which you can see the brilliant performance of the Swiss actor Bruno Ganz in the role of Adolf Hitler.
