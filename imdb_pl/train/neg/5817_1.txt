The most difficult thing about this film is to say something positive. The characters were stereotypical "white garbage", the "plot" of the movie was inhibited from the beginning, and the worst feature of the film was that the nakedness was so grossly visible from doubling the body that it was ridiculous. Unfortunately, it was the only fun thing in the movie. Mrs Jenkins would be better served if she refrained from using her life story in the future to "entertain" people. It was just so bad. The only positive aspect of this movie (it has nothing to do with the lack of quality of the movie) is that my brother spent the money on this stinker.
