LL Cool J. Morgan Freeman. Dylan McDermott. Kevin Spacey. John Heard. Cary Elwes. Roslyn Sanchez. Justin Timberlake - wait a moment. Justin Timberlake? And he is a star? I should have known better than to rent EDISON FORCE. Actually, I knew better. But at the moment of absolute weakness, I hired this STV. When you have big names like Freeman and Spacey in STV, you know that it's one of two things: indie or dog. As in sat-on-a-shelf. What did it do. And for good reason. The plot as such includes a group of corrupt, deadly cops a la MAGNUM FORCE, and Timberlake's 'journalist' is the only brave one to discover them. Is focused on your efforts - or maybe I should say for his horrible acting. I turned it off after one of those bad people was shot in the forehead and still had a tendency to turn to the shooter and smile before falling. Just awful. The real indication of how bad this movie is is to see Freeman on the cover and the entire movie with an unruly beard that looks like a hobo. You just know that the director was not under control. Freeman is clearly asleep.
