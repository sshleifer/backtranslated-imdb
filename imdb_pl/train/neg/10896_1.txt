I know you have already read this, in countless other movies, no doubt, if you read the comments here, but the voodoo academy is still the worst movie I've ever tracked. no doubt the really bad ones are not even available to buy or watch on TV, but I still feel that it's fair to qualify that I'm not just a stupid tenant who has chosen badly. <br /> <br /> and 'I've seen two thirds of the bottom 100 ranked videos here on imdb and I mark the others at every opportunity. most of them are above this ... they are excited about the absolute monotony. <br /> <br /> I like to judge really bad movies (as in those without humor, even if they are bad) by the number of people you have to watch it to go to the end. if you can watch it yourself, it's not that bad. if you can watch this with one friend ... it's bad, but it can be a lot worse. <br /> <br /> it took us 5 people to go all the way through the voodoo academy. and even the usual funny moments of watching bad movies (eg noticing the microphone on a boom, for example 3 times in this case, if I'm not mistaken) can pick up the dry taste in my mouth. yes, I watched it, but I also forced 4 of my friends to watch it with me to achieve this goal. <br /> <br /> I hope and pray that we saw how the directors cut ... that they might think it might be a version with 20 minutes of large ears with eyebrows, and the sebaceous glands rub against the torso, which scares me. so much of this movie focuses on it. <br /> <br /> I'm applauding David Decoteau for making this film in two days with a small budget, just as I applaud him for convincing people to pay him for what they do is undoubtedly the celluloid version of some his fetishes. but this is not a good movie. the original horror shop was shot at the same time for a comparable amount of money (taking into account inflation) and was a complete jewel. it is not a justification for how bad this child is. <br /> <br /> front spoilers ... <br /> <br /> it's not even worth choosing holes in the story or gathering all the characters in the story ... ... the pace of the movie ... is crazy ... nothing ... is not interesting for a long time, which the decoteau dedicates to breast self-care. no matter what kind of balance or gender you are ... rubbing simply can not keep this kind of time on the screen. <br /> <br /> acting is a cheese ... but not an amateur ... I've seen a lot worse in better movies ... but somehow it's partly competent to deliver the worst lines you'll ever hear in a movie that really they are shaking. <br /> <br /> rent it if, like me, you are fascinated with the worst of the worst and only if you intend to watch it with a group of people who are willing to work to go through it. it is not ha ha ha, a wavering affair. it's a strength test you probably want to skip. <br /> <br /> I'm sure it's worse ... but I would not be surprised if it had the decotheau name on it.
