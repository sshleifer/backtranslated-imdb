Do you ever sit in a movie and after it's finished it's one big "wtf!". <br /> <br /> Welcome to Decoy. <br /> <br /> Another film action right away, you can immediately forget about watching or better not to watch it. Peter Weller and Robert Patrick are playing and are quickly wasted in this fast, fast-paced campaign of mercenaries, where the story is pretty bad, and the action sucks and why watch an action movie if the action blow? Robert Patrick, in particular, goes into a new low sequence of actions that orders him to shoot a machine gun standing on the hood of a moving school bus. He co-creates ambient Charlotte Lewis and his own Canadian Scott Hylands (known from the television Night Heat).
