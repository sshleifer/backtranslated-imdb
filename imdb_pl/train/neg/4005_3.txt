I am a real fan of the original Cracker series and I own them on DVD. Cracker tended to be adventurous, but Robbie Coltrane and other cast members, as well as writers, always seemed to carry him. At the time, I count the original Cracker for the great crime TV series Brit TV, and there is some fierce competition: suspect prime minister, inspector Frost, inspector Morse, Sherlock Homes Jeremy Brett and many others. Cracker, along with Prime Suspect, was at the top of my list. <br /> <br /> What makes "A New Terror" even more sad ... <br /> <br /> In the end it was a very pale imitation of Cracker's former glory. I forced myself to sit through the whole thing, convinced that it really could not be so bad, and that eventually a spark would ignite. I was wrong, it was bad from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> A few critical remarks: First, so that any potential mistake would be immediately right away: I was insulted by anti-American, anti-war sculpting that he was whirling throughout the duration of the program. Topper: the murder of two innocent Americans from any crime and British Junkie is, in Fitz's words, "understandable but not justified." I thought: "I went through two hours of nonsense to hear this disgusting nonsense?" So I had a negative reaction to the anti-war / American tone caused by my beliefs ... Beyond politics I had the clear feeling that this Cracker was just a propaganda prop and actually helped to undermine already a terribly weak scenario. <br /> <br /> Second, how long did Robbie Coltrane get? Fitz was almost a player in this game, as if he were an addition to a story originally written without any thought of Fitz's role. Coltrane could carry the show on his broad and still floppy shoulders, but the writer apparently thought about other things and missed the chance, and this was a wide margin. <br /> <br /> Third: WHAT IS ABYSMAL SCENARIO! There was some brightness and a few fragments of the actual character development (Fitz's son, who cried that Fitz could not stay in his home if he was late for a plane to Australia, a detective who liked to beat his weaker performers behind their heads and some old sparks between Fitz and his Missus), but not enough to carry a boring plot. <br /> <br /> Fourth, where the hell was Panhallagan? That would be interesting ... After all it was Manchester, and 10 years later it would be in the ranks. Another missed opportunity (or maybe the actress was not interested?) <br /> <br /> Well, there is much more (it's bad) to say, but I will close with curiosity: at the end of the series (as on BBCA), when advertising announced that "Director's Cut" is available on BBC On-Demand, I thought AH-HA! Cutting the director, for which you probably have to pay, may have all the delicacies I expected tonight, but it never was like a cohesive, interesting plot. Unfortunately, after convincing myself to sit in the terrifying free version of "A New Terror" in the hope that I will see something, anything worth seeing, only to be disappointed, I have no more hope to motivate me to pay in a second, a potentially longer and more boring version. Besides, I was angry at thinking that the BBCA cut into slices and diced, took the time to accommodate an endless (every ten minutes) stream of ads, then turned around and asked me to pay for what should probably be the version for today . <br /> <br /> At the end I quote the first paragraph of Variety's "A New Terror" review: that really says it all: "The initial emotions associated with Robbie Coltrane again provoke his role as a faulty, drunken, female BBC criminal psychologist is under the snow, and Jimmy McGovern is determined to issue a political statement in this awakened vidpic. a little bit about terrorism before he came down to our threshold - clearing McGovern's chest overwhelms the narrative and silences the pleasure of watching Fitz in the case.
