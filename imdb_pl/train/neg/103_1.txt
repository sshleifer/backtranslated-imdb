Not wanting to be lethal, Brad Sykes is responsible for at least two of the most boring and stereotypical movies I've ever seen - one of them, and Camp Blood is another. <br /> <br /> Acting is terrible, the print is tacky, and everything in the movie screams "seriously, you can do better yourself". Maybe this is a challenge for everyone to saturate youtube with our own zombie related shit? <br /> <br /> I bought it for 1 pound, but remember that you can not pay 71 minutes of your life. It would be good to avoid this turkey even at a bargain price in the basement.
