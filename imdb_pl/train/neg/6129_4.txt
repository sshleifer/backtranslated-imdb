Judging from this movie and the STRONG MAN, made the same year, I would not place Harry Langdon at the top of the list of great silent screen comedians. It's just not enough. Perhaps he was on the right track to develop his style, but he sabotaged himself, too seriously approaching his first great successes. In any case, all his tricks resemble more funny men, but he lacks Keaton's acrobatic skills and Lloyd's incredible ingenuity. He also challenges his personality by dressing and walking like Chaplin's wanderer. His trademarks are childish innocence, shyness of approach and a tendency to not respond sufficiently to unhappiness, looking embarrassed, blinking his eyes or touching the tip of his index finger with his lips clenched tight. The comedy in Langdon's films results from a fate throwing various obstacles in his path, which he tries to overcome in a nauseating or na√Øve way or with minimal physicality, such as throwing stones in an approaching tornado to push them away, supporting a collapsed building two to four or avoiding boulders, lifting the leg so that it will roll under it. In this story about the son of a shoemaker, who joins the running race in order to publicize the company's competitive footwear, he manages to win with pure happiness. Nothing has been done much better here by the Big Three.
