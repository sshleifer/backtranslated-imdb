What a disappointment! <br /> <br /> It seemed that this movie was trying to copy the "modern" comedy, but the direction and scenario were sloppy, sickly and sentimental in the worst film tradition. The acting / role of Jacek Black was self-satisfied and self-admiration ... and other characters were equally unmasking and uninteresting. The soundtrack was boring. We are (WERE) Black fans, but none of us did more than force a forced titter for the duration. Why did he feel that he must make this mistake? <br /> <br /> We will not watch another of his films without a more careful reading of the review !! <br /> <br /> He was drunk when he read the script before signing up for this drivel?
