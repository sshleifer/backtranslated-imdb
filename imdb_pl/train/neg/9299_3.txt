While watching this movie, I tried to understand why they did it. Although the main theme of the movie is potentially good, there are various unrelated / unnecessary threads. Marketers in Hollywood had to dictate many bad guys, eternal double crosses and a man and a woman who come too close and have sex. It's weird that we see more of them having sex than the president and his lover. A lot of plot and storylines make the film too wide and none of the characters are properly developed - I really did not feel that I know any character, except that everyone is corrupt and angry. The ending is completely incomplete - it left me more than just the desire for what could have been, but what was to be. In the end, there is really no explanation why someone does what they do, except for serving as additional, broken characters who make a double cross. I am surprised that so many recognized (and good) actors agreed to make such an empty movie. It seemed like a movie made by students who are working on a second or third project. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time unless you're in a movie class and want an example of what not to do when making a movie.
