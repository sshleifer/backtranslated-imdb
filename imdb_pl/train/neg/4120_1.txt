Absolutely scary movie. Ameteurish and it is not funny at all. The main character played by Mehmet Ali Erbil is very irritating. Editions of E.T and Star Wars are simply stupid. <br /> <br /> Actor Yilmaz Goksal is the only good idea for this film. He should master his English and move to Hollywood. Hollywood can not find an actor about his values. Besides Goksalem, this movie is rubbish. <br /> <br /> Director Gani Mujde is a comic writer, and this film is his worst written work so far. <br /> <br /> Music Cem Karaca is another plus is a waste of money. The actor Sumer Tilmac is also present. The actor who plays three sons has no talent.
