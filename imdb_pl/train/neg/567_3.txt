This movie is one of the worst films ever. How can Jon Bon Jovi play in the film? He is a singer, not an actor, eh? Does he kill vampires with a guitar? And what about the horrible conspiracy? Oh, my God, this movie really sucks. Finally, the queen of vampires played by the eternal vampire Arly Jover (Blade) surrounded by an army of vampires, but when the "fantastic" killers arrive, there are only 4 vampires left !! What happened to other 10-15 vampires? They run in the sun ??? And what about "Grand Finally" when Bon Jovi blows his head with a rifle? It's really "NO". In "Buffy the vampire Slayer" in 100 episodes, not one vampire is killed with A SHOTGUN ??? It really is lack of originality!
