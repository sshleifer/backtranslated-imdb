Amateur in extreme conditions. The camera works particularly well - documentary camera operators do not have to rotate all the time. <br /> <br /> The script is really ridiculous, and the game is even worse. What's more, the story is chaotic and chaotic - with gaping holes in logic. At some point, the leader wants to be thrown in jail to touch the suspected Al-Qad agents, and thus get an interview with Osama. I find this story unbelievable because of many disadvantages. "Filmowiec" / the main role really shows a rash, an idiot boy with a brother. The only interesting element is that the filmmakers were actually filming on the spot. It is a pity they missed the opportunity to do something interesting. <br /> <br /> Who financed this shit?
