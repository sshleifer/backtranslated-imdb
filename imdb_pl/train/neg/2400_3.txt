No, it was not one of the ten worst films of the 80s, but it certainly ends somewhere. This movie looks like it has been put on a shelf for two or three years and then released in 1981. How else would you explain the special effects that precede "An American Werewolf in London", a disco still considered cool, and Ronald Reagan is not the 40th President of the United States? At this time, let's not skip hairstyles from the 70s in the 1950s and 1960s. I saw more of it here than in "Happy Days" and "Laverne & Shirley" together. <br /> <br /> One woman who raises this film to the category "so bad, good" was late, big Elizabeth Hartman, but barely. Biff plays the role of Miss Montgomery, a mousy high school teacher who becomes a sexpot, a stereotype that has been made to die and is still being thrown by Hollywood, but even as a "hot chick" he retains his mouse features. Her call to help is proof of this. She also looks much better as Miss Wimp. "Seven bucks in a beauty salon, shot to hell." She was not kidding. <br /> <br /> It does not mean that there are no good parts elsewhere, they are just a few and I'm not saying this just because I like Hartman. By the way, "Teen Wolf" was better than that. "Teen Wolf Too" was better than that, and it was not even that good. <br /> <br />
