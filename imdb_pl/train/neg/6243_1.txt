Do not drink cold help. <br /> <br /> This is a piece of opinion dressed up as a document. And calling it "truth" is simply nonsense. The debate on global warming is far from over and will only end when the eco-zombies start recognizing the top of the evidence against their beloved theory. All you need is Google "Global Warming" and "Hoax" or "Junk Science" and you'll find a river of information that refutes almost every link in the chain of logic that Gore sites. The reason why it is so important for people to educate is the catastrophic economic impact of measures to prevent global warming. Waking people. Anyone with a computer, some time and common sense can find many reasons why this theory is not even close to credibility. Do not just read the articles that support your current opinions, read everything you can find. There is not really an in-depth analysis. There are simply too many alternative options and contraindications, so that theory has even the most basic level of scientific credibility. It is so unbelievable that it can be the biggest fraud in human existence. The time has come for people to speak out against this propaganda and it is time for people to admit to themselves and others that you can be both a nature conservator and accept the blatant conclusion that the hysteria of global warming is a big lie.
