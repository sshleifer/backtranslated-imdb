For all his visual pleasures, how much better Renaissance would be in live action. The animation is fantastic in a big picture, yes, but the characters are cold and empty, just like the story and style of the movie. With real actors, the movie world would not be so lifeless. There is a lot to admire here, but in the end I discovered that all I can do is admire. I did not like the film so much and it explains something I have not seen before: that visual elements can be a decisive positive aspect of the film, but without a good story or strong characters it can be nothing. I will not even go so far as to say that this movie does not make sense, but sometimes it comes dangerously close. I love Dark sci-fi thrillers. Blade Runner and Dark City are two movies that I thought were great. But Blade Runner had his tragic villain, and Dark City stimulated thinking. The Renaissance has shade and light, but not much more. I would like to be able to please this film more, but the poor story and empty figures stood in the way. The Renaissance was a historical and artistic explosion of colors and life. How ironic it is that one of the most gloomy and dead movies I've seen this year has its title since the Renaissance.
