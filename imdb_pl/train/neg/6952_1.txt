The most terrifying story about a great series. You should not be called Battlestar Galactica, because only the same has a name. Too many changes to make changes. Characters change from male to female, black to Asian to Cylon to "attract the female audience" when there were strong female characters that could be strengthened. The Egyptian feelings have disappeared. They went looking for the earth. Lack of Cylon to go to reject the terminator, he receives the video, especially when it is a fembotem. It was admitted that the original program had a lot of cheese, but it had a big trace. They tried to stick to it, but they did not give the fans anything to do and basically spit in their face when they did it with their 'own history'. Changes are good when they are doing something better, not just creating them.
