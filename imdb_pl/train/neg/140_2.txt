Valentine is a terrible movie. I just thought about it: <br /> <br /> Acting: very bad. Katherine Heigl can not act. Others were not much better. <br /> <br /> History: the story was fine, but it could have been more developed. This movie had the potential to become a great movie, but it failed. <br /> <br /> Music: Yes, part of the music was pretty cool. <br /> <br /> Originality: not very original. The name `Paige Prescott 'Recognize Prescott? <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Do not look Valentine. It's really a stupid movie. <br /> <br /> 1/10 <br /> <br />
