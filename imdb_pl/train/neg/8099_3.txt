It was a great book, and the possibilities of a really great movie were definitely there. But the casting decisions completely destroyed the film. Hanks is a great actor, but he certainly lacks the morale, ambivalent features needed for the main role. Jeff Daniels would be my choice. <br /> <br /> Insertion of Melanie Griffiths, for the sake of the eye, is understandable, but again it does not depict depth or ambivalence, so it must distract it. /> <br /> This movie is a great example of how any decision, even the one at the beginning of film production, can make or break a file.
