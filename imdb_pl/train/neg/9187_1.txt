In the past I watched a few bad movies, but what the hell they were thinking about when they made this movie. Has the production team turned into zombies when they came up with the idea of ​​doing this because you definitely need to be a dead brain to find any pleasure in it. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of most genres and I'm happy with "Shoot Up" games, but combining the scenes from the game just made it funny and impossible to watch. <br /> <br /> As most of them said, there was almost no script and the game was weak. I will not waste time describing it. <br /> <br /> Anyone who evaluates this movie above 4 must be part of a production company or Sega, or have a very skewed entertainment concept. <Br /> <br /> I have to say that I was more irritated by the video store, which gave it a thumbs up, which led me to borrow. Thank God I had a second movie to watch to restore some of my faith in movies. <br /> <br /> A comic would be right if he said "The worst film in history"!
