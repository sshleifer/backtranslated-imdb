I will keep it brief; thank you Greg for help in a concise approach: slavery concerns a guy who drinks a girl, ties her and tortures her, and then poses for captivity to have sex with her. This is a single phrase and film score. It's torture as a rape in slow motion. And it's not even a good movie. It is not so bad that it is good; it's just bad. <br /> <br /> It should also be mentioned that among the critics there is a "spoiler code" that they dare not break, even if some people have tempted it because it is so bad. Why NOBODY had cojones to get up and say "it's rubbish, and that's why" is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Do not give money to these merchant dealers.
