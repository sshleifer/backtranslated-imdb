It is a rip off of Frankenstein's old assumption. A recognized scientist dies in a bizarre accident, and his father, a well-known brain surgeon, saves the brain. It is then placed in the robotic body of your own design. His brother, an electric genius, gives a "colossal" impulse to move thoughts. The whole project goes badly when the creation goes crazy. <br /> <br /> Special effects are undeveloped. The script is missing. The funny thing is that it's not a bit scary. Well, very young children will think it's good. If you are awake at three in the morning and it turns on .... night, night. <br /> <br /> The main characters are Otto Kruger, John Baragrey and Ross Martin. Ed Wolff played "Colossus".
