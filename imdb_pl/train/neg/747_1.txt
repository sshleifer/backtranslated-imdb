In the end, I thought that someone would give justice to H.G. Wells, not another version set in the wrong place or era, but based on a book. Well, he is definitely following the book, and this is the only plus of this mess. <br /> <br /> It's 180 minutes (yes 3 hours), the book has only about 150 pages. <br /> <br /> If Timothy Hines had the courage to come here and say "if you can do something better ...", I would say "yes, I could" and never used a video camera or any kind of theater school in my life. <br /> <br /> I paid good money to get this nonsense to the United Kingdom from the USA, do not make the same mistake as me.
