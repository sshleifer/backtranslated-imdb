In the back of the DVD box there are Ellen Page's co-stars in this video. She does not even appear until two-thirds of the film is over, and then she is in a smaller role. I do not consider this a supportive role, but rather as "a little". Also, the plot has many unexplained elements. Here are some examples: why does the main character reject his eldest son? Why is her youngest son going to the train? He talks about the "nerd" plant, which does not explain anything. Of course, the screenwriter does not know the definition of a sucker plant. In my opinion, this movie is not worth the rental price. Save your money and watch it for free on TV if you think you need to see it.
