I was expecting a very funny movie. Instead, I got a movie with some funny jokes, and many of them just do not work. I did not like the idea of ​​bringing the descendants of Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty. It was misleading. It would be fun if they just had someone new instead of resurrected Moriarty. Some things were funny. Burt Kwouk was very funny, as always. McCloud was funny on horseback. McGarrett from Hawaii 5-0 was not even similar to McGarrett. Connie Booth is of course very good with accents. She is from Indiana, but she played quite good English and New York. Unfortunately, it has not been shown too much in the script. I was expecting a more fun movie. Instead, I got a rather confusing movie with a weak script. Rather ironic because Booth and Cleese were together. Maybe they were about to fall apart in 77.
