Sure, we all like bad movies at one time or another, and we're really enjoying them, but it was not even blame, it's just bullshit. A guy, a vince offer that's cocky enough to become the protagonist, while he probably got drunk / high - probably both - and he thought it was a great idea to make a movie. Then he started showing his script to equally high / drunk people. In general, this movie was so bad, predictable and unoriginal that I could not beat it for 20 minutes before turning it off. It makes You Got Served look like Citizen Kane. Bat Man? WTF ... Some guy who walks with a bat, a real original. Almost as good as I call him Fat Man, and a fat guy walked in a superhero outfit.
