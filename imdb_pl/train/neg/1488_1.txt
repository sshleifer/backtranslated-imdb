I had to register with IMDb to post a comment about how awful this movie is ... my cats and the string ball have a better plot than this one. This is not the worst game I've ever seen, but when you erase almost the entire cast of a movie within 5 minutes, it will leave something to be desired. There was not a single "frightening" moment in the movie, except watching the movie "Halloween" on TV. Everywhere around it seems that it might be a good story, turning over loans and saying that Chasey Lain was in it, it was a bit of a loss because I did not recognize her right away and her scene was over before I could say "oh yeah, there is". I'm so glad I saw it at the hotel and I did not pay for it because I would be really tweaked if I paid a cent for it. I usually like to find at least one factor in a movie, but this one is an exception. It's so bad that it's not even so much fun, it's so bad - it's bad ... it's just bad.
