The second level of the leading American guy, Guy Madison, is a character whose fame surpasses him in this Spaghetti Western? which, having very modest references, turns out to be essentially routine (though having a good enough result). The plot has a slight interest: By the way, the title refers to a wounded man involved in the murderous attack on runners at the ranch? property of the family of their pursuer, Madison cavalry. The younger siblings of the latter are determined that the aggrieved party, now under their command, will lead them to a responsible gang leader; in the end, the identity of every mysterious man turns out to be a surprise? Both, ironically, engage in one of the Madison sisters (another is raped during the raid). The Euro-cult star Rosalba Neri seems exceptionally inconspicuous as the salon hostess and ex-flame Madison.
