I did not like this movie at all. First of all, I just think that it is primitive and vulgar, for no reason. I also felt that it was misogynist (against women). The film really does not look like anything, and I have not found any nice character. Really, it does not seem to make sense. Maybe something is missing, but for me this movie is a waste of time when I could do something more productive and enjoyable. For example, using my face as a pin. James's Garner is in it, like C. Thomas Howell and Shirley Jones, and James Cromwell.all are wasted here and I'm sure it was a low point in each of their careers. Jennilee Harrison (from the later years of Three's Company) is also in the movie and it's nice to see her in a different role than ditsy. t rise above the average script. For me Tank is 3/10
