No spoilers, but I'm a fan from the beginning of Waking the Dead, but the last series, of which only 3 were for now, is terrible. Stories do not resemble the original idea of ​​the series. I found these 3 in the last series of jaws that was absurd. As a payer of the BBC license, after the show I called the BBC's complaints to convey my disappointment. I am amazed that the actors of the caliber of Trevor Eve and Sue Johnstone did not oppose the plot. These actors are with these characters for 8 seasons, surly guys see that they have lost all direction. This is a good job, because the last series or the next series can start with the team investigating the death of the Christmas Father! <br /> <br /> Paul Bentley, West Yorkshire, England.
