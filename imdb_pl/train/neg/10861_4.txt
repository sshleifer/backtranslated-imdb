Maybe I'm missing something because I read more positive things about the Man who fooled himself than read the bad reviews - and I just do not get it. I like my noirs who have a bit of a style with characters who speak, look and behave like Humphrey Bogart in The Big Sleep or Gene Tierney in Laura. None of the characters in this movie has a style or presence or what you want to name. Take the main actor, Lee J. Cobba. His crumpled, rolled-up look is so far away from the lush, smoothly speaking archetype noir you'll find. Or treat Jane Wyatt as femme fatale as another example. This is one of the worst cases of bad thinking that I have seen for some time. It is simply not convincing in the role. <br /> <br /> As for the story, she's tired and there are no real surprises or anything new to the genre. I could have predicted the result of a man who fooled himself after about five minutes. And this last scene of pursuit behind a cat and mouse is simply boring. Ten to fifteen minutes, nothing happens really ruined any stimulation the movie could have.
