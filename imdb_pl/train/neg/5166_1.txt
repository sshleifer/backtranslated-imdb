Horrible acting, bad plot, stupid story and just a horrible movie sum up this piece of garbage. The seat was terrible. Just awful. Do not waste a penny on it. Cinemas should feel bad about putting this movie there so people can watch it. This "horror" was not even the most terrifying, frightening or disturbing. It was not visually appealing in any way. Acting was so horrible for all actors that every attempt to get you into the movie through dialogue was completely destroyed in moments when the actor / actress opens her mouth. Plus the whole story, I do not know why anyone would make a movie with this story AGAIN. Do not waste time or money. Even if it's a free ticket, do not waste a moment watching this movie. You will feel stupid, watching this.
