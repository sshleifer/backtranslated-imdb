Someone here really compared this movie in a way to High Noon. Now this is the real episode! I am a big fan of Sinatra, including some of his acting roles, but perhaps the only person who could play this role would be Don Knotts. First of all, as someone noticed, Sinatra simply has no compilation for someone who wants to become a Western bad guy. At this point in his life he is too "light". Perhaps he was more or less at the same height as Audie Murphy, but Murphy was quite solid. Sinatra turns out to be a great talkative kid that no one should take seriously. <br /> <br /> The story is uninspired and really unbelievable. I do not want to spoil it, but I think that the ending and the way in which the city's inhabitants react in this story does not make sense. Another thing is that these people still allow themselves to completely rule over some "bad guy". This is just a small city, so I do not get attractions or understand why people would allow themselves to dominate this way. <br /> <br /> There is "love interest" in history and if I went well for her, she was nervous when the main character refused to admit who he was, so some other bad guy would not kill him. Now, true love is for you. 'Stand in your defense! Tell him your name to kill you! LOL. Stop it, you kill me. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the basic premise of the movie is not good enough, and no matter how they tried, this story did not have a logical path to follow other than in the trash can. Want to know why this is not a video and is never shown on TV? The critics apparently did it in 1956 and they were right - this movie is quite bad. I could almost bet Sinatra paid someone to go into six things as much as possible. <br /> <br /> You want to see the good West, where the city stands against evil? Try Tension at Table Rock or At Gunpoint - two really good westerns with this motif. Johnny Concho is Johnny Stinko. Frank, you were the greatest singer in history - but you did not belong to such a movie.
