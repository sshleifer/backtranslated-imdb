As if there were not enough of those who swim then, we have another lame clone of GODFATHER from the director IL CONSIGLIORI (1973), which I watched earlier this year. The name of the brand at this time is Telly Savalas, who delays into the stage and is seen from behind, rather moving abundantly to his flowers and wearing a beret in the style of French painters! In addition to the fact that it does not look minimal in Sicily, there is no accent other than his acquaintance of the fig. Antonio Sabato makes this incredible gangster - except that he is a resistant top man; his relationship with Savalas, who becomes paternal in the blink of an eye, is also unconvincing (especially that he later romantically associated himself with his spiritualized teenage niece)! Besides, in the case of a gangster film, there are very few valuable activities that can not be remembered in any way (although the final set in the clinic is well supported); in addition, the score of Francesco De Masi is useful, but nothing more. Incidentally, a rented DVD with a bargain price I have rented starts halfway through the subtitles so that none of the cast members - or even the title of the film - ever been mentioned!
