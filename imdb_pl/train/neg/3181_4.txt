This movie was not created by the fans of Who. Most of the great moments that fans will be waiting for in Tommy's half-hour match are simply overlooked or overlooked. . ", they showed almost * no * Guitar Townsend shots in the Pinball Wizard, there were plenty of shots at the best moments of Go to the Mirror, and worst of all, in the second half, We Not Gonna Take It, robbed us from almost every shot Pete's burning guitar chords, huge pieces of film are shot at the back of the band, it's very frustrating to see a movie, I do not know if director Murra Lerner is just a fan of Who, and worse, at least for him, if * is * a fan Who and all * eight * cameras could provide it, I have to admit that there are a few rare numbers in front of Tommy, as well as some faves that are very well done, and sometimes the genius edition is enough to satisfy some viewers, if you do not expect Tommy. The sound was generally mediocre in the broadcast I watched from DirecTV, it could be different on video or DVD.
