Will they ever make films without nudity and sex? It came at 3:00 on a Sunday afternoon and I could not believe what they showed. Thank God, my son was outside, otherwise I would see soft / medium porn! Do people who make films do not care who they are offending or corrupting? The children could watch the church and that's what they show ??? !!! Acting was good and I was enjoying the tension, but GEE! There was violence and bad people, but this can be expected in the western film. Randy Travis was really good at his role. If writers, directors and producers simply stopped engaging in such unusual sex scenes. What must happen to stop going in this direction? Where can I file a complaint?
