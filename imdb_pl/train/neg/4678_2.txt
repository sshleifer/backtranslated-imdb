In this film there are a few fans of andrenaline, but this is an old story that simply would never have happened. The Navy's protocols would never have broken down so much that the crew much less than XO could go so far away from the captain. I'll take Dr. Strangelove every day if I want to see this story. Sidenote - US Navy did not support this film.
