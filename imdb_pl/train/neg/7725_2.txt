This movie is one of the most unwanted bad action movies ever made. Dolph Friggin 'Lundren with a Japanese accent is quite funny, but adds a really extravagant action of Buddy-Buddy to an eccentric and overly black character, stereotypical love theme and one of the worst endings of all time, and you have enough suicide drugs for people who like their lives and until watching the Showdown, they never thought about killing a bronx. <br /> <br /> I do not know if it's just me, but the whole homosexual subtext is not too subtle. There are constant references to male genitalia, not females. Brandon Lee and Dolphin talk about their male parts, and in fact, before the outbreak of suicide, Brandon says to Dolphy: "In case we do not do it, I want to tell you that you have the biggest d --- I've ever seen. "<br /> <br /> Is this what an ordinary man would say to another man? In the ACTION movie, not less? And would you like it to be your helping words? <br /> <br /> Later this jewel is: <br /> <br /> Dolph (refers to the villain): "I would like to cut off some parts of his anatomy. "Brandon:" Man, you have fixation. " <br /> <br /> As the guy from RuthlessReviews.com noticed: "Unfortunately, Dolph does not answer:" Do I have fixation? I have fixation ?! he decided that his last words should concern my privates! I just wanted to chop his ears and nose, man. <br /> <br /> It is mercilessly silly and fun if you're someone who likes to receive root canals from unlicensed dentists, without novocaine. It's about par Great fun for the whole family!
