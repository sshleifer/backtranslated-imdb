You really can not go far, when the initial story is not so great. The idea that a cyborg needs blood is simply stupid. <br /> <br /> The script is a light. " Actors do not have much to do. Kits were exhibited in the desert to reduce costs. It's a trademark that if the background is desert, then the movie has no budget. <br /> <br /> No budget is ok, if there is a story. "Solarbabies" and "Blood of Champions" are examples of decent work without $. but this movie looks like they have to scrape together to buy a cameraman's sandwich. Again, excusable, if only the story was not just suck. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie commits the biggest crime of all: it does not end! It just ends as if it was a commercial break from the rest of the movie. But the rest never comes. Just strange. <br /> <br /> Just bad.
