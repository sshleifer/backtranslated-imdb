I have not seen many low-budget movies that I have to admit, but this is the worst movie I've ever had, the main character that the old man talked about, had lobotomy and lost the power to speak more than one word every 5 seconds, 5 years could work better. History had the most horrible conspiracy and it's good that the army guy put what he thought was an army, and then he just crossed the threshold, I watched him just to laugh at how bad it was, and I hoped it would lead to a real movie. I can not believe that it was in a 2-night rental in hits, instead of please, take it for free and throw it out of our view. I think there was one half-decent actor other than a woman, I think the only thing fine with the budget is makeup, but they show every important movie scene in the beginning. Terrible just terrible.
