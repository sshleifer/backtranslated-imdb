The film is very long and unfortunately quite different than the novel. If you want to see a movie, do not read the novel first, because it will shock you. However, the pictures were fine and if you're a person who loves the adventure genres that explore Africa, go for it. Actors' performances are appropriate, but many important events that were present in the novel were omitted. In the novel, Sir Henry Curtis was looking for his missing brother, not a woman in search of a father. Gagool was cunning and died in a cave, while here it turned out that he was a good person who preferred to stay with the new king.
