* Mo≈ºliwy Spoiler * <br /> <br /> "Return to the cabin by the lake" is a useless movie. Acting was not good, and the plot was not even interesting. <br /> <br /> "Cabin on the lake" is a good TV movie. Continuation was not. Judd Nelson was very good in the first film and put a lot more in his character than in this. It seemed that HE was not even interested in continuing the sequel. His acting was good, but it could have been better. I really do not want to comment on the rest of the cast, because I think it's not worth mentioning. But I will do it. Alison's character is not even barely visible in the first part of the movie. He is suddenly the center of attention next to Stanley Caldwell. This role did not make sense and should be a little better thought out. Dahlia Salem was absolutely horrible. Her behavior was far below decency, and people who were throwing should look for someone else, anyone else. The director, Mike, was a tangled character. It seemed to have a purpose to be there, but it did not seem that his death was necessary. Acting in this role was good, no big deal, but better than in Salem. <br /> <br /> The plot was really bad if you think about it. Stanley, who is considered dead, goes to the "Cabin by the Lake" set, a movie based on his scenario. He stumbled upon the director and in a short time the director is dead, and Stanley runs the program. Yes, no one knows from where, the crew will let this stranger enter the picture and finish the movie without knowing anything about it. There are a few homicides, not many, and the ones that are shown are funny. One of the actresses on the set gets electrocuted while filming the stage. Another character is chewed up by a motorboat. And one gets tangled up in the plant before drowning. These writers must have been very excited. <br /> <br /> I just have to say that the movie was not impressed. The way he changed from a low budget to a normal one began to irritate quickly. The new cabin on the lake was poorly created. We are not shown, but only in a few scenes, and the whole with a chain in the basement was useless. It worked in the first movie just because we showed the room a lot more, but it did not work in it. <br /> <br /> There were too many characters in the sequel. All but a few had no reason to be there. The action of what was shown was really bad and ... they just had no purpose in this movie. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, "Return to the cabin by the lake" is a continuation from the place where the first one was interrupted. "Cabin on the lake" I can do it, but it was not impressive. Judd Nelson should have avoided this, and you too. It's nothing like the first and it went completely too slowly. In the first hour nothing happened and continued dragging to the other. Not to mention that writing was terrible. Put on this only if you need help falling asleep. <br /> <br /> So we see that Stanley is opposed to death and is still alive. By the way, he says that this may be the third installment of the film's good in itself. Stop throwing sequels and we can be fine! <br /> <br /> (Did the filmmakers not realize that they showed us how they filmed the scenes from the lake from the first one? They were all taken in the tank. Never, never reveal the secrets of filming.) <br /> <br / >
