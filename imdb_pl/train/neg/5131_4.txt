I liked it, but I think I could have ironed at the same time. This adaptation of Cyrano de Bergerac / Roxanne is a completely undemanding, formal Romance rescued from shame from the video after being released by the sharp phrase of Janeane Garofalo. Playing Frasier of Pets, she discovers that she is trapped in love when uncertainty leads her to her best friend (Uma Thurman), as she does when the caller goes to court. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting movie in Ben Chaplin's fascinating career. The average British actor gave Hollywood a treadmill with this movie. It is extraordinary, and its anonymity in studio productions is surprising on its basis, although it appeared in significant episodes in both later films of Terence Malick. Uma Thurman performs a ditzy turn on the autopilot, and Michael Lehmann packs everything in the set. Icky sex on the phone. 4/10
