It's true that the setting in Paris is great. The actors are doing well. History is a twisted game of morality. Is this to say that if someone wants enough, can it hurt everyone along the way? In a real affair, you want a less stereotype than a man who gets bored with his wife and is ready to drop a family, and a woman who is okay encourages him. What if they are decent looking and if Karen Allen shows her body? The heroes are still absorbed in themselves and reprehensible. Perhaps the moral of this story is: "you get what you deserve". I give him 4, only for the fast scanning potential of the "male interest" bits.
