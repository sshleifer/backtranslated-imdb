Someone will have to explain to me why every movie that presents poor people and adopts a pseudo-grainy appearance is perceived by some as "realistic". <br /> <br /> I did not see anything realistic in the characters (although the actors did their best with really bad parts) or situations. Instead, I saw a forced, self-aware effort to be "upset", "hard" and "depressed". <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it takes a lot more than hand-holding the camera without a rhyme or reason and not illuminating the film to achieve any of the above features in any meaningful way. <br /> <br /> This sad commentary on the condition of independent distribution of films, which is the only film that sees the interior of the film, the theater is now a carbon copy, with bad cinematography, a non-existent camera direction and many curses seeking to transfer themselves as "art" . <br /> <br /> It is not surprising that such films as "In the bedroom" or "About Schmidt" get such a rave. I think they are winding and very average, but compared to the current number of independent clones, such as "Raising victor Vargas", they are simply brilliant and inspired. <br /> <br /> A few years ago saw the "independent" movie meant that you probably will be treated with some originality and high energy and care, and maybe even with some technical defects caused by low budgets, now it means that there is chance that you'll get more numbers, let -shake-the-camera-about-in-two hours try to appease the lack of flavor of independent distributors. And of course everything to serve the heroes and situations that are completely unreal and invented. <br /> <br /> Is it a surprise that the independent market has fewer and fewer surviving companies? Not at all when you see movies like Raising Victor Vargas, which do nothing but copy the worst movies that preceded them.
