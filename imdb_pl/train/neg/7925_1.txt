Do you want a great recipe for failure? Take the plot of s **** y, add weak, completely undeveloped characters and cast the worst special effects known from horror. Let goulash for a week (the amount of time you probably spent on making this basket). The result is Corpse Grinders, a movie that takes bad movies to dangerous and exotic low places. <br /> <br /> The movie exploded completely. My words can not convey how painful it was to watch. This is not one of those bad movies that you and your friends can sit down and make fun of. This is not Plan 9 From space. It is a long, boring, sad waste of time. Corpse Grinders II is the biggest loss of energy and talent I've ever seen. I feel depressed when I realize that people have really lost their time in this shit, if you can call it action. But again, when you have a bad direction, poor writing, poor everything, acting is the last thing to criticize. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a huge, disgusting turd, which you miss to quickly disappear, fearing that a friend or a loved one can somehow see it. I really could somehow destroy every copy of this movie so it would not pollute the minds of the beginning filmmakers. Thank you, Ted V. Mikels, for showing me a new respect for every movie I've ever seen. You showed me what's really awful and why I should appreciate all those movies that are simply bad or boring.
