WARNING! DETAILS FOR SMALL OBJECTS DISCOVERED! <br /> <br /> I can not find anything positive to say about this movie. It is so badly written that every character is a caricature, but it seems to be taken seriously. He is poorly manned, especially Ralph Macchio (all with a childish face, nothing of it) as hard on the street. All elements are drawn in black and white, and each situation almost immediately escalates to some extreme climax. <br /> <br /> The most scandalous of all (PLOT ELEMENT TO BE REVEALED) is probably the most free and fancy act in the history of a semi-serious movie. One can imagine filmmakers saying: "We need JoBeth to throw the top ... hmmm ... I have it! ... at the beginning of the movie, let Nick give an absurd dialogue about how to strip in the corridors. .. then JoBeth can use this line on him later and REALLY hides in the hallway ... yeah, this is a ticket! "<br /> <br /> I'll give credit producers a hard time to deal with in 1984, one that turned out to be too heavy in the late 90s thanks to events like Columbine, but the performance is terrible. a dark comedy in the style of "Heathers", a political campaign declaration such as "The Web" or a serious exam like "Brubaker." Instead, he tries to be all these things - and ultimately is not one of those things. "Teachers" receive F.
