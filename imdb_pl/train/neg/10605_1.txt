It was a terrible waste of my time. No plot. The operation has been below the standard so far, should be used as an example in the classes of operation of what NOT to do. This is just a commercial stripping of an earlier Universal Soldier who also scrapes the bottom of a functioning barrel. It is sad that VD must confirm his ego every few years, and even sadder that people will pay good money to go through them. This kind of schlock gives Martial Arts movies a bad name. For comparison, it makes Segall, Norris and Arnold look almost talented. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the VD should take part in Leslie Nielson and ship his species. At least we could laugh with him instead of him.
