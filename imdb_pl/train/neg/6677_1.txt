After reading the first 5 reviews of IMDb, I was very enthusiastic about this film. But it's really a terrible movie, the total time you see the alien is about 5 minutes (the rest of the movie is cheap), the acting is on top, and the story, oh, which story? br /> History does not seem to be heading towards, first understand the stranger (after 7 years!), then they do not know what to do with it (after 7 years?), and even want to spend it (why the hell they did it?). Then the girl who behaves best, wants to leave this madness, and then suddenly does not do it, then again, and she does not. Then they come to the conclusion that killing a stranger will kill the entire human race (and remember that for all these years no other person has seen these permanently embedded aliens) and what are they doing? They torture him and blow up a group of aliens. <br /> <br /> This is my first review on IMDb, I'm a very lazy person who does not write too fast, so listen to my warning: this move is not worth your time, do not watch this movie.
