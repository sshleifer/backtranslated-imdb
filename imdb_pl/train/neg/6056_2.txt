Honestly, this movie is another of a series of huge disappointments ... most of these so-called "horror movie" movies are scary in terms of side effects and ridiculous plots ... except Ron Perlman, everyone else in this movie can not save their lives ... the shots sounded like someone was playing Bop-it under the boom microphone or something and it looked completely unrealistic ... in general, this movie is as scary as Home Sam ... the only good masters are Cigarette Burns, Jennifer and maybe Pelts ... I do not know how these directors can sleep at night, knowing that they ruined the same genre that some of them once really understood. .
