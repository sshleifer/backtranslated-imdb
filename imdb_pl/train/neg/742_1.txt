If this movie had a budget of 20 million, I would just like to know where the money went. The monkey could get better CGI effects than what's been wasted for three hours on this awful piece of garbage, although I must admit that machines and Martians would look really, really cool in the original game on Station 1 and early PC games since the mid-90s, if there ever was a game. What makes me wonder where the money went? Pendragon's films could make a great movie with good old models and computer-controlled camcorders by la George Lucas from 1975-83 and actors who look as if they cared about what they do (or ruin in this case) about the same 20 million. It's probably the worst movie you've ever done! I would prefer to sit in a 24-hour Ishtar show again than watch this movie again. I hated it completely! RegresujÄ™. I say it IS THE WORST movie ever made, because unlike other bad films such as Plan 9 or Killer Tomatoes, or Santa Claus conquers the Martians, these are films that are so bad that you have a special place for them heart, you love them. There is no love for this movie and there is no room for it in my DVD library. I sold it to a guy for a dollar. I bet the money for the movie has been spent on alcohol and other vices for the cast and crew. Shame on you, Pendragon videos! He wants my money back!
