A TV movie about an ancient Egyptian curse brought to the United States in the 1920s during the filming of the first version of the 10 Commandments of DeMille, which will be awakened again when the DeMille sets are discovered in the desert. movies that I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> The question is whether the filmmakers were serious or joking? If it's serious, it's a ridiculously bad movie and a great movie that can be considered bad. If his comedy is less good, but funny for the wrong reasons. You will laugh long and hard in this movie, probably more than many other Hollywood comedies.
