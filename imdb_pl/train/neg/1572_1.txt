One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Horrible acting, funny "action" (it's clear that cars are driving slowly), horrible scenario, hideously unsatisfying ending and incompetent direction create a mix of film. We know that Judge Reinhold is a great actor, but he should be ashamed of this detritus. There is not much tension in the car, and when the heroes stumble over moments of hope, they laugh for some reason like inane banshees, even "high fifty" when they see the bridge abandoned! <br /> <br /> In addition, a chain of events that lead these people to share the same car credibility. Apparently, however, based on real events? If it is, the truth is of course stranger than fiction! Unfortunately, it was presented in such inept ways.
