This movie was not terrible, but it was not very good. I'm a big fan of Toni Collette. I think she is a very beautiful and talented actress. The film begins with Robin Williams, who is a writer and gets a book from a 14-year-old child. The book is great and can not believe that the child wrote it. Toni Collette is a caregiver for children who do not know if this kid really exists or does everything. I will not destroy the movie, but I will say that the film is not frightening. <br /> <br /> Acting is pretty good, and Toni Collette's performance was amazing, as did Robin Williams. <br /> <br /> The film was a huge disappointment in my opinion that I would wait until it appeared on DVD.
