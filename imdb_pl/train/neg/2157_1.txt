Siskel and Ebert were wonderful in this program, whether you agreed with them or not, because of the real conflict that their separate professional opinions caused. Roeper took this performance to one or two positions, because he was not really a film critic and because he replaced snide for opinion. Now that Ben Lyons appears, I feel like I'm watching "Teen News" - do you know this children's program, run by children for kids? Manckiewitz is not much better. It is obvious that throughout their lives they encountered only a constant diet of mainstream films. The idea that these two amateurs have something interesting or consequent to say about movies is ridiculous. If they browse a movie without a formula, they are completely lost. Show them something original and intelligent - they just consider it "confusing". Wait - I think I understand ... ABC is Disney property ... Disney is making films for children. While Siskel, Ebert and Roper promoted independent films and were only a hit in big budget productions - what a surprise: these two guys LOVE the great studio Schlock and only tolerate a few indies. In addition, everyone knows the age group that TV advertisers are seeking. Glaring nepotism is the icing on the cake. In what alternative universe are they qualified as film critics?
