One thing that amazed me in this film (and not in a good way) is the fact that Nathan Stoltzfus, who seems to be proud of being the main historian on the subject of Rosenstrasse, was one of the historians working on this film, taking into account how many actual events have been changed or ignored. <br/> <br /> Another reviewer said that von Trotta said he never intended to go to Lena in Goebbels' bed, but in that case, why did she seem to have done just that? Why not show other possible reasons for the release of men, such as the catastrophe of Stalingrad or the fear of the Nazis that an international press in Berlin will learn about the protest. <br /> <br />, why did the whole story play a second role in the poor history of the family relationship that was repeated over and over again? Certainly something as amazing as it could have its own story! In some places, the film had two feature lines that seemed to have little in common. <br /> <br /> In general, the film failed with the goal of drawing attention to the little-known act of resistance, which is a shame because it could have had a big impact because it was done better.
