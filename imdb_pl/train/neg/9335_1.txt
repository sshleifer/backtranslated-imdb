The reason for this is the bad movie, because it is very badly written, and it's only the fault of the writer-hacker Robert James Waller, also the author of Bridges of Madison County. Writing is bad because the plot is completely banal and the dialogue is wooden and unlikely. The falling couple - a blocked American writer and a pretty Mexican woman with a history she is ashamed of - is kidnapped by a strong, self-proclaimed criminal, and after a few adventures (mostly terribly violent) alternated with scenes that show the warmer side of the killer, she leaves the killer's powerless partner who, being angry, sees her more clearly than anyone before. Nothing can help this film to succeed, not even the face of Scott Glenn as an assassin, but the light-hearted Giovanna Zacar√≠as as Luz, and even the steadfast performance of Harvey Keitel as a CIA specialist assigned to track the killer. A serious waste of time.
