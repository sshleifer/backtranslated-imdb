I looked at it with the hope that I would learn something. I did not know about the most infamous man in recent history and could not help thinking that history was rewritten in HITLER: THE GROWTH OF EVIL. Hitler was so obsessed with his niece that he threatened to shoot one of her devotees. Hitler appeared with a gun in his hand to arrest Ernst Rohm. Forgive me for asking, but the writers did not mistake Adolf Hitler with Tony Montana of SCARFACE? This is bad enough, but what really hurts me is the lack of whole fragments of the historical context in this mini series. Germany lost the first world war, and the allied powers caused that Germany paid a high price for it. It was the economic environment that prompted the German people to have someone - anyone - to restore pride and that's why they turned to Nazism. The German humiliation of the twenties caused by the allied forces seems to be completely lost, so there is no way that HITLER: GROWTH OF EVIL be taken seriously as a historical document, and even did not mention that Himmler and Goering are conspiratorial by lack of them. <br /> <br / > There is one positive point about the mini series and Robert Carlyle in the title role. Ok, some of his mannerisms are bad, and his voice is a bit too loud (recordings show that Hitler had a soft, seductive voice), but Carlyle is a charismatic actor and manages to pass on Hitler's own charisma on screen. Comments in the British press that Carlyle is more like a synthesizer from Sparks than Adolph Hitler, are unfounded and give one of Hitler's better interpretations. <br /> <br /> I liked the performance of Robert Carlyle, but I hated everything else about this mini series and I wondered why it was done on Earth first. There is nothing to recommend to serious history fans
