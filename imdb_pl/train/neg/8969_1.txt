The plot does not offer any new emotions, it even starts the same way as the ankle I. This time there are no other improvements to the cube mechanism, with the exception of having an additional exit that is not guarded, very ingenious. The characters are not as well-developed as in the first episode, they have become "flat" as in the soap opera. <br /> <br /> If someone gets to the normal exit, a person will receive a few questions, "do you believe in God?", it is not very creative or original, and especially in my opinion, do not fit in the mystery of the cube with by traps. There really is nothing more to say about it.
