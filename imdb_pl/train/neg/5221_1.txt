Hello, I'm from Denmark and one day I had a film evening with my friends. One brought him the film "Russian Terminator" and was extremely horrible. After watching less than half a minute, we decided to go forward, stopping only on some funny "backlights", or should I say "lowlights" in the film. I was actually surprised when I found out that this movie was produced here, in my homeland, Denmark ... it must have been the biggest mistake this country ever made.
