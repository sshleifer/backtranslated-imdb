My favorite quotation from Crow was when the car descended from the cliff: "The movie is so bad, even the car wants to get out of it!" <br /> <br /> It must have been the funniest movie ever to see. It was serious to scare you, which makes it even more fun! If it were not for the Mystery Science Theater, I would not be here today! :-P
