This is not a film, it is a 111-minute Evangelical-Christian sermon covered with red sports of the American state, a football high school. Another of the long, serious messages for converts who are considered to be fired by the spirit to go abroad and convert the unsaved neighbors. <br /> <br /> A dialogue in the style of "You win big when you agreed to Christ" loses all possible camp appeal by disturbing intensity in the sunken black eyes of the director / trainer Alex Kendrick. There are also "parables". <br /> <br /> Two farmers prayed for rain, but only one prepared his field to receive them. What do you think God blessed? This rhetorical question is meant to herald a wonderful climax, during which Coach asks his trembling reserve killer: "Son, do you think God can help you with this kick?" This is the kind of entertainment that we would expect if they received a funding based on on faith infinitely, if only the hegemonic pursuit of the Evangelical-Christian administration of Bush throughout the world convinced us all of the "piety" after their example. See how this poor coach Giants in the apocalyptic finale, calling his team to cry, "Who is with me!". while pious Eagles on the other side quietly did the work of the Lord. <br /> <br /> So you think our terrified support makes his kick overcome selfish Goliaths? Well, we all know that fanatics can not lose. Put it this way: Move the game field into the Middle East deserts, replace Christian proselytism, and this scathing nonsense can easily be repacked as a Taliban-Power-Power parable that pious worshipers of this garbage may want about a minute. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, they will not worry about it, nor will they have to: as Coach tells the team serious empty dishes, the answers are here in this book. And the Christian right will devour it on the way to his rapture, to whose final victory they have prepared their fields.
