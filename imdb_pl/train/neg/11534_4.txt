* WARNING * Contains MANY SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> Let me start by saying that I have a huge respect for the amazing talent of Gillian Anderson as a diverse and versatile actress - that's why I can not understand the reasons why I agree to this film after seeing the script (or lack of it) ) <br /> <br /> The premise of the film was, in my opinion, a great idea and there were genuinely inspirational themes, but it ended up like a collapsed souffl√©. He is an example of why I hate 99% of British cinema. It's a long feeling, most of it boring, and nothing happens after the first twenty minutes. When you think there is a chance that he will raise speed, he disappoints like Paula Radcliffe running a marathon. With little directing imagination and a minimalist story, there is not much for the audience to nod in popcorn. As for the script, I can only assume that the writer tried to save a few trees, with the average scene reading something like "Alice: F *** OFF!" (Adam staring, Adam escaping into the forest) (Alice follows) Alice: ADAM! ADAM! I suspect that, word for word, the actors probably got more money than Kate Moss for Virgin Mobile ads. What few poems did not contain too many variations with the frequent use of the word "f" that would make Bridget Jones's friend Shazza proud. The main characters do not have too many arrangements before the main, obscure event that leaves the audience lack of sympathy for the characters except the automatic reaction "Oh, it's terrible". <br /> <br /> Alice is not a woman who has compassionate judgment. He has a great job, an expensive London flat with a place for a roof to die for, but he appears on the screen as conceited, bitter and dissatisfied before her life turns into the worst. After the attack, several layers are torn off, which explains why it begins; she grew up with a soldier-like soldier who thought that teaching her how to shoot a gun was the ultimate expression of love, so instead of following in her footsteps, she fled to a big city looking for something to make her feel that her life was worth living. Instead, she found a group of stereotypical middle-class Toffs who look at anyone who is not rich enough to drive Lexus and luxuries that are equipped with an integrated security / entertainment system (e.g., Become Mrs. Robinson and want to be a prudent Cockney electrician) ) Someone gives me a handkerchief. The only advantage of this character is that it is played by Gillian Anderson. In the hands of a smaller actress she would be unbearable one-dimensional, but Mrs. Anderson can actually inject a few fleeting moments of humanity into this lifeless human being, especially when she sincerely apologizes for her craze on the road in a vain attempt to stop the attackers from continuing the attack. <br /> <br /> I can not say that Adam did much better. Danny Dyer played it well as a fish out of water, but this good performance did not save him from the lack of script and the total lack of any background of the character. <br /> <br /> This movie was mainly based on shock values, but the time was off and it seemed too complicated from beginning to end. As for the shock, the most shocking thing about this movie is the shameless demonstration of how painfully Mrs. Anderson has become; it was as disturbing as the violent scenes of the attack. By the way, only in the British film gang of violent sexual assailants will take the time to offer each other contraception before it continues to support its colleagues - talk about a stiff upper lip taken to the extreme! If it's the kind of movie that National Lottery transfers money, then I'm not surprised that fewer and fewer people decide to spend their pounds every week. <br /> <br /> Saying that I hate this movie gives him too much recognition, I did not care about any character to guarantee strong emotions. I want this one and a few hours of my life to come back, please!
