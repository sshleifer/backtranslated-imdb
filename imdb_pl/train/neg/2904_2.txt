If in the first 10 minutes of this movie you do not realize that the main character who writes a column of advice on life, will have tables - yes - cleverly turned back and learn valuable lessons of life, then probably there is something wrong with you . Configuration is so predictable that it will ruin the movie, even if the rest of the movie was good (which is not) <br /> <br /> There is almost no chemistry between the leaders, and Steve Carell's stalker-ish behavior is embarrassing, not fun. It's hard to believe that Binoche's character will interest him. In the end, everything is so wonderful and everyone lives happily ever after. Is not that great America!
