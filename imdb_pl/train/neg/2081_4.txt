This film is recently shown on cable TV, so ... <br /> <br /> There is no excuse for these 2 attractive women to fight for either Luke Wilson or the equally boring "villiana" in this film. Actresses are cute and that's the only reason to watch this movie. I suppose it's "funny" that even the uglier friend Luke is around, but well, that's what we get. <br /> <br /> None of the female leaders would ever talk to any men in this movie for over 5 minutes. We get them sobbing, crying and fighting, and so on, more than 2 guys who best described on Friday, June 13th. Dead * @ $ #
