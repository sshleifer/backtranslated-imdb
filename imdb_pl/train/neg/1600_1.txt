The biggest hit of National Lampoon remains "Animal House" and rightly so. It was fun, noisy and good-natured. <br /> <br /> The exact opposite of every other National Lampoon movie. In this "Class Reunion". <br /> <br /> PLEASE do not be fooled by the inclusion of Stephen Furst ("Flounder") from "Animal House". Or the fact that John Hughes wrote this chaotic mess. This meeting is almost as much fun as the root canal and twice as painful. <br /> <br /> One star, and that's generous. On the other hand, I always thought that most of my old colleagues were demons, vampires and serial killers.
