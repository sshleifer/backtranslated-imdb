Let me really understand this movie. I did not watch this movie because of the plot, I watch it for sex-prone scenes. That said, this movie is so damn horrible that I turn away between pure joy seeing the pious body of Traci (Mandy Schaffer) and crumbling my eyeballs in the event of a catastrophe. <br /> <br /> Spoiler Alert The first scene of the film has already embarrassed me ... you see a woman painting something on the shore of the lake, in pure bliss and peace, then a beautiful girl approaches and asks if she could paint next to her. When they both finished, they showed each other what they had done ... and the woman painted a Wine WHEN IS DAMAGED IN THE LAKE OF THE LAKE. Which screwdriver director would make such a mistake? In another scene, Traci kills his teacher's mistress, smashing him with a sailing pole, and then he leaves, and none of the city police has ever suspected her. I mean HELLOOOOO? MANDY DO NOT WEAR THE GLOVES OR DO NOT HER RINGS FINGERS ARE ALL THERE'S GOD DAMN BOAT !! After that, it gets the worst when Mandy is around, there is a "bloodcurdling" sound effect that sounds like a cat in a hissy fit. It is also a pity that Rosanna Arquette is in this film. I am very sorry about the fact that she has to play in this super-low soft-budget budget. The same applies to JÃ¼rgen Prochnow, who also has the misfortune to play in this film. A total of 2/10.
