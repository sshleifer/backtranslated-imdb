Encouraged by positive comments about this movie, I was looking forward to watching this movie. Bad error. I've seen over 950 movies and this is really one of the worst of them - it's awful in almost every aspect: editing, tempo, storyline, soundtrack "acting" (the only song in the movie - lame melody - playing less than four times). The film is cheap and nasty, and extremely boring. I rarely enjoyed seeing the final credits of the film. <br /> <br /> The only thing that bothers me is the one-point result of Harvey Keitel - although this is far from his best performance, at least it seems that he is making some effort. One only for Keitel's obsession.
