Oh my God. I bought this movie and ... I ... watched ... the whole ... thing .... . Okay, everything will be fine ... I know everything will be fine in a month or two. Soon I hope to get rid of flash memory. I was going to eat something after the movie, but I just can not be brave enough to try and refrain from eating. Bad? So bad. Very bad. BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD. Wait, the bad does not seem to convey the message in the right way. Hmm ... There is no word to describe how horrible ... not terrible ... Hmm obrzydliwie okropnie obsadzony / zagrany / nakrÄ™cony / directed / written. Now I do not know what to do, but throw it away. I will probably burn it, I would not like it to end at the bottom of an architectural excavation in a thousand years. The worst movie since "Hey Happy"
