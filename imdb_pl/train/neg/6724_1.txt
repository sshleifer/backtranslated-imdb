When you choose a movie, I hope that one of the factors that you will consider is whether the actors in the film use their fame to influence positively or negatively the moral tissue of our society? This is not a political declaration, it is a moral issue that results in society. When the comedian / actor does agile sexual and racist remarks about the teenager and her father, we should ask ourselves (do I want to support this behavior)? In this case, Mr. Foxx's conduct tears apart the social fabric that teaches our youth evil, the good behavior of evil, that goodness is better than hatred. Mr. Foxx should remember that it is only entertainment and there is a lot to choose from. Saying sorry does not take him off the hook. This will not result in excessive injury or removal of bad behavior that is spreading to our youth. One way to stop this behavior is to stop being a fan. You can not see anything that is part of it anymore. We can not change them, but we can stop the fame we give them.
