I do not know about you, but I always felt attracted to the cinema "ART". The first "artistic" movie that I managed to get was "The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover" by Peter Greenaway, who inflated my mind and creative flash. The film was the ultimate paradox, both beautiful and grotesque ... that's what it was in the "artistic cinema", exploring intellectual ideas and aiming at the screen. Life, real life, can be like living in a madhouse, and the art expressed shows what it is. I love movies of all types, but especially those that both play and have something to say, regardless of whether I agree with his attitude or not ... <br /> <br /> "8 1/2 WOMEN ", is a dry, clinical" comedy "in which father and son gather a harem to fill their many sexual fantasies. In the film there is only a brief allusion to Fellini, in contrast to what the announcements suggest. The main aim of the film is the "close" relationship between father and son, combined after the death of mothers. In the early scenes of the film, the sadness of the fathers is credible, you can feel his pain. What happens next is obvious thanks to Greenaway standards, the harem assembly, observations about love and death and the bodies shown for the good of the body ... You can argue, but I feel that the film is shallow and pointless. The idea that it can be a comedy is embarrassing to me. Acting for the most part, if it's okay ... Polly Walker and Amanda Plummer are especially good (although poor Mandy should put her clothes back on) What is missing from the movie is a fascinating story and the usual green accents of excess that made his other great films to watch. <br /> <br /> Filled with insight and occasionally taboo, "8 1/2 woman" is too cut to be considered an art, too bland to be considered "funny" and simply too boring to be considered valuable. <br /> <br /> Save your money ... I can only recommend this movie as a sleeping bag. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
