SCHIZOPHRENIAC: THE WHORE MANGLER is another example of what happens when you gather a group of non-talented people to create an "extreme" horror. Any kind of acting, production, plot, effects, etc. He goes out the window, trying to create a "shock value". Do not get me wrong - I consider myself a connoisseur of "shocking" movies, and better / gorier / nastier the better - but it's still nice to see SOMEONE a kind of talent from SOMEONE involved in the movie. <br /> <br /> SCHIZOPHRENIAC describes the life of Harry Russo - a drug-addicted show maniac who accepts the order to kill the ventriloquist, Rubberneck, from the manikin. He rides a few madness by killing whores and other random people and shouting about how much he hates "hoo-uhs" (it's "whores" for those of you who do not say New York-ese ...) and how he wants to rape them in ass. There are a few weak scenes of necrophilia, very little gore, and some nudity to mix a little - but nothing you have seen in a better movie ... <br /> <br /> The only thing that is redemption In this delayed movie I can find often (unintentionally?) Funny screams of our main character, Harry. He and he-on-and-on-it-on-and-on and wants to kill everyone and make them ass, and it really becomes quite comical after a while. To tell the truth, I am almost tempted to believe that there should be some kind of homo-erotic subtext in it, with all the asses and continuous shots of Harry running with the hanging dong. Honestly, this joker is more a nekkid in this movie than the few hatchlings that show a bit of T-and-A (and some full-face, tailor-made). SCHIZOPHRENIAC is a bit fun as a one-time watch, but I can really recommend it only to those who want to be able to say they've watched a movie called SCHIZOPHRENIAC: THE WHORE MANGLER. To be honest - the title - so far - is the best thing in this shirt ... Hojny 3,5 / 10
