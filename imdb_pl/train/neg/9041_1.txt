I liked the movie despite its crazy pace. BUT, I did not appreciate the comment that Canada was referred to as Montana North. Surely it is NOT Montana North and it will never be. Americans are wondering why they are perceived as arrogant in the rest of the world, and this is one of the reasons. Stop teaching children from the United States that they think they own the planet. Such a central worldview does not become one of the largest nations in the world. Even in jokes. I would never call the USA "Albert South". Walt has never let us down, so why start. Besides, the movie was quite goofy, next time more luck.
