A remake of an excellent stage movie from 1972, nicely casting Caine as the nemesis of his first movie character. But nothing else does anything nice. <br /> <br /> Not very successful performance of actors, Law and Caine, weakened by poor complacency. <br /> <br /> The warmth setting in the original is omitted in the state-of-the-art home settings. The subtle play of Oliver and Caine, which made the first movie so visible, is replaced by terrible, insolent arrogance, which immediately gives rise to contempt for the viewer. But this is not wise, sympathetic and disliked than the second character, which developed the original so well, it is obvious the murder of both characters from the very beginning. <br /> <br /> This version of Sleuth is not really worth watching, watch the original movie and be stunned by the opening act.
