I know that I fall asleep during movies, but it is usually caused by a combination of various things, including very tired, being warm and comfortable at sette and just eating a lot. However, on this occasion I fell asleep, because the movie was junk. The development of the story was permanent. Always slow and boring. Something seemed to happen, but without explaining what was causing it or why. I admit that I could have missed a part of the film, but I watched the majority of the film and everything seemed to share with one's will without worrying about anything else. I can not recommend this movie at all.
