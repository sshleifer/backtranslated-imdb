What a horrible movie. The only reason you would like to sit in this mess is the pleasant view of Miss Eleniak. The painful taking over of Mr. McNamara, which sometimes became embarrassing, ruined something that could be a reasonable movie if the right actors were cast. Mr. McNamara is not Tom Cruise, the actor who apparently wants to be.
