This series is one of the worst performances I've ever seen. Horrible acting, terrible effects, terrible writing, you'll get my drift. The stories are so far from Robin Hood's legend that it is amazing. It looks like they wanted to use the name Robin Hood to attract the audience. You might as well call "New Adventures of Mr. Bland." <br /> <br /> Someone told me earlier that if you had imagination, you would love this program. It's a horrible approach to the TV series. Visual media, such as this, should stimulate your imagination, you should not force your imagination to be good. It would be like an episode of the Simpsons in which they try to homer a religious propaganda film and begin to talk about who killed someone or anything. "If the movie is boring, I invent my own story." <br /> <br /> In summary: Absolute human waste.
