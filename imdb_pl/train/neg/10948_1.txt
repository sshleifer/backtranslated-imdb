What did they think at "Cannes"? One of the most annoying movies of all time. Every detail of this movie, no matter how insignificant it was shown. If I had to watch him put on those shoes, I think I would shout again. If the purpose of the film was to show how pathetic Roseta's life is, it was discussed within the first fifteen minutes of the movie, and then the credits should be launched. But no, we have had to watch countless unnecessary scenes repeatedly. The whole was filled with unpleasant and unpleasant figures. They deserved the misery of Rosetta. And to think that I gave up on "Tumbleweeds" to see this exaggerated movie of boredom. It was like watching grass grow, but it's more exciting.
