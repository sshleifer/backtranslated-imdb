"Rambo: the first part of the blood of II" by George P. Cosmatos is a pure fulfillment of wishes. The United States apparently did not win the Vietnam War. They caused damage in this country beyond the imaginary and this film continues the fairy-tale story of o-so innocent soldiers. The only evil people were the leaders of the nation who led to this war. Character Rambo notices this perfectly. He is extremely patriotic, he is mourning that Americans do not appreciate and underestimate the achievements of a single soldier, but they have nothing but distrust for leading officers and politicians. Like every movie that defends wars (eg, "We were soldiers"), it also avoids the need to give a comprehensible reason for engagement in South Asia. And that's also about every American-American soldier who was there. Instead, Rambo will take revenge for the wounds of the entire nation. It would be better to work on how to deal with memories than to suppress them. "Will we win this time?" Yes, you do.
