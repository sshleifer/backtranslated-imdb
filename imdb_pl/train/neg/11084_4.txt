"Tyson", a very ordinary "tailor-made" product, tries to be a serious biographical film, at the same time stretching anger moments to the effect, quickly passing the esoterism of the corrupt boxing sport and mixing sensational things that are the only thing that makes Tyson even very interesting. A summer watch at best that will appeal to the general public more than boxing fans.
