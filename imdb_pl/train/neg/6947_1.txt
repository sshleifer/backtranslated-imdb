No doubt one of the worst movies I've seen in recent years. The story focuses on four women forced to rob banks, with whom we have some sympathy. It is difficult to sympathize with characters who make such stupid decisions. Oh no, the cops are on us, they know who we are, what are we doing? ... Let's make another bank and then we're from here! What!?! Each character is a stereotype and it is easy to tell who is dead.
