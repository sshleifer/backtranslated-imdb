Polyester was the first movie of John Water, which I saw, and I must say that it was also the "worst" movie I have seen so far. <br /> <br /> In the "water talent" group there were a few people who I'm sure I worked for food and I was ready to say what Waters wrote. Every thing in the movie is awful, acting, camera, editing, and the story of a woman played by 300 lb God's transvestite was purely absurd. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I have to recommend this movie because it is very funny and you will not believe the shit that poor Francine has. Her son is sucking solvents and stupidly unsuspecting women's feet in the grocery store. Her daughter is the saddest whore in the city. Her husband is a cackling A-hole pornographer who does all he can to embarrass and humiliate poor Francine. <br /> <br /> Francine's only friend is Edith Massey, probably the worst actress ever. Edith looks and sounds like she's reading lines from a memory card and has never seen a script before filming. <br /> <br /> Despite all the hardships of Francine, Waters is preparing a great end to Hollywood and everyone (who survives) lives happily ever after.
