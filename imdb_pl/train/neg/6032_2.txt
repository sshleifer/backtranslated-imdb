I am a Christian who generally believes in theology taught on the Left. With that in mind, I think Left Behind is one of the worst movies I've seen in a while. <br /> <br /> To have a good movie, you must have a well-written script. Left Behind fell pitifully on the subject. First of all, he is radically different from the book. Sometimes this is to shorten a 400-page novel up to a two-hour movie, but in this movie I saw changes that did not make sense at all. <br /> <br /> Another thing is the lack of character development. When characters in history are saved (I will not say who), the book explains that it is a long process of searching for the soul. The film is fast and artificial. The book is written quite decently, where people like Rayford Steele, Buck Williams and Hattie Durham seem real, but in the film scenarios are consistently subjected to rapid treatment without anything significant. In another scene, in which one character is angry because of being left behind (again, I will not say who), it seems artificial. <br /> <br /> I realize that as a Christian it does not matter to me that I do not like this movie, but I can not in good conscience recommend a movie that I think is terribly done. Perhaps it would be better to make the first book in 2-3 movies. In any case, Christians need to be aware that to be taken seriously as filmmakers, we must start by making a film of good quality. I realize that probably a lot of effort has been put in Left Behind, but that's how I see it.
