Unlike the "Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai," "Great Troubles in Little China" or "Conan the Barbarians," which are horrible films that have a certain coolness and sense of humor that turn them into a cult sensation, the Golden Child is just bad. <br /> <br /> The premise is not unmanageable, and there are some funny moments. But here the "reversed attitude" of Eddy Murphy simply empties any feeling of tension or danger in history. Special effects are so stupid that they cause more damage to this voltage. The "mysterious secrets" of Tibetan Buddhism are rather amused than forced to coerce. <br /> <br /> Without feeling that the stake is anything or that the heroes are facing a real threat, why should we care? br /> <br /> Who should see this movie: <br /> <br /> - Eddy Murphy's big fans who can not stop <br /> <br /> - I can not think of anyone inny <br /> <br /> I'll give this movie 4 out of 10 for an occasional joke that worked.
