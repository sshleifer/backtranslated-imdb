The plot is simple: an old man living on the main road in the forest one day witnesses the murder of a child in the forest. Soft For Digging follows the old men trying to convince the police that what he saw is not a figment of his imagination. However, every time the old man leads the police to the place where the murder was committed, there is no problem. Soft For Digging has a small dialogue that reflects most scenes of the film, an old man living alone at home. During the film, I became convinced that I was twice afraid when a murdered child suddenly appears in front of an old man. The rest of the movie, which I must admit, did not involve me; I considered the tempo of the film too slow. Limited dialogue was not a problem. However, the development of the story and its conclusions, after watching the film, lasted too long. I feel that more could be done from relationships, spiritual encounters with a child and an old man. Alone in the forest at night, uncertain of your own mind can lead to strange situations, children are always terrifying like ghosts, see Dark Water.
