Chris Kattan is a great sketch actor on Saturday Night Live ... but he probably should leave the film industry alone unless he gets some creative control. He plays an annoying, nervous figure that basically comes out with a slight delay and speed. Do you want to meet only funny parts? Things that showed in the announcements. Yes, his shot is funny. Nothing else is. ESPECIALLY, when it can be said that he is trying very hard to become a physical comedian, which he should not try because he is one. And yet his "demolition of the vet's office" is just as bad. This movie has caused me to develop eye convulsions. Avoid it at all costs and watch SNL.
