First of all, I really loved Henry Fool, which puts me in a very small group of film viewers. Parker Posey is one of the best actresses on screen today. But this movie was a complete parody. Watching Hartley and the actors talking about the movie in the extras - so full of pride and meaningless analogies with Star Wars - turned into a stomach. This was the noise in some producers (HDNET) realized to the maximum. A real example of the emperor and his new clothes. Mainly I think that Hal broke HENRY FOOL forever. I do not think I have ever seen it again in my pure, innocent light. <br /> <br /> Remember Hal, you can occasionally pet some people ... etc. The director will not be here today if all he did did throw away a senseless junk. Unfortunately, this is a pure example of the lesson from ADAPTATION. The story must be exciting and active, or her hopes for cash are really weak. No decent story. For the actors it was like trying to act in a straitjacket. <br /> <br /> The result, I believe that Hartley, is tasteless. With percussion hits going through the entire dialog. I found one Apple Soundtrack loop I recognized, which made me smile. <br /> <br /> When I saw the trailer, I thought oh, they're just trying to catch a new audience. But it's really this funny ride. I would gladly ruin this movie for you, but it has been done. It is broken. Franchise FOOL is dead. Long live Henry Fool.
