Although it is not as bad as its adaptation to games, this piece of crud does not do better. <br /> <br /> Boll seems to have a pathological inability to accept the fact that he does not make good movies. In one of those days he will run out of money and stop asking his world bombs. <br /> <br /> Acting was below normal, the dialogue sounded as if they were reading TelePrompter and the special little accents of Bolla were seen all the time. <br /> <br /> Like all Uwe Bolla movies, this one simply should not exist. <br /> <br /> Plain and simple. <br /> <br /> Only how Uwe Boll should not exist. > _>
