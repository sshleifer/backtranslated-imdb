When I rented movies for free, I chose it. OOPS The things that I wanted to mention outside of the summary provided above were the following. 1: Someone who had a lot in common with the fact that this movie had a strange and sick fascination with food was disgusting and unnecessary. 2: In the background of the movie there is a soundtrack that seems to be present all the time, and by the way I felt for a few days after seeing this basket, I think that they had something subliminal on the path. Either that or it was just traumatically bad or both. Many times throughout the film you can say that the screenwriter and director did not have much experience or talent. And do not even ask for acting.
