Horrible acting, horrible cast and cheap props. It would be much better if it was set as a parody-style movie. What a loss. Starting from the name of the movie. <br /> <br /> "The Enemy" Naming it "Action Movie" would make it better. (contributing to the effect of parody). The policeman looks like a 60-year-old player, the blonde has the same empty, boring facial expression all the time. At the end of the movie, he and she work together to destroy the bad guys and every time they exchange words, they feel like cheap lines given before the sex scene in a porn movie. Awful. Do not waste time.
