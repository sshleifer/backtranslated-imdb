Below the average movie with bad music, considering the movie based on music ??? An ordinary screenplay and direction with full errors. Salman Khan played as usual. Ajaya's performance deteriorated with the passage of time, and his appearance, especially the Rock Star styles, were pathetic. Asin was just a showcase. In general, I wanted to waste money in the cinema. Salman Khan remains as immature as 10 years ago when compared to Aamir Khan. There were many boring songs in the movie, with the exception of 'Man Ko Ati'. The most important song to impress the British music sponsor was the most impressive. "Khanabadosh" can be very easily understood by the English Music Sponsor. Another movie that I saw last week was "Wake Up Sid", which was a simple, slow love story with good direction and acting, despite average music
