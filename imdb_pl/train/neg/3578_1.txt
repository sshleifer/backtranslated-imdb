There is absolutely nothing to buy this movie. They took a crazy story, misread it, wrote it badly, filmed it badly. He has a poor dialogue badly performed in a winding and kitschy story. <br /> <br /> Just as it fails as art, it fails even worse than trade. Who could be the target market. What age group? What group of interest? <br /> <br /> Someone should make a movie about how and why they made the movie. That I would pay to see. <br /> <br /> I've seen thousands of bad movies, and this is "Sailor Who Fell from Grace" and "Manos" ... my choices as the three most unbelievably bad movies I've ever seen. Everyone associated with him should be forced to talk to VanDamme for all eternity. <br /> <br /> I challenge you. Watch this video and do an academic exercise - how can you do it and make it worse? I can not think of one way.
