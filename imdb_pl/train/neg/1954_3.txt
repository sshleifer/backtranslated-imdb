First of all, let's get rid of it. . . Yes, this movie steals LOT from "Darkness Falls" (2003). The plot of the movie "Darkness Falls" looks something like this: The Tooth Fairy, a murderous woman who hides her face because of disfigurement, kills people who look at her with revenge. In "The Tooth Fairy" (2006), the distorted Tooth Fairy (which, yes, he hides his face) releases his furious vengeance on almost everyone. A little too similar to be a coincidence. <br /> <br /> But what you have to ask is: If you are going to directly steal the plot from the film, why choose something as average as "Darkness Falls"? Sure, he earned a few bucks at the box office, but it was closely related to quite a good cinema experience. Low budget, a simple video will not have the same effect. And it was not like that. <br /> <br /> When I watched the first 15-20 minutes of the movie, my expectations really increased. It seemed that there is at least a SOME production value. This story did not seem terrible, it was simply grossly detached. After the first scene we get a graceful cast of characters, including a former doctor with secrets (played by this guy who looks like Busey) and some hot veterinarian (Jenifer from "Masters of Horror: Jenifer" Argento). However, after a few minutes, the movie just slowly drops. It serves all basic horrible stereotypes, including, among others: some crazy old man with unnoticed warning, buff jockowi, psychology and stripper with a heart of gold. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest problems of this film was the inability to stick to the target group. It's a bit like if the filmmakers wanted to change the tone for any character on the screen. When the adults were on the screen, they had a more mature appearance. When there was a star (stripper) on the screen and what was on the face (jockey), the dialogue boiled down to a more stupid, vague immature level. When the kid was on screen, he felt like an episode of "Are You Afraid of the Dark?". . . only less frightening. <br /> <br /> From a technical point of view, the movie is everywhere. Visualizations range from fairly good to ordinary boring. The letter is below normal, as are most actions. On the plus side, there is a bit of excess gore on the part (including a pretty cool (but painfully predictable)) scene of the spurt of wood and quite a malicious scene of the nailer. Also, if you're looking for some sexy things, there is a short topless scene (but if you want to see this topless chick, there are better movies to do). Besides, there is nothing to worry about when it comes to this movie. <br /> <br /> If you're a big fan of "Darkness Falls" (do they exist?), maybe you can check this to see a story done in a different way. . . but that's the only reason I can see him. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 3/10 -AP3-
