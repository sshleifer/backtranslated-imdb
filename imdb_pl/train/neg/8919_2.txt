I saw it for the first time when it was chosen as a suggestion from my TiVo system. I like Danny Elfman and I thought it could be interesting. Besides, I'm a fan of Max Fleischer's work, and it started with the look and style of his 1930s cartoon. In both cases I thought it would interest me. I was wrong. Just a few minutes and I had a fast forward button. I ran it for about 15 minutes and I thought it was it. <br /> <br /> Then I read some other reviews here and came to the conclusion that I did not give them enough chances. I recorded it again and watched it. 75 minutes of my life I'm not going back. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that there are no more bad reviews. Personally, I think that's because it's hard to get a minimum of 10 lines of comment. How many ways can you say that it is a waste of time? <br /> <br /> The film appears as if it was made by a few younger kids ready to outrage the world and think they can with their breasts, profanities and playful jokes. Characters are flat. The parody of "Swinging the Alphabet" is a poor, essentially paving melody, passing through A-E, striking at the obvious "F" vulgarisms, and then having no idea where to go. Traveling through the intestines to the expected landing does not work the first time, let alone the next. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is what you can expect from someone who tries to "get out of South Park" Stone and Parker without being able to determine what is and is not fun. It can be fun if you're tall. Otherwise it is not.
