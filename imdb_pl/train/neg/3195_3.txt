Two qualifications at the very beginning: I think that Joe Don Baker can be good and even great with the right material and the right director (remake of "Cape Fear", small role in "Goldeneye", "Walking Tall"). And I even liked Baker in "Mitchell" because he played an anti-hero who could be unacceptable. Yes, the MST3K range was fun, but Baker found a lot of low-cost shots - which he did not deserve - to keep things alive and fun - was right for the level and tone of the movie, and he was the best part of the movie. <br /> <br /> "Final Justice" seems to be the same, but despite the exotic places and theme of "Cowboy Frontier Justice", it is slightly weaker than "Mitchell". And the main reason is that the character Baker, as it was written, is an idiot. The film has an idea that because Baker embodies the old border style, he challenges his opponents with old-fashioned mano-a-mano competitions. And because he is so tough and macho, he always wins, even when hurt, wounded, outnumbered, etc. <br /> <br /> It's conceited with high potential (it worked in the case of Gary Cooper), even if he condemns the movie to the status of the movie "B". But Baker is so damn stupid and obsessive that he unnecessarily challenges the three subordinates of the bad guy to show up in the public market with civilians everywhere. He could just hide them to the headquarters of the evil guy (that's why he followed them) and they would never have noticed. Or he could get them and force them to surrender, and take one of the supporters to the headquarters at the point of the weapon. But no, he must be a hot dog from the league bushes and macho, so he gets the child taken hostage during the shooting! <br /> <br /> Is this the guy we should admire? <br /> <br /> The whole movie is basically like that. Most of the supporting actors are somewhere between OK (supporters) and quite good (the main bad guy and his father, who are two well-known European actors - they just go through movements, but are professionals, and even inhibit they are decent). But by all this, Baker's character is drawn by stupid, unproductive acrobatics and errors that kill at least two relatively innocent people, plus a few bad guys who could be taken alive without using lethal force. <br /> <br /> A positive aspect is that because 90% of the film takes place in Malta or the Mediterranean, you can see many beautiful landscapes and many nice and exotic additions. And indeed, Baker himself may be on the heavy side and a little indisposed, but he is not so bad ... it is certainly not a puddle that film critics (including Mike and Bots in their happy relationship) seem to think. <br /> <br /> In short, this video is good for video wallpaper, but the viewer should not pay attention to it.
