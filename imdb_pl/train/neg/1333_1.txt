I was totally disappointed with this movie. I have read a few other reviews here and had much higher expectations. I was expecting a drama about a more intense character development. But it never happens in the movie. Daniel-Day Lewis is a good actor, but not as good as some reviewers would like us to believe. I thought he repeated the same set of 4 or 5 moves in the movie. I would rate his performance 6 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Acting: 6 out of 10. Direction is 5 out of 10. The script is the worst: 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> removed the movie from my recorder after 70 minutes . for the movie. Much better movies than this ...
