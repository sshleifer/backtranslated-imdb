The idea "In the name of the people" is good, the murderer does not want his only daughter to go to the institution and asks the parents of the girl whom he killed to look after her daughter. And you can expect that actors, especially Scott Bakula, will do something good, unfortunately not! In the name of the people, it turns out that it's just a Friday Friday tear squeezer. Retrospections with a killed girl are quite pathetic and at some stage you can simply predict what the actors will say ... If you want to watch a good movie on this topic, watch Dean Man Walking!
