Roast in a human pot Joe Don Baker (MITCHELL) plays in this boring little-known action movie, as deputy Geronimo, a fat, gas slob who sits in a stupid cowboy suit, listens to country music and eats too many donuts. Meanwhile, vaguely a criminal named Palermo (played by a guy who owned the drill in GATES OF HELL Fulci) falls into the territory of Joe Don and shoots the sheriff on a badly prepared stage. Joe Don - slowly - gives chase and throws brother Palermo after saying his legendary slogan, "It's your move. Do you think you can take me? Come on! For some reason Joe Don, a Texan lawyer, has to transport Palermo to Italy ("Mr. Palermo was the main source of shame for the Italian government," says Mr. Wilson, another obscure character played by Bill McKinney who was in MASTER NINJA 1, SHE FREAK and many good movies by Clint Eastwood). <br /> <br /> Yes, Joe Don's plane must land on the island of Malta, where Palermo escapes with the help of a briefcase and a guy who looks like Jon Lovitz. And there the movie stops. For the rest of the movie, Joe Don is looking for Palermo, he is losing Palermo, he is in a prison cell, the Maltese police chief is complaining about him, and then he is dismissed with a warning not to look for Palermo. Then Joe Don is still looking for Palermo, he is losing Palermo, he is in a prison cell, he is shouted by the police chief in Malta, and then he is released with a warning not to look for Palermo anymore. Then Joe Don is looking for Palermo, he is losing Palermo, he is in a prison cell, he is shouted by the police chief in Malta, and then he is released with a warning not to look for Palermo anymore. This is one aggravating movie. <br /> <br /> At some point Joe Don thinks he is dead at sea. All other characters are wondering if he is dead or not, ultimately reaching the conclusion that he is. But then he appears (he was saved by a poor family) and no one mentions that he was missing at sea for several days. Even his sweet assistant Julia Louise-Dreyfuss-esque does not greet him back. She, however, offers to help him find Palermo, so Joe Don is looking for Palermo, he is losing Palermo, he is in a prison cell, he is being shouted by the police chief in Malta, and then he has warned not to look for Palermo no longer exists. <br /> <br /> Highpoints is a bizarre carnival with strange colorful swimmers, some sexy stripteaseers, a shootout with a kid dressed as Napoleon and a cart with tomatoes, a chase scene with a guy dressed like a monk, and every scene without Joe Don . The lower points are Joe Don threatening the stripper with coat hanger. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that this comes from Greydon Clark, director of ANGEL'S REVENGE, who appears as the sheriff. Ick! <br /> <br />
