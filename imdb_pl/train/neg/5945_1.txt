Black guy is fighting ..... and apparently he wins ... yes ... 1/10. Of course, fiction. <br /> <br /> So we have a nice title, a really nice line of markers, and even a nice storyline ... That's where it ends ... We're moving to fiction for that. <br /> <br /> Michael Jai White, a black guy, so do not be wrong with the name ... he portrays a black guy ... Umm, that's all his name ... <br /> <br /> It's hard to find decent help, he had to hire friends from black guys to help in a low budget, low inefficiency of this movie, the shadow of the camera stretches behind the first scenes .... So obvious moment idiot for the average guy like you and me ... but yes ... <br /> <br /> 10 lines. review submitted. if you paid for watching this movie, you got screwed up.
