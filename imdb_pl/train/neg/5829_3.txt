I watched this movie as a preview of Matthew Barney's art exhibition. She certainly prepared me. I almost skipped the exhibition and, in retrospect, I probably should have. <br /> <br /> Besides the fact that the score is great (Bjork), and the rich and colorful photography, the content was mostly boring and predictable. Man, I really needed to see someone wearing pearls to find out what divers are doing. The film was a stupid mix of Japanese cultural references and industrial shots of modern whaling technology used during hunting / harvesting. The movie "reaches the top" with enough free shock art to turn your stomach away. <br /> <br /> What was the meaning of the movie? While others may argue that this is an element of counteracting whales, it can also be argued that it somehow justifies whaling. Personally, I think it was Barney's attempt to "flicker" the audience with anal fetishes, feces, self-injury and cannibalism. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: unless you really go out to Barney's sense of art, do not worry about watching this movie. The message is vague, the pace is slow, and cultural references pretentious. If you are looking for a shocking art, you can do better in one of the many undead movies or hunt for an old copy of Hustler and take a faeces-cartoon.
