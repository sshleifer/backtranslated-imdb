I saw it in the theater when it came out, and yesterday I saw it again on the cable. I was able to see again the sense of how disgusting this movie is. The whole mass of the characters is absorbed by narcissistic presenters. The worst thing is that it strengthens every negative stereotype of twenty-something dates, even if it aims to celebrate people who "find themselves". Nice guys are finishing last, and the guys are off-putting, the best are the best. All girls are boys on the legs. Only one character ("Wendy") does everything that is useful in society, and resigns from a long-forgotten virginity in a one-time night scene with scum, in a filmed scene, which we should think of a romantic. In fact, this is the Hollywood concept of young America: permissive, detached, promiscuous, conceited.
