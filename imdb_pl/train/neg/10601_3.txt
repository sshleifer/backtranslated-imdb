This is the official continuation of the sci-fi '92 thriller. In the original, Van Damme was one of several dead vets of the Vietnam War who were revived as excellent soldiers (Unisols). In this, I think, about a dozen years later, since Van Damme has a daughter of this age. He is currently working with the government in a secret installation to train the latest Unisols for some reason - codenamed Unisol 2500. As usual, something goes wrong: supercomputer on the spot (named Seth - like a snake in "King Cobra" in the same year) went crazy, takes over commanding the Unisols, and even downloading his computer brain to a new super-Unisol body (Jai White). We're looking for the next step in evolution, people! Most of Van Damme's battles are with one particularly unbelievable Unisol (professional Goldberg wrestler) who just comes: throw him off the building - nothing good; push him in a truck - do not go! Shoot him, burn him - forgetaboutit! Much of the humor comes from how Van Damme is now obsolete and outdated (even graying at the edge). But, though he's taking licking, he's still kicking! Most of the continuation of this type is quite poor - a pale imitation of the originals, and although this is certainly not a genius, she manages to consistently play, especially if you are a wrestling fan.
