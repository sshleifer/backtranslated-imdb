The author of the film, Steven Greenstreet, not only obviously loves Michael Moore, but also follows in his footsteps, using several of Moore's propaganda tactics. Moore, however, has experience in distracting the viewer from this subject, while Greenstreet is of course less qualified. <br /> <br /> Being privy to all issues related to Moore's speech at the UVSC, I was disappointed that the major community complaint - that Moore was getting $ 40,000 from Utah's education funds to basically promote John Kerry's campaign ego and advertise their own liberal film - they were pushed into the background by Greenstreet, while smaller problems were sensational. Br /> <br /> The marketing methods of this film were equally biased and objectionable ... promoting the movie, claiming that "Mormon tried to kill Moore". Not only is it preposterous, it defames the main religion with which Greenstreet obviously has some personal problems. I followed Moore's visit closely, and all the major news agencies noticed that Moore's visit had come and gone without any credible security problems or incidents in Utah. <br /> <br /> Greenstreet has accumulated a film career in this film so much that he even quit film school to speed it up. This seems a serious mistake, however, because Moore's visits to about 60 other colleges and universities across the country in 2004 weakened interest in this rather common event. The assumption of Greenstreet that the American public would be interested in this film because of the promoted religious and conservative angles does not seem to be well-founded. <br /> <br /> Even the name of the film, "It's a divided state," is somewhat mistaken as Utah usually voted for the re-election of Bush and therefore seems to be more politically united than any other state. The division in the title of the film seems to be more indicative of the gulf that exists in the ideological differences of Greenstreet with its religion and state. If anything, I find a humorous correlation between the religious angle of this alleged document and the playful dispute of Woody Allen in Sleeper (1973) that "I was beaten by the Quakers".
