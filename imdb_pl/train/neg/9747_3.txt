First of all, this movie sucks. But let us examine why. Claiming that the machine is able to convert matter into energy, store it, and then transport it and reconnect it is at least intriguing. But it's as far as they put it. Instead of delving into what could happen if someone did this kind of machine, they break that damn thing. That could be a good assumption. Living with responsibility for this kind of power and dealing with constant temptation, i.e. Invisible man. But no ... they break this damn thing. And Lembach wants to leave. So the doctor dropped something to himself and tried to move. Just to beautify him with his beautiful, but stupid secretary, (duh). What would not have happened if Lembach did not decide to leave. So now he is wandering the country, killing people because his little experiment has failed and they did not give him money. Wah. Then, to make the movie worse, put in a dry British relationship between two semi-competent professors hired to help. Between their love sessions, they make several thoughtless attempts to find him while he kills half of London. All this could end without interrupting the damned machine, which would never have happened if Lembach did not leave. This movie tried, so I tried to give him 2 stars for the effort, but it would be better if they did not break this damned machine, which caused Lembach to leave, forcing him to try again. Shit, Lembach !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
