It was a movie that I hoped to suggest to my American friends. But after 4 attempts to watch the movie until the end I knew that I can not even see this damn thing to close. You're almost convinced that the real war did not last that long. Others will try to question my patriotism for criticizing such a film. But you can not go from watching Saving Private Ryan to LOC. Forget about the difference in the budget of the film or about the audience - they do not exclude the director in creating a smart movie. The length of the film is not so bad, and the fact that it is repetitive - it attacks the same hill, but gives it different names. I thought that LOC is a terrible area - this hill looked like my yard. The sequence of character development (retrospection of sorcerers, looking back on their last moments before they are implemented) should take place in the whole film, not just in one long memory. I do not watch the ending until today. But there was a much better movie (not saying much) called Border.
