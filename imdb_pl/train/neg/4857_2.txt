I really liked ZB1. Really yes. I do not have a problem with extremely low-budget movies and I enjoy movies with worse production values ​​than ZB3 (if you can imagine something like this.) Check out "wiseguys vs. zombies" if you are interested). In fact, I prefer zombie videos with a lower budget, because I suspect that Hollywood directors do not understand what zombie is all about. <br /> <br /> But ZB3 was so bad. He was delayed. I do not want to bother with my dignity in my criticism. I want to have 90 minutes to come back, etc. It only took me 80 minutes, because halfway through time I put it in 1.4X fast forward. <br /> <br /> Okay, here's some criticism. <br /> <br /> 1. The pace was terrible. Everyone was talking in monologues. Even if someone had only one line, working with the camera and editing and inserting several F bombs in each sentence made the line FEEL like a monologue. Initially, I was excited about the 90-minute working time compared to 70 minutes of ZB1, but in ZB3 there were fewer "events". He says everything. <br /> <br /> 2. The gore effects have become stupid. Only the glop brushed against the people's bellies. <br /> <br /> 3. Despite the epic exposure, there really was no story. And the exhibition is indeed epic! I will not spoil it if you watch it. (Do not watch this.) But this is just a group of lame figures walking and arguing for ~ 80 minutes. or less if you choose.
