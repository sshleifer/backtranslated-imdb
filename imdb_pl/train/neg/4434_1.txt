I rented this movie, thinking that it looks like a wonderfully delightful historical piece. I got a piece of clean rubbish. This movie was misleading in most places, interrupted almost in every place and terrible in all places. The portrait of the queen playing the young scientist Mira Sorvino was depressing at best. Ben Kingsley should be deprived of his knighthood for having considered this film one of his projects. Fiona Shaw should definitely stick to Petunia Dursley; at least the Harry Potter movies are more fun than what they call art in the film. <br /> <br /> The pictures look like a college kid took a lesson in cinematography 101 and suffered a setback. Almost every scene in the movie is cut into some effect; the end result is of course the hottest piece of editing I've ever seen. Jay Rodan was almost good as Agis; It is a pity that he had such a bad script to work. Rachael Stirling makes every effort to become an almost naive lady in anticipation. After all, I would really like Blockbuster Video to give back the money. I'm glad I did not spend 10 bucks watching this fiasco in the theater. If they've been playing Marivaux since the eighteenth century, I wonder how many people have had the best naps during the ages. If I was there, they would not hear the snoring. Thank God for the modern convenience of DVD players; you can skip boring or horrible scenes. Guess it means just watching the beginning and the end!
