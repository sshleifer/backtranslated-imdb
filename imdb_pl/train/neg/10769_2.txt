I found it on the shelf while I lived and I was bored. How can people give it 10? It's not just that it's supposed to be a good movie of redemption (I think) because it does not work at this level. Poor storyline, bad dialogue, terrible game; there simply is nothing there. Harvey Keitel is decent, but he has nothing to work with, and Bridget Fonda, and especially Johnathon Schaech, are simply horrible. The progress of the plot (especially the relationship between Byron and Ashley) does not make sense. It seems that the authors wanted the conspiracy to go in a certain way and did it without actually writing the necessary bits to pass it. It's only an hour and a half, but 90 minutes of your life you will never come back.
