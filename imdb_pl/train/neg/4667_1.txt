Visually cluttered, less fabulous, incredibly repulsive garbage. He is not even approaching Greenaway's better job. Avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> The overlapping effects of the "split screen" are just confusion, the movie is very dark for a long time, and the "artistic" composition of images is extreme. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely nothing to recommend about this movie; even the nakedness is incredibly non-erotic, which, seeing that it fills up, a large part of the movie soon becomes very boring. <br /> <br /> Besides, if someone can say that the acting of Ewen MacGregor is brilliant, he is beyond me. He showed more skills in the Star Wars series, and that says something. <br /> <br /> I have not been so impressed with the movie since I saw "Darby O'Gill and the Little People"!
