Why? Because for one reason, there was never a more charming scene in any movie than Ann Margret singing "Bye Bye Birdie" at the opening. He also repeats it at the end (in a different mood!). Both wonderful. Rent and see. Even if it's all you're watching. You'll agree, I'm sure. <br /> <br /> Everything about the original was so perfect that I did not need a remake, I'm sorry! Jason and Vanessa gave praiseworthy performances, as well as Tyne and Chynna. In fact, all the actors and singers in this new version gave "everything", but it's like trying to improve "Casablanca" - you just can not do it! It's even annoying when you compare two minds when you're trying to appreciate a remake, and it just falls, no fault of the actors.
