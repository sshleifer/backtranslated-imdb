Boring, long, pretentious, repetitive, involved? this movement seemed bad. Worse, the painstaking course in the art school - with the heavy use of a whirling shot that is so exaggerated, almost made me throw myself - keeps screaming to be noticed. Add the thinnest story and virtually no dialogue, and the movie will start to feel like a four-hour epic of about 30 minutes. Things get worse: instead of dialogue, there are badly written lectors AND quotes and songs that comment too much on the characters. Really loud opera music too. Blame everything on the director. <br /> <br /> All actors are pretty good. The main actor Miguel Angel Hoppe is particularly suitable for film fame. He and other actors have delicate erotic moments. Even these begin to get bored after 5 minutes, and one wonders if the director is involved in the Bel Ami porn interview. The magnificent architecture of the university campus as a location in Mexico City is inspiring. Why universities in the US are so bland (SFSU, UC etc.)? But wait for the DVD in this movie. Will you want to use the quick scan button? much.
