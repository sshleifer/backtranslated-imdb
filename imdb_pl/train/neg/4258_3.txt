I would give this movie 5, not 3, if it would be at least on time ... When I saw it for the first time, it was just what you could wait with the work based not on the artistic ability of the directors but on the idealistic or rather I would say the idiotic habits of our government (Kazakhstan) ... It's a shame because "Qazaqfil'm" made fun movies when it was not honored by the name of Shaken Aimanov, but it was actually run by him. Films such as "Konec Atamana", "Kyz Zhibek" and even "Aldar Kose". However, after the death of Mr. Aimanov, the production of high-quality films fell almost dramatically in 10 years, and very few films were produced. However, in the late 1980s, Assa was filmed, it was a film about the first organized crime groups in a large country, a year later Mr. Rashid Nugmanov made another film with the same actor / singer V.Tsoy, at that time he was already a Soviet legend / Russian rock - a movie called "Igla" (Igla or something) was completely new, someone called it a resurrection or a new wave of the Kazakh film. Unfortunately, today we do not have high-quality films, our filmmakers make films on French and Japanese financial support, so films are not intended for the public, but for the critics' critics, some of them take the price at international film festivals, but there are very few of them becomes business products ... And again we return to our "nomads". Such films are usually unpopular due to the huge aspects. The same effects were with Nikita Mikhail's "Sibirski Cyrillnik" about the Russian Tsars, which was also filmed equally with foreign partners, I think they were French, or maybe the British. Nobdy liked him, even in the Russian audience he became the main topic of comedians and comedy series such as "KVN". in my opinion
