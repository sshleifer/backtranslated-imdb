This film is "riveting", but largely the same as in a car accident. It is difficult to look away. In general, this film is nothing more than an incredibly irresponsible social experiment - and a futile, biased experiment. The creators of the film are manipulative and seem to have no problems getting the lowest possible denominator. The way the money is presented to Ted is pure exploitation. Intervening steps that filmmakers force Ted to participate in (a meeting with so-called experts) were empty and devoid of any substantive attempt to connect with Ted. Instead, it is painfully obvious that they are used to cover the back of the filmmaker and to further use the situation of Ted. The worst thing is that the filmmakers stopped watching Ted after six months; and it seems that they are completely cut off from the subject they have been observing so closely a month earlier. If they cared, they would find better "experts" who would help Ted. If they really wanted to see what Ted would do, they should let him spend the money without any intervention. This movie is at best a Jackass stunt, not a document. It's sad that $ 100,000 could have changed the homeless life if it hit the right hands.
