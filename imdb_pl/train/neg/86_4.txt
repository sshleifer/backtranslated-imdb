As a Southern Baptist, it hurts me to give below the average rating to an openly Christian film. There is certainly not so much that I want to discourage filmmakers from a genre that is pitifully underused. However, I must honestly say that "Love's Abiding Joy" is a typically low budget, a low key, consciously Christian movie. The story is predictable, average acting (I'm kind) and the editing is awful. As a TV movie it can be slightly above average, but as a feature film leaves much to be desired. Try the guys. You must have a movie about true Christians in yourself. Can I suggest that you turn to G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for some inspiration?
