Bugs Bunny accidentally goes to the South Pole, trying to go to Florida. Where he meets a small penquin who is trying to save an Eskimo. These short tests and the penquin are cute, but in the end it's a bit too light in the laughter department. Eskimo is not so great with Bugs' foil, and I just saw a much better Bugs Bunny cartoon, even other shorts when it's paired with other unknown antagonists. So I can not recommend it with a clear conscience. It is nice to see it in its uncut form. This drawing is on disk 3 "Golden collection Looney Tunes Volume 1" <br /> <br /> My class: C
