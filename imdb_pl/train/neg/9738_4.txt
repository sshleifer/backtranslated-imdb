Not as bad as it is attributed to being (Hooper did much worse)? more disappointing for me. Such an ingenious concept, which Hooper never uses in his economic direction, let alone in the smoky (justifying pun) writing. He is so ominous and exaggerated in a serious tone, becoming absurd and unpunished, allowing the entire pessimistic tale of mystery / plot to be easily telegramsed and ended with something completely abrupt. For this reason, the pace is quite slow, and Brad Dourif (it's great to see him in the lead role) seems to struggle with an unbalanced performance, despite picking up the bizarre, bizarre intensity of his colorful character. Although it is a cheap solution, it is the right technical approach. However, it seems that it does not go anywhere unusual with your idea and wants to plaster with unpleasant shocks (which some people do) and strikingly parries special effects (flames, flames everywhere). Hooper displays some stylishly crazy images (more towards the last end), and the work with the camera is quickly maneuvered, and the result of the beam excites. The performances are somewhat surpassed by the shop thanks to the performances of William Prince, Cynthia Bain, Dey Young, Jon Cypher and Melinda Dillon. Also Geroge Buck Flower and John Landis have small but fun scenes? especially Landis. Nothing surprising, but passively involving.
