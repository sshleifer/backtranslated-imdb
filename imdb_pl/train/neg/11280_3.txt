This film is about the bad life of a man. His business fails and he can not impregnate his wife despite repeated attempts. <br /> <br /> The plot is a complete chaos. It just does not make sense. In fact, nothing in the film makes sense. The story is so poorly said that I just could not understand it. It is a pity, because the sets and costumes are well made and stimulate the eyesight enough. The photos are well composed throughout the film. However, these redeeming features still can not compensate for the bad plot and bad story. I am amazed with the big names that agreed to play in this film. It is such a loss of their talents. This movie is very bad. Avoid this !!
