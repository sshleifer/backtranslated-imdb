Pokemon 3 is not much more than three or four episodes of the TV series, connected to each other without ordinary ads. The story is typical for Pokemon (conflict, struggle and resolution, in which everyone is happy in the end), and in the animation there is nothing original or unusual. Some holes on the story are filled (over end points!) No explanation, and everything is just a little too sweet. <br /> <br /> Why do you see it on the big screen? The only reason is to be part of your child's world. Both my sons like Pokemon, and thanks to my interest in what they like, we're closer. Watching a movie in the theater is still different than watching it on the lamp, and my sons enjoy full movie experience. I gave the film 4, mainly from the point of view of my children. <br /> <br />
