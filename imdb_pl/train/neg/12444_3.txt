Gloria Victor and Dolores Reed in the costumes of a cosmic girl. <br /> <br /> I love sci fi 50, I love even sci fi 50 years, but this movie is really, very bad. And not in a kind of MST3K. <br /> <br /> Virtually unseeable, how a few bozos do their best "hip-cat" impression of Abotta and Costello. <br /> <br /> Chessecake can usually save cheesy fi, for example in "Cat Women On The Moon", but in this case it can not. This movie requires a mute button and a quick scroll function. <br /> <br /> I said I could watch Gloria and Dolores walking around the spaceship for about an hour.
