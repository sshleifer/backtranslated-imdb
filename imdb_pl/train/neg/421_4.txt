My above title says it all. Let me explain it. If you've seen the BBC Planet Earth, which, I'm sure, most of you have, then you will not like this movie. I have all the "Planet Earth" albums. I saw the film very highly and read good reviews about it. I was excited to check it out. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I went to the theater and the movie started, I saw a Disney movie with production companies from BBC and Discovery. And when they started their first polar bear scenes, I recognized them from my DVDs at the "Planet Earth" house. <br /> <br /> The film was continued and continued and it lasted, my friends and I were holding all the scenes from "Planet Earth" after recognizing the scenes. <br /> <br /> We were very disappointed, I think 90% of the material comes from Planet Earth. I say 90% because some of the scenes I did not recognize. I have the impression that I just do not remember them. <br /> <br /> So in the end what this movie is, it is a compilation of various materials from various "Planet Earth" albums, with a narrative directed at Children. Yes, the narrative is quite childish. I'll give you an example. When they show that the polar young are leaving their mothers, the narrator says: "Polar cubs are not like human children. They do not always listen to their mothers "(I do not remember exactly the words, but that's the way it is). So in a nutshell. This is a condensed "Planet Earth" for children!
