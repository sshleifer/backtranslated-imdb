... but I'm not one of them. Caro Diario was at least watched for two-thirds of the time, but the boring and self-centered third part of the movie gave us the taste of what was to come in this unusually indulgent mess. Moretti says he feels the need to do the movie, but he does not want it while the viewer feels he should stick to it, but he does not really want to. A film about Italian politics and elections can be fascinating, but this is not the movie. At one point, Moretti and his friends are standing in front of the headquarters of the Communist Party, discussing the interviews they are preparing with party leaders inside, but this is characteristic of the film, we never see anything of them. Moretti's political interpretations are the events that led to the birth of his son, and subsequent shots from his home with the child, and later with Pietro's baby (the film drags us through several years and more than one election period). We are still expecting the final sequence or convincing argument, but they will never come. I'm sure I doubt if I could have the patience to sit in Nannie Moretti's movie again. He manages to take an hour and twenty minutes that seem like an eternity.
