I finished watching this whole (very long) movie, because I was fascinated by the very stupidity and naivety of the film. It's hard to believe that so many famous people (Anthony Quinn, Lawrence Olivier, John Gielguld, Vittorio de Sica, etc.) would be happy to take this farce. But maybe in 1968 people really * were * so naive? The plot seems to have been written by some confused Marxist priest from Latin America with a program. There is a conflict of superpowers, and the Russians are actually good people, and the Secretary General of the Communist Party is a nice and spiritual man who suddenly, after 20 years, sees light and feels compelled to ease his evil conscience, freeing a prisoner from a Siberian gulag. Then the priest quickly becomes pope thanks to a series of coincidences. We can see the secret papal voting process in the Vatican, which is presented in the most hysterical and devout form imaginable. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the communists in China have achieved the usual socialist economic miracle starving half their country to death. To resolve this tiny hiccup on the inexorable, shining path towards communism, they want to start a nuclear war (in order to equitably divide Western capitalist riches into poor workers in China). <br /> <br /> Our good old companion, General Secretary, worries a bit and calls the pope just before the coronation to ask for mediation in peace. They meet with the companion of the Chinese leader Peng, who looks and behaves like a 15-year-old boy. You will roll on the floor laughing at how people in 1968 believed that the Chinese look. Comrade Peng demands that the Western capitalists have to pay (which is finally logical, do not the bosses always pay for socialist madness?) And that the Pope must also sacrifice something for the common altruistic cause of equality and social justice. <br /> <br /> So when the Pope will be crowned in Rome, he promises all the riches of the Catholic Church throughout the world to feed our poor Chinese brothers in Christ. In this way, he saves the world from the nuclear holocaust. <br /> <br /> Besides, there are also minor threads, which, unfortunately, do not allow much to discover this amazingly bad movie. I would give three Oscars for foolishness. <br /> <br /> By the way, Anthony Quinn looks unlikely as Pope. It is much more credible than the Greek Zorba.
