First of all, this plot is too exaggerated - the girl wants to do it, everyone loves her, the snobbish girl intervenes, everything looks lost, the girl pulls in, everyone loves her again etc.) Throw in the thing, attractive male crushing heroine plus problems with one parent and this it is so predictable that you can practically recite with him. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I really hate how they continue to reject classical music. They send a message that everyone involved in classical music is tense and snobbish and have limited minds - I do not remember exactly the quote, but I remember at one point in the movie, Holly says, "Why are they supposed to be so ... so classic? It's really offensive how to label classical music in this way. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, I've gone through it dozens of times, but the only reason I can come up with this movie is to promote Britney Spears. it just does not make sense. <br /> <br /> And so, while the actress who played Holly (I'm not sure if it really was her singing or not) she had a pretty good voice that was not as amazing as it turned out - especially when she was spinning. She supported him all the time. <br /> <br /> 1/10 stars.
