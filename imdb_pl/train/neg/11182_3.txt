A very stupid movie, filled with stupid lines and Jewish references. It was a serious movie, but it can not be taken seriously. The famous plot of the film ... Being in the wrong place at the wrong time. A terrible story with Kim Bassinger. Very busy and too regimented. I noticed that Al Pacinos' acting skills seem to be waning. Problem solving tool, but nothing more disturbing than Pacinos terrible Atlanta accent. Damage control must fix this damage to the film. OK, my one liners are bad, but not as bad as those in this movie. This film is not only boring, but also disgusting. Usually, a hideous movie can be viewed for the wrong reasons. This movie is impossible to watch. I was able to sit down. The plot, if written a little better, maybe with a little better action and eliminating the terrifying story, and even stupid jokes, could break this thriller from stagnation. What's left to us is a boring, stupid movie that made sure it was detected in our heads that Eli Wurman was a Jew. The embarrassment of all good Jewish people around the world.
