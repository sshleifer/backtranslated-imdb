I think everyone was very disappointed with this science fiction movie. First of all, it was directed by Tim Burton. The other thing is a remake of what is to be classic. I found it boring, disgusting and funny. If you saw it, you know what I mean. Almost everyone in Imdb says it's shit and boy, right! If not, avoid this. It's snoring. 1 out of 10.
