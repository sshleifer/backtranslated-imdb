I thought this movie was pretty bad. If you're looking for cheeses, you can like it. I do not mind the large amount of cheese myself, but it was funny. The progress of the film bored me, and the plot was very poor. <br /> <br /> The only funny thing about this movie were zombies from day to day, but even that is not enough to see this movie.
