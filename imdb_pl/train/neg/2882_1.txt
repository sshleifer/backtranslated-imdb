This movie is the biggest steaming stack you know what, Being and growing up in Wichita Kansas, I know for sure 90% of the movie was Bogus. Apart from the names of some victims, nothing else was right. The film looks as if it was made with a handy dad's camera. He had a material that, I think, came from a different film along with film material from a slaughterhouse. Usually I like to watch bad movies for fun, but because of bad acting, poorly prepared or non-existent sets and very boring and short ending. I recommend that you do not waste money on this movie, because you will be sorry. Crunch
