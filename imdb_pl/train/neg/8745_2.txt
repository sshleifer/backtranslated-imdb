One more unprofessional movie about computer programmers. <br /> <br /> It seems that the authors of this movie do not know the real world of programmers. <br /> <br /> Top 20 programmers in the world, programming that have their own satellites (for what?), a satellite frequency program, someone to kill someone to steal codes (why?) and much more stupid moments in this movie. <br /> <br /> People who are not programmers will see something terrible in this film, because not professionals. But people will not see real things. <br /> <br /> Developers consider this movie to be strange and scary - because many moments in the movie are not related to real life (why in this case the film is not scifi?).
