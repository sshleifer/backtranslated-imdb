He pulled the guys off his ass! It's true, right ?! No one really writes that it happens as if improvisation has gone terribly wrong. I think in any way. This movie must be a parody, because who would say that he wrote the script differently. Can anyone imagine the entire cast seated around the director and writers on the script. <br /> <br /> The director says: "then our inbreed villain uses his 24-inch machete to disembowel our pathetic terrible neighbor. intends to draw the insides of his bunghole "<br /> <br />" Brilliant! "The whole cast preaches. <br /> <br /> There is no such option, no one is writing so stupid! I must be a trick. <br /> <br /> I loved the part where a thin, introspective gal beats to death an inbreed maniac with an iron frying pan on the cave floor. I was not sure if the types of inbreed cannibals are trying hard to cook. Maybe this explains why the pan lay on the floor in the dark at the right time to kill the distorted hull. It seems ironic that after a freaked guy defeated the porn queen, a martial arts expert and a few door jockeys, he fell so easily into the frying pan of the skinny helpless girl next door. <br /> <br /> What the hell is this Richard Greco doing? Did he release his agent or something? <br /> <br /> Can anyone explain the end to me because I did not get it? I do not quite understand why a nice heroine wanted to kill a funny lady who makes her tea. It does not matter, I do not want to know.
