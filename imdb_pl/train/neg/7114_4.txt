When it comes to photos, this movie was pretty good in the mid-1950s. It was several times that the lighting was too hot, but the shots were usually in the frame and remained the center of attention. Acting was above average for a low smelly budget, but the direction was terrible. Several scenes were dragged too long, trying to get tension, and the effects did not exist. The skull attack in the joint should have been completely removed from the final incision, and any attempt to revive the skull was obvious using sticks and strings. I could not help but think that the budget did not allow them to furnish the house, so they continued to make references to people who move, and that all things in the warehouse should soon arrive. Honestly ... it would be more fun if it was a worse movie. It was not bad enough to be a "good bad" movie, but it was not good enough to be "good". Download the MST3K version ... it's more fun.
