This movie could have been great (because it has a somewhat fascinating premise), but it never rises above a pure caricature. Acting is seriously flawed and there have been times when I crouched so hard that I thought I would drop out of the theater. I never and never look at this cursed piece .... Danish cinema has been winning a lot of good in recent years, but if this piece ... crosses the border I am afraid that no reasonable person will ever want to rent a Danish movie. This movie is the reason I decided to register here. I really felt that I had to distract people from this piece ... my sympathies are coming out to people who have already gone to the cinema to watch it
