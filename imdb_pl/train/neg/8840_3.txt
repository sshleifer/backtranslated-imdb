Here's a great example of what not to do when you have a great idea. It's not a problem? The concept is fresh and full of potential, but in the script and its implementation is missing any real substance. He should catch you from the very beginning, and then draw some emotions, interest and invest in the form. This movie does not have what it takes to start and sustain the flight, and here's why. First you do not care about characters because they are not presented in a way that people can relate to, that is, it is not here Superman or Mission Impossible, it should be about normal people who are in a stressful situation. They are not reliable in the way they act and interact. Example: Jeffrey Combs as a clay on chewing is a gum, frowning and looking intense all the time, this is not the way to go. I mean, what is it? It looks like he's in the toilet or something. I loved him in the re-animator, and the way he played the intense / neurotic, under-appreciated medical genius was right. But not for this purpose, trying to compensate too much, watching so intensely and sharply, but in a still mild neurotic manner, it is not natural, I am surprised that it did not sprain the jaw during filming. The film is basically based on sustaining life, it barely has a pulse and keeps me waiting for something that will never come.
