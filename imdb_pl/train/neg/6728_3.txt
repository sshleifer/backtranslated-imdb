This movie is not good, not great at all. A few unforgettable scenes and an unlucky choice of pairing Norma Jean with a real actress. Jane Russell has it all for her, the smaller woman Marilyn and / or actress. One can only wonder why this is considered one of the main attractions of her poor career. 3/10
