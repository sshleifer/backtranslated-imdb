It's not as fun and bloody as the DVD says. I really like twisted and strange movies, but this one is really boring! It's the hour of broken penises, Baby Born dolls and many rapes! I think the intent of this amateur homicide was to create good movies, but it fails. Just bad! A few scenes are fine, but all in all a mess. If you like such splashes (only better), I recommend Andreas Schnass' Violent Shit 2 and 3.
