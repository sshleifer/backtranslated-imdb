It's a very bad movie. I laughed once or twice, and the plot sucks! Maybe there is one funny joke, stupid and boring. I fell asleep throughout the short movie and wondered when it would end. <br /> <br /> Nobody works for a man, and everyone behaves stupidly and ridiculously. Rob Schneider behaving like an animal is not something I would like to pay for. It was fun, but most importantly: DO NOT WASTE, YOU ARE PRECISELY TIME AT THIS CORRECT AND STRONG FILM. <br /> <br /> I wondered when it would end, even though it's a short movie. At first, we thought it would be better; but it's getting worse. Stupid until the end. I left the theater and I remember this film as extremely bad forever. <br /> <br /> The writer and co-producer of this movie is a TV screenwriter Simpsons, but it's nothing like The Simpsons (this movie sucks !!!)
