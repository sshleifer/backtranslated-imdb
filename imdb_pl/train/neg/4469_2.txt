This game is (no) an honor to be the first game in which I stopped playing in the middle and I wanted to blow to pieces and then burn. Congratulations. FIRST and LAST Tomb Raider, where I will ever play. I assure you. <br /> <br /> Intrigue: just typing this word made me laugh. No such. There is also no character development. In the end, we have a girl-heroine who can take care of herself, who is not * squeaky * mary-sue, but unfortunately she dresses like a slut, and her breasts are huge. They had to attract the sexist boys you see. In any case, all he does is go to the tomb after shooting the tomb as he goes on. Why is he doing this? I have no idea. I had subtitles and t.v. as loud as I could, and I still did not understand the damn thing. The development (or lack thereof) for her, her two friends and * villains * was ridiculous. There will also be levels through which you have to go, without giving any hints about what you need to do next, and literally you'll be mostly boring like tombs for HOURS trying to figure out what the hell you are supposed to be doing. There is one course (out of two), especially with her on a motorcycle (believe me, it is not fun at all) that you will be able to STOP THE HOUR without seeing any point. This means that you are hit by a second driver and the guys in the vans shooting at you or hit a tree that starts an hour's OVER journey. <br /> <br /> Head Stupid F * ck: You know that it allows very high levels for a long time, there are basically no save points, no history, no character development, no difference in the game, most of the music at the earliest levels of bleeding from the ear and we do not give the player any clues so that they can stay even longer in place instead of getting into the non-existent plot. <br /> <br /> Stupid F * ck one: These sound like ideas. <br /> <br /> Stupid F * ck two: I agree. Who needs the development of a character, plot or unbridled game. <br /> <br /> Todd: I'm sorry, sir, but these ideas seem very p * ss to turn off the player. <br /> <br /> Boss Stupid F * ck: Shut up Todd. You're fired. <br /> <br /> Game: everything he does is shoot. Of course, he can turn away when shooting, jump while shooting, or kick again. PHOTOS. But flipping, jumping and kicking does not remove the fact that everything he ultimately does is SHOT. BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Music: The intro music is extremely beautiful. I love to listen to him. Music in the game goes from tolerance to the desire to cut off your ears. <br /> <br /> Graphics: Given this game, which was created in 2006, I expected that the visuals would dispel me. Well, I was amazed, but definitely not in a good way. <br /> <br /> Bottom-line: This game is free, there is no clutter of character development with barely clumsy clothing (THANKING) young women leading through boring tombs for some boring reason (which I could not tell you) with unimaginable gameplay. KEEP AWAY FROM THIS B.S. !!!!!!!! He gets two stars for having a woman who is not in danger (no matter how scantily dressed) and beautiful in music.
