This film often extrapolates quantum mechanics in order to justify meaningless ideas, limited by such statements as "we all create our own reality". <br /> <br /> I apologize, people, reality is what is true for all of us, and not just credulous. <br /> <br /> The idea that "everything is possible" does not stop the water after a closer look: if something is possible, contradictory things are possible and nothing is possible. This leads to postmodern nonsense, which is nothing more than an attempt to denigrate established truths, so that all ideas, well-founded and stupid, are equal. <br /> <br /> Quoting the science-fiction writer Philip K. Dick, who put it this way: "Reality is what, when you stop believing it, it will not go away."
