Do you remember a movie that you enjoyed in the past and which does not meet the same feelings as an adult? It came to my mind when I returned to school ... National Lampoon Reunion. The film has a great opportunity to laugh, but it surprisingly wanders aimlessly, seeing a bizarre collection of figures of women who have sold their soul to the devil and can fire fire from her mouth, a man who seems to be a vampire and a crazy killer dressed as a woman and wears sacks overhead. You have a class president who believes that he is the best thing since sliced ​​bread (but as we see in the movie, he is a coward and a joke), several sweat smokers who do not even know they are in their own class meeting, and a man named Gary, who is known that he even knew existed (and no one can remember his name ... this is the only joke I liked). There is a plump pervert who likes to grab women in inappropriate places, a deaf and blind woman who has a scream when she calls her dog and a cook (you know her from "goonies" and "Throw Mama From The Train") who loves to put in hands eating on the plates of people! The film is basically about a quirk that is (or at least tries) to take revenge on its classmates for the gag that pulled him (they arranged him to sleep with his twin sister!). The film follows the heroes who are looking for an assassin accepting darkened, dilapidated corridors of an old high school. A psychologist, who seems a bit strange, informed them about the killer. The movie has some good gags that work (quite early), but the movie slowly gets worse every minute. The real problem with the movie is that it really does not know where to go. The film is basically a joke because it has an unmoved direction ... if it has any direction at all. The cast is enthusiastic enough, but the material to be entertaining is not of such quality as to arouse any interest. It's a curio for lovers of comedies from the early 80's that are forgotten (this rightly so).
