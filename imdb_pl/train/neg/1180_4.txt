Known for more than a quarter of a century (and often forbidden), its darkness was its greatest asset. Hey, it's often better to talk about it and not see it when you can not support the "legend" content. <br /> <br /> The movie played a few times in Los Angeles and is available on the home video, so the curtain slowly rises. While there is still plenty to insult the masses, it is more likely to bored them than to arouse a lot of real passion. Except for the unprotected and prolonged sex scene of XXX between a pair of horses (whoever the "Document of Nature"?), There is almost an hour of boring arranged marriage. <br /> <br /> After the beginning of sex and nudity it is a continuous sequence involving masturbation, retrospection looooooooong to the alleged "beauty and the beast" and a naked woman running around the residence (no one, even her allegedly protective aunt, seems to even think about inserting some clothes on her!). On the video, I think you can scroll through the clich√©, but it's not worth the effort. Nudity does not go beyond what you see in something much more substantive, such as THE DREAMERS by Bertolucci. <br /> <br /> Try to find some "morality" or "symbolism" in corporality, I doubt that worthy one's effort. Unfortunately, for LA BETE, now that it's easier to see a movie, the notoriety of being "banned" has been abolished. And this beast has been tamed.
