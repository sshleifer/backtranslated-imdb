Wow ... I can not believe how bad ZOMBIE DOOM is (ANT VIOLENT SH! T 3). I heard rumors, I read reviews - but I had to think about it. Let me tell you - THIS BLOWS !!! The worst game in any movie ever made, dubbing, which had to be done, while everyone involved, was completely wasted, inept and funny gore FX, lack of perceptible plot, "cinematography" that looks like my grandma filmed it with a camera, props that are no joke - made of tin foil - list goes on ... <br /> <br /> Three guys are trapped on the island, where a group of freaks runs with plastic and tin swords. Two prisoners are released together with rebel islanders and get a start day before being hunted down by the rest of the "tribe" ... it's almost that ... <br /> <br /> Honestly - it's one of the WORST films I had the misfortune to give up. The budget had to be around $ 200 and was spent entirely on top of the FX (which was not really a bad idea ...). In ZOMBIE DOOM, there is nothing more than ridiculous funny-looking scenes with lots of terrifyingly dubbed dialogues. In this video, there are other, non-budget trips, such as PREMUTOS: LORD OF THE LIVING DEAD looks like TITANIC. Some may include ZD in the "yes-bad-it-is-good" category - and I think that if you are REALLY drunk or tall and you watch it with a few friends in the MST3K style, then you can look at it. But not because of me. I hated almost everything. If ZOMBIE DOOM or ZOMBIE 90 (which is equally frightening and attached as "bonus" in the issue of ZD in Shock-O-Rama) indicates other works of Andreas Schnaas - then he should be forbidden to have something to do with re-filming under the penalty of death . In the second half of the movie there is one funny kung-fu battle and a lot of blood - so I'll give this VERY generous 3/10 - Do yourself a favor and skip it.
