This is a movie about making a movie. Such films can be fun, but they need a certain substance for this. It did not happen here, I'm scared. Unfortunately, Coppola did not inherit his father's skills (just like his sister, who can make films that could be watched). <br /> <br /> I wonder how this movie came to get such enthusiastic reviews. <br /> <br /> Let's see: the main male actor, apparently the director, is as expressive as a frozen squid, and his voice has the same tone as he says, the main actress has a face expression that never changes, the plot is completely divided for bits with one single connecting element, the movie in the idea of ​​the film must be more musty than the Paleolite rocks ... Is that enough? <br /> <br /> I regretted every moment I watched this movie. A walk with a dog is definitely a better entertainment for this incredibly bad film. It's like the plot of François Truffaut directed by Dick Cheney ... <br /> <br /> Brazil, other classic SF movies? You must really joke ...
