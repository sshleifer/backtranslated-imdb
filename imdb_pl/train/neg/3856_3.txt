"And Guy Thing" tries to capture the feeling of "There Something About Mary" or "Meet the Parents", but it more closely resembles that it was released from the typefaces rejected by these two films. Fortunately, I rented it for a 5-day rental, because I could not sit and watch more than 20 minutes at a time. <br /> <br /> The premise is decent and I liked the scenes where other guys automatically hide themselves Paul's bugs (checking in Save-Mart was great), but writing scripts is absolutely horrible. Dialogue falls most of the time, and when you think that everything will end up in vain, some senseless gag lies with no reason. Plus, how many jokes from the toilet really need one movie? <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, the humor of the slapstick is great when it's elegantly done, like in the other films I mentioned, but this movie just does not get the mark. It's a pity, because I love Julia Stiles (Ten things I hate), but even that could not help me sit down in this awful movie. Save your money and go to borrow "There's something about Maria" again.
