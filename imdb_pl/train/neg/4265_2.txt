I am a big fan of warrior movies. Some of my favorites are Braveheart, Troy, Last Samurai and Gladiator. And after seeing Mongo≈Ço, who is absolutely amazing and which I highly recommend, I had high expectations for the film by Sergey Bodrow. But it was terrible, terrible, even pathetic is not a strong word in this case. The whole movie I've been waiting for something exciting to happen, but it did not happen, at least I was expecting a great epic battle at the end, but even that was a huge disappointment, just running randomly, waving swords ... There are so many good movies about warriors, this one is not one of them.
