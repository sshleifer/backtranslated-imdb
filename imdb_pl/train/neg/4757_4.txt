Some time ago I saw Sleuth (1972) with two great actors Michael Caine and Laurence Olivier. Michael Caine has returned, but now he is a husband and Jude Law is his wife's mistress. The story is still the same and it's a fantastic game. <br /> <br /> During the movie I always had the impression that I was watching art. This is one of the reasons why I do not like this remake of the classics. When I watch a movie, I've adapted art that I need to feel to see a movie, not just a game. Director Kenneth Brannigan made great films in the past, but this time he missed. Another reason was the look of the movie. The design was modern, stylish, clean, uncomfortable and cold. I have never felt that anyone has ever lived in this house. Photography was not bad, but the lightning was terrible. Sometimes there was a blue light, a dark green light that was not eye-friendly. <br /> <br /> Acting was really good. The performances of Michael Caine and Jude Law are the best. I would really like to see these two guys playing together on stage. But I must admit I have never been a fan of Jude Law. The weakest part was the middle part. I remember that the original part was still very mysterious and simply wonderful. I tried to look at him twice and always in the middle part, which I slept. The end part is better and more interesting. Sleuth (2007) is not terrible, but it seems to be more a film for critics than for the public. Sleuth (1972) is still a masterpiece and much more fun than Sleuth (2007).
