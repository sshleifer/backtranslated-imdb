alone, as an inspiring director, this movie was exciting to watch with a view to criticism. Pictures taken with a low end digital camera, probably with a 35 mm adapter for DOF. Editing is good, decent, sound effects are not too exaggerated. I would give him 7 for an independent film, but the story is not very interesting. It's more on the side of drama, character development than horrifying horror. <br /> <br /> This is not for those who want to get scared frightened, terrified, exhausted or sit down with popcorn just to enjoy themselves. <br /> <br /> honestly, this movie would be good if we were still in the 50s. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a family that has a dry field, and that's what it is.
