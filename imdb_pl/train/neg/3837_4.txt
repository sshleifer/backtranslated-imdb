I have seen (too) many films from this company - this one is in the middle of the package. One good side, a little more stylized and under control than part of their tariff - less sophisticated attempts at humor and greater attachment to history (for what value). Many of their titles, such as Sexy Sixth Sense, have been buried by baaaad performances and amateur sensitivity. On the other hand, simulated sex scenes were not as hot as some of their other films (like Vampire Vixens, Gladiator Eroticus, Spiderbabe or Mistress Frankenstein). <br /> <br /> Misty Mundae is always 10 years old peter meter, just like Darian Caine. I found Barbara Joyce in the act of making school marble, and Ruby LaRocca on the sexy little hottie. <br /> <br /> Watch it with the remote control firmly in (free) hands, at night, when you need a break from porn. Do not waste time trying to check the history - you have better things to do in your life. This is not a movie, it is pure RCP, but it is not bad according to this standard.
