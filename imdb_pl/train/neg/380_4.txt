I wonder if there is any sense in this movie. It's a big joke. Okay ... It's funny ... You'll see the stupid plot played very seriously in the form of a movie .. I wonder which audience the film is basically aimed at. <br /> <br /> Thoughtfulness (professionals) substitute play a mother for a happy couple Salman / Rani, who wants to have a baby, but can not. I wonder what it would be like if this drama was a real start from the life of a real couple. <br /> <br /> Rani seems satisfied with another pretty lady in her home who was brought to make a child for her and Salman. He cares about Prety and tries to push his husband Salman to Preity so that they can have an affair. When the audience will have enough of Salman's nakhras. <br /> <br /> Although the movie is good, this movie is unbearable. Absurd.
