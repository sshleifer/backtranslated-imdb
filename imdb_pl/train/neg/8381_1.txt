There are very talented black directors, Spike Lee, Carl Franklin, Billy Dukes, Denzel and many others who bring a well-deserved credit to the film industry. There are also Wayans Brothers who once (15 years ago) had an extremely entertaining television program "In Living Color", which began the career of Jim Carrey among others. Now we have stupidity replacing humor and disgusting gags (humor in the toilet) as a standard operating procedure. People are not as stupid as those who are depicted in the "Little Man," but they could not be. A child with a full set of teeth and a tattoo is accepted as having just a few months? The child comes with the shadow of the fifth hour he shaves. You could say that the child is having sex with his adopted mother for husbands, Darryl, back. Oh, yes, it's just fun. As a crime champion, "Little Man" is the dumbest on Earth. It stores a stolen rock that is just huge in a woman's purse and then has to pursue it. Chazz Palminteri star, why Chazz, offers the best line: "I am surrounded by morons". Based on, without a down payment, Chuck Jones, Bunny Baby Buggy. This is definitely too stupid to be even a bit funny. Hint of how bad this movie Damon Wayans appeared on Jay Leno the night before, before the BAT rewards, and he did not do it, he even mentioned the horrible movie. When Hollywood stops the green light of rubbish from the Wayans brothers. When they overcome their white guilt, most likely.
