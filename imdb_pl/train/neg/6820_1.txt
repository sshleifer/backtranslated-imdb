This stupid, unbelievable story is redeemed only by the opening scene, in which a hard-boiled police detective provides a few almost audible lines confirming our greatest fears: He is dead. Perhaps the film would have been saved if the director had given up the dazzling power of A. Martinez's stars to this sad-anonymous actor who filled the screen for a short while. The fact that an unnamed streetcar can save such a movie is less likely than a villain committing murder, dropping stones into a quarry for an unsuspecting diver. His moment is short; His promise is huge. Perhaps we will treat more time on the screen by this unknown tespiana, if there ever appears the sequel to this imprudent movie.
