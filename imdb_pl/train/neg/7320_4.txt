Captivity, humiliation, S & M show and not much more. The plot is flat, really trivial configuration of stylishly depraved elements. The host of the show, a silly little man who squirts while strumming on the stage in dresses, was almost as painfully distracting as attempts at artistic assembly. A dreamlike feeling. In honor of the film, Aya Sugimoto was quite convincing as tortured lead. Flower and Snake has been compared with Eyes Wide Shut, but apart from the small similarities of the surface, Kubrick is easily more layered, artistic and atmospheric.
