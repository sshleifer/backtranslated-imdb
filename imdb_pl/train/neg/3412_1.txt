First of all, IFC runs Town and Country, and now it. The difference between this smelly and the fact that the Pink Panther is a rip off is that the city and the country were observable. This is not. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the cast signed up so that they could get out in Europe for someone else's money. Belushi is particularly annoying. His scene with Candy (doing Z-grade House DeLuise) was torture. Speaking of torture, five minutes of soulless Shepherd, I bet the prisoners in Gitmo will break like walnuts! <br /> <br /> The real "crime" (apart from being illuminated in green) is the Shepherd's character: the mousy wife who takes the Monte Carlo casino for half a million dollars! If you buy it, I have a real estate in Arizona located on the ocean that you may be interested in!
