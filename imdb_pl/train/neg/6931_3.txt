A stupid rich guy around 1800. He wants to visit a nearby psychiatric hospital to see how the famous doctor cares for his patients. Despite initially hostile reactions, he is soon invited and visited by a good doctor. And, as the doctor shows him, he talks, talks and talks !!! And when he speaks, the loonies escape here and there, doing nothing particularly productive. While here and there is the SOME action (and some of them are quite disturbing), it's amazing how boring and cerebral it is - lack of life and energy, which is strange in the case of horror. Even a guy who thinks he's a chicken and dresses like one becomes rather tiring. The further this route takes the visitor, the more disturbing the fact that you finally realize that the prisoners have taken over the hospital and tortured their guardians. Once again, despite this change, the film is incredibly dead in many places - especially when it moves very slowly, when a bizarre ceremony takes place or people are wandering around the set. Only if the asylum workers found in the prison cell, starved, film have any real influence. Given this story, it's hard to imagine it boring, but the people who created this cheap operating movie have! Now with the same plot and competent writing, acting and directing, THIS MAY be an interesting and valuable movie. <br /> <br /> You know, now that I think about it, it was the story of one of the episodes of the original TV show "Star Trek"! You know, the one from "Lord Garth - Master of the Universe" and Kirk and Spock are imprisoned by this madman and his crazed supporters. <br /> <br /> The final remark: the movie has a lot of nudity here and there and includes the scene of rape, so be forewarned - not for children. In fact, considering how worthless this movie is, it's not for anyone! However, with the version included in the "50 Movie Pack - Chilling Classics", the printout is so incredibly bad that it is difficult to see the whole body because of a very dark print.
