It must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen! There were people coming out of the theater, others were falling asleep (ok, it was late evening) ... This is a nonsensical movie, one of those who can make you never want to see the main picture again. I would like to watch this film because I am deeply interested in what is happening in the minds of the authors of such rubbish. Do they laugh when they create all these funny things, or do they really think they are doing something interesting? Interesting ... The soundtrack is awful, with the exception of some of the instruments that resemble the previous Bjork album. Even if you're a Bjork music fan, stay home. This is the best thing to do. Small, tiny pieces of nice music are not the reason you can go out and give in to this torture. God!...
