believe it or not, this movie is worse than the number three. It's slower, the game is worse, and the story is very weak. There is not much to say about this movie. Even battle scenes are more boring than the number three, and I would think that's impossible. It is very slow 90 minutes. Full, in fact I'm stuck, hoping it will be better. If you really want to see this movie, try to find a cheap rental. it's hard to find (I mean buy) and probably for a reason. Like number three, this movie has nothing to do with the first two. it is the same only by name. I can give Best of the Best: There is 2/10 without warning
