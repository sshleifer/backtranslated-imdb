Stanley Kramer directs the action thriller and skips two key things: action and emotions. RUIN DOMINO includes Gene Hackman as a prisoner jumped out of jail to perform some mysterious task. Richard Widmark, Edward Albert and Eli Wallach are his agents - they probably work for the government, but this, like most of the plot lines of the film, is never clear. Hackman asks a lot of questions that NEVER gets an answer, so the film goes completely nowhere. Although trying to be like NIGHT MOVEMENT and PARALLAX VIEW, DOMINO PRINCIPLE mixes ambiguity and mystery with confusion and boredom. The film is very well photographed, but even it works against it. Kramer's direction is devoid of any style. It's a very sunny movie! <br /> <br /> Acting is fine with Hackman, who proved he was unable to be bad. Widmark and Wallach are bad enough, and Albert is well manned as the cruel butler Widmark. Even the usually unbearable Mickey Rooney is pretty good as Hackman's assistant. One of the strangeness is to fill Candice Bergen as Hackman's wife. We were told she ended up in prison and it looks like she is trying to use some southern twang. Kramer's idea to make her look like a garbage truck would make her wear an ugly brown wig. This role is better suited to people like Valerie Perrine or Susan Tyrell.
