I liked Chiba in Street Fighter and I thought hey, no matter how stupid this movie is, at least I'll see him kick ass, right? Wrong. It's a boring, grim mess of pointless speech, a half-deleted scenario and senseless plotting. There are few action sequences, even fewer martial arts, and a few of them are filmed and edited so poorly that you can not even see what is happening in the world. Dub is terrible too, and perhaps this idiocy, which is this film, is best illustrated by the fact that he has apparently an Italian mafia ... EXCEPT FOR ALL THEY JAPANES! Avoid the plague - you'll see better martial arts by looking through the window of your local pre-school karate class for five minutes.
