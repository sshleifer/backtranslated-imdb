As a player, I can not say that I like this movie. The fact is I hate it. I tried to look at it as openly as possible, but when it comes to it, I feel rather offensive to my social group. <br /> <br /> There are several reasons for me. <br /> <br /> 1. Characters seem unnatural. I met many players from different areas of life. I do not know anyone who behaves like any of the characters in the movie. It's as if film producers have adopted the worst aspects of the worst stereotypes and put them in 5 people. Most of the players are rather social people, some have a rather active life. <br /> <br /> 2. The style does not work. Mockumentary style does not fit the theme of the film. A real documentary about players would actually work better. Although it is good looking (eg Clean), it is not very good. <br /> <br /> 3. The dialogue is forced, unnatural. It also seems to lack real context. Players swear, I'll confess, but we do not have Tourette's team. <br /> <br /> 4. Lack of humor. While self-sufficient humor is the foundation of my group and several other groups that I have encountered, it is less depreciation of myself, and more like humor in the toilet. Similarly, a large part of the players' humor is full of jokes and anecdotes, not toilet humor. Most players would throw in the eye and avoid anyone making such jokes. <br /> <br /> 5. The biggest problem for me is in fact: accuracy. I do not mean rules, but dynamics. Invariably, this movie will be compared to the even lower budget movies The Gamers and The Gamers: Dorkness Rising, which present players as real people playing the real game. The difference is that Gamers: The Movie presents a situation where you want to beat nonsense players compared to The Gamers, where you can say something like: "Huh, I know a guy ... Yes, it's definitely Gary. "
