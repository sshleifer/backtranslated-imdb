this document is based on biscuit, as soon as you put REAL evidence on it, integrity slowly falls into a great heap of shit, for example Bart Sibrel claims that they had to have many light sources because the shadows seem to intersect if it were not two or more more shadows for each object, when Apollo 11 went through the van Allan radiation belts, they spent 30 minutes instead of 90 minutes in the document and received a dose of radiation more equivalent to the x ray dose. <br /> <br /> take the research seriously, find out what really happened, do not let this pile of nonsense documentary speak to your opinion about what really happened
