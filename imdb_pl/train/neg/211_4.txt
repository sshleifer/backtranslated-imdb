A really obvious "drama" about a group of high school students (I think) who like non-stop hip-hop, break dance, graffiti and try to become a DJ in Roxy - or something. To be completely honest, I was so bored that I forgot! Even people who love music agree that this movie is terribly preserved and - as a drama - failed. We have to find nice and nice children. I found them nondescript and boring. The one I REALLY hated was Ramon. He's doing graffiti on subway trains and it's considered great. Excuse me? He destroys public property that is not his property. These "big" children use the city's electricity, so they can organize a big dance party in an abandoned building. UH Huh. So we should find a lot of lawbreakers, nice and funny. <br /> <br /> I can forgive everything if the music is good, but I can not stand hip hop. The songs were - at best - mediocre and they were all the time! ALWAYS play! It came to pass quickly through many endless music numbers. (Cut out the music and you'll have a 30-minute movie - maybe) There are some ingenious numbers - a dance fight in the subway, a really funny Santa's number and Roxy's atmospheric show. If you love hip hop, here's your movie. But you are looking for a good drama - forget about it. How was the PG score obtained? There is an incredible amount of curses in it.
