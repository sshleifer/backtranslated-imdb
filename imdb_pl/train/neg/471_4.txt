The stale "fake army" saga, which without any doubt attempts to be both surreal (foreign inscriptions) and vulgar (bloating gags), but ends up with a mix of many types of humor that went very well. Barbara Bach, Bond Girl from "The Spy Who Loved Me", has only two or three short scenes. What a loss! (* 1/2)
