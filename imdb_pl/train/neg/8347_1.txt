The title should be "The walker". It was only he who walked. <br /> <br /> There was nothing good in the film. The description of the movie is not consistent with the story. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can get from the movie is that he was a good son, but a low life terrible man. <Br /> <br /> I am sorry that I spent the money and time on this movie. I saw people leaving the theater in the middle of the movie. I was hoping that it would be better ... what a mistake. I got worse. <br /> <br /> If there is any suggestion that I can do, then the producer has to redirect his life to another field, because making movies is definitely not his cup of tea
