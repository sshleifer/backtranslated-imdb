This story about Cannon is the worst of many and is a positive proof that the five-minute fairy tale is not a full-length film. Poor Sid Caesar, as a vain emperor, looks so stupid that it's hard to see. As a cunning tailor, Robert Morse has no charm. Neither his unfortunate nephew (Jason Carter) "Songs" are terrible and only slow down the action. The direction is practically non-existent, and supporting signs add little. Lysette Anthony is as beautiful as the Emperor's daughter, but her voice has apparently been named for some reason, a fate shared by many smaller players. And the film crawls at the pace of snails. Hans Christian Andersen had to turn the somersault in his grave when it appeared. You can honestly say that at least from this story about the film is not surprising that it went straight into oblivion video.
