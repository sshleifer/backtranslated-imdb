STAR EVALUATION: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> The US military has just launched a new large fighter aircraft that can avoid detection in Unlike others. The renegade pilot (Steve Touissant) steals and plotts him to keep the US government in ransom. So they must send their best man, John Sands (Seagal, who else?), To stop him, in exchange for getting him out of jail, where his mind was to be erased from all incriminating information he had learned over the years. <br /> <br /> I skipped Attack Force because of the cover and all the post-production manipulations that happened that it would be nonsense, and when all the negative reviews and low rating users appeared just confirmed what I was thinking. But I decided to give FOF, because Shadow Man (the same director) was not bad and, hell, Seagal was my favorite action star once and maybe, maybe, he could make a great movie again. Oh, how I was a fool. <br /> <br /> Copying, terrifying recordings from fighter planes, terrible work with cameras, low production values, risky, unconvincing battle scenes that have become Seagal's trademark and boring, dream-provoking plot that is nowhere to be found. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, his next movie, Once Upon a Time in the Hood (which I will bypass), apparently marks the end of his contract with Sony, which means no more of these awful European juicy action movies and his next movie Prince of Pistols can mean going back to theaters. Hell, he's already done it, and Stallone can do it before him (Rocky Balboa.) <br /> <br /> This is not a Fury Flight. It's not even fun. It's a flight that can not even get off the ground. *
