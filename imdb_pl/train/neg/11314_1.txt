This movie is probably the worst I've ever seen. Bad acting, bad script, bad everything. Comparing it to two other films of the same genre and more or less at the same time is interesting. Both Cyborg (Van Damme, 1989) and Nemesis (Olivier Gruner, 1993) are much better and seem more solid both in the story and in the direction, and yet Albert Pyun directed the two! the story is not original. The world has become a terrible place, probably due to ecological disaster or nuclear war, and people live in medieval circumstances. A special race of robots (cyborgs) lives on human blood, and there is a story ... Cyborgs must force many people to fulfill "prophecy" there, and people need someone to stop them. One girl along with a robot (Kris Kristofferson) built by the creator of cyborgs was designated by destiny to save mankind. <br /> <br /> In this movie, the director tries stylish scenes of fighting with Hong Kong by flying high and jumping far. The film fails in this attempt. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie only because most people will get a new film "the worst in history". And for fans of the genre, I recommend "Cyborg" because I think it is a very underrated film with a fairly high entertainment factor. And if you can not stand Van Damme, check out "Nemesis." <br /> <br /> I rated this movie 1/10.
