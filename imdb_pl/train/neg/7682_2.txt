Featured in 1955, THE COBWEB is an all-star cast, ranging from the veteran with the silent screen of LILLIAN GISH to the offspring of Actors Studio SUSAN STRASBERG. What's happening in this movie about you, you're wondering ... in a dramatic hospital? Relationships with a doctor and patient? Shock therapy? No, this howling is about who exactly chooses the draperies for the psychiatric hospital! Do you think I'm kidding? You will not believe your eyes when you watch this unbelievable storyline that has been transformed into a movie! Progressive psychiatrist Dr. McIver (RICHARD WIDMARK) wants all hospital patients to be involved in the design, selection and implementation of the necessary new draperies. McIver's wife played by the marble mouth GLORIA GRAHAM wants to get 2 cents on this monumental task. It also makes a longtime employee of Miss Inch (LILLIAN GISH). Directed by VINCENT MINELLI, you wonder if he was really too involved in details because his marriage was worried about JUDY GARLAND. Talented actors such as LAUREN BACALL, SUSAN STRASBERG, CHARLES BOYER and JOHN KERR are wasted in this hokey story. What were they thinking?
