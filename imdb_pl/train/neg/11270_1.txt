I saw bad movies, but it took ***. It makes no sense, and all the characters do it by swearing every few seconds, and I think one has a low sperm count. That's good. The Welshman is cursing. The elegant English guy plays a vulgar, uncontrollable villain from an unruly one, and some weaker lights play poor grated. <br /> <br /> And there are some Russian gangsters. Oh yes, someone has a gun and maybe talks about junk when he's on drugs. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie like a plague.
