I watched as he did not know anything about it, except for the short description I read here. After watching it, I wanted to say that the director is promising, but it seems amateur, then I looked at other things he did to see if it was his first or second film, but no, he did House on Haunted Hill and Fear Dot Com . In a sense, he lacked both these films and the same. <br /> <br /> This story was also quite awful, could anyone just fall in love with a girl because she is pretty but has a child's mind? I gave him 3, because there were a few visual effects that I liked rather at the end, but all in all this movie is quite awful.
