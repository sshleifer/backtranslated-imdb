Save $ 8.97, which you will spend in Walmart on the purchase of this DVD and watch the real movie by Steven Spielberg. <br /> <br /> I am a filmmaker and being an avid fan of HG Wells, I had to buy it, hoping to sit down and watch three hours of good entertainment. Instead, it took four days to finish watching because I could not stand watching more than 10 minutes at a time. This is terrible. <br /> <br /> There are reports that Timothy Hines had a $ 20 million budget for this production. Where the hell did it go? Did he use most of them to buy a new home? Financing your retirement? Or what? Let me start with what is really good in this movie. He remains faithful to the book and there are some good performances in it. I can respect actors who apparently tried to make a good movie out of it. But good results have quickly been overshadowed by terrible ... and I mean terrible special effects. Every first-year film student could do a much better job at CGI. For me, most of them looked like cut-outs from the "stop action" cards that were used, not the sophisticated CGI software that a $ 20 million project should use. <br /> <br /> There is no excuse for amateur post-production that was applied to this movie. My own partner and I sat down and recreated our version of the ferry scene with software that cost less than $ 1,500 and in one day we had five minutes of a scene that looked better and more realist than what Hines had created. I've seen movies with budgets under $ 2 million that look better. Much better. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the special effects used in the original King Kong were more sophisticated and better than Hines's special effects in this film. In fact, I have much better appreciation for Attack of the Killer Tomatoes because of this movie. There is no excuse for today's technology to make the movie look like a B-Movie movie from the 1950s, unless it was an intention that should not be related to this particular project. <br /> <br /> The problem I had with the DVD transfer was that the movie is violent, another demonstration of amateur filming. <br /> <br /> Generally, I have to say that I have produced a project worth $ 45,000 in 2003, which has better pictures and special effects than this movie. <br /> <br /> I strongly encourage anyone who appreciates good film making or is a WOTW fan to leave this movie on the shelf and instead watch the Attack of the 50 Foot Woman. It would be easier on the eyes.
