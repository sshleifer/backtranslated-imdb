I saw this movie at the premiere at Sundance 09. <br /> <br /> Because American Beauty is a movie that had something to say, I was hoping for Towelhead. Unfortunately, it was a disappointment. In fact, from the countless films I've seen at over a dozen Sundance festivals, Towelhead is the only Sundance film I ever wanted to leave earlier. <br /> <br /> The worst problem with Towelhead is that it comes from a collection of "provocative" ideas about cultural stereotypes and not from the organic human drama. The script is from the novel by Alicia Erian of the same title. A famous quote by Edith Wharton comes to my mind: I never knew a novel that would be good enough to be good, although it was adapted to the author's political views. This observation is particularly devastating for Towelhead because its political views are so old and simplistic. If there was a time when black white characters of Towelhead, condescending representations of blacks, ironic treatments of foreign cultures, etc., were fresh, it was long ago. <br /> <br /> For a more detailed overview, look up any of the many professional reviews available online. Almost everyone evaluates this film poorly and exposes the shallow and manipulative tissue on which it is based. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, amateur reviewers seem to be easier to splatter. Reading reviews on this and similar sites, you often see superlatives: "stunning", "breathtaking", "deep", "shocking" ... I'm embarrassed reading them, but do not surprise me. Indeed, I have met many people who seem to consider every book or film dealing with racial, cultural, sexual or sexual issues as deeply moving, provocative, full of deep insight. If you are such a person, most likely rent a Towelhead and let yourself be carried away. On the other hand, if you set your standards higher, you can safely move on.
