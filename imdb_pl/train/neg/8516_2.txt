Last week I looked at weekly Nielsen's reviews and Veronica Mars was said to be "the best concert you're not watching." <br /> <br /> Well, they're right that you're not watching. Twice emitted and placed on 147 and 145 on 147. <br /> <br /> Translation: this is the lowest rated program on any national broadcasting network ... and deservedly. I tried to watch it several times because all the press materials suggested it as a "great" program, a "realistic look" in life and all such nonsense. In fact, it was different. Veronica Mars is a bore. It's as unrealistic as it gets and deserves to be canceled. <br /> <br /> The only secret is why CW felt compelled to introduce its inaugural schedule in the lowest-rated program in memory, after two years of continuing commercial and artistic failure.
