I can not believe I really sat through the whole thing. This movie has the worst game since Killjoy. <br /> <br /> Here's a brief outline of the story: The movie starts with Jojo and that other girl sitting on the beach, drooling on the skinny blonde beach hair, "handsome" who looks like he's not in the gym all day long. Somehow everyone knows him, and every chick in the movie wants him. Oh, oh! The competition is coming! A stereotypical "hot chick" and her best friends who run an ugly pink car. Soon we will find out that mom Jojo got a job in Australia, which means that Jojo would have to move and leave his best friend (no, I think I will cry). A huge storm comes and fills their pool with unpleasant water. Somehow, for no apparent reason, the little cane falls into the pool and comes face to face, yes, you guessed it, MERMAID! In this place, "history" really begins. Basically they want the mermaid to fall in love with a "handsome". <br /> <br /> This is a preteen movie with such bad behavior that makes the 80s look like the best Oscar achievements. This movie has all the possible stereotypes ... best friends, "handsome" everyone wants, "hot" evil girl and her weird friends, terrifying old man ... you call it, he's there. I took one for many people watching this. Consider my time and 40 minute sacrifice for you. Please, do not watch this movie. Do not do it, so I suffered in vain.
