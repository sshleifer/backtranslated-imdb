Wow. I read about this movie and it sounded so horrible that I had to see it, and my God, I feel it in St. Louis. Where do I start? National Lampoons tried 5 years later to follow the success of Animal House, but completely missed the mark. I will be chronologically with these short films. <br /> <br /> Short movie # 1 <br /> <br /> Poor Peter Riegert (Boon from Animal House). Apparently he did not work then, so the boys at National Lampoons probably called and said, "Hey, we're doing a p ** movie, I want to be there?" Peter was like, "Well, I do not do much today, why not?" He was a great character in Animal House, but he could not stand this short flop for 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> POSSIBLE SPOILER The premise is quite fun, and Jason Cooper (Riegert) tells his wife to leave him, he must be found. It's too weird that they are in a happy marriage. So he chases her, goes there, and Cooper guides the children. This of course leads to the burning of the house, the loss of several children and sleep with an assortment of New York's bimbos (including the so-so young Diane Lane). Then the wife returns, wants the children, and the film ends with a coin toss that determines the fate of the children. The idea was actually clever, but the director stinks. All characters seem to fall asleep, they had to be administered. Sorry, Boon, your legacy has been wasted thanks to this flop. <br /> <br /> Short movie # 2 <br /> <br /> MORE SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Enter the Dominique Corsaire. A pretty girl, she recently graduated from college, not knowing what to do with her life. He becomes a whore, starts to sleep with mega rich men, takes their money when he dies, and she does not interrupt until he puts the most powerful man in the world, Fred Willard (Ooops, I mean the president of the United States). Once again it could have been fun and although I was glad that Corsaire (Ann Dusenberry in real life) was not afraid to embrace everything, her acting was terrible. What a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Short movie # 3 <br /> <br /> I can not believe I've come this far. This is the beginning policeman Brent Falcone (Robby Benson) with veteran Stan Nagurski (Richard Widmark). Falcone is young, na√Øve, he thinks he can really help people, even though he becomes cynical after he was shot a few thousand times. Nagurski really gave up his care. He watches robberies, assaults, you name them and you never intervene. He thinks the world is unlawful and will probably be sued if he does something. Even Christopher Lloyd (at the end of the taxi) takes part in the action, calling the police officers, committing a crime, but having there his lawyer to protect him. God bless America! <br /> <br /> Once again, it could have been fun, the performances were deliberately camp, but goodness, without energy. Henry Jaglom and Bob Giraldi should be ashamed that they have their names on this schlock. I think the writing was not bad, the ideas were there, but the execution was interrupted, as was the attempt to rescue hostages in Iran in the crisis. If I was part of this movie, I would like my name to be removed, it's terrible. On the other hand, that's why I watched it. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this junk is that Dr John did the film score (repeating "I'm going to the movies" many times), and the movie is not much longer than an hour and a half. Show it on the film class with the headline "what NEVER you should do in filming". This script should be left on the shelf, because it is so bad.
