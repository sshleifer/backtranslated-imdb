I do not even want to call it a movie - it's a movie that should not have won any prize. Acting was awful, as were stupid scenarios. This is exactly a movie that many people think is intended for the public of NRI, but is actually hated for their awkwardness and overwhelming sense of "rehearsal" throughout the film. <br /> <br /> I think it is strange that so many actors who speak English have such a difficult task, doing so convincingly in front of the camera. I am sure that many readers know what I am talking about - all these English symbolic expressions thrown into the film, in Hindi and regional cinema in order to get interesting points. There are several Indian movies in which English seems completely authentic - Being Cyrus was the last. Although it was not a great movie, it was a good movie, and the language did not seem "imposed". <br /> <br /> I'm embarrassed that P3 received the NFA award in 2005. The only semi-pleasant parts of this trash were Konkana and a somewhat catchy foundation in the background. Also, do not waste time on this movie.
