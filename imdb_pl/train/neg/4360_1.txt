First and foremost, let me say that I had to think a lot about writing a commentary on the film. The best review of this kind of cinema can only be the silence. The film is addressed to housewives and grandmothers. This film tries to look "authentic" and the characters should be "real people". Italy could never have thought that characters could be "real": they are simply "low profile" stereotypes. It gives a very wrong vision of what life in the Italian countryside is. The plot is poor (the plot? Which plot?), And humor does not make anyone laugh older than 12 years old.
