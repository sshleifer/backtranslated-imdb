Fortunately, I did not pay to see this movie. I can not even reveal any spoilers because I eagerly FUCKed after forty minutes of film. It was so bad. I was laughing once when Yahoo! the billboard fell on the guy, and the theme song appeared. But it was only because I thought it made me laugh, but then I realized that it was NEEDING more product. <br /> <br /> I loved the cartoon. I watched it almost religiously. (Although I missed the last episode, I heard that they show Dr. Claw and it was just a claw, someone commented on the show). At this point, the cartoon had much more Penny and Brain. I hated the settings of the whole thing, reminiscent of Robocop. Then Broderick screwed up with all the feeling of Inspector Gadget. He is not as clumsy as this cartoon. Another fact is that his gadgets actually work to the point where I've seen, with the exception of oil stains. He also fucked the tone of "Wowsers", who was once excited. I felt so disappointed that they murdered the cartoon so much. Everyone felt so too. We, children aged 14-17, fondly remember this cartoon and we loved every minute of it. <br /> <br /> I went to the movie with an open mind, knowing that they would spoil the cartoon. I was surprised by how delayed this movie was. He relied on visual gags and stupid dialogue for humor. Disney relies on pain and physical humor to push a movie for children. Product placement is pointless in this video and shows. A smart car is not so good at breaking. The gadgets look nice, but they were almost too shiny. The cartoon looked better. Stupid scenes were nonsense. Within 40-45 minutes I watched the movie, I did not hear any laughter, and they were laughing at the preview of Dudley-Do-Right. This film should not be watched by people who want intelligence in their family entertainment. I highly recommend "The Iron Giant", which was sad but very good. This film is a travesty of the whole family drama .------------ 1
