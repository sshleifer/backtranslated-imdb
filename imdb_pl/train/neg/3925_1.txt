I saw this "hot" movie when it appeared in 1986. He had an X rating for a short scene with oral sex, but he played in major theaters (it was an "artistic" film). Apparently, this is the first movie that ever showed a respected actress in a clear sex scene. <br /> <br /> What I saw was a boring story about a boy in love (understandable) from high school (Federico Pitzalis) with an elderly woman (Maruschka Detmers). As mentioned earlier, Detmers is very beautiful with a good body, but also gave very good results. Pitzalis was (to put it mildly) quite poor. No wonder he never made another film. Despite this, despite the infamous sex scene (which is clear but quite short), this slow, boring story bored me stupid. The good working through the Detmers only helped at some point. I was mainly looking at my watch, patiently waiting for it to end. If not for this sequence, this movie would be forgotten a long time ago. Boring and slow. You can omit this one.
