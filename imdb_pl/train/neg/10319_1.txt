Unlike many, I do not think that the premise or subject of this performance is the least offensive. Its implementation is however a completely different matter. Like many B-minus movies, all decent gags seem to be connected in a trailer. For most of the 22-minute minutes we sit in the fading expectation of every piece of real humor. Or at least something that will stop you from manipulating the remote control or counting carpet fibers. With some exceptions, acting is terrible; comic abuse of emotions and gestures of some cast members may be well suited to night-time advertising, but not for sitcoms from primitive times (even Canadian). Regardless of the original cultural point of view, I can not help but think that it's mainly badly burned by CBC to repeat the success of Corner Gas. Unfortunately, they received a tone - and the script - quite wrong for the prairie. The last insult is that they apparently could not even afford to work in a specific small town (why? Is it so hard to find them in Saskatchewan?) Did they think the audience would be cheated by the city center of Regina? As a proud Canadian, I hope that it will soon disappear, and the rest of the world, initiated by CBC journalists, quickly forgets about this huge embarrassment from the series.
