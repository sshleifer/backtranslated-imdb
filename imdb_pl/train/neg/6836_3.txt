Please, even if you are in the worst mood, refrain from watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I do not think anything is going to happen with this movie at all. At the recommendation of a friend, I watched it and literally rinsed my wardrobe in the space of 1h and 48 min. Poor acting, stupid direction, weak plot and pathetic action sequences - and when you combine it, you'll get "Double Impact." Even the smallest expectations were not met. <br /> <br /> I think I've learned one thing - never watch Van Damme action movies. They are pure waste of time!
