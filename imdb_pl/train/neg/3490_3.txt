Enjoying Jean Arthur in "The Devil and Miss Jones", my interest was the highest, so I tried to sit through this second string of discs about the death of the jockey - but I did not get to the end. Arthur, photographed darkly in a movie magazine, or wants a support from her former husband, William Powell, or another photo for a marriage, but I never felt to her because the character is just a series of wise (she is a type of heroine prone to comic curiosity, but once in the morgue - like all women in these 30 comedies - faints). William Powell has reportedly spent a lot of time working with Miss Arthur, but you will never know that from the final result; they look awkwardly standing side by side, hesitating to tease them. The actor playing butler Powell is excruciating, and the breaks for the viewer laugh with concern.
