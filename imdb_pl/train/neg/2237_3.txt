I got this DVD from a friend who got it from someone else (and it probably goes on ...). Even a DVD cover looks cheap, like the whole movie. Arrows and fistfights with delayed sound effects, one of the worst actors I've ever seen in my life, a very simple intrigue, make me laugh, until my stomach hurts! With very little financial resources I have to admit that it looked quite professional. Perceived as a movie, he was one of 13 dozen gangsters who no one is waiting for. So: if you are tired and want cheap laughs, see this movie. If not, throw it out the window.
