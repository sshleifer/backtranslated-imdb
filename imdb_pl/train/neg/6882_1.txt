I hated how Mrs Perez presented the Puerto Ricans! We are not all in the ghetto - and we speak Spanish - not Puerto Rican! I can not speak for the uneducated people you have come across. But our language is intact, our island is our pride. Puerto Rico is better in economic terms than any other Caribbean island! I'm glad we are not like Cuba, Dominican Republic or Haiti, free from American influence? Free in real poverty, not in the American poverty standard. We are not victims, we are immune, humble, honest and intelligent people. Our origin includes strong African roots, but not "black" roots - I have nothing to do with Black Americans 9 for research). <br /> <br /> The analogy between Pedro Albizu, Che GuevarrÄ… and Martin L. Kingiem could <br /> <br /> MLK was a great hero a real revolutionist - an honest man who saw a day when we would all be free. <br /> <br /> Che Guevarra helped Castro create Kuba, who is today, is this why a boat full of Cubans risked his life to come to America - because Che made such a better place for them? You had a great, amazing, bright idea, but you politicized him too much. We have so many things that we can be proud of as a nation - do not be ashamed of our people who persecute us. I'm not a Nuyorican and maybe that's why I can not share your views. I am a Puerto Rican, I speak Spanish, I am not a victim and I have achieved many of my goals in America. If in the future there is a part 2 - less policy more history, more history of triumph - there are many. <br /> <br /> Damaris Maldonado
