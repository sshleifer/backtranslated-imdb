I had high hopes for Troy and I am very bitterly disappointed. The film was directed so much that my stomach ached. The pace was so slow, the dialogue was fun, and the movie - except for the nice scene of the fight between Achilles (Pitt) and Hector (Bana) - the rest was shallow. <br /> <br /> And why, oh, why Hollywood always insists on rewriting stories to fit the "consumer consent". Agamemnon did not die in Troy, the war lasted 10 years, and Achilles was killed by Paris. Away from the walls of Troy with an arrow! It annoys me that a classic story like this turns into soap. <br /> <br /> And do not even start me with the "lack" of chemistry between Helen and Paris. She was the woman the war was fighting for, and she did not even look as if they both cared a lot about the other. No sparks, no emotions, no hope. <br /> <br /> I have to say that in defense of films Brad Pitt, Eric Bana and Peter O 'Toole behaved very well with the bad script, but that's not enough to save this awful movie. <br /> <br /> Can anyone tell me where the budget of 200 million pounds went? Maybe in all the trees they used for funerary pyres - where did all these trees come from? <br /> <br /> I am so disappointed that it hurts.
