I caught it in IFC yesterday and I can not believe in positive reviews! Am I the only one who thought that these "ladies" are something other than? Kate tells Jed that she could be fired because she is supposed to be a pillar of the community, but puts him on his feet! Then they suddenly decide that they are in love? And she is so devastated by his death that he does not attend his funeral, let alone tell his family the "good news"! By the way, how did the American become the director of a very good British school? Janine should be thrown out of her strength for her unforgivable abuse of power, but nothing happens! And she finished, glancing at the interrogation! And the less you were told about Molly, the better! <br /> <br /> Regarding Janine and Molly's guilt, please, Jed! It's a damned punk wine that has changed in a roadkill! Where is the guilt for poor Gerald who vomits? If only I could do the same with Bozos for this "movie"!
