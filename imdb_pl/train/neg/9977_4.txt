This kid is rather angry, but in no way makes him a type outsmarting adults and can thwart experienced thieves at every turn. No, he is not a brat because he is a child with serious emotional problems. The nice couple who want to adopt are rather pissed off in adoption and while the husband is a little more willing to give this child a chance that the mother is not. In the bizarre form of Michael Richards and always annoying Gilbert Gottfried, and you have a rather bad movie with a few laughter in this place. Actually, I prefer the sequel to this movie because I like the fact that they brought Amy Yasbeck back as a different, more sympathetic character, because the movie has from one to many characters that are completely unacceptable. Even the kid at the beginning is quite annoying, and they also cool him a little in the sequel. The plot is so simple that because future parents decide to adopt this kid, who they think is great in the way the orphan plays a party, they quickly realize that they have some damn things themselves. Add this little infernal contact with some convict. I'm not sure about this character, at first I thought it was supposed to be his real father or something like that. Not so good, but I'll choose this kid Culkin every day of the week.
