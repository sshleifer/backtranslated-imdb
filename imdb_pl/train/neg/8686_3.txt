I mark this as a "spoiler" only because of some of my comments to the content of the series, not the content itself. <br /> <br /> When I read the comments, it is obvious that these Republicans somehow tolerate the performance, but neglect it, while the Democrats seem to enjoy the so-called truthfulness. One reader even (apparently) actually indicates that he believes that these events took place or could have happened when Bush was in primary school. <br /> <br /> But when it comes to content, how do I see it, I try to be neutral, it is that the group that created this series must really be really hating Bush. In the episode I saw last, s02e03, he showed that the program had to be made long before McCain became the leading nomination candidate; because all the runners in front are described. <br /> <br /> Another thing that caught my attention was the use of cabinets. I thought that the series had to be made in Europe, certainly not in the US, because I do not know a home in the US, which would not build a wardrobe, and most likely in artists' houses. <br /> <br /> When I watch the program, yes, I am entangled in it, I am amazed to see what must be the incredible desire of writers to do what they can to embarrass our president. Sure there are problems that most Americans will agree with, but this is not a reason to be so hateful in public shows around the world. Perhaps this trend has already been established by this program and the network so that IF Obama or Hillary will enter, will they continue to produce and give the same kind of "humor" about them? <br /> <br /> Only one more comment on comments from the commentator. If in 2000 there were any changes in the election, according to this writer he was so sure that he would be a completely different acceptable president. Wow, wishful thinking on his part. Regarding the events of 911, I believe that it was launched when Clinton was president, and I do not see it as if Gore was the president, everything would be completely different.
