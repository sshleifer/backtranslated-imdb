Throw to die in a movie that is much smaller. Vanessa Redgrave dies, but before she leaves, she tells her daughters the story of her life and her secret love ... <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that have the look and feel of being a great movie simply because they have so many great actors and actresses in them that it seems to be about something other than the potboiler that they really are. Not bad, but with Redgrave, Toni Collette, Glenn Close, Meryl Streep, Clare Danes, Natasha Richardson, Eileen Atkins, Patrick Wilson, Hugh Darcy and others (all this gives great performances) you're expecting something more than just a tearful story than a harlequin romance. <br /> <br /> Wait for the cable.
