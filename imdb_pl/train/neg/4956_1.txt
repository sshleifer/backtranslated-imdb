When this cartoon was broadcast for the first time, I had the impression that it would be at least halfway down, boy, I was wrong. I must admit that watching this cartoon is almost as painful as watching Batman and Robin with George Clooney all those years ago. I watched several episodes, and two of them ordered Batman to literally kick left and right butt through Penguin who fought like Jet Li and beat Batman shit, and I watched the next episode in which Batman kicked Joker again who apparently used Jackie Chan's movements, turning in the air like a ninja. Ever since the Joker or Penguin ever fought for Batman? and even worse when they were Joker and Penguin Kung Fu's counterparts Jackie Chan and Jet Li. It's really embarrassing, depressing and sad how Batman's picture is portrayed in this program. Animation is awful and the dialog is awful. Being a fan of Batman from an early age, I can honestly and definitely advise you to stay away and avoid this show at all costs, because this is not a real picture of Batman. This cartoon is more like a would-be Kung Fu Flick and if you really want to see a classic Batman cartoon, I strongly recommend Batman the Animated Series, but this cartoon is nothing but a piece of S --- T! Download the Batman: The Animates series and do not waste time on this cartoon.
