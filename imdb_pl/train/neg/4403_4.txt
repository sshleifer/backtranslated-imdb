Regardless of the advantages of the film, it is poorly researched. As others have pointed out, the film shows Iranians speaking Arabic and not Persian. This is enough to lose credibility for anyone who has the least knowledge about the area or the country. The landscape could not be more different from the real one. <br /> <br /> Other factual errors: the train is shown in Afghanistan, while Afghanistan has no turn. The Turkish ambassador is wearing Fez (red hat), while Fez has been banned by Turkey much earlier than in the film. The daughter of the Turkish ambassador is actually dressed as an Indian, and Indian classical music plays in the background in many scenes. I suppose the filmmakers who wanted to show an exotic woman and the sari were what they decided to make it exotic.
