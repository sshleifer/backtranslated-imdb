This is one of those movies that make you want to spend the time you watched and then some time, like Time you accidentally sacrificed, time spent in getting to the video store, etc. <br /> <br /> After first, appearance: is grainy, low budget. This is not a bad movie alone. But the way it was filmed makes the action look unnatural, so it's kind of distracting. <br /> <br /> Then the story. Three girls are going to a gala weekend away from the guys. Of course, as EVERYONE does during the trip to the campsite, they stop on their way to get the earrings. When they reach the place where they intend to stay, they are detained by Mr. Ranger, who hets them for throwing a lit cigarette out of the car during a fire, and then goes where they are going (remote cabin). Of course, 2 "cute boys" are wandering around, and Bambi (yes, Bambi) and Aubry are immediately paralyzed, but apparently Bambi is smothered in anything with two legs. Mady is rather disappointed with this development, because she could not wait for the weekend of forgetting about her former person, facing ** and confronting her gal friends. <br /> <br /> Oh, I almost forgot there is an old old hermit who lives this way, maybe someone with whom one does not get tangled up, and the area and cabin they are in have a kind of "reputation". <br /> <br /> So, of course, sooner or later (unfortunately LARGE later) some of our weekend guests begin to die and find various traps (though a few of them go a little lower) and of course the other campers are clearly upset. Of course, we do not answer a mobile phone (who would miss the opportunity to check your mobile phone for pickup in the movie?). Mr. Ranger Sir still appears in strange times and his behavior seems a bit strange, but he said he would get help. <br /> <br /> There's a fantastic phrase in it that you just do not want to miss if you're still awake. Pray that you wake up on a blank screen. <br /> <br /> The action is horrible, the production values ​​are terrible and the whole venture is simply bad and I think it's amazing that it even got fired. Avoid at all costs, 1 in 10.
