I rented this movie for a few laughs. I've never seen SNL skits, but with hits like Tommy Boy and Waynes World, it could not be that bad, right? Answer: it was. This movie was not a way to relax after a hard day at work. I just waited for the story and the fun part, but there was none. The highlight was tiffany amber thieson, and that's it.
