I just watched the movie yesterday at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2006 and seriously wonder if people at the festival actually display films before their choice. The film was simply awful - I say that without exaggeration and hidden motives - it was terrible. Matthew Modine's days as a leading man are far away. Gina Gershon had an inexplicable and unnecessary English accent - she should be ashamed of her participation in this film. Gloria Reuben had a bit of a strange episode - she should be ashamed. The script was horrible and we were given absolutely no reason to care for the heroes. I doubt very much that it will be taken away, but people from Hollywood make mistakes. I really think "Kettle of Fish" is a serious candidate for the worst movie I've ever seen.
