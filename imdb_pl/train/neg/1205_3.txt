What is this? A Canadian zombie movie that I've never heard of before. A funeral worker is working on the body of a recently deceased youth. This allows for an extended retrospection that shows how the guy got there. Basically he and friends went to the cemetery on Friday the 13th and raised the dead thanks to his silly singing. Go back to the morgue, where our dead body comes back to life and kills the funeral entrepreneur and the owner (who jumps out of his sight). Final WTF? shot has a funeral home owner in a simple jacket and yells: "I'm not crazy!" Strangely, he has his eyes back. <br /> <br /> Starting just 58 minutes, this is certainly one of the curiosities in the zombie cinema. I feel much longer, but put me in a trance in which I can not stop watching. In the film there is also one of these "if you see this picture, turn away from the screen" of a gag. It is a picture of an old man suffering from theater (prophetic?), And when he appears (only twice), blood begins to flow. The scenes are quite damn during this period. There is a great blip in which the zombie rips off the girl's right hand with a shovel, but when he pulls the fake hand into the frame to pump it, it is the left hand.
