I really can not think of any redeeming features of this completely wrong rendering of Asimov than of the direction of art. Forget about the catastrophe associated with product placement, the unconvincing performance of Will Smith and the giant holes. It was not only funny but also painful. Even the action was boring. The mixture of MTV-inspired production values ​​and a completely bad dialogue was probably aimed at very young children. <br /> <br /> What a pity that science fiction can be so bad after we had Blader, a minority report or, to a lesser extent, Dark City (the same director). This really belongs to the bottom list of 100. Really terrible.
