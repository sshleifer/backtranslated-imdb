I got this movie because I worked in a movie shop, so I got free rentals. He came in and the cover made it look good. Hot chick, carrying a gun, all right, I'll check it. <br /> <br /> About a man, a bad move. It was so horrible that I spent half the movie watching quickly to get to the nudity, which was minimal. I think there MIGHT be three scenes of partial nudity. <br /> <br /> Trashy dialogue, shitty violence, bad character excuses. I put this movie wrong because I know it was made on a cheap budget, but it was the same with "Clerks" and became an iconic classic and series. <br /> <br /> 2/10.
