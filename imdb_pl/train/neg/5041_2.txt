The film Ye Lou "Purple Butterfly" assumes a secret organization (Purple Butterfly) against Japanese forces in a war torn apart in Shanghai. Ding Hui (Zhang Ziyi) and her former lover Hidehiko Itami (Toru Nakamura) find themselves on opposite sides of the conflict after an accidental meeting. <br /> <br /> I agree with a reviewer from Paris. The film replaces a conspiracy, a semi-historical conflict with a plot, without giving the audience any single reason to care for the heroes or their causes. A sudden shift of time does not help, because it seems completely unjust and pointless. I usually do not mind dark films, but the lack of light, shocking camera shots and generally bad film techniques really make the movie difficult to watch and remains interested. I also agree with the viewer from Georgia that this film "has a chaotic style of editing and claustrophobic cinematography", but I do not think it helps the film. The background of the film is one of the strongest events of the 20th century and I do not believe that it can be done justly, editing it as if it were a Michael Bay movie. Overly melodramatic moments do not increase his viewership. <br /> <br /> All actors are suitably melancholy. Zhang Ziyi once again shows that he has an extremely limited range of acting, because he spends the whole film doing what seems best done in all his films, thinking and looking generally annoyed. However, at least he adds a bit of this role by burning chains and getting involved in the worst creation scene from the time of Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton in The Terminator. <br /> <br /> All in all a very disappointing movie, especially seeing how it came from the director of Suzhou He. 2/10
