I gave the film 2 stars only because Dominic Monaghan put a lot of effort into his acting. Everything else in this movie is extremely amateur. Everything related to the direction of this film was very poorly made. The director should not only think about what he's doing for a career in life, but maybe he should watch a few films. Because Dominic Monaghan is a very credible actor, putting him in the movie of this caliber makes him look awful. Whoever played the "actor", Jacek's best friend should never stand in front of the camera. I did not expect much after such a small movie, but maybe a little more time and effort should be put in the characters and their surroundings. Do not waste time or money on this movie (like me), you will be very disappointed.
