I like the cast, but the story is developing quite slowly. Danny Glover does a good job wondering if he's a bad guy. Meanwhile, other characters are just part of the story. Dennis Quaid did not have as much space in history as he could. I thought the first scene was a bit exaggerated compared to how the story unfolded. However, I would watch it again. I rated it at 5 (I would like to rate it at 5.5)
