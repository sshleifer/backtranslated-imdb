I am shocked that there were people who liked this movie. I saw him in Tribeca and most of the audience laughed at him during the scenes that were not meant to be fun. I felt bad because the main actress was in the audience, but to be honest the conspiracy for this film required a BIG revision ... did not even make sense, one second heroes ask what exactly they are snorting ... the scene is hopelessly addicted and wonders how to do it ? The ending was also over. I'm not going to spoil a great application ... but it mixed up with the rest of the terrible plot / script ... see this movie for comedy, if you must ...
