I waited almost 25 years to see this movie, thinking that it might be an underestimated work, because the animation from the era was no longer quality. He appeared in one of the best films of the villains of all time, based on a beloved series of children's books and was a production of Disney Studios. What could be wrong with it? As it turns out, almost everything. <br /> <br /> Well, not everything. Vincent Price as Rattigan and the elegant result of Henry Mancini are two favors in the film. The price is incredibly pleasant, and Mancini more professional than it deserves. They bring the class to a project that otherwise belongs to it. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the rest of the movie, filled with inadequate adult situations, still suffers from a completely boring scenario, a nondescript voice, horrible songs and lazy animation that would not be out of place on any of the Disney television programs on Saturday from the mid-1980s. <br /> <br /> It was a complete disappointment for me. It's amazing that this movie was almost contemporary with The Secret of NIMH. Costing a fraction of this, the independent studio has produced something more creative in its trailer than GMD in its never-ending time. <br /> <br /> An additional star that stops you from being "horrible" goes to Price and Mancini.
