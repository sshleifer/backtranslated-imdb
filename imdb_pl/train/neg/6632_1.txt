What happened to our dear Ramu? Is it the same man who created Sarkar, Satya and Comapny? I do not believe that. If AAG was Ramu's most ambitious project, he clearly jumped from the high cliff he joined, giving industry one of the greatest works of all time. This movie was created to fall like a brick. I cringed before leaving the theater, but I had to sit, because I would not be able to leave the car park before the others left. What's more, nothing would make me sit outside the interval. <br /> <br /> This movie is nowhere near Sholay. He does not even approach him in a radius of a mile. I believe that Ramu certainly loves the Godfather more than Sholay, because Sarkar was a classic work. I read Ram's interview a few days ago, in which the interviewer said that Ramu does not sleep more than four hours a day, it's not too long. I totally agree with that because his lack of sleep probably left its mark on the film. <br /> <br /> Performance does not have power. Amitabh Bachchan does not even look terrible. He looked more frightening on several posters and wallpapers I saw earlier. Ramu's favorite, Nisha Kothari, did a fantastic job at Sarkar because she did not have many dialogues (in fact, there are no, if I remember correctly). She opened her mouth in this movie and found a place in history. The new guy playing the role of Jai seems to have this audacious look, but he did not cope with Jai's role at all. I can not go on ... I'm sorry ... my pain is too big for me to deal with. <br /> <br /> I promised myself for the whole movie that I will see the original Sholay again that it is still there. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Scary movie. Media and critics will cook the goose Ramu. And to remind all readers, I am one of Ramu's greatest fans, and I can not even spare him for this act.
