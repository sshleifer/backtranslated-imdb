I rarely make such comments, BUT after watching most of Rankin's terrible movie, I feel that I really deserved the right to talk about what I think about it! I could not do it to the end and became one of a half-dozen or more walkers (about one third of the audience) on a ragged plot, pathetic dialogue and insulting characteristics that had become too difficult to bear. this film is a pose and art. all style and no substance. he is overwhelmed by terrible acting, a truly terrible script, indifferent cinematography and production values ​​at the student level. how it was financed, started and completed is a mystery to me. I bet you have a million pounds, you will never go to the general release. the right critics would tear it apart. really bad movie. shockingly angry. really very poor effort And that's not even mentioning the unpaid deep fryer with new born cats. completely irrelevant, completely light, badly connected; this film is a terrible shame for cinema uk.
