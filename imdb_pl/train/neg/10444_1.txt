The only great thing about the movie is its title. In this case, "Snake On a Plane" is an example of not judging a book by its cover, the title says nothing about the film. When I went to the theater, I did not expect Citizen Kane, I was expecting Independence Day, a movie that is pure popcorn, but instead I got this horrible Roy Liotta movie called "Turbulence". SO SO is so bad. The only thing that makes SOAP better is its title. And this is not even the famous movie title, there was not even a flash of "snake" or "plane" 40 minutes to the movie! What a false ad! Were it not for its title, SOAP would be another unforgettable summer movie of class B. And the rating of R? This must be the most undeserved R movie ever! The creators of the film only add a few words to make it R, All violence is maintained at pg-13 level. Do you know what really has an R rating? Superstar with R Edge rating! See him in Summerslam instead of wasting money on a snake!
