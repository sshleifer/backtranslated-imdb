You can look at it in many different ways. This movie sucks, good or just weird. The third probably best explains this movie. He has strange topics and has a strange plot. So who would not play Christopher Walken yet, no matter how bad, medium or even how good it can be. <br /> <br /> Acting was what you would expect especially from Ben Stiller. Jack Black I've always liked it, so you know what you get out of it, but it's not bad. Christopher Walken is always off the beaten track. It's always nice to watch no matter how bad the movie is. Comedy is a bit funny. This of course means that he has his moments (although it is very little), but it can happen here that I feel that the movie is just desperate for laughter, but of course not in a good way. <br /> <br /> The director was also average. Barry Levinson is a slightly overrated director and he really did not do a good job here. This film seemed to have much more potential and did little to achieve it. Just very average and it did not seem that a lot of effort was made to make this movie. <br /> <br /> Writing is the key to good comedy. Of course, this means that writing here has failed. At best, it's below average. Given that he has his moments, it was not too scary. However, this is never a good thing to say about the movie. <br /> <br /> If it were not for Christopher Walken and that stupid funny ending, I would give him a lower rating. In her films, she is always quite a character. Stil is just a strange movie with strange characters who are not going anywhere. Not entirely frightening, but I would not recommend it because it is a very forgotten movie.
