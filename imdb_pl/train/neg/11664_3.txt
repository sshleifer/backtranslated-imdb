I wanted to enjoy this movie so much. He moved very slowly and he was just boring. If it was on TV, it would take 15-20 minutes. What happened to history? A great cast and photographer worked on a flawed foundation. If it is loosely based on the director's life, why did not he persuade someone to see that the letter itself is "loose". Then he directed it at a snail's pace, which could have been the source of several people who were nodding their heads during the film. Music rises, but for a different movie, not this ... probably the saga of a soap opera. There were times when dialogue was not understandable when Armin Meuller Stahl spoke. I was not alone because I heard some murmurs about who told who. Why can not Hollywood make better movies? This one had a lump of great history, but it was just badly made.
