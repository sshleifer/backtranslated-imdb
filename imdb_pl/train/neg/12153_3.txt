Feeding The Masses was another movie that wanted to earn some money from the zombie frenzy that is happening around, mainly due to the popularity of movies like Land Of The Dead and Resident Evil. <br /> <br /> It starts with a television station that is guarded by the army, and they report that the Lazarus (zombie) virus is about to close, and the city will soon be able to do business again. The problem is that it is completely false. Zombies are running violently and only a small part of people are aware of this. Among them are Torch (William Garberina), the camera man, Sherry (Rachael Morris), the main anchor (which for some reason is mentioned as playing Shelly on this site) and Roger (Patrick Cohen), their military escort. Torch and Sherry are against people's lies, but the station is run by secret services (or some other government agency) and they are highly censored. <br /> <br /> This video is slapped on the back of the box-cover saying "We're holding FEEDING MASS at a higher level than any of the three" of the Dead "films by George A. Rombero." The source of this quote has lost ALL of it credibility. <br /> <br /> I'll just say that this movie is BAD. I do not mean that I was expecting more (of course I was), but I mean, I could not find any advantages in the movie. Operation in all parts is either made or too wooden. Did anyone remember their lines or read memory cards? I can not even think about what was the best part of the movie, or the best actor / actress. It really was not. If I had to bend someone, I would say Roger, the military escort was probably the most interesting figure, but he does not really say much. <br /> <br /> I would have to recommend giving this film, despite the fact that the cover looks pretty good (it just attracted me to the movie). 3/10
