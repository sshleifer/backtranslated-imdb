I have not read a single IMDb commentary on the movie, which mentions how a Jewish character in this movie jumped up and down like a small child when a racist skinhead pointed to his face while the black hero looked stern in the barrel of the gun. . <br /> <br /> I do not know how anyone could see this as a balanced account of university life. I agree that universities are not bastions of tolerance, how they should be, and the title would be right if Singleton did not make his heroes so wide caricatures. <br /> <br /> On the surface, he tries to portray Ice Cube as a bad guy, provoking Remy to become a racist skinhead. But who is completing his studies in the redeeming film epilogue? It seems that Singleton points to whites who are unable to empathize (I did not say I feel sorry!) With their black student OR just on the path of racist skinhead. Many people who have been persecuted by people of a different race do not go into extreme bigotry. <br /> <br /> Women who have been raped do not immediately turn to lesbianism, which is presented more as a cult than a lifestyle. Honestly, what was the point?
