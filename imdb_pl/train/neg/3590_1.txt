How low can someone sink, trying to regain the old glory? ST: HF will gladly show you. <br /> <br /> If you're used to watching a good show at Star Trek, DO NOT watch it. <br /> <br /> Writing is a hodge -podge, portraits of actors are weak and, above all, design works are simply dog. <br /> <br /> Like watching strong captains, do not look here! How strong is the Federation's attitude? Forget about it here! Starfleet is ridiculed by couriers wearing SPIKES in their hair. <br /> <br /> While the seemingly poorly thinking captain shuffles and within two minutes of the credits for the opening of the exhibition, Ensign Spikey tries to arrange a tryst with an engineer. From there it degrades. No, even uniforms do not fit, for God's sake. They are too small or too large, the collars on the chest, and TNG Seasons One and Two Uniforms mingle with the uniforms of the third and DS9 season. Strict discipline and tradition of each of the originals that are lacking in this production up to the degrees! The only good side of this program is its graphics, which seems to improve slightly with each season. OK, I'm taking it back. Who uses CG so inexperienced? Designers of this series. <br /> <br /> Do not bother about it, it will offend your Star Trek sense, just like mine. Even a return to previous shows can not save this catastrophe. <br /> <br /> I cried openly when I was watching, probably because my eyes were bleeding and my head was almost bursting. So bad.
