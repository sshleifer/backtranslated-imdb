Lets be honest. As a film school project, made without budget and "real" actors, this film is extremely interesting. As something to be released on a DVD for an innocent browser, it is a very poorly produced product. If I was idly changing channels and accidentally grabbing this movie, I would probably stop my eye and attention for a moment. As a person who bought this DVD impressed that I will get the right movie product, i.e. Film, I feel deeply disappointed. It is a TV game with video recordings, something like the old series from the sixties, but without this certain charm. In addition to the main character, Mr. Redfield (who is also a director), other actors seem to be campus snapshots (a little too old for this) or the director's house members who appear in front of the camera without any help. Not only the working sofas, but also make-up artist or hairdresser (cap on overhanging permanent fringe or cylinder over color is very far from the creation of the 40's). Everything is shot with a fixed camera mounted in a small, bare studio, sometimes with a blue screen on the outside. The synthesizer has generated an unprecedented result of romantic karaoke inspired by the "period" that insults viewers more than once. The film tries to be "phenomenal", while in reality it is simply a concept-free collage of those shots that went into editing (and believe me, the standards were not too high to start). From time to time, interesting dialogues appear, but in general it is quite poor and two-dimensional production in more than one way, without brilliant genius on the part of the director or crew members. In this way, "artistic" films tried to look like in the 80's. Mr. Redfield does a much better job as an actor than a director.
