Salvage is the worst so-called horror movie I've ever seen. There is nothing terrible about it. It does not deserve to be in that genre. First of all, I do not see how many people can think about this piece of such a great movie. If I wrote something so boring and completely ridiculous, I would be ridiculed and too embarrassed to subject others to stupidity. Second: acting is terrible, and the main actress is terribly ugly. Thirdly: history sucks, has been used earlier, and the excuse that her cheap movie is not an excuse. Read the summer on the back of the case, reveals the whole story. I do not recommend watching this movie unless you have 80 minutes to waste something that will regret watching it. I feel very bad for these Cheaters and the irony of their name. All grad Anthony Perkins !!!!!!!!!
