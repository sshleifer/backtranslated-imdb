The Zombie Revolution is BAD. There is nothing interesting about the film. It is boring, lifeless, malfunctioning and poorly written. I often complain that the original Dracula is a bit slow for my taste, and this movie makes Dracula look like a roller coaster ride. The 65 minute time seemed 165 minutes. <br /> <br /> History: the expedition is sent to Cambodia to find the secrets of mind control through "zombies". One man finds a secret and uses it to make the woman he loves marry him. When this happens, it releases the zombies under his control to terrible consequences. this is it! It's the whole story. <br /> <br /> For most of the movie I tried to find out where I saw the male lead. He looked so familiar. I had plenty of time to think about it. Nothing happened in the film. Just before the "rebellious zombies" it struck me. It was Dean Jagger. I saw him last as a general on white holidays. That's how I "played" most of the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I did not buy a DVD for this movie. King of the Zombies is on the other side and is a masterpiece of making movies compared to this movie. For what it's worth, I'll give him 2/10. (I will not go to 1/10, because, believe it or not, I've seen worse.)
