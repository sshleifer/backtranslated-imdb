After seeing the Tobe Hooper jewel, Crocodile, in 2000, I was very interested in the niciate college / crocodile of the exploitation / monster genre. I am looking forward to a recalcitrant producer who will continue with a few sequels to these charming delicacies of camp goodness. If only Ed Wood could bring his subtle sense of talent and dignity to these extraordinary scenarios. When Ed wrote scripts and a room full of monks creating crocodile special effects on the computer, all we would need is a cast of moronic feed with Russ Meyer's breasts and Ren Hoek breast implants. <br /> <br /> While the gruesome work of Tobe Hooper related to his own films, Blood Surf chose several aging motifs from a bucket of other films. See if you can view the Revenge of the Nerds sequels to find allusions / tributes? / Samples for Jaws, Temple of Doom, Indiana Jones' Last Crusade, The Convent, Godzilla 2000 and any James Bond movie. Also try to find a fade ready for the TV, in which the editor gave up making sense. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed that the pot could not try this sotto voce tenor with a monologue about environmental protection ... or passionate recognition, but quasi-captain Ahab in this story gives a speech. Perhaps in the years to come we will see a galloping gallop after shooting in the golden sunset. Or, hopefully, the monkey flushes the table in the toilet of an international space station to get dwarfs and enjoy the exploiting waltz of the monkey / monkey / dwarf / crocodile spill. <br /> <br /> In total, I was irritated by the lack of a bar in the music of surfing.
