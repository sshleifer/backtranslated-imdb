A stereotypical, derivative, unoriginal and boring western. Two popular stars (Charlton Heston and James Coburn) give performances that are far from their best and rightly so; they both have superficial roles and character traits mainly expressed through dialogue. Heston is the sheriff who "liked the world better than it used to be", and Coburn is an outlaw who "owes something to a man who closed him and has to pay his debt". In addition, Heston is so old that he has problems riding a horse, and Coburn is a mean and hard, but not as cold-blooded murderer as some of the lesser villains. Apparently, the filmmakers were not able to come up with ONE original idea of ​​how to make this film stand out a bit. (* 1/2)
