I could not watch more than 14 minutes. It's a GREAT combination of really bad acting and really bad direction. The shots used are disgusting, breaking the 180-degree angle all the time. My head hurts, try to watch the load "you know what". Dirt in the window of the "mysterious machine" makes you see the light from the window lighting ... annoying. What else ... all the time is so badly framed that you just want to shout at that lady. I've only directed short films, but I'm sure I would be better than directing a feature film ... the story is unbelievable, only the long French kisses scene at the beginning says it will be terrible. So, try to avoid really bad movies at all costs, you save about 5 bucks for borrowing, and 1:30 of your life will never come back ...
