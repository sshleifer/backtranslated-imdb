this movie was not absolutely horrible, but it was pretty bad. ACTUALLY was pretty good! jeffrey combs did a good job as a mad scientist, which is his specialty if you do not know such things: D. the bill for ... well, I'm not EXACT, why he was in this movie. he is too good for such things, and his role was not too demanding. I hired it under these two leads and I was not disappointed. I mean, damn it, it's a half-man / half-shark movie. They're not Shakespeare's people. In addition to the story, which is full of holes and poor dialogue, I would like to point out that the photos also left much to be desired. There were shots when they tried to look "cool", but it ended up covering the stage or simply moving away from the usual cheezy. They did so many times when they had a decent dialogue and they left prematurely before the person could deliver her. it was quite bad. but if you're a jeffrey combs fan, it's worth checking out. he gives a great performance and does what he can, with a character. also not bad, but also feminine. Hell, if I remember her name. Most importantly, I would not waste your time.
