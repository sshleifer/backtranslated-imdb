Ever since I started visiting this site and voting for films, I have never given any rating of 1. Even worrying "Dance training! Barbie "received 2. There is a reason for that. <br /> <br /> Every time I watch what I think is a really bad movie, I have to stop and ask myself the following question: "Is this movie really as bad as the frightening beast, which is" Theodore Rex " ? "And I have never been able to answer" yes ". <br /> <br /> I would give anything to know what the crackhead said: "Hey! Remake of "Blade Runner" with Barney as Harrison Ford! "And I decided it was a good idea to spend time and money filming. What's more, I want to know what kind of market the hell they were going to sell if it did not go to the video strait. This is the rare monster: a movie that is too violent for children and too crazy for adults. I would ask "what were they thinking?" But in this case it may be unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Anyway, all you need to know is that you should be horrible only if you are one of the five or six furious fans of "Howard the Duck", or if you're curious, how to watch the Evil Insane movie of all time, or you want to REALLY punish yourself.
