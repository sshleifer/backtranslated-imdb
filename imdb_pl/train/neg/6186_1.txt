It's wrong. Susannah Yorke is a great young Jane Eyre and her performance is impeccable. However, Edward Rochester is supposed to be 35. Gray-haired George C. Scott looks and acts like an arthritic 80. Jane's dead uncle is in better shape! It cracks and growls, nasty and gloomy. It looks like an ax killer who sent his ax to sharpen; it is not surprising that he is holding his wife in a cage in the attic! A great love story looks like a sado-masochistic nightmare. The novel is quite dark, but Rochester Bronte is relatively young, athletic, powerful and charming when he wants to be. He has a wonderful voice that speaks and sings, a good mind and a conscience that he tries to suppress without success.
