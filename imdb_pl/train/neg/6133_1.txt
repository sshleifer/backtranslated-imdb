Kurt Thomas plays Jonathan Cabot, a kind of gymnastics who trains in a special ninja-hunting game, but those ninja have no chance, especially since Cabot is a gymnast! As a whole, Gymkata is one bad movie, horrible acting, horrible scenario and really incompetent directing that makes the quality below human standards, but this movie is so terrible that it becomes really, very funny. I mean a dialogue like: "I know I will cut them!" Or "Ha !, your passage!", Just add the trial value that Gymkata gets. In addition, it is (Wisely) the only movie in which the hero is a gymnast who finds things that can rotate in the heat.
