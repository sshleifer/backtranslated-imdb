Because everything he does throughout this movie is naked for no reason. When Tarzan is bitten by a snake, he suddenly removes his clothes. Since when the poison boa suffocates? How did you poison Tarzan? The whole movie is fucked up. They could not choose animal species for this film. What does Orangutang do about these chimpanzees? He had to leave the set of a much better movie. A group of tribal cannibal people looks caucasin. Why? Why did Bo and her dad paint if they were to be eaten later? Probably it was just a bad excuse to show your breasts and curves again. Standing too close. Every real elephant of an African bull who was not from a circus would break the butt of this moron. Every wise hunter started firing the moment he saw him. if the camera was on LSD because it showed different scenes that were moving in slow motion for no reason. It made no sense. Boa constrictor, who Tarzan struggled with in the water, looks like one of those 12 Ft Rubber hoses you can buy at the local Spencer Gifts.Tarzan was strangely sp in this movie does not make sense, maybe with so much has flashed. I'm sorry, but this is a rip off of the classic black and white film Tarzan, with a similar but better story. Not to mention drafting. I saw that everyone forgot to mention. * (SPOILERS ALERT) * The scene in which she tries to save Jane and her father, makes him stand too close to the running water. It seemed to urinate on someone under him. Eww! He and Jane are also fooling around on the beach, with perky jumping and clapping monkeys. She must have taken her father's death well. * (END OF SPOILERS) * This video should be Surgeon General's Warning. too much vision Because naked in this movie will make you blind.
