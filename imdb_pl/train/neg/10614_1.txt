It's the worst movie I've ever seen and seen a few movies. It is transmitted as an artistic film, but it is really a piece of rubbish. One of the advantages is the beautiful dance of tango, but this can not compensate for Sally Potter's disgustingly obvious tribute. The story of this movie does not exist and I guarantee that you will start laughing till the end. Especially where he begins to sing. It is absolutely unrealistic.
