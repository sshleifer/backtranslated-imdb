The first half of this movie is pure pleasure. Novel. Funny. Great performances. A close brother and sister living in Manhattan belong to the same woman! Adult. Bright. Witty. What more can you want. As a romantic comedy, the refreshment begins. He is heading for unexplored territory. And then it falls apart. <br /> <br /> From the universal adult comedy to the story of the coming century from the wardrobe, which has been done many times. What a disappointment. As a movie film begins with such a promise. Why it must become a pedestrian film "I am who I am". The frozen frame of Heather Graham's shot in the air to celebrate "her happiness in finding herself," emphasizes the banality of the last part of the film. <br /> <br /> It could have been different. It could have been magical. It ended up on the same old old one.
