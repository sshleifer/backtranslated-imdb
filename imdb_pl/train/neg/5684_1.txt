badly directed rubbish. a mediocre nihilist sadistic gorefest ... if you're the kind of person who likes it ... see chicken. even if you are this person, it does not make it a good movie, acting is really poor, a story full of plot roles, the director really should just give up and find a real job, because there is no talent for it. I can see why people do not like uwe boll ... we've had some of his films lately and that's the best of them, which is really sad! The total lack of any humanity seems to fit some people, but here it just steals. Horrors can be devastating, they can be miniature works of art, they can be just good watching when there is nothing else ... SEED is really very poor.
