Ok, promos promised comedy, and people (a few) went to see it. Being the first version of 2006 is not a bad thing, neither this year, because the first and last movie is mainly a flop, with the exception of GHAJINI and several others <br /> <br /> Good coming to JAWANI DIWANI <br /> <br /> Review in a short film The film tells about Emraanie Hashmi, who does his usual things with sadness, this time he annoys after repetitions Ma irritably Hrishita Bhatt and lap Celina Jaitley <br /> < br /> Random dialogues, comedy scenes and ill-served drama and many gaps <br /> <br /> Direction is bad Emraan Hashmi is annoying here, fortunately now he is of age But after FOOTPATH ​​and MURDER and some decent work in several films in which the actor was sitting in it, and the directors focused on his kisses and the feminine image, which unfortunately lost his touch after the repetitions of Hrishita and Celina are bad Mahesh is terrible
