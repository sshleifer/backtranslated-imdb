I saw this movie on t.v. this afternoon and I can not see anyone sitting down by this piece of rubbish. It is not fun at all and it takes your IQ. down a few notches. I know this movie is for children, but that does not mean that authors should consider their intelligence to be obvious. I bet the writers were sitting at a large wooden table and came to the conclusion that a) the word "kupa" means big laughter. b) A four-foot-high kid can immerse himself in a ten-foot basketball net. c) Children should always fight with hijackers armed with guns, because hijackers will fall on everything and d) 3 months of karate training is all you need to defeat the so-called "ninja" swords. One good thing I can say about this movie is that it contains the weakest "gang" in the suburbs of the world that nobody can scare. Maybe the guys from MST3K can use this movie for a good laugh. Do not bother with this pretext for the movie.
