An incredibly horrible movie. I last saw this part on T.V. My jaw dropped as I watched the frighteningly invented plot and listened to the paralyzing mind. Not a single line from the liner master could come close to creating anything like a chuckle. It was so bad that I wanted to exhume Rodney Dangerfield's body, hit him and shout, "How could you?" I know that many movies are made in a hurry, hoping to earn the popularity of a given actor or subject. But please, Hollywood, show some respect for your audience. It is sad and scary that people should pay to see such tripe. Bottom of septic tanks, even by Sunday afternoon television standards.
