This film is a poor and forgotten Sean Connery vehicle. The performances are generally crapped especially by Capshaw, Fishburne and the usually solid Ed Harris. Connery seems ill-treated as Harvard Academic. The film is getting worse when it goes on. This is a third degree secret that becomes extremely sophisticated before it develops. The film breaks the perfect cast. George Plimpton also appears in a lesser role to add some seriousness to Connery when they discuss the death penalty. Violence and atmosphere fuck the third level of mystery / thriller, which is the manipulation to the highest degree. Scripts and direction are very weak. Charery's charisma and screen presence are the only advantage of the film. Manipulating, brutal and funny. 2/10 Avoid this.
