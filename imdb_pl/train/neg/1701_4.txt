The raw and primitive feature of David Lynch in South Park presents us with a nightmare of disturbing stereotypes about suburban middle-class families. The father is a hideous monster with three teeth and a disproportionately large circular opening from which the most terrible guttural sounds are uttered, the son and mother are permanently frightened, incoherent creatures for whom terror is a way of life. In the series there are many equally absurd figures. <br /> <br /> Lynch is not known for his comedies (eg On the Air, aspects of Wild at Heart), and I do not like comedy at all. There were, however, several scenes in Dumbland that made me laugh. There are some clever fragments of animated cinematography - where Lynch transmits a broad spectrum of reactions from her characters through a syntactic arrangement of shots in contrast to facial expressions (which is never different in Dumbland). <br /> <br /> I believe that Lynch really tried to give the audience a simple, though disturbing, animated comedy. Interestingly, he decided to follow in the footsteps of the recent ultra-low-brow humor (ie Most of Will Farrell's films), adding elements of misguided social criticism and classic cartoon violence and disgusting humor. Although the mix does not work very well here, it's not like Lynchian. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing Lynch fans.
