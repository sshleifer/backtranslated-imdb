I knew that this movie was supposed to be so bad that it was funny, so I went to it with this expectation. I just found out that it was so bad that it was murderously boring. A bizarre theme song is ridiculous for about 10 seconds until you realize that there is nothing wise about it, except for deliberately annoying quality. Seeing things stained with tomatoes is aging after about 30 seconds. There is nothing wise or amusing in the film, except for the premise. It can withstand a 3-4-minute comedy sketch, but this is not a feature film from any part of the imagination.
