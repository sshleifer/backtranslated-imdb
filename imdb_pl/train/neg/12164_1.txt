this movie is not good. the first of them was almost sucked, but he had an unreal ending to be worth watching. this is nothing. there is no fear, no voltage or tension. This is not really a horror movie. most killings do not show anything. there is no talk. it can be almost television, with the exception of some nakedness and a bit of violence. acting is not very good either. And do not start me from dialog.as for an unexpected ending, surprise, there is not one. I suppose it could have been worse, although I do not see how to do it. But then, it's less than 80 minutes, so I think it's a good thing, though I felt much longer. apparently it's a cut out version of the movie. And she found it at a very low price, but it's still not worth it. If you want a more simple graphic version, check out the Anchor Bay.anyway edition, this version of Sleepaway Camp II: Unhappy Campers gets a big 1/10 fat from me. If you're watching this movie, you'll probably be a bored and unhappy camper. If you're a real fan, you can choose the Sleepaway Camp Anchor Bay collection (with a survival kit) with three discs containing the first three videos of unprocessed special features
