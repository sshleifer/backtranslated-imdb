Interestingly, a novel without a storyline became the basis of two films. Although The Heiress was a good, if not quite exact, adaptation, Washington Square is hard and poorly preserved, except for the part of Dr Sloper, a film that could have been a lot better. <br /> <br /> The director's attempts to create "beautiful" scenes were so obvious that I cringed. There is nothing of subtle and simple beauty that a movie without a story like Onegin can have. I agree with other comments about the presentation of Katarzyna by Leigh as an idiot, instead of naive and shy; she made me despise her without feeling at her. <br /> <br /> Katarzyna's transition from childhood trust in the cynicism of an adult, the whole sense of this story, has been internalized, as in the novel. But we do not have the benefit of a narrative voice to tell us in the movie! I think someone left the adaptive class at the film school. <br /> <br /> I appreciate the director's attempts to make a moving and beautiful movie with difficult lyrics, but it just did not work.
