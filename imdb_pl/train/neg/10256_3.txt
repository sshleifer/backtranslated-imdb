Your mind will not be satisfied by this budget destruction thriller; but pray, who wants? A young couple spends the real end of the world in a hidden laboratory of some aliens posing as church people. <br /> <br /> A small apocalyptic tour, THE END OF THE WORLD, has ingenuity and lack of style and style of purely similar films from the 1950s. And not only this, but EOTW plays like a hybrid, not only the doomsday, but also the monastery . The black character of the film is a well-known hero of the character. <br /> <br /> This totally shameless slapdash seems to be a piece of monastic exploitation, which is largely a species of the '70s, which looks so funny today, outdated. In any case, the secret lab of the monastery is some nasty piece of futuristic style! Christopher Lee is the pride of End of the World; but the end of the world is not his pride at all!
