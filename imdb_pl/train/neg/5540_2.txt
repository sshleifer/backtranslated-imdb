After watching Revolt Of The Zombies with the participation of the future Oscar winner Dean Jagger, I was left with one burning question. How has the society that created these highest warlike battle machines been defeated? <br /> <br /> This is a question that you will be considering if you take the time to watch Revolt Of The Zombies. At the end of the First World War the French discover a cult from occupied Cambodia, where these undead creatures can not be stopped by crutches of monks who go through the mountain and displace Hun. <br /> <br /> It scares the living matter of feces from everyone interested, so an international expedition is created to learn how to destroy the secret of these zombies so that no nation can get them and rule the world. <br /> <br /> But we have got some opposition in these ranks. The first is the villain Snidely Whiplash Roy D'Arcy, who murders a Buddhist monk who has a secret and the other is Dean Jagger. Power is the best aphrodisiac, as we all know, and is determined to take Dorothy Stone away from rival Robert Nolanda. <br /> <br /> I think you have some idea of ​​how this will happen, especially since the zombie race did not conquer the world for one country. Dean Jagger, when he received an Oscar for the Twelfth Hour, had to shudder every time he thought about the movie and a horrible dialogue that tried to give a spark of sincerity. <br /> <br /> Moral of this story, you can create the ultimate warrior with a zombie potion and singing zombies, but you can not create the ultimate slave of love.
