A flat, simple thriller about a woman who deceives everyone who supposedly loves to increase her bank account. Nicole Kidman plays deceptive Tracey, married Andy (Bill Pullman). When an old school friend Andy named Jed Hill (Alec Baldwin) appears as a resident surgeon, the trouble is not far behind. <br /> <br /> The script fails because it does not develop a very promising assumption of an effective, tempting thriller, as well as a strong lack of character motivation, origin and development leave the whole performance to be achieved. None of the actors is able to arouse interest in their shallow characters, especially Bill Pullman, whose own inexplicably curious Andy can not be believed. <br /> <br /> Poor director Harold Becker is resurrected to resurrect the impossibly dead project and is unable to provide entertainment from any of them. Before you reveal the "secret" of the plot, you will not worry about it. <br /> <br /> At least the cinematography has a Massachusetts look. There are also George C. Scott, Peter Gallagher and Josef Sommer. <br /> <br /> Sunday, 25 February 1996 - T.V.
