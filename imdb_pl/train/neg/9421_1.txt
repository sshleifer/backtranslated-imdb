If you like to watch Mel Gibson at the Million Dollar Hotel, you can enjoy watching Burt Reynolds in another movie so bad that you will never be able to distribute it. I can only confirm the DVD version, so maybe the VHS version is of better quality, but movie nights and dark scenes were so poorly made that everything seems red. For the first time, I thought my DVD players were broken. There was no. If you insist on watching, I recommend adjusting the color on the TV until it is black and white. If not, you'll never be able to go through the movie. If you do, you'll simply remind poor film students about trying to restore the Pulp Fiction style.
