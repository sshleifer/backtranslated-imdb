Over the last weekend I had absolutely nothing to do, and with my friends I marked a movie ... every movie. And because the only movie we did not see was Inspector Gadget, we decided to do it. <br /> <br /> BIG MISTAKE. It's a movie that can appeal to children only. Oh, it's not that I do not like movies directed to younger audiences. But this movie had absolutely nothing in mind. If you have nothing to do at home, go to sleep. It's better than wasting hard earned money on it. Check the movie if you are a child or you are a parent with a child :)
