I did not like Frosty's return and this one. Both films are absurd with badly written characters and bad voices. The voices could be made, but the cold returns were the worst because they drew an unmatched snowman. Frosty's winter land was great, as was Drama's original, emotional one. The only good thing about this movie was Frosty. The snowman was similar to the classic 1960s and a funny line, like when they talked about things that are not real, and then Frosty walks by the window, humming, whistling whatever he was doing, but everything else was badly written and badly animated and I barely got it storyline. About 2-3 years ago I saw a DVD cover in the library, and the art looked bad, so I did not pick it up this year because the pictures on the reverse looked a bit touching but I was playing this movie. It was embarrassingly poor artistic characters, just like a DVD, and it was just terrible about what was going on. I watched it in the night and found it boring that I fell asleep on the whole thing (Wait, I always do it when I watch something when I go to sleep) But this movie was generally boring <br /> <br /> Overall Rating: Grade - C <br /> <br /> It's like a different holiday, special bad stripping in cold turns and this one. This is the 4th sequel, like Home alone 4, I thought the movie was OK, but the house itself was great. But it's like a bad house, 3 and 4 people themselves hate it. My sister did not watch it so much because when she came into my room to watch 2 minutes and half, she left like "I hate animation!" I agree with her, just like Frosty's third comes back. Usually terrible!
