Herbie returns, Volkswagen, who thinks like a man, currently led by Maggie Peyton (Lindsay Lohan), a young woman who hopes to become a NASCAR champion. The only thing that stands in its way is the current champion, Trip Murphy (Matt Dillon), who will do anything to stop them. <br /> <br /> The original error of love was not very good. Even as a child, I remember that I did not like him very much. However, I was hoping to continue. I mean, the cast is pretty good, and the trailer makes it look pretty cool. Unfortunately, Herbie is not better now than before. The film is provocatively weak for people over 12 years of age. Probably entertain children, but that's all. <br /> <br /> I realize that this is a movie for children and everything, but they can make the movie a bit more interesting. There was very little laughter and at the end was bored. Most of the actors also seemed dead in their roles. Lindsay Lohan was fine as Maggie Peyton. It usually gives better performances as in Freaky Friday and Mean Girls. Matt Dillon gave the best performance of all. He was very good as a bad guy, although he did not have much to do. Justin Long, Breckin Meyer and Michael Keaton are really there and they do not do anything special. <br /> <br /> Angela Robinson directs and does a good job. He tries to make the film interesting but works with a poor script. Thomas Lennon and Ben Garant wrote the screenplay and would it surprise you that they were also responsible for Taxi and The Pacifier? These two films make light films, but they do not make the stories interesting and enjoyable. It's not entirely their fault, but I hope they will try harder next time. In the end, Herbie is a safe, predictable family movie that is worth watching if you are a child. Everyone else is better to skip it. Rating 4/10
