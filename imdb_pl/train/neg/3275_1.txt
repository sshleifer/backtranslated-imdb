DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM IF YOU LOVED CLASSICS THOSE TOM WOMEN, JOHN SCHNEIDER, CATHERINE BACH, SORRELL BOOKE, JAMES BEST, DENVER PYLE, SONNY SHROYER AND BEN JONES! THIS FILM WILL BE UNKNOWN! First of all, this movie starts with the bohemian Bo and Luke for Jesse. Because Luke would never do it in a real series! This movie shows unimaginable characters doing things that would never happen in the series. In the series, Uncle Jesse was honest and law-abiding. In this movie, he is a criminal who makes moonshine and burns grass at the Governor of Georgia. Plus, if it was an extension adding to Dukes of Hazzard Reunion! and Dukes of Hazzard in Hollywood, I have one question: HOW CAN MORE DO MOWERHINE WHEN HAS BEEN DEADLY BEFORE THE HAZZARD IN Hollywood MOVIE? AND HOW GOD HOGG LIVES WHEN HE WAS SORRY BEFORE THE FILM OF REUNION IN 1997! FILM AND ROSCO RAN HAZZARD? NEEDS THAT THESE CHARACTERS HAVE RETURNED TO LIFE WHILE THEY WERE DEAD OUT FOR 11 AND 8 YEARS OLD? If Hollywood really wanted to make a good movie, they should bring James Best, John Schneider, Tom Wopat, Ben Jones and Catherine Bach, just like in 1997 and 2000, a show of what was and still is compared to this disgusting, disgraced movie! If you want to see good Dukes movies, buy the original series or go to walmart.com and buy 2 DVD sets containing Reunion and Dukes of Hazzard in Hollywood movies! They are both stars of the original cast and they are family! Do not waste time on a movie that is not worth the CD it's written on!
