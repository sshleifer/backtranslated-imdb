Oh, God, what a stupid movie! Unbelievably cheap with fake special effects (the creature plays one guy in a lame dress) and a stupid plot. All dialogues are unbelievably bad, and these actors (HA! HA! HA!) ... they are simply ridiculous. For example, I have never seen such annoying characters like this garbage (these stupid children or pregnant women with my husband and many others). All in all, it's great entertainment if you're drunk. like a plague. I'm drunk? I do not think so ...
