When a movie like "The Dukes of Hazzard" brings in over 75 million dollars, it makes an incredibly sad statement about the condition of our society. Or we are too stupid to stay away from the rubbish, or maybe I just do not realize how many people this kind of carefree garbage will please. <br /> <br /> Hollywood did not have the motivation to create good movies, because if you dump the garbage, people will see it anyway because there is nothing else on the screen. This is it. I left despite receiving a free movie. Dialogue could not be stupid. Stunts can not be more exaggerated and scandalous. Perhaps this "larger" large picture appeals to the Texans, but he did not speak to me or anyone else in the theater. None of the "big names" was in this ending career of the film, except for Burt Reynolds, who says everything you need to hear. Jessica Simpson - do not make me laugh. <br /> <br /> I would not even recommend this movie, even if you were desperate. The idea was to cheat public opinion, to earn enough money after opening, to equalize or do better than cost through marketing. They did it despite public bias. Stupidity abounds.
