This movie was very exaggerated. Many viewers who thought it was "amazing" must have been in old school movies because the entire movie is set in the past. At first, I thought that the movie just shows something from the past, so I expected that the faded dreamy light like on the characters will pass, but it just goes. Basically, it was a movie trying to connect the future with the past, and film 2 does not mix well in this film, even with special effects. You can see the blue screen that the actors were working with. There are too many movies out there that do exactly what the movie did, so there's no reason for the critics to hoot this movie, saying, "It's the biggest movie ever made." It's just crap on the stick. It also did not help that the plot was so mushy. I do not understand why Hollywood agreed to produce this film, and I do not understand how the actors / actresses in this film want to be in such a movie. It's almost as if everyone has read the script and forgot to read the small print ... "Everything will be done on the computer". It was a movie that should be in the film network, because nothing about the film was revolutionary. I am very angry with myself that I pay money to see it. Whatever you do, do not waste time and money on this film today or tomorrow.
