As often happens, films about people who hate themselves usually do not give a good drama. "Downloading Nancy" is no exception. Apparently based on a real story about a woman who was murdered at her own request by someone she meets on the Internet. <br /> <br /> The heroine is Nancy (Maria Bello), who is the wife of Albert (Rufus Sewell). Albert is a successful software developer who has developed a game of golf that his company has successfully introduced into various bars and restaurants. Unlike most people, Albert has virtually no positive attributes (except his ability to succeed in the business world). Throughout the film, Albert has a grim and grim look on his face. He has no sympathy for his wife with all her emotional problems and is resorting to condescending prostitutes. When his wife asks for sex, she punishes her by masturbating in her presence. <br /> <br /> Nancy is just as much a note as a character. Not only did she have a 15-year-old marriage without love, but when she grew up, she was sexually abused by her uncle (fortunately, there is no retrospection of this story from the movie). Her revulsion takes on the form of self-injury and results, she is forced to therapy. However, he has such a contempt for his therapist that you can not make any progress. <br /> <br /> Finally, Nancy is so depressed that she contacts Louis on the Internet. It is a type of sadomasochistic gigolo who has sex with women for money, inflicting huge amounts of pain. It turned out that Louis has two children, but he can not see them anymore (the child's mother no longer wants to have anything to do with him). <br /> <br /> Nancy's plan is to have a painful sex with Louis first and then kill him. There is a particularly unpleasant scene in which Louis has sex with Nancy while cutting her vaginal area with a piece of glass. These scenes are shown as flashbacks after Louis visits Albert, who binds him and hits the golf club. It seems that Louis has a double plan to see Albert: 1) reprove him for treating Nancy and 2) enjoy the beatings he receives. It takes some time for Louis to reveal Nancy's fate. First, he forces Albert to do him a favor to take his dog to a relative so that someone will take care of it in the future. Nancy's fate, of course, is that Louis finally ended up choking her to death (but he showed some hesitation, as he explained that she had "feelings" for her). We soon find out that Louis is imprisoned for life for the murder of Nancy. <br /> <br /> What exactly are we to take from a movie like Downloading Nancy? Should we sympathize with the victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence? Is this the main point of the movie? Is compassion for Nancy really justified? I do not think so. The creators of the film create a straw in the form of Albert - someone who is so cut off from his emotions that he is responsible for the fall of Nancy. But are people so one-dimensional in real life? I think not. They have a repulsive Louis, a man who makes a living by hurting, comes and criticizes Albert for neglecting Nancy. What's more, his expression of love for Nancy (before he kills her) is to show his "sensitive side". <br /> <br /> In the end, it does not really matter if the filmmakers have defined where their liking is different characters in the film. They are so caught up in the excitement of the audience with scenes of unjustified violence that downloading Nancy becomes nothing more than an exercise in bad taste and soft pornography.
