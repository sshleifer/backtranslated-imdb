First, let me say that it must be at the top of my list of boring movies. Nothing, and I mean nothing in this movie is even amazing. Most of them are very misleading and as you progress you just want it to end !! Some people want a movie that makes them "think" through the whole thing I'm talking about ... "More power for you" !! On the other hand, I just want to play. What brings me back to this stinking entertainment is not. This movie is stupid and a complete waste of time. It seems that the majority here also agree. Most of them did not make sense, and by the time you think you have one scene, you came up with another lame scene and ... well, I think you can see where it's going. Avoid it, this sucks .... bad !!
