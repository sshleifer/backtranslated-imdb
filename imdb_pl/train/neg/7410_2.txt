I love horror movies that bring out a real secret, like "Silent Mountain" (which turned out to be pretty good, but something was missing) and the movies that make you guess it was one of those movies. Initially, the film starts with a really good suspense and is a good starting point for a good horror scene, but then it just rolls down and from there it goes only faster and faster. At the beginning I mentioned the quiet hill, because I see here many "stolen" motifs from this movie here. In total, I would say, watch a quiet hill instead, better, it's more frightening, it has a lot more tension, and the ending is much better .. And best of all, you will not feel cheated like this .. It's just it seems to be one of those "I like this movie, so I'm doing it again in my own, really bad version" movie style .. Oh and one more thing ... Lordi ... in horror ... it's like trying to scare a kid with a care bear that "hugged me and I will love you forever" written on the stomach of it
