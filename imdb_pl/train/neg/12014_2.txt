A bit awkward spy secret with a predictable conspiracy about the dangers of the Second World War. The secret is whether Jane Graystone (Nancy Coleman) has amnesia. The best action is Raymond Massey as Dr. Ingersoll, a good doctor turned to evil. He is the head of the spy ring trying to get information from Jane's amnesia, encoded information related to allied activities. Will she say? Does she remember? Moroni Olson (as Mr. Goodwin) is convincing as partner of Massey. The role of John Garfield (as Dr. Lewis) is catastrophic. It seems that it is so badly said that casting must be counted among the worst in the history of the film. It is a pity that such a talented actor is pushed into a role that does not suit his talents. The film is worth one look, even though it is a semi-spy and half-gangster movie, and despite the parade of stereotypical characters. It's easy to forget about it, amnesia is not necessary.
