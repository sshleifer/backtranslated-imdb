Another case of a decent DVD case that reveals the quality of a video in shot-on-video mode. <br /> <br /> It was not that bad. Rochon does a good job and Shit! the cast looks good. I've never seen a lot of muscular men meet regularly. This movie really wanted to make you think that Rochon was a killer, but it was not. My biggest problem in the movie was that I did not care who the killer was until the end, and the real killer did not make sense, because it was unusual, and the filmmakers thought "ha, but do not see it coming, sucker! ". Yes, there were continuity errors (mainly in the constantly changing wardrobe of Mrs. Rochon), but in the case of indie slasher it is not that bad. At the beginning I was pretty sure that the girls just have nothing to say, but it's just a trick. Dialogue was sometimes too thoughtful and painful. <br /> <br /> I just do not have high expectations and it will not be so bad. And Lloyd Kaufman's pendant is wonderfully understated.
