Not funny - how can anyone connect with Monty Python? It's absolutely funny - no laughter. This is not funny. On top, but ugly, strange, just because of the strange good and it seems to me that these people were on something all the time. Unfortunately, something that did not make them funny. <br /> <br /> You should give some points for the effort etc. Whatever. Actually, it looks like there is a path of laughter - is it like that? Hummm .... Because there is almost no laughter, this is a questionable issue. <br /> <br /> Maybe I do it unfairly - maybe it's some exercise. An art - in this case everything goes, never mind. <br /> <br /> But these guys play with women with high voices, they raise their noses. Come on !!! Not funny. <br /> <br /> There is only one heir to Monty Python's intellectual joke, and it's Stephen Colbert and maybe Jon Stewart.
