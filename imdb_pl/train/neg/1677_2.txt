Unlike others, I refuse to call this pathetic excuse for film with the triumph of style over content (I do not want to give style to a bad name). Nevertheless, it is the most accurate description that comes to my mind. <br /> <br /> A senseless, unpleasant and ultimately senseless attack on eyes and ears, "Wonderland" leaves one wondering just why the film was made in the first place and who in their right mind cast a green light on this gloomy and tangled mess . Biography porn star John Holmes? Researching who the man was, why he went to business and how it affected him? Great. Bound to be convincing, he must be funny. Connected with enlightenment and fascination at the level of about a million levels (and I have no interest in pornography). <br /> <br /> But the misleading, violent Rashomon-style study of Holmes' murder series is over? Who cares? What are our observations? This film completely ignores the most interesting aspect of John Holmes' life - that he was a porn star! "Wonderland" may as well apply to everyone: the fact that the main character is the most famous movie star for adult men in history is almost irrelevant. <br /> <br /> To make things worse a thousand times, the picture is loaded with jerkoff tricks - annoying machine gun editing, messy Dogme-95 work, unnecessary graphics and split screen animation, etc. <br /> <br / In the absence of an attractive story and a unique main character, the director (and I use this term loosely) dumped a dozen or so techniques from other films and decided to name the resulting film mess, among them: fashionable, faded "Narc" or "Traffic" or "Minority report" "; crazy, often incomprehensible style of "Natural Born Killers" or "28 Days Later". soundtrack "Goodfellas" or "Blow; groovy, retro title of the sequence "Velvet Goldmine" or "Autofocus" or "Catch Me If You Can". The list continues uninterrupted. Pitiful. <br /> <br /> I wanted to like this movie. I had real hopes for it. "Wonderland Avenue" has existed for years; if the context of the murders was emphasized, not the murders themselves, I think it could work. If the murders (and Holmes' growing involvement in suspicious L.A. types) signaled the end of his career or the end of the 70's swing, I think the film could have been important; he could serve the purpose. How it is - irrelevant. Pointless. Who cares how many perspectives there are for a series of murders generally unknown to the public? The case is not known enough to deserve such a tedious examination. <br /> <br /> This movie should be the third act of "The John Holmes Story". this is it! Dot. And that could work. What is this? Oh, right, they did not want to tell a traditional story of rising and falling. They did not want to create "Boogie Nights" or "Goodfellas", "Star 80" or "Autofocus". They wanted their film to be different. Truth? <br /> <br /> Well, in a way, they did it. There is a big difference between these films and "Wonderland". The difference is that the films are good. <br /> <br />
