Usually, I do not have a problem with moving away from a bad movie, but it was a special case. This movie was so bad that I actually sat through the whole thing, almost praying that it would have a minute of good movie to justify an hour and a half of waste. Needless to say, I was brutally disappointed. Set in a house on the beach, where a group of friends from college celebrate holidays, this film suffers from numerous problems that make it worth not watching. First of all, there are gaping holes. Secondly, very few of the C-letters (I dare not even call them B) the actors can behave damn, so any scenes that have potential, fail miserably. Thirdly, the pace of the film is very uncertain, because most of the time makes building tension very difficult, which leads to few surprises for the audience. Fourth and most importantly, the ending is completely anti-climatic, partly because it ends (setting / who turns out to be an assassin) and partly because the dialogue is simply awful. The movie includes the only movie I ever say is the worst movie I've ever had on the stage, and I've seen a lot. <br /> <br /> So, like a bad joke, you'd be happier, never hearing, the next time someone asks you if you want to know the secret you're going to shout for, no, not really when you run in the opposite direction.
