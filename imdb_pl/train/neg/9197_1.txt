There are films that you know will be bad from the first frame. Even if you completely forgot about Ed Wood's work, look at this commentator from "Plan 9 from space" and just KNOW you will not see another film masterpiece. Just when I saw the first shot of Uwe Bolls masterpiece "House of Dead" when this guy was sitting in front of the house, starting his introduction, trying desperately to sound like he just arrived from Sin City, I knew that "m in the helluva ride. <br /> <br /> So the movie starts like this - first the main character says that everyone else will die. You know, that you wander. Then he begins to portray the rest of the characters with lines like "Karma ... thinks it's Foxy Brown" or "Alicia..myój zerwaliśmy lately ... I had to learn and had to fence." No, I'm not kidding. <br /> <br /> In any case, this group of 20-year-olds who could not get out of a wet paper bag goes to the "Rave of the century", rave is talking about a few tents, a port-a-potty and a tacky scene on a small island in the middle of the Pacific. Our gang is late for the ferry, but fortunately it will find a way to get there, because it is a fishing boat led by Kirk (Cpt Kirk? Get? Man, whoever wrote this script is a genius) and his helper, who is a bastard child Simpsons Cpt McAllister and this hacking killer who knows what you did last summer. <br /> <br /> To shorten this long story, the gang goes to the island, finds no one but damn T-shirts and then decide to escape from there. Do not wait, they are not, they are really happy and how is something free alcohol there. <br /> <br /> In this scene, the film hits the bottom and then goes on ahead of all chances. Some guys in rubber suits start running around, shouting and shooting, our gang goes to a house to meet some other gang, leave the house, meet Crypt Kirk and some police woman (who has about 500 pounds between them), and then decide to go home. Somewhere along the line they transform into S.W.A.T. team, come to the Matrix, the men in the rubber suit will start to reproduce like bacteria and start to cry, because I actually paid to see it. To add insults to injury, every few minutes there are shots from the video game on which this nonsense is based, and when they die, there is a lovely cut-over scene for several characters. <br /> <br /> I seriously hate this movie. It does not even fit into this famous category "It's so bad, it's good." It's just bad. The script is bad, the zombies are awful, there is no tension, the lines are bad, the actors are bad ... the list just goes on. <br /> <br /> You'll probably want to see this movie just because of its terrible reputation. No. There are bad movies that deserve to be watched. This is not one of them.
