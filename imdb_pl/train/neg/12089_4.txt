I borrowed the movie "The Teacher of the Piano" without knowing anything about it, except what was written in the video field. I did it with concern because the films that win awards at Cannes are usually very good or very bad. Unfortunately, this belongs to the second category. About a quarter of it, I said I was saying aloud, "This movie is boring." About halfway I said to myself, "Where have I seen this before?" After three quarters, I understood this. <br /> <br /> Despite its literary origin, this film is essentially a remake of Robert Altman much earlier (1969) and better: "This cold day in Park." Although the details are clearly different, and Altman's work was more inspired the two films are thematically identical, in this production there is nothing new, every aspect of it has been done before: a figure that gets out of control with more and more self-destructive behavior (Abel Ferrara's "Bad Lieutenant" 1992), perverse and doomed for the destruction of "love", culminating in the operatic (near) death scene ("Butterfly of David Cronenberg 1993"), extremely violent sex scenes ("Blue Velvet" by David Lynch from 1986), and so on. the fact that so many people have considered this film "shocking", "shocking", etc. This highly-derived movie seems to be created solely to make idzen feel uncomfortable, and some have succeeded, but I attribute this reaction to the lack of watching movies. See enough movies and you really see it all. And while it is true that I have seen the "R-rating" version, I doubt that additional scenes will change my general opinion of "The Piano Teacher". <br /> <br /> Technically the film is not devoid of merit. The camera is very good and the lighting is excellent. The reliable performance of Isabelle Huppert also helps you save time. This is the first of the Haneke movies I've seen, and if I saw more, I expect to have the same opinion about him as I have about Ferrara: an interesting director, but not as genius as others. Rating: 4/10.
