This (unusually) low-budget movie is compared to the great classic "Silent Night Deadly Night" because it is labeled Slasher Flick. Let me first say that I think that even "Silent Night Part 2" is better than that (that one was full of retrospection of the original for over half the movie). "Christmas Evil" tries to get psychology by introducing the main character as someone who is crazy (strong word), slowly (very slowly). He is annoyed by people who do not understand the true meaning of Christmas and can not stand the way toys are made with such a lack of quality and love. Disguised as Santa Claus, he finally manages to kill himself. Also a strong word, because only 3 people die without the real need for special effects. No tension, no emotion, no blood, no cast. With one exception: Jeffrey DeMunn is in it. He is best known for playing Tom Hanks as one of the guards in the classic "Green Mile". He still has to kick in on these days for taking on the role. He really is the only one who can really act, his supporting role is better than the main role. (which is also not so bad, but if you're in the shadow of a small supporting character, you're not great either.). And what about this strange ending? (you have to see it to believe it). "Christmas Evil" is simply boring, nothing happens, and the graphics are simply misleading. This is not a slasher. Want to see a real Christmas slasher, check out the best time: "Silent Night, Deadly Night".
