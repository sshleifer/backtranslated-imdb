Interesting to read the viewers' comments on the Omega Code ... many of the overwhelmingly positive comments have been lifted almost word by word from the TBN broadcast ... the movie looks like it was created to go directly to the video to be stocked with three - Part of a rapture series that was performed by some other religious group in the 1970s. I do not remember that? You do not remember it in a year or two. This is the first movie I've ever seen in which it was suggested that your religious duty is to go to him and buy as many tickets as possible to save souls ... very shameful ... it just shows that if you are the son of a TV-writer, you too you can play a Hollywood producer with tall women from tithing ...
