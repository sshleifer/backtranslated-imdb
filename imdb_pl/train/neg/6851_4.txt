Feh. This film began in an interesting way, but quickly went from confusion to boredom. The tangled parts occurred mainly at the beginning, where the cut scenes are so numerous that it is difficult to say what is going on for the first twenty minutes. Boring comes later, with a summer romance between two living people (outrageous). The vengeful spirit of a dead girl is actually the most alive person in the movie, which is sad. If the rest of the cast was in good shape, the movie could be better. <br /> <br /> Maybe. Because the plot is really interesting for some time, because it seems that a mad priestess, the mother of a dead sixteen-year-old girl, tries to resurrect her daughter from the dead, with a decidedly unfortunate side effect that all other dead people have returned, also take a permanent human form and most likely start killing everyone . Something like a Japanese mystic night of the type of living dead. But it does not happen. Although this hairy, unfit priest with a tiny basket tied to his head, tells daunting young people that it will happen if the priestess completes his ritual, he does so and the only deceased person who manifests himself is her daughter. Without the massive construction of the dead, without a walking army of corpses, nothing. The priest only makes the ghost of the girl return to the land of the dead, taking into account her washed away boyfriend with her boyfriend, when she crushed his spine like a fragile peanut (at that moment I was tempted to cheer for how the idiot went to kiss and caress MARTA girl, ewwww !!!. Robitussen's sapid, shapeless best friend has a long introspective shot at the end when he leaves the village for the last time and that's all. No real horror, no real terror, which the Japanese do much better than American film makers, with an emphasis on excessively tacky face makeup, without screaming mimes. I was very disappointed.
