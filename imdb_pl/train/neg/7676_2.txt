I was honestly surprised by Alone in the Dark. It was so bad that I could not believe what I saw. There are no characters, only a few stereotypes wander and die. The degree of character development gave each character a name and a profession, and that's all. There was no real story and none of the characters had any motivation. In fact, many action scenes began independently, coming from nowhere with a vibrating techno track. While watching this movie I kept asking: "Where is this happening? What's going on? "Acting was high-quality in high school, with rigid wooden delivery, as if actors were reading memory cards without understanding their lines. Their problems with delivering the lines became even more obvious thanks to the awful sound design. The ADR sounded as if it had been recorded in an open room. Actors constantly cared to hit their footsteps, looking almost robotically. So these apathetic machines pass through a series of unlikely and confusing scenarios, often even without the benefits of transition scenes. They were here, now they are there. That's what happened, now it's happening. Random scenes with a small rhyme or reason. I had a great time watching it. Certainly not worth nine bucks.
