Twice I tried to go through this movie, succeeding the first time - and it was like pulling teeth - and defeat a second time, despite a great DVD transfer. Problem? It's just too boring. <br /> <br /> If you manage to reach the dramatic scene of the courtroom that covers most of the second part of the movie, you did it, but it's difficult to get to that point. During the trial there are interesting conversations of "Abraham Lincoln" (Henry Fonda). It ends when Lincoln leaves and puts his memorial on the screen. <br /> <br /> It's a nice story, it works well and so ... but it lacks a spark in the first half and discourages the viewer from hanging out. I suspect that the real Abe Lincoln was much more interesting than the movie.
