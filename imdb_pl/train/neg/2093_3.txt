If you like syfi soap opera, this show is for you, just as I care that it does not work for me and after watching 3 episodes I just can not watch it anymore. It is boring and slow, and the show that the timeline is based on over 100,000 years ago, if you rely on the timeline of Battlestar Galactica to reach Earth, you certainly seem to have all the same things, such as sliding delivery vans Chevy 100,000-year-old streets and people watching 100,000-year-old popular LCD TVs with the brand. The same happens with the rest of the sets, as well as the series, but many of today's things can not overlook it, I think they could do a lot more work to get around these problems and yes, battlestar galactica had several same problems, but not so wrong. As the rest of the series is not as good as BSG, is this a poor pre-sequel?
