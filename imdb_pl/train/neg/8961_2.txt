This movie was another waste of time ... Why oh, why are I still hiring such nonsense? ... someone please tell me ... * sigh * Oh well. Coming back to the movie: Cube Zero is probably worth it, if you REALLY really enjoyed the first movie (just like me), and you just want to check what's happening in the last (hopefully) film scraped just to keep poor employed actors and screenwriters, it's obviously a movie for you. But if you're looking for a good movie with a good game and a fantastic story ... * a bad smile * this movie is definitely for you :-D .... OK, I'm lying ... At best this movie sucks. OK, I have to admit that some elements to him were cool ... well ... nice ... and I laughed a few times, definitely on bad things, but still I was amused. :-) But all in all, a few things that barely make the category "ok" enough to make this movie worth it at all. If you do not count "Manos - Hand of Fate" one of the top ten EVER movies!
