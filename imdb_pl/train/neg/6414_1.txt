This is the worst piece of cr4p I have ever seen in my life. It barely made sense. It was not terrifying at all (unless you scare like loud sounds and screams?) Sarah-Michelle Gellar must stop with these shttty horrors. I think everyone else in the cinema agreed with me when I was shouting "SHITE" when the loans were raised. <br /> <br /> On my list of the worst movies ever made, this is: <br /> <br /> 1. Return 2. Cabin Fever 3. Silent Hill <br /> <br /> The reason for which I created Silent Hill 3rd it is that it showed scary scenes, but the rest was absolute cr4p. The same with the fever of the cabin, it made no sense but to return to the top of the list. It's worse than the Silent Hill and Cabin Fever built together
