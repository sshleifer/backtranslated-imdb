It is a kind of film that leaves one impression. Writing a story WHAT is making movies. <br /> <br /> Incredible visual effects. Very good acting, especially from Shue. Everything is perfect ... Except ... The story is simply poor, so it all fails. <br /> <br /> Imagine if you had the power to be invisible ... What would you do? Well, our crazy scientist (played by Kevin Bacon) could not think of anything else to do, like caressing and raping women. That's all that his "genius" can come up with. Are you trying to get extra power? No. He does not even think about how to return to being visible. The guy is basically a crazy sex maniac. <br /> <br /> Add to this the laboratory atmosphere, you have all these young guys .. Spreading jokes as if they were in the bar ... If it were not all white coats and equipment you think it is a bad imitation of "shouts". Very shallow and poor personality and very little attention is given to you thinking that these guys are nothing but lambs for the Hollow Man wolf. <br /> <br /> Even in the thriller, the movie becomes short because most of the exciting "scenes are written so poorly and are full of the illogical behavior of the actors who just shout" - it's just a stupid thing to do An empty man could find me alone and kill me. <br /> <br /> If you read a real book while Scientist (Cane) follows women, there are many mental manipulations and disturbing thoughts that come into his character. In the movie Cane is just a sick guy who goes to the crowded market to rub the body with women and get off on it. Just sad.
