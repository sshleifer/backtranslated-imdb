Interestingly, 90% of the high voting reviews consist of a "* random username *" from the "United States" (no pride in the state of ??), who all speak more or less the same with exactly the same grammatical style and all with the same total lack of taste in movies. I would delve into this suspicious trend, but unfortunately, this is a movie review, not the reviews themselves. <br /> <br /> Let me start by saying that I am both a Christian and a real die-hard fan. This means that I have seen many films, from good to bad, and I can say with all my heart that Facing The Giants is not really a good movie. He has good intentions, but he does not meet many (if any) basic standards that I associate with qualitative filming. <br /> <br /> Acting: Mostly horrible, at best tasty. Hearing that most of them were apparently a volunteer, I am not surprised at all. <br /> <br /> Dialogue: Clumsy, tacky, the script comes out as a long version of some cheesy sketch which can be seen in the Sunday School or in the youth group function. Rave Review Robots revel in the lack of "senseless words", but the cold hard truth is that such words are part of the real world, and the total lack of them is tangible. Let's say that the average head coach of the team in the state championship would have much more to say than "OH NO!" When things do not go in his direction. <br /> <br /> Plot: amazingly predictable. It has been commented that this film is not a "Hollywood stereotype", and yet it is as if it was drawn directly from the film "Making a would-be sports movie for mannequins" (including a mandatory quasi-romantic subtle theme for ladies) and simply had a Christian theme a coat of paint hit him. I do not lie or brag about when I say that I had almost every important detail in both the story and the plot immediately after their creation. Only someone who has never seen a decent sports movie in his whole life would be emotionally moved by the story presented here. <br /> <br /> Direction / Editing: It was also modeled almost exactly after the general Underdog Sports Movie Template. Even so, acting aside, there were not many noticeable fools, so at least facing the Giants was technically competent. <br /> <br /> Message: Ask Jesus and fulfill all your wishes. Part of me hoped that this movie would end with the final defeat of the band to really emphasize the whole "If we lose, we praise you" because in the real world you will be disappointed at one time or another and it is good to be prepared for it. But in the world of Facing The Giants, if you fail, clearly someone either screwed up or cheats. Another interesting question is whether the Eagles will come across another team that has won religion? Will they be caught in an infinite loop of wonderful games and salvages at the last moment, or will the universe just explode? <br /> <br /> The Bottom Line: For the hardcore conservative crowd of Christian parents lamenting the evil of Hollywood, Facing The Giants will be another mediocre Christian film that will stick to the pedestal as the preferred model for modern film making. For all others, the effects will range from boredom to the burning desire to see something else. And a warning: any attempt to show this to non-Christians will not lead to conversion, but to mockery. I give this to two stars, one for one scene that did not make me roll my eyes, and the other for basic technical proficiency with a low budget.
