of course she has some talent, Maria Bello is always great. but this is just a grim waste of time, showing each character as someone to be hated and exploited so that someone can make a movie from an "interesting" story. Well, I hope they pulled it out of their systems. unfortunately, for the public, there is no insight, no sensitivity, no context, and in fact no humanity. what would be fine, except that there is no humor, no horror, no context and nothing constructive to say about the story he is trying to tell. bad things happen, you sit and watch, you do not care what so? In 99% of cases, the words "based on true history" constitute an unintentional warning to the public. it means that the director and screenwriter are lazy and fascinated by events they have heard about somewhere, so they just throw them on the screen and expect the "true" nature of the story so that the audience would feel something without the filmmakers at work. I hope they had a great time creating this movie. it stinks on the ice.
