I created my own reality, starting from the theater. My girlfriend was dragged by my girlfriend to go to this misfortune with her. We (my g-friend and I) left for about an hour. What a pseudoscience jargon of the new century. <br /> <br /> Subatomic particles are thoughts? By sticking labels to bottles of water and blessing them with Buddhist monks, they grew some beautiful crystals on them? A drop of 25% in the murder rate in DC occurred when a group of people meditated. Wow, what a rigorous research. I'm sure someone ate cheerios for four days straight at the same time. Should we say that eating cheerios resulted in a drop in the murder rate? <br /> <br /> Hogwash, hooey, bull pucky! <br /> <br /> BTW- It was financed by Ramtha's cult, whose leader was one of the "experts" interviewed by filmmakers. No hidden motives here, right?
