"Look, I know it can get sucked now, but the pain is temporary, the movie is eternal. Whatever you do now is burned on celluloid all the time and for thousands of years. " ?? Robert De Niro <br /> <br /> It was initially a film for Steven Spielberg, the director hired several screenwriters to adapt the script so that it would fit more into his motifs. So we have a dysfunctional family that is threatened by a deranged monster in the form of Robert De Niro who was recently released from prison. Like "Jurassic Park", "Poltergeist" and "War of the Worlds", dysfunctional family teams combine to defeat the beast, the beast is created by a father, a lawyer who did not defend De Niro during the trial. <br /> <br /> In the typical way for Spielberg, the father kills a monster that undermines the family and then is immediately released from sins. Like Oscar Schindler, Robin Williams, Sam Niel, Tom Cruise, and virtually every "daddy" character in the land of Spielberg, his father regains his paternal duty as a bitter-sweet code that Spielberg enjoys. <br /> <br /> But Spielberg eventually gave up the picture, and the project was directed to Martin Scorsese, who at that time tried to try his hand at a more commercial tariff. The result is probably the worst film in Scorsese's filmography and, ironically, its most instructive. <br /> <br /> The failures or unexploded artist are often very revealing, revealing the inner workings of their art. When the story does not work, the characters do not connect or the images are not searched, we stay with the type of inner core. This ?? other carcasses - that's what the director's cinema is all about. <br /> <br /> "Cape Fear" is an impersonal film, so we will not find any thematic connections with the rest of the filmography Scorsese ("You sacrifice it!" De Niiro yells, but movies about Catholic redemption are cookies. on which his filmography is based, see how Scorsese's camera desperately whips back and forth, how he's rapidly expanding the door handles and windows, trying to force tension and how his characters are loud and screaming for attention, but more importantly, look at how the film does not The showdown on the boat at the end of the film takes place on an obvious sound stage, the street parade is claustrophobic and takes place in no greater context, and the family home does not seem to exist anywhere in particular. There is simply no geographical sense on anything in the image , Scorsese is unable to film space or create any spatial environment. <br /> <br /> The reason for this is is that the Scorsese device must always be connected or closely related to its main character. For the world around the character to make sense, his camera must focus on the character. Resnais can take you to a French hotel, Welles and Hitchcock can dance down the street and the building, Cameron can give you a tour of the Titanic, Scott can recreate the whole future city, Lucas can give you an alien desert planet, and most other directors can create a sense of space thanks to textbook combinations "close up", but Scorsese can not do it. There is no poetry, there is no point in his films. Everything is about the character. You break this rope, you leave this boxing ring, this taxi, you look away from De Niro and everything breaks down. It simply can not break away from this very documentary style of photography, which in a way is a prerequisite for filming action films. <br /> <br /> Scorsese tried to solve this problem with "New York Gangs", where space and sets become the main character, but even this consciously spatial experiment is sabotaged by the magnetism of Daniel Day Lewis, the actor is inevitably attracted to the Scorsese camera as moth for a light bulb. <br /> <br /> 5/10 ?? Even as a general movie, B is an ugly, vulgar movie. Look at the dull paintings, inept tension attempts, stupid spinning special effects and hokey fistfights. Even so, we have Robert De Niro, who approaches this slack. De Niro, who gives his body to Scorsese like a tattooed Christ, gives the film the only great stage. In an improvised romantic sequence with a young Juliette Lewis, he puts a thumb in his mouth and kisses her. A kind of symbolic rape, the girl escapes, awakened and repulsed by the interest of this man. <br /> <br /> But the performance of De Niro, so wonderfully upstairs, simply can not be imitated by Scorsese. The operatic tone and baroque visuals of someone like De Palma would be needed to do this work. But Scorsese? No. <br /> <br /> It's worth watching.
