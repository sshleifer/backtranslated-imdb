This movie evokes more unintentional laughter than anything I've ever seen. Really, if you're a Tolkien fan, hire him to laugh at him. I will not be a man who breaks his faults ... I will just say that the movie (for me, anyway) has lost the main points for transforming my favorite character, Sam, into a clumsy idiot. Shame, shame ... 3/10
