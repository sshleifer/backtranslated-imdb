This movie is worth watching if you like to admire special effects. There are several interesting visual effects. <br /> <br /> Besides, typical for the nineties / aughties hollywood has a dazzling character. According to the title. <br /> <br /> It's not worth choosing a story. It's like brain surgery in a dinosaur. At the beginning, there is little there. It's nothing original and not very special. So do not get into this story. Just look at the effects. <br /> <br /> As already mentioned, at the end he shouted a little, weakening the purity of the wonderful treatment of FX invisible (and sometimes even invisible) human. However, if you ignore the "standard" pyrotechnics, this is a view to see (or not see). <br /> <br /> In summary, this is a decent FX movie, which is worth seeing for this purpose and alone.
