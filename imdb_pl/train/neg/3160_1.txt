You know you're having trouble watching a comedy when the only fun parts come from the Animal cast. It is a pity that the parrot, Cat & Dog were only in support, and not vice versa, because the people in it were very hopeless. <br /> <br /> If I were you, Paul, Eva, Lake (what name is that), Jason and Lindsay, I would forget this actor and I would do something else because you are all so funny, like watching dry paint and terrible actors to boot. <br /> <br /> The main gag in the movie is one of the screaming characters, I'm not Gay, which is funny, if you were not, you can change your mind if you had to endure these three overbearing, boring and bold words. very simple women lead in the movie. <br /> <br /> The worst movie I've seen for years, and hopefully I will never see him that bad, though I do not expect it.
