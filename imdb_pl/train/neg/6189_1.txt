I bought a DVD version of this movie on the orders of my wife who loved the version she saw on TV. But the DVD version was a disaster. The lighting was dim to nonexistent and the entire scenes were simply cut out. In one case, Adele goes to bed and immediately breaks the next scene - we enter the middle of the sentence - where is the next night. Characters like Grace Poole and Mason will never be introduced, wondering if they were dozing for a few minutes during the movie. <br /> <br /> The DVD we were watching was produced by Platinum Disc Corp for $ 6.32, it was gyp. <br /> <br /> Watch out which version of this movie you buy! We send it back.
