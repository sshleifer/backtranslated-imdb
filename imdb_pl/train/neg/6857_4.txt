This "terrifying comedy" seems very forced. Actually, the actors TRY it very hard to make a basically unpleasant script. As a result, it does not go anywhere. The idea that a woman found out she is pregnant after a quick divorce is not that funny. And then, when Cooper sneaks in with the child because he does not want to be adopted for adoption, it seems terribly preposterous and it's really hard to turn it into a comedy. It is a pity that the actors were more capable than the script, and the whole mess bored me. Given that Cooper made a lot of GOOD comedy, I recommend seeing it.
