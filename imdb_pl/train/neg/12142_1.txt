Please, for love of God, do not watch it. By saying this, I know what you think, it can not be so bad? If everyone speaks as badly as they say, I have to watch it! Do not do this! It will be like watching a terrible accident involving small children and a tanker for gasoline! You will be scarred for life ... the picture will never leave you! I could only watch it for half an hour before I became ill. Acting is the worst I have ever seen and saw Barbwire !!! If you risk tearing your eyes and renting this movie ... do not say I did not warn you! Cover and story is a trap !! Zombies? Satire? Shaun of the Dead was great! This movie must be the same .... right? NO!! Writing = targeting crap = garbage acting = no action. Are you still not convinced? Then your soul will be tormented forever !!!
