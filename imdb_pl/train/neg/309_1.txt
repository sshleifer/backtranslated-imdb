Good day. I'm Paul Raddick, a.k.a. Panic Attack WTAF, Channel 29 in Philadelphia. Let me tell you about this horrible movie about God, which fueled Adam Sandler's film career, but after a short time he was digitized. <br /> <br /> Riding overboard concerns the beginner comedian played by Sandler, who gets a job on a cruise ship and fails ... I thought so. Sandler encounters babes like History of the World Part 1 and Rebound. The babies were supposed to be engaged, but they were actually killed by Sawtooth, the worst cannibal the world had ever known. Adam Sandler did a bad job at Going Overboard, but he was better at Big Daddy, Billy Madison and the movie "50 First Dates" by Jen Leone. Man, Drew Barrymore was one hot rod. Spanglish is red, Going Overboard and not Dooley squat! The end of the file.
