So there is an old security guard and a guy who dies, and then there is KEVIN, the world's largest wuss. Kevin wants to impress his incredible, ugly and virgin girl AMY. When he returns from work to ... a random home ... finds his "friends", sexually misleading red KYLE and truly repulsive, disgusting DAPHNE. Soon Daphne, a cheerful crazy macho lunkhead NICK will join them. And there are the title creatures, terrible, small, frightened puppets that kill people, giving them the desire for the heart. Kyle's desire is to associate with a frightening, noisy woman in spandex. Nick's heart wants to throw grenades in the school canteen - I mean the nightclub. Kevin's desire is to beat the skinny bandit nunchucks. Amy's heart is to be a disgusting whore. Daphne is a disgusting whore now, so he does not want to have a heart. Along the way, a truly hideous band sings a really strange song. Hobgoblins return randomly to the place they come from and then blow up. Citizen Kane can not bring the candle to this true masterpiece of American cinema.
