Screenwriter / director Bart Sibrel based his work here on a film box, which he says has been mistakenly sent by NASA. He says he shows astronauts pretending to be a TV material from their journey to the moon using camera tricks. The astronauts were in low Earth orbit all the time, and the terrestrial editors composed this raw material in just a few seconds of the finished film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Sibrel's research is so careless that he does not realize his material "behind the scenes" comes largely from the 30-minute live stream (also on this drum), which was watched by millions and not hidden in NASA's vaults, as he suggests. And we have to wonder why Sibrel presents his conspiratorial narrative about the sound of astronauts in the recording, because listening to astronauts in his own words clearly says that astronauts tested only the camera, not fake movies. <br /> <br /> Finally, everyone can see raw material without having to buy a hacked version of Sibrel. (He's showing you more of a movie about Zapruder's murder than his "burning gun.") Sibrel thinks he's the only one who saw it. What's more, there are clips of this raw material that Sibrel did NOT use, such as those clearly showing the distant Earth dimmed by the window frames and so on, destroying his claim that the stones and foils were placed in the windows of the spacecraft to create the illusion of distant Earth . <br /> <br /> As with most films of this type, Sibrel relies on innuendo, inexperienced assumption, misleading comments and selective quoting to force the viewer to accept the application for which there is no shred of actual evidence.
