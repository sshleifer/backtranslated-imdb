I really do not understand all these positive user reviews. This movie is the worst movie I've ever seen and I'm not trying to be a pessimist. <br /> <br /> Eva Mendez is hot, but terrible in this movie. But I do not think it's her fault, but the directors. Somehow he managed to make everything look artificial; their acting, the idea, makeup, everything. <br /> <br /> The star I give is just an idea for a movie that was badly made. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this shit, look at Fellini, Woody Allen or David Lynch.
