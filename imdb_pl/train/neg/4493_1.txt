I tried to remove everything that could be considered a spoiler. I also assume you saw the first movie or at least know its general meaning, so if you did not do it, it might not make sense. <br /> <br />. Story: This movie beats the audience with the tired philosophical wandering time after time, trying to reach the subject. We are repeatedly bombarded with questions about the purpose and purpose and the choice and forced to endure long, tiring plutonium sessions that contain them. <br /> <br /> Neo, awakened from a dream in the last movie, now begins a period of awareness of his own existence. There are many revelations in this movie that I will be foggy about, so they will not look like spoilers. <br /> <br /> * If you're still worried, obscure references will break the movie, do not read the following paragraph. * <br /> <br /> The strength and weakness of faith is manifested. The strengths and weaknesses of love and its temporary nature are also revealed. It also reveals the interdependence of people and technology and our faith in technology. The meaning of choice and experience is revealed. Explaining further things that will be revealed would be too detailed, so I will refrain (as the guidelines for writing a commentary say). Btw, "I revealed" I mean sticking in our ears and eyes like nails. <br /> <br /> Story: So how do Neo and the gang go from the end of the last movie to the beginning of the next one? In short, they keep their faith and abuse and abuse excessively stylized actions and bullets, as it happens outside of style (and after this show, I hope that both film viewers and creators learn to appreciate subtlety and originality). More on this topic later. In order not to spoil anything, I will not say more than the promotional material already made: Neo is still trying to come up with the Matrix, and he is looking for answers trying to save people and Zion while the villains follow him and his cohorts. The film almost rises where the last one ended. <br /> <br /> Action: While the action of martial arts and shooting moved her predecessor in slightly equal parts, this film focuses more on martial arts than shooting, adding swords, sais etc. to the mix. Special effects are so often used and waved on the face of the audience that they become really tiring. I've discussed this movie with both friends and colleagues, and almost all of them have discovered that some action sequences - especially the "Smith fight" we've all heard about - will be too long and cumbersome. This is a huge red flag for fans of action, because the end of the action sequence should either make you want a bit more, or completely be content with the generosity that has just happened. <br /> <br /> These battle scenes do not take place. These are overly stylized sequences that are wooden and not very inspired. In the first movie there was a real sense of desperation in relation to some of the actions, the sense that the struggle is about survival, and not just looking good (which I think they do not deal with Reloaded) in black and skin. After the film, watch Drunken Master or Iron Monkey to remind yourself what are the good fight sequences - you will not regret it. In addition, people who have the skills of "Matrix" in Reloaded are not consistent, and what they actually do is not consistent. The first movie had its inconsistencies here, but they were not very glaring - unlike Reloaded. <br /> <br /> Special effects are poured and turned on and off. Every little thing that someone does is simply jumping, somersault, spin, and in many cases simply posing, are <br /> <br /> slow, scored or overly accented by some destruction. It is obvious that in Bros they had a lot of money to throw on this movie, and the boy threw him, without real restraint. Sharp's editors could really help, but the first movie was such a hit that it was obvious the free reign that leads us. . . <br /> <br /> Character and dialogue: I've said more or less that the dialogue was tired and full of philosophical clich√©s. Actors can not really bring a lot of depth to their characters when the script and direction push the viewer's face or completely neglect it. The audience never receives nuances and substances so that they can contemplate the character on their own. <br /> <br /> Keanu's acting is rigid at best. Keanu is good at behaving confused and that's all he's doing in this movie. He makes a decent attempt to show the passion between Neo and Trinity, but he falls down. <br /> <br /> Lawrence tries to make Morpheus everyone, from Moses to Henry V, and be as cool as a cat. Thanks to the script that was provided to him, he makes a noble attempt, but also fails. <br /> <br /> Moss is not very credible either. Her care is always the same, as in the case of Keanu, and chemistry is not there, although in their very physical scenes they pretend it well enough. <br /> <br /> Hugo once again made a strange feeling of being an agent program, but he also suffered from the hand of the script. Actually, I consider him to be the most interesting figure of this group, but instead of development, he makes it an excuse for a huge, stretched battle scene. <br /> <br /> In total, this movie is unsatisfactory if you had good expectations, and as a standalone movie (which is not what it should be), it's still awful. I do not consider the Matrix so deep, but at least I see it as a pleasant sci fi romp, which has some interesting ideas, a good action, a few funny lines and enough restraint and elusiveness to entertain the attentive. Reactivation is unsuccessful in all these cases and I really hope that In Bros, they will give us a better impression in the third part. That's true, I do not have much hope for it after this movie.
