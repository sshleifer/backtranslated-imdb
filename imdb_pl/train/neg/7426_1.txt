I could not believe it. I had to rub my eyes several times. Is it true? <br /> <br /> Yes, there were Billy Dee Williams, Jeff Conaway, Maxwell Caulfield and Tracy Scoggins - they all have some talent, but here they were all in something that essentially folds into a cinemax-style film set on board cosmic! <br /> <br /> Sad that "Alien Intruder" tries to be unique, with computer virus / alien demon / harpy / whatever you want to call Ariel (Scoggins) penetrate into this kind of advanced virtual technology station on board a spacecraft, in which four men can experience their fantasies because the system is watched by their captain (Williams). <br /> <br /> Interesting? Perhaps, but here everything happens as a well-completed episode of "Red Shoe Diaries". Williams out-class everything right and left, and it looks like he would rather do anything else, anywhere. Ah, things that people do for money .... <br /> <br /> The effects are quite static, maybe even less than one would expect from a cheap release. Unfortunately, even the nakedness of women is less than one would expect. SEXUAL INNUENDO is a real star here and, of course, he gets ALL the best scenes. <br /> <br /> If you like a film that is annoying and devoid of reason, check "Alien Intruder". Of course, you'll probably have to look no further than Cinemax at 2 or 3 in the morning. <br /> <br /> No stars, even for what stellar power this move can collect. <br /> <br /> Leave it lost in space.
