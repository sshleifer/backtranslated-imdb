Sunshine is a European import in Hungary in 1880-1980, an epic story of Hungarian Jews, the Sonnenschein family. This name literally translates into Sunshine. The family has modest beginnings, and then it is affluent, it becomes mobile upward, changes its name and hopes to assimilate with the Hungarian society so that future generations can develop professionally. The story is told through the eyes of the eldest son in each of three generations; Ralph Fiennes plays these three roles. For those who missed the Second World War and the Holocaust in Europe, Sonnenschein's approach to life did not work out well. <br /> <br /> Sunshine is considered an artistic success, but it is a missed opportunity. The plot, dominated by the history of the world, is predictable and transparent; this is reinforced by the narrative from the cover of the voice and the material of the newsreel. The family "conspires" from one predictable event [i.e. Habsburgs, WW-I, WW-II, fascism, communism, etc.] to the next with small continuity, depth and detail. The subject of assimilation of Jews is undefined, and important sub-topics [secret "journal and family philosophy] that could give family character and credibility are up to the end. Alternatively, the creators of the film provide generational continuity using the common themes of incest / infidelity. <br /> <br /> Ralph Fiennes presents brilliance, but his performance is far from the award-winning material. The "3 on 1" casting format is the entertainment of the viewer and gives the impression of a more cheap cinema than a good theater. Sunshine is essentially a Hungarian material from the "History Channel". The appearance and style of Winds of War has changed with Forrest Gump changed in Something About Sex. <br /> <br />
