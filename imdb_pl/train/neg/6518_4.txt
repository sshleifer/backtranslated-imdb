The film is quite funny and covers about four dates, and then becomes a gross ad for a guy whom (and even his "friends") really can not stand. This is quite an interesting concept; the film is about searching for true love in modern LA. The problem is that sometimes it seems unbelievably (and badly) written in the scenario and grossly self-promotional. It's hard to bother and be involved in any of the characters, because the screenwriter / actor is so selfish, uncomfortable, untrue and simply unacceptable. In the end, you feel sorry for his dates.
