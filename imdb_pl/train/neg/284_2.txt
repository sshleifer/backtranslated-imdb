I just today, I raised it today in a shop worth 99 cents and still think that I was cheated. "Dream to Believe" is a pretty boring and unrealistic gymnastic drama, and $ 1 is simply too bizarre. This film is probably known only from two things: 1. He has a young Keanu Reeves. And 2. The director is Paul Lynch, the man who also promoted the Promo Night. Now for the movie. <br /> <br /> It's about a girl named Robin (played by Olivia D'Abo), who is badly injured in a car accident, which also cost her father's life. So the accident makes it impossible for her to compete in gymnastics, she is often chosen during classes and eventually meets a wild kid named Tommy (played by Keanu). and a half-sister in the laundry belonging to her offensive stepfather. Eventually she was chosen to compete. <br /> <br /> In general, Keanu alone and some catchy songs from the 80s are what keeps me from giving this 1 star, and is not one of the worst films ever, but still far from good. The DVD itself does not receive any medals, because it seems to be from the old VHS, and at the end the sound will be synchronized, and when the end credits are almost finished, it disappears in black, although the sound can still be heard. It can probably be passed as a bootleg. There is no sense in DVD graphics because it has what seems to be the last pictures of Keanu and Olivia, and the background has nothing to do with the film, because it is not in the film itself, so the cover is of course photoshopped. In any case, avoid at all costs, unless you're a Keanu fanatic. I will probably not deal with this anymore. I will probably give it to The Cinema Snob, which is a great critic of YT. Hey, if any of you have some bad movies that you do not want to see anymore, feel free to donate to keep your program running.
