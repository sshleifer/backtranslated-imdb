Excellent little cruelty ... I doubt if the single shot lasted longer than reglamentary-MTV 4.4 seconds. Unhappy throwing, even worse than in the Kusminsky version (reminder: he managed to confuse Juliet Binoche and Ralph Feinnnes). But, hey, the rich got what they deserved. Dark and deliberate Heathcliff reduced to the state of a golden angel, frail and angular Catherine depicted as a chubby, humble melon, docile and weak Linton is a voyeur, and the innocent Isabel becomes the character of Sarah Michelle-Gellar from Cruel Intentions. 15-year-old Eddie Bauer and Abercrombie and Fitch donners-notice. This thing was created for you. It's an hour and a half music video in which everything is given to you; you are saved from uncomfortable necessity without even trying to understand the complexity of the characters, but even from the initial shock in their actions. The actors tried, but, as I said before, they were misunderstood. A decent photography, but the edition is at the level of the television production class in high school. I am begging you all: read even a book or a cliff; watch previous versions, even Kusminski; but stay away from numerous future replays, during which you will not get the benefit of the premiere without ads.
