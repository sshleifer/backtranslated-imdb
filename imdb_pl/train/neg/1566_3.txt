For an experienced Beatles fan, the main advantage of this film is simply to sit and choose mistakes, inaccuracies, combined events, skipped events, wildly exaggerated events, omitted people, timeline errors, quotes with errors, incorrect clothes, out of local songs and (shame of shame) incorrect instruments and other bonuses that I just can not think about. The disadvantages are fast and furious, so you have to be on your toes. <br /> <br /> I did not give this "1", mainly because it is filmed in Liverpool and the actors (Rain band) give it all (Lennon's character is credible and is doing a good job). At some point, you can also hear the song "Cry for a Shadow", which counts for SOMETHING. <br /> <br /> So ..., watch it for fun, but please do not treat it as historically accurate.
