This film is an attempt to present the theory of Jared Diamonds, "Pistols, germs and steel," explaining how Europeans dominated the majority of the world. <br /> <br /> The version I saw in this movie appeared on 2 discs covering 3 hours. I think the information could have been submitted within 20 minutes. There are completely useless scenes: Professor Jared Diamond watching birds through binoculars, Professor Jared Diamond using no bow and arrows properly, Professor Jared Diamond misbehaving from the barrel. Was this document supposed to become a hero from "Professor Jared's diamond?". This part of the document was so bad that it could be a travesty. The worst part was that during a malaria show at an African hospital, Diamond showed he was falling apart and crying. None of this helps me to understand his theory of "weapons, germs and steel." BTW "Pistols, germs and steel" is said about 100 times. "Can European weapons, germs and steel get out of this terrible situation? Stay up to date and find out! "When he finally goes to work, his theory is equally interesting and completely boring. Europeans conquered indigenous peoples of other countries because they had weapons and beautiful blades against stone and wooden weapons. Do I really need a professor to convince me of this? The parts of his theory are interesting, which explain how the Europeans have achieved the advantages of conquering, but the range is as thin as paper. <br /> <br /> In the end I think the document only tried to convince me that non-Europeans are as capable as Europeans. If I'm not a racist, I already know. If I'm a racist, Jared Diamond will not convince me with his inept use of native tools. <br /> <br /> I do not think adults are the target audience of this document. However, children can enjoy it more than me. I have read that the book from which this document is much better than the document.
