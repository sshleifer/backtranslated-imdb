What can you say about this catastrophe? I watched it because it was broadcast on the cable. I regret that I wasted my time, but at least I did not waste my money. <br /> <br /> The creature is the most cordial you can get! You must be very generous, so as not to get angry with your CHEAP costume Halloween. Well, there are also displays of horrible action, f / x and dialogues. The confrontation with the creature is unbelievable, you can not get a more pathetic scene. <br /> <br /> This is the worst you can get from movies directly to movies. "Creature Unknown" makes FULL MOON PICTURES films look like "Halloween". <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs, please. The only "positive" thing about this basket are sexy women.
