We had to go to the meeting, so we turned on the recorder to record the ending. When finished, I looked at my husband and said, "Do you have a clue?" He shook his head no. I said, "So you forced me to watch the end of this movie and I have no idea what happened." He did not "do" me, but you know. <br /> <br /> The movie itself was pretty good. There was a lot of tension. You were wondering about it. Then came the ending. The ending was ... well, it just ended. You have not been let in what happened or why. Until I thought something would happen to explain it, but it never happened. So I came here expecting someone to understand it, and I just did not pay attention to it. No. Four years later, I'm just as unaware as Tom Sawyer. <br /> <br /> I still have no idea what happened. I'm glad I did not waste any $$ to buy it, because I would definitely be crazy. <br /> <br /> OHHHHH! I understand! The end of the movie is what has disappeared! ROFL
