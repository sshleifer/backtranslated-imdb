First; is a very dilettante to try to describe the path of history only from the position of weapons, germs and steel. The same was what Marxists tried to do from economic positions. <br /> <br /> The reason for Western success can not be only silly happiness, the advantages of domesticated plants and animals. We see that all benefits and bonuses around the world are completely useless if they are not wisely managed. Japan has no huge natural resources, but Japan is one of the largest world economies, the same situation in Singapore, but in Nigeria, a country with rich oil resources, only medium and low success are achieved. Both these nations had and still have access to Western technology and inventions, but why such a gap? <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, Daimond stated that it is very important to understand the factors of weapons, germs and steel to understand. Perhaps the main factor of difference in the world is not geography, but the ability of people to understand and use things? Mental understanding. In this case, geography is only subordinated.
