It's been a long time since I saw this comedy, and I forgot how idiotic it is. I would put it easily in the bottom two or three worst movies of Elvis Presley. Presley plays Joe Whitecloud, a half-breeding Indian bull rider who returns to Arizona and the broken hut where his family lives, and where his friends love to play all night long. His parents play Burgess Meredith and Katy Jurado, and his old Indian grandfather is Thomas Gomez. None of these three offers anything significant, comical or otherwise. The government has invested in family cattle, but they are missing a bull. Elvis sings only a few completely worthless songs and is chased by a young crazy boy and her mother. This is just a real mess, and the destroyed surroundings virtually smell of manure and do not make it easier. The only thing that puzzles me is that Elvis seems to be having fun in the movie. It's hard to believe, considering he was so upset that he got stuck in so many mediocre movies.
