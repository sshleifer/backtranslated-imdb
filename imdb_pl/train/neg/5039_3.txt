Rex Reed once said about the movie ("Julia and Julia" to be specific) that it looked like he was shot by pomegranate juice. I remembered it when I was snoring by Purple Butterfly. This one seemed to be shot by gauze. <br /> <br /> The story was boring and it did not help that in the case of large parts of the scenes the faces of the actors were literally blurred or focused only after a longer period of time. <br /> <br /> They all looked the same, so it was difficult to tell the characters. I call this syndrome "Association of the Dead Poets". <br /> <br /> No one bothered, no one was interested in it dramatically, and the film did not cast historical light for a very interesting period of time and a set of circumstances. <br /> <br /> Total disappointment.
