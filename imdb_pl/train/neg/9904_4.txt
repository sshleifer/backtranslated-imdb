Film "Gung Ho!": The story of raiders from Makin Carlson's island was created in 1943 with a view to raising the morality of the American nation during the Second World War. It shows in a better way that cinema can be a propaganda body. The value of this film is just a collection and no artistic. In the propaganda film, there is no point in judging the direction and actors. Watch this video if you're interested to find out how propaganda works in movies or if you're so much fun with Robert Mitchum who has a small role in the movie. If you want to see a movie for the Second World War, there are much better and more objectively. I evaluated it 4/10.
