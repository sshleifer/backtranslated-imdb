With 2 days in the Valley, I think it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Another of the long line of Tarantino outbursts that have appeared since Pulp Fiction. The atmosphere created by the film is fun for the first five minutes, but then the creators of the film make an unforgivable mistake, allowing unnecessary and grotesque violence to the "hip" ratio. You better skip this one.
