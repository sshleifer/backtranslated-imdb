This movie fails miserably at every level. I have an idea, let's take everyone involved in this movie and send it to the hot zone in the Middle East. Maybe if we're lucky, everyone will be shot and we will never have to waste time. Did I mention that I have never been so bitter about the cinema pile of nonsense in my entire life? My God, I can not think of anything I've ever seen, it was so bad. I'd rather see Ishtar 25 times in a row than sit for 10 minutes of this apologetic excuse for the movie. If I ever meet someone who has been involved in this movie, I spit in their face and then I will beat them pointlessly. It's my two cents.
