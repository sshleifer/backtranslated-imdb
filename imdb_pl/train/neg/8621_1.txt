The previous poster, of course, was working on the film. It's a joke, how bad it is, and no one will review this kind of movie the way it did it. Listing all the names of the actors and what they were before is a sign that it is somehow related to it. > <br /> He's now at Cinemax and I was pretty sure it was a movie where porn stars (the one named Ava is great and well-equipped) were forced to do something different for some crazy tax reason. <br /> <br /> Besides, when I saw it for the first time, I was sure it was around 1986, and I was born in 1973, so I thought I knew what I was talking about ... but no ... it was done in 1993 !! Unbelievable! <br /> <br /> Though I would call it one of those so bad, it's good movies. How to watch the wreck of a train.
