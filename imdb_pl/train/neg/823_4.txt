First of all, it takes half an hour for Hackman to get out of prison and start working. What a waste of time, we all know that Hackman is doing something for his masters, why waste almost a third of the movie on these sequences. Then Hackman stays in the hotel, and the plot story is nowhere to go, just proving to us that Hackman is under close observation and everything he says or does is known to the masters. Again, another 20 minutes. Then more wasted time shows a meeting with his wife. All this should take only 10-15 minutes as a set for real actions, intrigues and twists. Before the real action started, I was so bored that I wanted the movie to end. Hackman is great as usual, as well as other actors, but this is the first size dud.
