Where do I start? In the title of this movie I expected a certain degree of authenticity, in the end I was completely disappointed. This is not the story of Lale Andersen or the song of Lili Marlene, or rather a story about Hollywood (or choose your movie making center) loosely based on characters from real life. I should have known when I heard a heavy English accent giving an intro to a film in German; Bloody red text (title, artists) should be the second clue. The plot is made up (Lale has not been cheated from Switzerland by Rolf Liebermann's parents, there is no information that Liebermann helped to smuggle Jews from Germany, the original song was registered outside the control of the NS regime without being in control, the record played at the station was picked up in Vienna, while the lieutenant was there on vacation, etc.), the costumes are bad and incorrect for the time frame (black SS uniforms used wherever from border guards to staff stands, these departed from everyday use after the start of the war, etc.), the figures are stereo (SA rascals at the club, when they were not powered at all). Do not waste time.
