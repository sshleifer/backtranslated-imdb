It is not worth the video rental nor the time nor the occasional efforts. <br /> <br /> * Makeup that a child can do. * The action has been completed ... poor director. * The edition was very uncertain ... many things did not make sense or seemed unjustified. * The sound was badly called. * Music was highly inappropriate. * Throwing was very slow ... it had to be cracked. * Zombies that speak, let alone ... drive, dance, work ... just annoy me. * And this evil ... Holy Crap! As horribly thrown as he ... he was the best-looking zombie of all. What little he says. <br /> <br /> Cover Art was good, but very deceptive ... just like the main DVD menu ... great graphics and music. <br /> <br /> DON "T BOTHER!
