I saw this movie in the theater in the original version. It was painful to see how Peter Sellers was so ashamed. The story was incredibly bad and hard to follow, and the ending was ridiculous. It was sad to see how powerful they fell. I will not say that I am a big fan of Peter Sellers, but I really liked the Pink Panther series and felt that he gave a good performance at Being There. But this film should never be done. From what I read, he continued to produce this film against the advice of people around him. Okay, but it still does not justify the studio that the movie is making.
