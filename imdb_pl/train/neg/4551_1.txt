I must admit I do not have much about the New Age mumbo jumbo. When people "exchange energy", I always wonder how much kJ is actually exchanged and how it can contribute to solving the global warming problem. When energy is "forced", I always wonder how they managed to break the laws of entropy and still do not have Nobel prizes. When people feel how well their instinct allows them to move around in the intricacies of life, I wonder how they fail to do a simple thing, like finding a railway station. <br /> <br /> But this is not the first movie with holes in the story and most of them I think are completely acceptable and entertaining. If that was the case with "The Celestine Prophecy", I would not burn this movie, but unfortunately it is not. Every actor seems bored with his head and unable to grasp what he really should do on the spot. It causes a lot of "Ah-s" and "Oh-s", as I usually do when I talk about quantum physics with someone who really knows what he's talking about and pretends to understand. <br /> <br /> The direction is also not very inspired. You can expect something more from a guy who did "what dreams might come," but hey, I suppose he got a good wage and accepted the attitude of a New York taxi driver: "It's your money, buddy ..." only the one who seems to have a good time is always a bad guy, JÃ¼rgen Prochnow. Not only does he have a job, but he is one of the few actors in this movie who can have some wise cracks on this eternal and terribly boring New Age chatter. <br /> <br /> This movie is similar to one of those dinner dates when you find out that your date is a terrible bore that does not seem to be able to shut up. At some point, it seems that words turn into small ping-pong balls that are constantly thrown in your head until it hurts. <br /> <br /> If you want to have fun and choose between this film and sticking safety pins on the eyelids, I advise: choose the latter.
