I discovered this movie on IFC and thought it would be interesting. In the case of "little" love stories, some stories have really been included in this film. The fact that none of these women has names, makes you suspect that actresses spoke about their real sex life, including Kathy Baker and Alicia Witt. I must admit that I want to see some more romantic views for the first sexual encounters again, as in "Strike! "<br /> <br /> Some people may think that reconstructions and flashbacks will improve this movie. I think that would make the situation worse. It does not have to be hardcore porn to attract my attention, but somehow I expected more.
