I would not bring a child under 8 years to see it. With puppies dangling from buildings writhing through dangerous machines and listening to Cruella's scary laughter, to name a few of these events, there is quite too much tension for a small child. <br /> <br /> The live action gives a more ominous atmosphere than the comic version and there are a lot of disturbing moments, including some guy who seems to be a transvestite, a lot of tense moments that will worry and can scare young children. <br /> <br /> I do not know what Disney people thought, but neither history nor acting was on the ordinary level. Puppies are cute But this movie is uneven at best.
