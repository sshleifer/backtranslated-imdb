Why do all Lifetime videos have such anemic titles? "An Unexpected Love" - ​​ooh, how provocative !! "I know so much" would be better. The film is nothing special. Real people do not really talk like these heroes, and the situations are really broken. A simple woman who "turns" into a lesbian seemed more butch than a lesbian. If you want to watch two hot women kissing in a very discreet way, you can enjoy it. Although it seems to have been written by someone who does not really go out into the world to observe people. Why do I waste my time writing about it?
