It's very surreal what these flies can do ... eh well ... it's a cartoon, so everything can happen in it. <br /> <br /> At the beginning I have to tell you that I love animated movies. Unfortunately, this year's repertoire is very weak. This cartoon is just a list of defects: <br /> <br /> 1) I have quoted the markup line. This suggests that this movie has great 3D effects. Well, I did not see any, or at least something special that I'd never seen before. <br /> <br /> 2) "Flies" in this movie do not look like real flies. At least they could make them black. But cyan flies, seriously? With gigantic heads and slim torsos? <br /> <br /> 3) History. I think it was written for 6-year-old children. I could say that in two sentences, it's too simplistic. <br /> <br /> 4) Excessive patriotism. For example: "After all, these are American files!" Oh give me a break.
