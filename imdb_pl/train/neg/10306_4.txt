After watching a dozen episodes, I decided to quit this program because it presents in an unrealistic way what is mathematical modeling. In the episodes in which Charlie would predict the future behavior of people using mathematical models, I thought my profession was joking. I am not a mathematician and a chemical engineer, but I work a lot with mathematical models. I will try to explain to the layman why what is shown is close to "inventing" fairy tales. <br /> <br /> First of all, choosing the right model to predict the situation is a demanding task. Charlie Eppes is shown as a genius, but even he would have to spend a lot of time searching for the right model, especially to guess what someone will do or where he will be in the near future. Units are chaotic and accidental, there is no modeling for them. Isaac Asimov even wrote about it in the 1950s. Even if there was a model for a particular type of unit, it would be a probabilistic (stechastic) model, which means that it has a good chance of making a false prediction. <br /> <br /> Second, let's assume that the correct model for someone or found the situation, model parameters must be known. These parameters are constant equations, such as gravitational acceleration (9.8 m / s2) and are often not easy to determine. Again, Charlie Eppes would have to be someone but a genius to know the right parameters for the chosen model. And after choosing the model and parameters, they would have to be tested. Strangely enough, they are not a miracle and they fit exactly into the predicted situation. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, a very important aspect of modeling is almost always neglected, not only by Numbers, but also by sci-fi films: the computational effort required to solve these models. Try to make Excel solve the complex model with many equations and variables, and one of them will perform herculean work. Even if Charlie Eppes has the right software to solve his models, he may get stuck on equipment that will be terribly slow. Even with the right combination of software / hardware, the model solution may take several days. It solves them immediately! I could use his computer in my research work, I would be very pleased. <br /> <br /> As a drama, this is not the best program. The characters are a bit stereotypical, but they are not even as funny as those of the big pickup theory. Crimes are boring, and the way Charlie Eppes solves them sometimes makes the FBI look quite incompetent. <br /> <br /> For some laymen the show can work. For others, how to handle this makes it difficult to swallow!
