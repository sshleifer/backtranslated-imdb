This kind of story has a lot of potential, but it has been massacred here. Honestly, I sensed the element of cheese at first, but I thought it would be better after a grotesque birth. Whoa, I was wrong! A mad scientist doing a monster, he wants to brag with his old buddies before he kills them, but of course they run away. After that it's really bad. I should have counted the times when the rubber mask of a shark peeked from behind the leaves, but I would most likely lose the count. <br /> <br /> Immerse yourself in a severed blood dripping down to show us how a shark finds people. I hate being a teaspoon of every aspect of horror. <br /> <br /> Oh, and after he was almost killed by a mutant shark and wanders around the jungle, there is nothing more cheerful than a middle-aged man reciting Shakespeare ... <br /> <br /> This is the one where you find cheering on the monster ... if you can stand watching this bad excuse for quick movement.
