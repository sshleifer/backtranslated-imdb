This film reminds me of "Irr√©versible (2002)", another film with works of art is a brutal and radical approach to human nature. I did not like the movie, but I can not say it's a bad movie, it's just special. I also remind you of "Camping Cosmos (1996)", where a group of low-class figures is the inhabitants of the seaside camp in Belgium. The same description of people living together against their will and the confrontation of characters who do not match each other. I also thought about the books of the French writer Emil Zola, who was a writer of the style of naturalism. I did not like the movie and I do not like people who are in it. They all seem so vulgar, without basic good taste. One can ask why they live, everyone seems to be a member of a great farce on this planet, forced to live against their will. Or you can say: hell is in this world.
