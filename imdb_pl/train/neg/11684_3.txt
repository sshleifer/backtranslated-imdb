This movie does not make any sense, there are holes big enough to be used to drive huge NYPD vehicles. Characters do not work in any reliable way. I put my comments in chat, but I save time and money, it's stupid. I can not stand when Hollywood spends millions of dollars on flash-bang equipment and uses fancy editing and cool music, and does not care about the story, which even connects to the most basic level. But it's nice to see how Denzel W. outweighs the Man who comes in three varieties, Jodi Foster, Mayor Bloomberg and Captain Von Trapp. There's even a cute little kid with a video game that's nice.
