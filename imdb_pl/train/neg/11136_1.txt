This is only the second time when I felt compelled enough to comment on the movie in imdb. For the first time it was probably the best movie I've ever seen and it was a movie for Memento. <br /> <br /> Seeing Darkwolf is on the other end of the scale compared to Memento, as in the worst movie I had, I had the misfortune to see. In addition to two scenes containing naked women in this movie, there is nothing that could pick him up from the pile of rubbish. <br /> <br /> Let's see, apalling effects, cliched scenario, bad acting and about 90 minutes also long. My wife and I laughed most of the disbelief, how bad. Amazingly, I watched it to the end, how I did it, I do not know! AVOID!!!
