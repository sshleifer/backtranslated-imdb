This film is indeed mindless for 2/3 of the journey. Unfortunately, the movie ends too "lost". Although I know that some of the story ideas are standard in the "cop cop" movies, I was attracted by characters who are greatly frustrating each other, but in the end the movie is too much based on the pursuit sequences as a sphere and lost interest. <Br /> <br /> The creators of the movie have done a great job of bringing the characters to themselves and doing their own, and we must see who they are and identify with both cops early on. We have created our own opinion, instead of being forced to induce them to watch them through constant quarrels. <br /> <br /> In the end, too much happens and considerably reduces what could have been a pleasant escapism. Here's what concerns Joe Gavilana (Harrison Ford) at the end of the movie: <br /> <br /> 1. His real estate transactions 2. His romance with the radio psyche 3. He's investigating internal affairs 4. Investigating homicides < br /> <br /> If you add Casey, you like to want to be an actor and avenge your father's death. Now some of these things meet and even merge together, but all the elements of the story meet in the midst of this false pursuit, which is so long and pathetic that I hardly have time to stop my boredom and give nonsense about it, what just happened. Impressive screening acrobatics are not able to overcome the bad shooting of movies. <br /> <br /> As if the funny pursuit sequence was not bad enough, one that has four separate sections and can last for nearly half an hour, was not bad enough, Joe Gavilan answers about his real estate transaction, chasing the perpetrator with weapons. All these extra-curricular fictional lines and jokes make it absolutely irrelevant whether a criminal is caught. At this point, we have already forgotten or no longer care about the plot of the murder, because many plot lines and sweets of the eye from chases have desensitized us beyond any understanding. <br /> <br /> While I could continue pursuing and destroying a decent story, I will not. It could have been a very nice movie of the formula, but it became far too big for his shots and became an unnecessary waste of time. Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett have actually done quite well and it is worth paying attention to the small appearance of Gladys Knight. Unfortunately, none of the actors can forget about this hopelessly wrong movie. <br /> <br /> Although it will probably be better than the likes of "The Hulk" and "Lara Croft II", which still does not make the film good. I heard once that Harrison Ford claimed he was only making movies that thought they would make money, I'm not sure if it's true or not. It is true that in order to get a great film money, you do not need a great movie or a great actor, this film also has no major roles. My advice to Harrison Ford would be: stick to Indiana Jones, because at least you can still run.
