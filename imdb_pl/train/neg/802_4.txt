Like many media experiments, this amateur effort contains seeds of very interesting social commentary. Over 5 years after its launch, the assumption has become less scandalous due to events related to software development in the real world. I believe that for this reason it seems to me less boring than the previous commentator. Hitchcock and it's a pity that the movie has not been made better, but in reality it's almost a parody of fake pulp, including a soundtrack squeaking at us when we have to pay attention. You can almost see exclamation marks and uppercase letters on the yellowed page. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I find it funny for all these reasons. Sometimes slick has less to offer and I recommend it to anyone interested in deconstruction for educational purposes. Oh yes - and although the stitches showed up and creaked, my heart rate increased, and I did not want to get up and take breaks.
