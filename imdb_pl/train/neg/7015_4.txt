"54" is a film based on the notorious "Studio 54" from the 70s - a meeting place for the social elite and partiers. In the film, Ryan Phillippe is the main character based on the actual Studio worker from 1977 to 1982. <br /> <br /> The film's problem is its splendor and style as well as the lack of content. He's trying to be really dirty and probing satire, like "Boogie Nights," but eventually he turns out to be a worse girl. Mike Myers has a thankless job of playing Steve Rubell, the owner of a cocaine club. It's just a bit of a comedic role and if it was Myers' best attempt to sneak into a drama like Lemmon and the other comedians, they did it in their own time, it's a total failure. interesting, but instead it is another stupid teenager movie that is not funny, and even remotely engaging. Look at your own risk.
