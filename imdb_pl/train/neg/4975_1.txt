After watching the production of "Beowulf & Grendel" in Canada / Iceland / Great Britain in 2004, which I thought was brilliant and stunning, I approached this - the first of the three new Beowulf movies that will appear this year - with apprehension. As soon as I heard "Viking" and saw horned helmets, I moaned. These were the migration era Swedes and Danes, not Vikings (they came later). And even the Vikings never wore horns on their helmets (the horns make it easier for your enemy to drop the helmet and then the senses). Then there is the Hrolfgar palace, which looks like a set for a film about Greece or Rome, not Denmark from the 6th century. Swords and armor look like props that remained after previous films from different historical periods. I noticed a weapon that could be used by the Crusaders in the "Kingdom of Heaven", and one character even wielded the sword of the Windlass Steelcrafts reproduction film from "Beowulf and Grendel"! In addition to the basic theme of the original epic poem, writing was bleak, and acting completely wooden and unconvincing. The biggest yuk was a crossbow with secret weapon, with the scope of observation and exploding missiles that looked like something bought from Iraqi insurgents. The monster with special effects and his mother were on steroids that Beowulf would never have taken off of his arm, just like in a poem. I thank gods for bazooka crossbows! I can go on, but I will not.
