Another British romantic comedy that the audience seems to have an appetite for. This weak effort is an unintentional parody of the genre - all the classic clich√©d scenes here are from ridiculously complicated misunderstandings to running after the departure of trains to announce their love. The heroes are one-dimensional caricatures, with the exception of Love-Hewitt, who manages to ensure the cohesion of the film. When the film progresses, it threatens to get out of control in the credibility department; our kind-hearted suspension of faith finally falls on the absurd ending. If you're looking for Bridget Jones, Notting Hill experience, you will not find it here.
