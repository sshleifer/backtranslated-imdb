I know it's a Power-Rangers trick and it's designed for 7-year-olds, but why did they really take this movie seriously? If they're going to write a plot with crayons, at least they have the decency to do it stupidly. It's funny if you watch it. We have a typical family filled with old characters (father of a war veteran who lost his wife and blames himself for LOLOL), children try to fill the stereotype, but fail with frightening acting and a ridiculously horrible helper, which does not make sense to the film, but to fill the space of the camera . Funny things! <br /> <br /> But the real big moment is coming to an end when dad from war and villain-stealer are trying to fight swords, but then they realize that none of them knows (probably because there is no room in the budget for choreographers), so they invented this type of American Gladiator to get around him in LOL. <br /> <br /> 1/10, because they try to take it seriously.
