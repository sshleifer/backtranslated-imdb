This movie was the worst movie I ever watched. I could not sit through the whole thing. I also think that the writer must have some strange fetish for pissing women who vomit and crush ... I mean what it was all about! I can not believe that it was even done and I am outraged that #ingwasted paid 4 pounds for rent. The quality of the picture and sound is terrible, the acting ... does not exist. It was a bad excuse for the film, and the pee, crap and vomit scenes resembled 1 cup of 1 girl. Urghh ....... AVOID ALL COST! The girls looked as if they were selected from the street and only got a part because they would be willing to take peaks off them ... While these girls have nice bodies, it certainly did not make up for the fact that their scream was terrible unconvincing and pain for my ears . <br /> <br /> It was like (maybe worse) than amateur school production without the right direction and hey, there is no need to set up because everything seems to rotate around the car ?! <br /> <br /> Definitely no one is buying people. I am sorry if my first comment is terribly negative, but I could not find anything positive to say and would like to think that I can save someone else to waste money just like me.
