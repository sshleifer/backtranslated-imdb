A great slass movie - it's a pity they were not producers, not part of the script. The basic summary of the plot - a man with a redhead fetish invites such women to his apartment only to fall into a bizarre coma and proceeds with them to varying degrees. Only the cutting team behind the scenes had to think that the movie was just as advertised as I was and cut out the movie. Nothing is going on, you get lost on what he is red at the time (he has not abandoned this before ??), and most of the time it looks like the camera man fainted and resumed filming when he woke up. Not that I could blame him, that I lost consciousness 2-3 times and had to rewind and resume to try to regain what exists. Warning, when you see the ending DO NOT try to combine it with anything that happens before - you just get an aneurysm. Not worth the time, effort or God. Just the reason to get 2 instead of 1 - a small chance that the burglary occurred between the release of the movie and the horrible version that I watched.
