Due to budget cuts, Ethel Janowski (again played by Priscilla Alden) is released from the psychiatric facility (even though she killed six people) and delivered to the home of Hope Bartholomew. When he gets there, he immediately turns into crazy criminal ways and kills everyone who gets between her and the food. <br /> <br /> SAINT MOLY! Is this movie suck! You know that you are in trouble when you open credits and these are only loans from the first movie, apparently filmed on the TV screen. Nick Millard (under the pseudonym Nick Phillips) decided to return to the world of Crazy Fat Ethel more than a decade later and the budget, which probably covered the cost of empty tape and rental video camera for the weekend. Let's say that Millard's unique style does not translate well into video. Seriously, I made home movies with more production value than this one. And Millard tries to pull out SILENOUS NIGHT, DEAD NIGHT 2, filling half the time with material from the first movie (which looks like it has been removed from the used copy of the VHS). Alden is good as Ethel again, but the movie is so inept that you start to feel sorry for being in this junk. I mean, at least the first movie was tried. We do not have music here, weaker effects (if at all possible), unstable camera work, horrible sound and editing, which looks like it was connected with two connected VCRs. Avoid this at all costs!
