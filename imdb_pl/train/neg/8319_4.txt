Pretty little impressive. "Returns" are quite predictable if you've seen movies in the last ten years, and a few interesting parts (in which someone uses contextual hints to make a decision) are few and they lack a punch because the "secret" has already been shown before these tips are explained. <br /> <br /> (spoilery, sorta) <br /> <br /> Acting is decent enough. The story is simply not very interesting. The whole premise "still awakened" is annulled by the astral projection (not joking). <br /> <br /> The surgical scene is initially tense, a bit uncomfortable, but then it becomes completely banal. <br /> <br /> Not terrible, but not memorable. The least interesting role of Terrence Howard so far, as far as I saw. <br /> <br /> Generally boring.
