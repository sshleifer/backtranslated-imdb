I could not refer to this movie. I could not get involved either intellectually, emotionally or aesthetically. The dialogue was very thick and uninvolved. I could not connect with anybody and care for her and I find it difficult to find a lot of positive information about it. <br /> <br /> I have read that to understand it properly, one must be familiar with some of the more obscure aspects of Catholic theology. I admit that as an atheist I probably do not know many minor details of Catholicism, but I have also seen many films about religious issues that have touched me, because their themes are still universal for the human condition and don rely on specialist knowledge or beliefs.
