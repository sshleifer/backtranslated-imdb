Words can not really describe how bad this movie is. I thought Zandalee was bad, but at least he had some cool shots and occasional good moments of chin taking here and there to stop you from nodding. It is just ridiculous! Horrible scenario, bad direction, terrible acting and you know what? I can not think of one thing that could recommend something other than the fact that it is not too long. If you want 100 minutes of entertainment, book with the dentist and work on the canal - much nicer and much better (assuming you need it!). By the way, I have to write 10 lines of text to finish this review - PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS FILM. THIS IS AWFUL!
