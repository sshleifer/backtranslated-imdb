How hard is it to write a video with Vince Vaughn, Paul Giamatti and Kevin Spacey? Apparently VERY difficult for writers here. <br /> <br /> I still have no idea how Santa is younger and looks 20 years older than Vince (who plays BIG brother). I had to miss this part of the story, but it really did not matter. Many of the scenes seemed out of place and invented; a kind of "funny imagination" of scenes that are too far away from drugs, where any sense of comedy is lost. <br /> <br /> The director / producer at the end tried "tear jerker". it was appropriate if EVERYTHING leading to this point was worth tracking. <br /> <br /> Ugh, big disappointment. I see how some people can enjoy this OK, because many people will take trash that is fed, but I strongly encourage you to wait for a DVD on it. NOT worth $ 23,978, it's necessary for your family to go to the cinema these days.
