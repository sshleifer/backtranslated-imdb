I've always thought that people are too cynical about those old Andy Hardy movies. A few of them were not bad. Contemporary film critics are not the ones who usually prefer nice ones to nasty ones, so these two films like these are rarely praised. <br /> <br /> However, I can not defend this film. You can still have an outdated dialogue, but still laugh and cry over history. Watch it, just shake your head, ask yourself, "How stupid can you get?" It's less elegant than trivial, if you know what I mean. It is so trivial that I can not understand too many people who sit for an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> Basically it's "Andy" (Mickey Rooney) who tries to get out of jam because he makes up some story about getting involved in some New York rookie, as if it was final. People were more socially aware in old times. You would hear the term "social climber" as if getting to know rich or beautiful people was the highest achievement you can make with life. This is obviously complete nonsense and it looks even more today. <br /> <br /> However, it is such an innocent and clean story and series (half a dozen of Andy Hardy's films were created), as you could find. Also, if you want to hear Judy Garland singing, this is your ticket because she sings a few songs here and she wobbles in Andy's heart. Oh, wounds, I almost write about it even when writing!
