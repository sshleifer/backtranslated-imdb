I felt obliged to watch this movie all the time, since I found it in a container for occasions and bought it for myself, but many times I approached it to turn it off and to write off the money I paid. If you're a fan of gore and sadism, this movie is OK. If the creators of this film know one thing, then the creative use of false blood and body parts causes a disgusting effect. If that does not impress you, stay away. <br /> <br /> This movie is shot in a home video camera, with school props and horrible actors. It's called from German, but even allowing it, the sound is terrible. This movie is more or less as budget as the budget, with the exception of the above-mentioned special effects. If they spent a little more money on the actors and the real scenario instead of blood and guts, the movie could be a little more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The story is about three men who land on an island inhabited by an army of sadists masked with tin. They are captured, and the rest of the movie tells about their attempt to escape. I call it a story in a looser sense, because it is really a series of scenes of torture and struggle combined by an inconsiderate, obscene dialogue. <br /> <br /> In this movie there is nothing redeeming like mindless blood. Look out for being warned.
