I can not believe that I spent an hour and a half looking at such a weak film. If there is only one movie you have to miss, this is the one. <br /> <br /> Robert is a teenager whose father died recently, so he starts meeting some local anti-social teenagers and taking drugs. All this makes it subconsciously become more aggressive and eventually the subconscious explodes ... <br /> <br /> The first thing is that I can not find any sense in this movie or a trace of great ecstasy. any single character. If the director thinks what I've seen in the last few minutes for great ecstasy, I must say that it is not even close. <br /> <br /> The use of cinematography is also not ripe. Most of the time, I did not see any facial expressions from the actors and I did not feel that body language was enough to make an impact. Perhaps the crew was so tired that she attached a camera there to cover everything in the settings. Everyone is happy except for the audience. <br /> <br /> The plot is particularly weak. There are many unrelated scenes and conversations that may be related, but they are really so random that you can never connect them all unless you're the one who wrote them. <br /> <br /> In an hour and a half you can find less than 5 minutes of real acting and all the time there are only people walking, talking and moving. So I can not really comment on acting here. <br /> <br /> A good selection of music in the last few minutes. Maybe it's the only good thing. <br /> <br /> I never gave the film 1, but this movie certainly deserves it (at least you laugh, watching Horrible movies). It is a film about when an unsuccessful attempt to show restless teenagers meets with an unusually turbulent audience. I hope you will not fall into any of the groups.
