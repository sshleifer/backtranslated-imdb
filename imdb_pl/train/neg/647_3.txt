Acting was terrifying, just like the script. It was poorly connected and made you almost want to laugh at some awesome murder scenes. The ending was even worse. Everyone is dying, but somehow the ending made everything look perfect! They did not give enough stories about the teacher's obsession, etc. The film needed more time to develop a better story. The only reason I give this 3/10 is because I feel bad about young actors. They needed better coaching. They could really create this good movie, but the script and acting have failed.
