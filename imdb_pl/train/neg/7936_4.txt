ANOTHER movie about a group of less intelligent people on a trip that set off from their original travel route for shortcuts or, in this case, to explore an attractive place on the side. The results, as expected, are not at all good, because this particular side show is home to a handful of mad, bred residents who fled from prisoners from previous years. The father, who is apparently a professional photographer, must just stop and take pictures of this place, only to find that he is still inhabited. Different family members wander to see various attractions to be scared. Thinking that they did it safely along the way, the van tire explodes (surprise!), Leaving them shelter and accommodation in a small town, which, as we find out, is inhabited only by weirdos (surprise!). <br /> <br /> This movie plays as expected, and the family is persecuted and killed by weirdos. In some families there is a bit of a fight, but these are probably the worst scenes in the film because they are badly made. There is nothing original here unless you count the completely inappropriate soundtrack played during individual scenes that completely destroy the atmosphere and mood of the film. Acting is just as bad as I've seen for some time by everyone involved (it's bad when the cast is cast by "Camp Blood." The special effects are bad, and the ending made me want to hit my TV. <br /> <br Despite everything, despite all the negatives, I liked the movie, which definitely has a "bad, good" atmosphere, I even enjoyed it when I crossed the ridiculous stereotypical plot, terrible acting and trashy special effects, although the ending made I felt cheated and angry, especially because the movie is not very good, and the ending makes the whole movie pointless. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I can name countless movies that you saw when you saw them The difference between them is better, although it is not a complete loss, this movie is pretty bad and not terrible. <br /> <br /> My class: D
