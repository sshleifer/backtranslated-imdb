What was she thinking? file: Whoopi Goldberg plays in the future a policeman who works with a talking dinosaur (!) in a criminal case involving a madman who wants to start another ice age. Simplicity on the tape is embarrassing and absurd, and the concept itself is looking for itself. Apparently, it was a love work for its scriptwriter, Jonathan Betuel (who was also one of the producers); Unfortunately, the final results are anemic, they are charitable. The mere presence of Goldberg on the screen often produces goodwill and laughter, no matter how bad the script is, but here it sinks and you can see unpleasant results. NO STARS WITH ****
