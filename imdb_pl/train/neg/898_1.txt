Eddie Murphy's Delirious is completely and completely rude, primitive, surly and rude. This is the only way to describe this horrific, kitschy piece. Eddie Murphy is looking for a shock value, and he is not laughing to try to win his next. From time to time he is funny, but mainly loses the plot with obscene language and distasteful jokes of sex. <br /> <br /> Forget it! Unless you did not like Eddie's style. I do not think I'm worried about "Eddie Murphy Raw." I prefer Eddie as part of a movie screenplay. <br /> <br /> Saturday, January 17, 1998 - Video
