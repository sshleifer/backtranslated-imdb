For the record, this movie is intriguing, but it is not original. In 1998, the film starring Talia Shire by The Landlady had almost exactly the same story, but with younger characters. <br /> <br /> The story of Amanda Lear had a bad life, offensive father, horny doctor, mental homes, etc. Finally, she is released from a happy home under the watchful eye of her perverted doctor ... who anally abuses and kills the poor guy. (Now it was original) The doctor financed her court before she killed him and buried the sucker in the yard. After moving, he falls in love with a stud named Richard, who is just married to a blues singer. If you've seen The Landlady, you know the rest, she's killing or trying to kill everyone who's between her and Richard (including roadie). <br /> <br /> Many ideas come from the previous movie, the same idiot who pushes his nose, spy on a guy with a bowl of popcorn, flying on bodypress himself. It had some original material, the bottle of beer was brutal. The highlight of the film was Amanda's beautiful breasts on the hot stage. A bit of a rip off, but not a total waste of time. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
