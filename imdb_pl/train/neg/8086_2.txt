When I heard about "Solar Crisis" for the first time, I had a lot of cast, I was wondering why I had never heard of a movie with such a large cast before. That's when I saw it. <br /> <br /> Now I know. <br /> <br /> In the case of a film that covers space, the sun, vast deserts and vast metropolises, it is a terribly tight and claustrophobic feature; it feels like everyone is close together, so the camera will not have to go back too far. <br /> <br /> And the effects, though good, are quite weak; we are talking about the imminent destruction of planet Earth, if a team of scientists and soldiers can not take a deadly solar flare. But apart from shouting, sweating and the red glow of everything, there is no real feeling of an emergency. <br /> <br /> Do not let me start about the cast. What Heston, Palance, Matheson, Boyle and others are doing In this film, without even bothering to feel that it is material, it is unthinkable. Are you wondering who they are not yet paid for living in Hollywood .... <br /> <br /> And as for the end ... Well, let's say it is tight and intriguing, but also too small late in such an effort. If he kept up the pace all the time, maybe I'd heard about "Solar Crisis" before. <br /> <br /> Two stars. Mainly for lost chances and bad professional moves. <br /> <br /> I wonder how Alan Smithee keeps his job doing such rubbish?
