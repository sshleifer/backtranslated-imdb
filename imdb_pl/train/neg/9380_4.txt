The last few weeks in the life of a dead vagabond are in retrospection. Like a tramp, the film wanders aimlessly and rather aimlessly. Mona, lazy, gloomy and addicted to drugs, the title character is not nice, and Bonnaire does not much to interest her. Although there is some pretentious dialogue trying to explain why Mona chose this miserable lifestyle, her motivations are never really clear. The episodic nature of the film, with the participation of a few random characters, becomes tiring after a while, making it seem much longer than its duration. It is also difficult to believe that an attractive young homeless woman will not attract more attention from men.
