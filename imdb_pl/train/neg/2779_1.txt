Apparently, when you offer the actor enough money, they will do anything. I'm not sure how much John Rys-Daves got, but most of the money he earned should be passed on to fans as an apology for the ROTTEN movie. The special effects were worse than the effects of B's ​​films from the 1950s, and the rest of the cast was even worse. When it comes to how bad acting works, in my opinion the second best performance. English was terribly stressed and I think that no one could even speak English, he just remembered how these words should sound instead of remembering the script and trying to make his character both "realistic" and real.
