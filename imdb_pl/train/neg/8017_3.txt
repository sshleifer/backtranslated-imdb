I have not finished the movie. You can say that in this case I have no right to review it, especially so negatively. But it is so, just because I stopped him because I could not watch anymore ... I went halfway and got there just promising myself a good thing just around the corner. This film is so tiring, so hopeless that it actually offended me. I have not read many other reviews, so I'm not sure if there are other homosexual teens who suffered because of it, but I'm homosexual and went through "similar" revelations, daydreams, problems, etc. There were maybe two moments where I really felt that this movie may go somewhere, where I felt that it might have some idea of ​​meaning or relativity, but these hopes were interrupted when the next set of stereotypical stories appeared. Just look at the quotes on the IMDb website. Unfortunately, you are not able to hear rough play, and the echoes do not fade, if you just read the quotes, because they are just too painful / funny / stupid to miss. I gave the film three stars, and all three stars go to the cinematographer who did a fantastic job, trying to transform the tired "concepts" of Archer into something that you can watch. Remember that I am praying that he will not be the one who decided to include all long shots of television close-ups ... next unnecessary stereotypes already done in films such as Gummo Korine ... I think it's very fitting that this movie premiered at Sundance (just because Archer had connections to the festival through voluntary work he did, incidentally ...) because Sundance seems to be the only festival where such a heavy drift like this is still accepted as an "arthouse". No, this is not a house of art, I'm afraid it's just a house. Do not look.
