Bollywood fans appreciate Mard Amitabha Bachan very much, but I think he is very overrated. Manmohan Desai has previously worked on films such as Suhaag, Parvarish, Amar Akbar Anthony, Naseeb, Desh Premee and Coolie, I've seen them all, I liked them, so I had very high expectations before I looked at Mard and was bitterly disappointed. My main reason to worry is that Mard feels like Amar Akbar Anthony part 2, maybe Mr. Desai ran out of ideas, he finally used this formula for years and years. 1. Above all, some cast members are repeated with the AAA, for example a police inspector who raises Amara, a Muslim who raises Akbar, Nirupa Roy and several others. 2. In AAA Nirupa Roy loses sight, in Mard loses voice 3. In AAA there is a famous song (Shirdi wale sai baba) in Mard we have Amitabh singing Maa Sherawali. Seeing AAA for over 1,000 times, I noticed it immediately. <br /> <br /> My other caveat is that some situations just seem ridiculous, the real Manmohan Desai made you leave your brain on the movies, but with Mard I thought he went too far. My last caveat is that compared to the songs from previous films by Manmohan Desai, I found the songs disappointing. I know she has a lot of fans who swear by it, but I did not like it a bit. Actually, I have to write this review because I am such a big fan and I have loved his films since I was a child.
