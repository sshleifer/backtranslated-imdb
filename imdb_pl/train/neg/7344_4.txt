This is the story of a young woman seduced and then abandoned by her older married lover after becoming pregnant; avenges against him and his whole family through black magic? which, unfortunately, does not do it alone, but has someone else for it. Good production values ​​for a horror film in Thailand. But the vague scenario never generates tension, the director approaches the material completely conventionally, and the last act loses the sympathy of the viewers for the victims, throwing logic to the winds. At some point, the character has a first-rate chance of simply shooting the dead figure, and instead rises and escapes without raising his weapon. Bad letter? you will soak in it! <br /> <br /> Some disgusting effects, including the really distasteful corpse of the late fetus and one guy dying of hundreds of live eels jumped out of his stomach. Recommended only for genre compliments who just have to see every horror produced in Asia over the last 15 years.
