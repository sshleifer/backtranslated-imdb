I can not say that Wargames: The Dead Code is the worst movie I've ever seen, because it has one or two decent moments, but I can easily say that it's the most transparent movie I've ever seen. More than once, the allotment device was presented without guessing it in advance of 10+ minutes. There was nothing subtle about the film, no intelligence behind the scenes. Every intention of spoken or typed line was so blatantly obvious that it was impossible to "enter" the movie. <br /> <br /> I found myself laughing in a frighteningly thought-out plot line, and the vague attempts to regain the audience, much more than I enjoyed the movie.
