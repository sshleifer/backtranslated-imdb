I am sick and tired of all these young children who talk about how this movie "rocked". This is pure CRAP-over-act CRAP! Do not send a killer, it's much wiser to sneak hundreds of colorful, aggressive, poisonous snakes on the plane! The only reason people like this movie because they feel they must. It's not so bad that it's good. It's so bad that I'd rather be stuck in the eye with a sharp stick and then give it up again. I really thought it would be a COMEDY AIRPLANE! Parody! Was I wrong. It's like this "It sucks, take it!" Or Samuel A. Jackson screams "Snakes on the Plane! Thing. Well, I'm sorry, I do not understand. It seems that a handful of worms have given the film industry more money to make more movies like Triple X and Die Hard. If you spend your money watching a movie in the company of the same people who bought the CD of William Hung, still live in their basements and stink plastic chairs from computer games online and looking at porn, hurry up to the theater and ask for one (because I doubt you have a girlfriend) a ticket to Snakes on a stupid Plane, to hell with films such as Full Metal Jacket, Pulp Fiction, True Romance, 12 monkeys, officials, etc. There is no irony in watching good movies The real fall of western Civilization Naming this iconic movie is an insult to true cult classics, such as Repo or even Orgazmo.
