It must be one of the worst films of the 90s. When my friends and I watched this movie (as the target audience), we just sat and watched the first half hour, when our jaws touched the floor, how bad it was. For the rest of the time everyone else in the theater just started talking to each other, leaving or generally crying out for popcorn that they actually paid the money they had earned to watch this poor excuse for the movie. It must have looked like a great idea on paper, but the film looks like no one in the film has any idea what's going on. Bloody acting costumes. I can not help feeling how embarrassing it is. Save an hour and a bit of your life .........
