This movie made me angry. I desperately wanted to strangle the "scientists" and invisible filmmakers during this process. The seat is very, very painful. Sophomoric and pretentious in the worst way. Little good information about the functions of the brain / chemistry and quantum theory has been lost in the sea of ​​new age horses. The worst perpetrators were charlatans Ramtha and Joseph Dispenza. Mr. Dispenza informs us that most people lead a life of mediocrity and clearly suggest that he lives on a higher level. Even the ideas and attitudes that I agree with are presented in such a heavy, clumsy, better, pretentious way that I felt a desire to reject them. I think it made me so angry that they took what are essentially deep aspects of the established scientific thought and entered their new age hokum. Many of them are based on errors in the application of the concept of quantum theory in the world of macros. Properly dramatized fragments from Marlee Matlin are amateur and clichéd. <br/> <br /> Instead, I refer people to the excellent scientific research of Bill Bryson: "A Brief History of Almost Everything." In real, established science there is a lot of deep reflection on life and the universe.
