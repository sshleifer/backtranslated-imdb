... or maybe it's just that bad. The plot is a cheap reworking of the first, which is strange because it has to be a prequel, not a continuation. Almost the whole movie seems like a cheap remake of the first one, with scenes imitating things that happened in the first, only much more ridiculous and unlikely. Where the first had a great cast, this one consists of actors from the B list and rejected. Acting is usually terrible. Half of the good lines in the film come directly from the first, just like almost every bigger character, including those that were not in the first movie. I realize that it was a pilot episode of the TV series, but it is not an excuse. They did not have to turn on (bad) recordings to the movie. Only one thing is marginal good, and these are erotic sequences. However, because they are not as good as those of the first, it does not raise it above 1. If you have the chance to see it for free and you are a simple guy, it may be worth checking if you want something erotic and not pornographic. If not, avoid at all costs. 1/10
