I can not believe that I looked at it more. It starts with OK. This movie pushes the limits of reality to a distance !! At least the first one was a bit realistic. He breaks the first film, and even mentions the Joshua project. Anyone who knows anything about computers will hate this movie. However, he has one good message, RETURNING TO THE BIG BROTHER !!! The film makes it seem that Big Brother is much larger than it really is. It was very annoying. Even the make-up of the actors was completely bad. Some games are quite good. Some of the acting is really bad. The script was OK at some points and completely mixed up in other parts. This movie is played for convenience every five minutes. As I said, I can not believe I was looking for more. I think I will jump into the original to get back to the ground ... P
