From time to time I can watch a good movie about bloody colors. I saw quite a few sick people. However, this is one of the few films I find grotesque in a way that was simply repulsive and repulsive. I like movies when they are funny. I like that there is a lot of creativity behind them. Gore in this movie is not creative. He's ill. This is disgusting. This is completely unpleasant. For this reason, this movie is certainly not funny. The film is a horror movie, but it lacks horror. So, the only reason for watching this movie is gore, but it's the most unpleasant and ugly aspect of the movie, and that says a lot. Acting is terrible, the plot does not make sense, and the music is really irritating and too electronic. It all took me from the movie. Almost the whole movie is one long, depressing rehearsal. There is a guy who has a strange accident in the ferry and wakes up in the hospital to discover that his skin dissolves and melts. My guess is that after that comes out and eats the human body to slow down the melting process. There is a strange story involving an old pair chased by a dog, a fragmented head floating in the stream and an ending where the man is electrocuted. There were moments in which I tried very hard to enjoy it, but the only scene in the whole movie that seemed to be even funny was the scene in which the nurse runs along the corridor in slow motion. If you like ugly, nasty and uninteresting horror movies, this one is for you.
