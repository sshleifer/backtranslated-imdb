if you did not live in the 90's or you did not listen to the rapper EVER !! This movie may be okay for you, but for every fan or single person who has ever listened to rap, this movie was boring and there was no point in the movie where I said it was interesting or I did not know about it. Another thing that eavesdropped me was that it seemed that everything he did in his life was very easy. There was no fight he would make an easy prison, selling drugs, and even rapping was not realistic. I think that if the film is released in about 15 years, maybe it will have more impact! good rap movies are bustling and flowing, becoming rich or dying, not trying notoriously
