This movie does not offer anyone anything. It fails at ANY level. Acting is a terrible, boring, long-lasting dribble. Apparently, at the end of the sex scene, they tried to be shocking, but it ended up being a parody of what the movie was striving for. Complete garbage, I can not believe what laughter it was. <br /> <br /> And I'm pretty sure that Rosario Dawson finished in this movie, because that would be her shattering indi hit, the amazing NC-17 movie. The problem is that no adult will stick to this movie, because the movie plays out like an uninteresting OC section or something directed to teenagers. Pathetic.
