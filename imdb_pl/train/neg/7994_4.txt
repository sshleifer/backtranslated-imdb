A pretty worthless TV movie that follows a murderous insect script. Ants mysteriously turn into murderous ants near the hotel. I think it comes from hotel food, because sewage from the hotel's kitchen is dripping directly into the bed of ants. There is a lack of tension in this film and it is not terrifying either. Watching a band of eager ants is not too scary. <br /> <br /> Section of Spoilers The hero's stupidity is almost unbelievable. He is told that the health inspector, that the ants can not be heroes. It must be a mysterious virus. After the inspector says that, the hero takes a bulldozer and destroys a huge colony of ants. This bothers millions of ants and imprisons people in the hotel. <br /> <br /> Finish spoilers Generally, this movie is extremely bad. I do not understand why she received a DVD when there are not so many deserving films. My only guess for the DVD release is that Suzanne Summers appears in the film. This is a film that should be avoided.
