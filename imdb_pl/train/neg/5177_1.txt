This is so bad, so bad. Acting is the biggest joke in history. Do not even try to see it, I did it after 20 minutes and it was just as disappointing as at the beginning ... I really do not understand the taste of people, I'm a fan of horror movies and I'm not picky, but I HAVE LIMITATION! Maybe it was a quarter of a star better than the beginning of The Hoast, but that's all. I recommend that you do not waste 15 minutes that you can watch. I mean, acting is better done by monkeys. And an older brother with a parenting role is simply awful. Do not pay for characters in C movies? No, I have to say it's not the first time I think the horror is bad, but it's absolutely one of my ten movies and it will be a charity place with a Vampire Portrait, A Lake Cab, Hoast!
