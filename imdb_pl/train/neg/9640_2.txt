I've always been interested in this movie because it's hard to find, so when I came across it on eBay, I spread out over $ 10 and bought it, now I understand why it's so rare! This film is so bad, so horribly written and hopelessly low that the final credits that show all the intermittent scenes in which they buried their lines are literally the climax of the film. The film is about psychology (Pettyjohn, cast for one obvious reason, about its topless scene), which uses its powers in an experimental machine to pull objects from another dimension into this reality. When he enters a box, such as an object, the army nonchalantly throws him into the open back of a truck with one soldier to guard him, and oh, what do you know? SURPRISE! The kid in the outfit of a foam rubber monster jumps out, immediately kills the soldier with a scratch on his face, and then escapes to a nearby town. But instead of deploying half the armed forces of the county to find him and protecting society, the responsible simply left it to Petti-humen and Ray to find him, but no matter this movie, he believes all his credibility LONG before. It hardly escapes voting through me just because of unintentional laughter, someone has to alert the producers of "Mystery Science Theater 3000" if they do not know it yet! 2 in 10, really, really bad!
