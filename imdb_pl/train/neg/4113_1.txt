I have to finish watching the movie when I start, no matter how bad it is. This movie was painful to sit down. "Sparkling" bullets, a reporter from the "ninja" like movements, the way bad guys shoot hundreds and hundreds of bullets and seem to hit innocent observers, the predictable outcome and all bad actions were just awful. Like a girl who finds a reporter in a friend's apartment and walks away from "what the hell are you doing (holding the stick)" to "hey, you're cute, you want @ # $%! ??? "in about 1.2 seconds ... Just bad ... Save yourself an hour and forty minutes and have fun with your kids (or dog)!
