Jennifer Cassi (Gina Philips from "Dead and Breakfast") returns to the home in which she grew up, in which she recently inherited her late sister, without the knowledge of grandmother (Fay Dunaway), who still lives in it. Jennifer decides to sell her because she needs money very much, to disappoint her grandmother. He also begins to have troublesome recurring nightmares of a mysterious raven. In this movie there was no one to talk about. Jennifer seemed cold, distant, unsentimental and narcissistic, while her grandmother seemed vicious, sad, and narcissistic. The film is good and well made, but with anyone with whom you can empathize, it was difficult to worry about what happened to them. <br /> <br /> My class: C-
