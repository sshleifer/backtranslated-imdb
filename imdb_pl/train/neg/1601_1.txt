Stereotypical sending of fast movements is unlikely. Gerrit Graham, Michael Lerner, Zane Busby, in fact the entire cast is completely wasted. A lame joke abounds, and each break line is well telegramsed. Stupid liners arrive at a fast pace, and almost everyone falls flat like a crushed grape. Music numbers only contribute to the boredom that appears, and the whole movie continues. Another negative phenomenon is the claustrophobic surroundings, completely located in the walls of an abandoned secondary school. Avoid this and look for one of the really funny "Lampoon" movies, such as "National Lampoon's Golddiggers" - MERK
