From the director of Barbet Schroder (Reversal of Fortune), I think I saw some of this in my Media Studies class and recognized the main actress, so I tried, despite critics' assessment. Essentially, cool kid Richard Haywood (Ryan Gosling from Half Nelson) and Justin Pendleton (Michael Pitt from Bully) join forces to murder a random girl to challenge her and see if she can escape without being found by the police. Murder investigation is detective from Cassie's assassination department "The Hyena" Mayweather (Sandra Bullock) with a new partner Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin), who are quite surprised by the evidence found on the scene, such as unrelated hair. The plan does not seem entirely successful, because Cassie and Sam are pretty quick to have Richard or Justin as suspects, it's just a question of whether they can push them away. They also performed Agnes Bruckner as Lisa Mills, Chris Penn as Ray Feathers, R.D. Call as captain Rod Cody and Tom Verica as Asst. D.A. Al Swanson. I now see the same concept as Rope Sir Alfred Hitchcock with murder for challenges, but this film does it in a very stupid way, and even quite good Bullock can not protect it from boring and predictable. Suitable!
