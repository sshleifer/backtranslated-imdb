Watching Tenants was an interesting experience for me. This is the first movie I've ever seen, in which I moved at high speed through some (not) shares - and normally I can see everything from filming action to indie and Serbo-Croatian, and I find it fascinating. <br /> <br /> The Tenants is frustratingly slow and too arranged. One of the main problems of the script is a small realistic character dialogue, except for sets in which characters "collide" in a very structured environment (to do this, the film had to be more conceptual, what he did not). This leads to a lack of realistic character development; everyone seems to be two-dimensional. <br /> <br /> It's worse with the character of Bill Spear, also known as Snoop Dogg. His characteristics were very uncomfortable and very unpleasant. At some point, I even stopped this movie because I was so irritated by the aggressive, brutal and monotonous delivery of the character, the lack of any other layer of personality except reaction of the reaction "on" switch (which after some time is really predictable) and I desperately wanted him to have some saving qualities. However, one of the reasons for this jar may be a vague picture of the time of the film (supposedly the '70s, it seems to be early years). If it was safer in the 1970s, its form might seem more understandable. <br /> <br /> The lighting of the film was also awkward. At all times the soundtrack tries to provide a certain granular, jazz-saturated atmosphere that just did not go away, mainly because the set was too well-lit. <br /> <br /> Tenants is an incredible movie for me. He does not represent real people or suggest any interesting ways of thinking about the writer's race, identity or life, be it white or black. <br /> <br /> Oddly, I got the impression that this project needed David Lynch; its amazing, clustophobic and obsessive appearance and impressions would raise both the actors and the script for something extraordinary.
