Look, I loved the PROPER Anchorman movie, but it was very bad. The kind of evil that makes you want you to regain this time in your life, the kind of evil that makes you think "what on earth they thought to film it first", the kind of evil that makes you want to do 50 minutes more by going into the kitchen to catch a snack during the movie, an evil that makes leprosy look funny, so bad that makes you think you want to rent a movie instead Pauly Shore ... Well, I can not explain how bad it was. <br /> <br /> Having said that ... there were some funny laughs, but they are all LESS funny than Anchorman. Sure, they tried to make it fun and fun, but the whole thread remained of Anchorman, which made him here, he was really missed for a good reason ... he was not even a good one. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor (or in the US, a favor) and do not watch this DVD ... it will destroy a good movie that is Anchorman and you do not want to do it. <br /> <br /> Okay ... that's good.
