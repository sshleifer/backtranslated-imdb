I have advice for people who made this movie, if you're going to make a movie, make sure you have f / x to create it. Also, do not let a group of actors from the list play in it. Another thing, we've almost all seen Jurassic Park, so do not do it openly. In total, this film is useless, f / x sucked, acting sucking, a non-original story. Let's talk about acting for a second, a guy from Carradine, whose career peaked in 1984, when he did "Revenge of the Nerds" (which was a really great comedy). It is not exactly from the list, it can work. He should have said "no" to this bag. He should have done what Mark Hamill did after "Return of the Jedi" and go quietly into the night. He made his mark as "Nerd" and it should be so. I understand that he has bills to pay, but that does not justify the bag. Did I name this movie yet? WELL. I just wanted to make sure. If I sound a little hostile, I'm sorry. I just wasted 2 hours of my life that I could spend doing something productive, like watching a paint peel, and feel cheated. I will close on this note. Thank you for your time.
