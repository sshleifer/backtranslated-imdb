"Sleepwalkers" is the first film for which Stephen King wrote the script. Considering this, and the excellent song of Santo & Johnny, which they used as the subject of the film, you would expect a strange and ultimately satisfying viewing experience. Unfortunately, this is not what you get. The idea was that they would probably make a good movie. The beginning is intriguing, what about its terrible atmosphere in a small town. But something strange happens about 20 minutes in the movie. The film becomes funny for no apparent reason! From then on, the whole atmosphere of "Sleepwalkers" is ruined. For those who have seen her, who can forget about good old Johnny shouting "COP KABOB !! after sticking a pencil in the ear of one cop?!? But do not get me wrong, sense of humor is not redeeming. I just rented it again to see if I could be wrong the first time, considering how original the plot sounded, but I was right. Man, what a waste. I can not believe they have the rights to this song, Santo & Johnny. I gave it to 2.
