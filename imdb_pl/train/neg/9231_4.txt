I went to this movie thinking that it would be more officials, but I left the feeling of a profession. Humor was weak and the characters were quite flat. This does not mean that everything was wrong, the idea of ​​dating site in the grocery store seemed a pretty prolific material, but the director focused on the phrase "save Mom-and-Pop store from a bad boy corporation." I felt that if he got stuck with a dating story, He would come out with a much more memorable movie, now to make movie justice, I come from the Rochester area and I loved the way he portrayed Webster.In fact, the best tribute to Kevin Smith (from Clerks) was to give props to his hometown. Webster, NY has to check What is Red Bank, NJ is for Clerks, the director wisely tossed Nick Tahou in. Trust me when it comes to things to do in Rochester, the trash plate is at the top of the list. I was lucky to see this movie at Little in Rochester, so everyone knew when they return to the city and will appreciate it.
