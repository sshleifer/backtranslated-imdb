I did not know what to expect from the movie. Well, now I know. It was a really awful movie. The script, direction and acting were just as bad. The story was stupid and stupid. The director could create an intelligent and thought-provoking movie, but he did not. I saw myself in the last half of the movie because it was so bad. Where has the film been focused? Where was there something in this movie? Christians should boycott this film instead of promoting it. It was done poorly and I lost money. Do not watch this movie.
