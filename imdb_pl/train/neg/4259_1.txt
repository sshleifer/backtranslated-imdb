I did not know anything about this film before I found out that a friend who had heard it was "a relentless epic battle scene from beginning to end". It could not have been further from the truth. It was one of the most boring, ill-written, amateurishly directed, frighteningly acting movies that I unfortunately fell into. I would rate him there with a movie that I consider to be the worst movie of all time ... Battlefield Earth. Basically, there is no history, it's hard to believe that the creators of this movie thought that this poor crap with a soap series would be taken seriously as a factual fact. It also contains one of the worst dialogues I've ever heard ... like this little gem ... The guy tells the girl "You smell like the moon." The girl answers: "How does the moon smell?" ABOUT MY GOD! You're probably kidding! The scene in which the guy was drawn and quartered laughed at the audience because it looked so funny cheaply, and the fax sound of a torn guy reminded me of someone who gave a fart from mouth. If you play in a nearby theater, avoid it at all costs. This movie is so bad that I decided about 45 minutes that I had to make up for the dream ... and I did. Horrible.
