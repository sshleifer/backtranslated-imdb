After reading the next review, I thought that this movie would be really good. I like "B" movies, but you can not even consider it as such. Photography is probably the only half-decent movie. But the edition left a lot to be desired. It was very rough and staccato. Whoever chose music and sound did a terrible job. The music was terrible, especially anything atmospheric or scenic. If the game was better, they could turn off the movie. Unfortunately, I've seen better performance in porn movies. If you want to see a movie about "B" vampires, check "Ties of Blood". You will be much more entertaining.
