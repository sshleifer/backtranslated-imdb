I saw it on DVD (in this format it's known as CORRUPT), and the blurb on the casing really scared the way Harvey Keitel Frank's figure was similar to the one BAD LIEUTENANT played. "The cover did not mention that it is an old Italian film. How old is Theo? Well, when a character plays music, does not put on a CD player, pulls out a large plastic trimming, puts it on a revolving board, where the kind of mechanical arm touches the pancake, which makes the music heard. Do you see my point of view that this is an old movie? The DVD case did not give any indication that it was a movie made 20 years ago. It is also a film about weak production values, like many other Italian films pretending to be American. With the exception of Keitel, the cast is horrible, although Johnny Rotten's performance is bizarre, not scary, the pictures are static with picture and sound quality, which gives the impression that I was watching a pirate copy of the fourth generation (I do not know if it comes down to a suspect DVD or if it's a very bad printout of the movie, and the worst is the result of Ennio Morricone, you can not believe that the man who made the annoying incidental music for CORRUPT is the same that did the music for those westerns Clint Eastwood. <br /> < br /> It's a pity, because CORRUPT has its moments, it is not the best psychological thriller ever invented, but I was interested and as always Keitel is having a good time as a brutal policeman, it's a pity the rest of the movie did not match his high standards
