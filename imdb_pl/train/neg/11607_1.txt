I found Horrorvision almost impossible to watch. While only 70 minutes took, I kept pushing the fast forward button. Acting was "if I'm screaming and I'm saying *** I'm a lot intense" at school. And history was, at best, a scenario that has not yet been developed. <br /> <br /> Although I never go to Full Moon for making great movies, I've never seen them produce such a sinister piece of garbage like this.
