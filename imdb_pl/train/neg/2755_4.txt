It is the saddest collection of stereotypes, connected in a straight line with no visible plot or any decent way of acting that I have seen for a long time. Canibalising scenes from Star Wars, Reign of Fire, Godzilla, Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, went to war with the spectator's intelligence. Was this movie good? It was not a movie at all! <br /> <br /> Even if it is not as low as to be funny and achieve the iconic status of a comedy, the movie offers some laughter. The trick is to place the copied scenes in the context of their original films. Gandalf can be a funny talking Korean, snake basilisk funny if you compare him to a cat, and an evil villain can make a lot of fun switching between Sauron and Jaja-bing, or whatever his name is. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: every pleasure derived from this film is entirely dependent on the state of intoxication and imagination of the audience, not the director / writer. Shame on you, Shim!
