I judge this movie with three skulls, because the girls knew how to scream, it could be a better movie, if the actors were better, the twins were fine, I believed they were bad, but the oldest and youngest brother, they Suck really bad, it looked like that they read the scripts, and they did not work ... spoiler: if they are vampires, why do they freeze blood? Vampires can not drink frozen blood, the sister in the movie says we drink her when she's alive ... but then, when they move to another house, they get cold, they're frozen blood. end of spoilera <br /> <br /> it was a huge waste of time, and it made me angry, because I read all the reviews of how this movie was great, how many prizes won this movie, and this movie was f * *** ing s ** t !!!!
