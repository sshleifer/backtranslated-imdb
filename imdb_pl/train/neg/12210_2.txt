This movie is a joke and must be one of the worst films Stallone ever did. This is a typical movie from the 80s, in which one man himself destroys the entire army. "First Blood Pt. 2 "is very similar to Schwarzenegger's" Commando ", but you have Arnold killing a terrorist, while here you have a specific nation shown as bad guys. This film is a typical American anti-Soviet propaganda. It is true that it was the height of the Cold War, but I have enough that communists or Nazis are always portrayed as enemies. There are so many American movies that have one thing in common. Why is not there a movie that shows Americans as an enemy? Who will believe that a lonely soldier will destroy an entire army? Do you really think that such a thing would really happen? It seems that the average brain-washed American viewer would certainly do it.
