"Little Man", currently on DVD, is a Wayans Brothers flop. This is a story about a smaller criminal played by Marlon Wayans, who hides a diamond in a handbag after the attack. He and his partner Tracy Morgan are cooking a brilliant plan to dress up Marlon as a child and put him in your house. Then it goes through all kinds of "Home Alone" or "Child's Play", such as chaos, to recover a jewel and be treated like a child. I was surprised at how low the humor was in this movie. Jokes have been done in other places so many times that they are not cute or funny. I almost think that the film could have been more fun if they did not use CGI and used a small actor whose face Marlon had pasted. While watching the removed scenes (without CGI) this actor was funny as in Mini-me, but they chose a different route. Several episodes and Tracy Morgan are making funny scenes ... Spend your rental fee on Borat if you want some real laughs these days.
