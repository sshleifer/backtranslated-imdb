I watched this movie in DVD format. My copy might have been compromised, but I was disappointed with the lack of a DVD menu screen. I will say that my initial reason for watching this movie was Claire Forlani. While playing, I feel that it did not meet my expectations, which I have found so far in her other films. I was just as happy to see Arkin have a humorous performance. The other two actors, with whom I was not very familiar, so I can not compare their performances, but they were also quite happy. In my opinion, acting is the only endearing quality of this film. The plot, while some could say a bit compelling, had no direction. I believe that the main problem stems from the scenario, not from the direction of this film. If you like any of these actors, I recommend this movie, but leave it alone.
