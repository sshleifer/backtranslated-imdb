Oh, what did Sam Mraovich think? What was someone who was involved in "movie" thinking? Mraovich is the boss of almost everything from "Ben and Arthur": director, writer, producer (also an EXECUTIVE producer!), Dude, the leading star - name it, he did it. And he (Mraovich) sucks more than anyone has ever involved in any film production department. <br /> <br /> So what's wrong with this movie? Everything. The film is about two gay lovers: Benie (Jamie Brett Gabel) and Arturze (Mraovich- * moan *). Ben and Arthur want to get married in a world where everyone basically hates gays. To make matters worse, Ben's "married wife" (not fully divorced), Tammy (Julie Belknap) is furious that Ben left her for another man and demands that Ben come back together (saying he could be gay too!) and Arthur's devoted Christian, overly hypocritical, as delicious as Tammy's brother, Wiktor, is infernally inclined to let Arthur turn straight and then try to kill him after he is thrown out of the church. /> The movie is absolutely blockbuster with many fools (eg Ben and Arthur fly to Vermont to get married - they go to Alaska Airlines, and Vermont has palm trees, they return with FedEx freight plane - I hope they were comfortable in a wooden box, plus much, much more) and plot a hole to start (Victor calls Arthur kill "The Final Plan", which later turns into "The Final Deed"; Arthur and the private (intern) detective run the same car, blah, blah, blah) . All "actors" are very bad and are on the right track; the script is ridiculously horrible (one of such examples is "I do not make sense, you do not make sense!) I make sense, that makes sense!"), and "film" is much more bad, do not write them all down. <br /> <br /> However, the most ridiculous but incredible thing about "Ben and Arthur" is that Sam Mraovich thinks he created something that is really fantastic (see his fake reviews for "Ben & Arthur" and obvious comments from him on YouTube.). Mraovich is narcissism, and his arrogance blinds him, seeing how terrible his name is. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, forget about every bad movie that you think is the worst movie in history - Ben and Arthur "knock them down, even Paris Hilton movies look like" The Dark Knight "in comparison with the monstrosity known as "Ben and Arthur".
