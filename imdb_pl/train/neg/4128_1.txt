This movie is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. Dialogue is not only horrible, it never ends. You think it ends, but it is not. How long does it last, 140, 160 minutes? I do not even know. I know I never watch it again. It's as if someone took a romantic comedy, took out a comedy, and then decided to minimize the romance, leaving us with a pile of nonsense that managed to reach the screen. But do not take my word for it, see how awful this movie is.
