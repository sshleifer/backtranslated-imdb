Jude Law gives everything in this beautifully filmed vampire movie that offers little more value. Completely missing in eroticism, excitement or carrying ladies with attractiveness. One decent fight, a few moments of gentle tension. A one-story plot. <br /> <br /> The film becomes a philosophy in the series of conversations between Lava and a stubborn detective from the homicide department. But despite their best efforts, both actors are put on the cross of the banality of the film. <br /> <br /> With the smaller actor in the lead role - and without the benefits of Oliver Curtis' photos - Crocodiles blend in to the sea of ​​low-budget fast vampires.
