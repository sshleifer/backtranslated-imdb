Hee hee hee. This movie is so bad that it does not even try to hide the fact that it sucks. I remember the day when I saw it for the first time at MST. The sun was shining, it looked like a good day. then I saw this product of Rick Sloane, which consisted of terrible plush dolls wreaking havoc in the nonsense of the 80's. Kevin, extremely fastidious, tries to impress his girlfriend, manages the assistant of the bodyguard, fights with raking and many more things in this very poorly made series of photos. You do not need a story or a story. Of course, no action is necessary because the film proves. The guy from the army and his maddened sex girl will make you want to jump off the cliff, and a fucking friend who gets his sex with the phone, will make you say, "He has some nice red shorts." Besides, I really hated the old security guard and regretted that he had no accident in a supermarket trolley. When you think it's over, wait for the Club Scum scene. Ask for Road Rash. <br /> <br /> I advise that after watching this movie it would be a good month to regain your senses and common sense. And if you see Rick Sloane, give him a good kick in the groin to show how much we appreciate this moron called Hobgoblins.
