I saw this movie for the first time when I was about 10 years old. My mother bought her at our local Kmart because she was selling for $ 5 on VHS. She thought it would be a nice Christmas movie for me and my brothers. This movie, however, frightened me. Perhaps you are asking yourself, how can a movie about Nicholas scare anyone? The plot of the film revolves around Satan, who sends his minions, Pitch, to the ground, trying to kill Santa Claus and destroy Christmas. That's right, Satan sends a demon out of hell to kill Nicholas. Pitch persecutes Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, trying to trap him when the sun rises on Christmas, because if Santa does not return to his home in space, he turns into powder. Do not get me wrong, the movie is fun and quite funny, but the image of demons and devils dancing in the depths of hell (which appears at the beginning of the movie) is simply frightening.
