"Wild tigers that I know." Of course, this will only be visible in large cities. This is one of those artistic films that makes no sense about it except the director! I hate those! And all these o-so-alternative / artistic people are trying to find "metaphors" in EVIDENT horses. <br /> <br /> There was no story, no history, no morality, no chronology and nothing funny or even touching. For me, it was a series of scenes that had nothing to do with each other, and all were intended for a "show" to show how "artsy" and "visual" can get. It was ATTEMPT on EVERY other film for teenagers, but we missed a mark on every possible level. Then he throws credits! I waited for him to do SENSE! I waited for the "good part". I have about 60 independent films in my DVD collection, many of which could be called "house of art" films. It will NOT be among them. You will be very angry with yourself for paying for watching this movie, much less for buying it on DVD.
