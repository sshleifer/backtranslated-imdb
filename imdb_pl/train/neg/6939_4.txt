R Balki tries to tell a story that Ram Gopal Verma told Nishabd earlier in a sensual way. This time mixed with mature moods. <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan is a chef and owner of Indian cuisine in London. He is very dominant and arrogant and he respects his work just like any other work. According to him Cooking is art. He is still unable to properly prepare Hyderabadi Biryani. <br /> <br /> Enter Tabu, who sends her the right Hyderabadi Biryani made by her and soon begins to meet and finally falls in love? Amitabh is 65 years old, and Tabu 35. No problem! But one catch! Father Tabu Paresh Rawal !! Couples decide to meet with their father to approve their marriage. But Amitabh realizes that Tabu's father is much younger to him. And complications begin? Smart performance all three actors are brilliant. The screenplay of the film is very tight and interesting. The film's dialogues are catchy. But somewhere you feel that your stomach is not properly filled. Comedy is sometimes not properly understood. In some parts the film also tries to last a long time. <br /> <br /> Music does not sing anything except the title track. The camera operation is good. Director R Balka could have used this scenario much better. But in the second half he looks confused. The father's Satyagrah scene looked annoying. But the lines spoken by Amitabh Bachchan in this scene are worth recommending. <br /> <br /> In total, Cheeni Kum had to have more sugar!
