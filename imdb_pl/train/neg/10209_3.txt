I was pleasantly surprised by the performance of Sandra Bullock in Miss Congeniality, so I decided to give Murder By Numbers a shot. Despite a decent role in sparse, idle roles, Mrs Bullock's performances in "serious" roles (see "Floating Hopes", "Speed ​​2, 28 days") leave much to be desired. Her character is at the same time omniscient, confused and sexually unfit (the sub-story of Sandra's past turns out to be an unnecessary filler, which to a small extent develops her already shallow form). Two teenage boys gave decent performances, although their forensic expertises and the attitude of "catch me if they can" is questioned by stupid mistakes that shout "We did it!". Chris Penn, being an obviously suspect, is wasted here, as well as partner Ben Chaplin and his heroine interested in love. <br /> <br /> *** Spoilers in advance *** On average acting aside, the biggest disadvantages can be derived from the TV story of the week in which you have never fully embraced the motives of murder, and as mentioned, stupid mistakes (vomiting rare food at the crime scene, everything too comfortable and framing about a school janitor, two boys meeting in public, a convenient interest in love, to cause friction etc. etc.) make the view from intrigue boring and disappointing murderers. The ending was strictly "By the Numbers" and was probably the most disappointing aspect of the movie. Using now the tactics of almost showing the climactic scene at the beginning of the movie, and then filling the audience in how we arrived at that moment, the last scenes are not surprising anyone and there was no so-called film intelligence. come to a conclusion. A somewhat promising concept, but poorly made and poor in almost every way. * except ****.
