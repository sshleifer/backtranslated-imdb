Unfortunately for me, the first Busby Berkeley movie I've ever seen is "42. street". I expected then that all his things would be so good. I learned that this was not always the case, even here, with my favorite actor from the Classic Age, James Cagney. <br /> <br /> Oh, the music numbers at the end are as spectacular as ever, but the story is like many others and quite tiring. They seem to always engage the screaming, unlucky producers of the show. In this movie, Cagney is screaming so often that after a while he gives me a headache and his character wears skinny ... fast! <br /> <br /> Even the songs here are everywhere close to "Class 42nd Street", songs that can be awakened over the years and years - decades, I should say. The songs in this film are not unforgettable. No, that's one of the few early Cagney movies - and Berkeley movies - I do not like me completely and I was very disappointed to watch.
