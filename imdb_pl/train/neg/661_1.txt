Fine. I just returned. Before I start my review, let me tell you one thing: I wanted to like this movie. I know that in the past I was negative, but I was hoping that I would be surprised and I would really like this film. I did not do that. <br /> <br /> It's not just that every stereotype of a terrifying imagination is in it. And not just the fact that they make every little thing scared (entering a baseball bat left on the floor? Are you kidding me?). It was not terrible. One thing surprised me: there was more blood than I thought it would be ... which does not say much. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with Donna's falling into the house of Lisa's mother. She comes ... goes upstairs. The camera moves to the dead father on the couch. Horrible. He goes upstairs, where the mentioned scene with a baseball bat happens. He finds his brother on the bed, apparently dead (how could she say, he did not have a place with blood). The killer comes in, Donna hides under the bed, mom dies. He runs outside shouting for help. Killer behind her: "I did it for us". Break for a therapeutic session. It confused many people - everyone asked if her family had actually died, or imagined it - and remembers how the nightmares began to come back. A dialog with the filler follows. <br /> <br /> They quickly came to the chase. Several scenes in the living room go to the hotel. Of course, the killer is already there (for some reason he escaped 3 days ago, but the police / family were not informed until he was there). More fillers appear. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to talk about what's going on in the movie because I do not want to mess it up too much. If you want to know who is dying, Horror_Fan has already written about it. But about death: they were not that exciting. The people in the theater actually laughed loudly (an experience I had never had before in horror, even in "Call Strangers") during a few of them. One in particular: a bus boy who gives me the funniest "terrified" face I have ever seen. The only death associated with any blood was Lisa and it was quite rare. Her throat is cut open, blood (if you can even call it that - practically black) splatters herself on the curtain. The only other blood was on Claire when we see her body. Apparently, Fenton decided to stab her a few times after he strangled her to death. Oh Okey? The film was one of the most stereotypical ones I've ever seen. Let's see here ... obligatory close-mirror-curtain-BOOM! stage. Check. Twice, actually (it can be said that they fought). Compulsory protection against murder. Check. There is also a stage with a lamp base, but you've all seen it. Oh, you say you want to scare flying birds? Well, you have it! (Yes, they managed to turn on one of them here). And of course the scene in which we have security, everything at the exit, but he is still running away. Should I keep going? I could. <br /> <br /> For anyone who says that the characters were not stupid, are you kidding yourself? "Oh, even if a powerful alarm sounds, literally saying, I ASK FOR BUILDING A BUILDING, and 3 of my friends are missing, I will go upstairs to get to work." These characters were one of the most flawed and stupid characters in history. The only nice character - Lisa - made one of the stupidest moves in the film. "Oh, I just realized that there is a psycho-teacher here! I have to leave my strong boy behind me so he can run away to warn her! Oh, shoot, the elevator is slow? I'm guessing I'll take the stairs and run to the construction site! "Ugh. At the end of the film, everyone deserved to die. The only death that any remorse felt was Donna's boyfriend (I do not even remember his name - is it bad?), And by that time the audience was completely exhausted from this frightening, stereotypical film. <br /> <br /> There were SOME positives - the acting was decent in the majority and it was well done. But that's it. <br /> <br /> I would give him 1/5, and this is generous. Only for laughter (and believe me, the audience had a few) and Brittany Snow. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the reaction was bad. Very bad. People booed after the movie ended, and then the buzz was very negative. Expect bad legs for this.
