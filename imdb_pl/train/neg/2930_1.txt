I like British humor, I believe it is one of the best in the world. I like almost every British sitcom (okay ... maybe not Monthy Python, some jokes were great, but some of them I did not understand.) But this League of Men is just something good that you get sick. This program was somehow good; it helped me lose weight because watching this piece of rubbish makes me feel like I'm not hungry anymore. This is a really disgusting, sick and not even funny television program, and I wonder who really laughs about it. I watched it for about 10 minutes and turned it off. It was so disgusting, watching men dressed in a woman with yellow teeth and peeing on a car ... I mean ... what's so funny about it? It makes me want to vomit. Without humor, just disturbing images and cheap laughter in the toilet ... I do not know ... if you like these things ... go ahead ... look ... but honestly, people watch and enjoy it must have some problems emotional. Garbage.
