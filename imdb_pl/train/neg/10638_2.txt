Proof that not everything Tarantino touches turns into gold. It's definitely the most plastic. It's easy to see that if it was not for Quentin's involvement, it would probably have been on the shelf for years, assuming he would ever rise. It's about a woman with a death fascination who deals in cleaning up crime scenes, Angela Jones is not convincing in this role, William Baldwin is better as a serial killer who keeps Jones at work! All in all quite poor.
