Unless you are between 10 and 14 (except for the grade R), there are very few things that you can like. One or two lines from Kenan Thompson, David Koechner (we really should see him more) and Sam Jackson are fun, and Julianna Margulies is as good as he can think about his surroundings, but unfortunately that's all. Poor plot. Poor acting. Worse writing and delivery. The special effects are gloomy. While the whole situation is a strange and horrible joke, significant individual situations are equally horrible. If we take into account parts of the action, in some movies there are unbelievable sequences of actions that make you dizzy and are the ones that make you moan. This movie contains only the latter type. There is not much left. I'm glad I did not pay for it. <br /> <br /> Despite the hype, I can read and think, so when I sat down to watch, I did not expect anything good. I did not have any expectations, but I was a bit worried. However, like a train wreck, you can not just look away. And even without any expectations, I was disappointed. Bad. Even "so bad, it's good" material. I'm "very" tolerant of bad movies, but that makes "Six String Samurai" (what I liked) an Oscar worthy. <br /> <br /> No, this piece of trash CGI is in the same company as Battlefield Earth, Little Man and Gigli. As currently, 7.2 is completely evaluated, it mystifies me. Brainwashing or somehow laying out a voting system is all I can come up with as an answer. <br /> <br /> I could pull, but just say that tonight I was a witness to the train wreck. I need to wash my eyes. 1 out of 10
