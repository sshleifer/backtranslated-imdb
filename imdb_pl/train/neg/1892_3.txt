I have read Chris_m_grant's comment from the United States. <br /> <br /> He wrote: "A fantastic documentary from 1924. The geography of today's Iraq from the beginning of the 20th century was powerful. "<br /> <br /> I would like to thank Chris and people interested in Iran Bakhtiari Nomads, Zagros mountains and landscapes and watch the film Grass, A Nation's battle for life. The traditions that you saw in the movie have lasted forever and will last as long as life continues. I'm from this region of Iran myself. I am Bakhtiari. <br /> <br /> Chris, I'm sorry to bother you, but the Bakhtiari region in Zardkuh is in Iran, not in Iraq, as you mentioned in the commentary. Iran and Iraq are two different and separate countries. Taking an Iranian for Iranian is almost like taking an American for Mexico. Thanks, <br /> <br /> Ziba
