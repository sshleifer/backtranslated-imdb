After seeing this pile of dung, my husband and I were wondering if it was actually the result of the experiment to see if the computer program could produce the movie. It was so apathetic and formal. But American propaganda thrown into your face throughout the movie proves - with disappointment - that it is the work of people. Call me a conspiracy theorist, but he quotes: "We have to steal the Declaration of Independence to protect it," they seem to justify actions like the invasion of Iraq, etc. The fact that Nicholas Cage says words like "Never use The Declaration of Independence as a bargaining card "with a simple face made me and my husband wonder if the entire cast took Valium before shooting each scene. "Reasoning" behind every plot turn and a new "clue" is really ridiculous and impossible to follow. There is also an additional additional plot of misogyny, in which Dr. Whatever-Her-Name-She was accused by everyone involved for "never quits." It is clearly in the film just for look, but they felt the need to hit the "dr" title of her character to give her some seriousness. At some point, the character Cage says, "You never shut up?" The camera moves to her, looking at her with astonishment, as if she were a child. Really grotesque. The only benefit of this movie was that it is so amazingly bad that you get a few laughs from it. It's really scary that most people watching a movie with us liked it. Frightening....
