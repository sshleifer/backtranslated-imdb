A long time ago, there was director James. He brought us a wonderful, thrilling science fiction, such as Terminator and Aliens. These films were the material from which the hits were made, and it looked like a fantastic future ahead of him when the advent of computer special effects appeared in the film industry. Terminator 2 showed us what was possible in this new era. <br /> <br /> ....... and then it happened ................ ... 1997 ........ countless prizes .......... obscene sums of money ............ bizarre advertising barrage ...... ...... maximum profit margin ....... Titanic was here! <br /> <br /> I've never (never) been able to jump on fashion and be too critical for good, in fact I often took the opposite attitude from the majority to get an argument. Titanic, however, was a movie that I took from only one positive - Kate Winslett is absolutely wonderful! <br /> <br /> Quick - the dialogue was like something from Beverly Hills 90210, the acting was more wooden than my nephew's tree house, the pictures intended for horror were actually comical (the man fell from the ship and hit the propeller), historically false ( do not start me, because it's too much), had terrible thematic music (there with a bodyguard for cheese) and a senseless love story was so tedious, absorbing and pathetic that it disregarded the difficult situation of all other people (I was glad when he died and he was disappointed when she did not). <br /> <br /> It was just obvious from the very beginning that this photo was designed for watching MTV, chewing chewing gum, chasing a boy with a car, teenage girls (DeCaprio himself resembled something less heroic than a greedy member a band of boys) who would have their sex hungry for boys starving for three and a half hours, hoping for happiness later! The worst thing was that he did not stop at this point. Millions of fools, cultural vultures went to see this expensive waste celluloid, because "it cost so much to produce it must be great" and "Steve and Barbara said it's good and they know their films". <br /> <br /> The crowning glory took place when the Titanic swept the boards during the Oscars. King James of Hollywood had a serious moment of silence for the victims of the mortal evening on which his three and a half hour long farce was based. It seemed to me that he prayed for forgiveness after he made a fortune, incorrectly presenting the circumstances that led to the death of many people. <br /> <br /> However, if people are stupid and sentimental enough to buy the kind of trash they deserve to be deceived. Good luck in Hollywood, if they want to make money, I'll do it if I had chances in life! <br /> <br /> This is on my worst list of films other stupid, historically fake / human interest traps like "Patriot" and "Pearl Harbor".
