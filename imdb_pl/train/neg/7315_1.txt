OK, let's get to the point. We have the last five college graduates (who had to be specialists in the field of F) going on a weekend camping trip. They bump into someone who needs help, but instead of trying to help him, they decide to set him on fire instead. A nice group of people. Then some of them start to get sick - there must be something in the water in the cabin in which they are staying. However, the neighbors seem to be okay. Well, when things start to be really bad, they close their companions, instead of getting help (by the way, try a neighbor). Some locals do not like them. They are chasing one at high speed, traverse the forest for many miles until the truck breaks down. Somehow, ten minutes later, he appears in the cabin (how he could find him and how he could travel at the speed of light to get there, it's a secret). Another type of brain surgeon in the cabin realizes that something is wrong, so he hides in a cave to let it pass. The next day he decides to return to the cabin, believing that it must be some sort of shrine. He is shaken with relief that he survived (probably he thought it was a 24-hour mistake). Unfortunately, not so friendly policemen meet him. Another couple decides to have sex while the meat-eating worm is working on his magic, and then the women realize that he needs to shave his legs (taking a lot of sick skin with a shaving cream). In any case, you have an idea. Nothing makes sense here. These are five people that I would not like to be friends with. I supported bacteria that eat meat. Other characters were also introduced, which were also a bit funny, but completely unlike others. Ninety minutes of good life has been wasted here.
