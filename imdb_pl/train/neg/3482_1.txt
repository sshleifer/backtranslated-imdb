So I know I voted 1 in 10, but it really deserves no more than half the star. I hated it. It was so stupid and unrealistic, I can not believe that none of the stars who signed the contract would create this absurdly absurd project. <br /> <br /> James G. and Cathrine O'Hara were great heroes and Ben Affleck and Christina Applegate were equally good, but the story was useless and I encourage anyone who sees it in the video store, not even bother Heads her lifting and reading the back cover, but just go away ... I do not even want to find out what the movie is about, because it's too stupid to pontyfikowaÄ‡ o. <br /> <br /> Do not rent it! It is horrible! Awful!
