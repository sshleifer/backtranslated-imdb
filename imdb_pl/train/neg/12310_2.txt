Steve Martin should stop trying remakes of the classic comedy. He absolutely does not fit in this part. Like the unfortunate remake of Out Of Towners, this movie falls on your face. If anyone thought that Steve Martin could even get closer to the great performance of Jack Lemmon, he is above me and the same applies to this film. Dan Ackroyd could have better play Bilko. Martin is great when he creates his own original characters, but he fails to miserably recreate the classic work of other people. It's a sad statement when the funniest part of the movie is in the first line of subtitles when the movie ends. The line "Producers gratefully recognize the total lack of cooperation from the United States Army" was almost the only line that really made me laugh. If you want to see the real Bilko, get the original episodes of Phil Silvers Show. They guarantee that you will laugh, in contrast to this error, which should never happen. I put this film in the same category as the Lemmon classic mentioned earlier and the Psycho remake. None of them should ever happen.
