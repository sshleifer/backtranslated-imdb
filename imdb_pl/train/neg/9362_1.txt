The plot sounded as if she promised. Honestly, I did not watch the whole movie. After about an hour of film, I had to make a decision. Is this film worth watching to the end? The answer was clearly NO! It is not the fact that the human body could not receive a transplant from another species without rejecting it. Neither the premise that he was prosecuted by secret government authorities for a human / wolf transplant. This is because the movie was badly written, there was no emotion and I did not understand several dream sequences with wolves and buffaloes. When he ran to the zoo with a pack of dogs and left them in front of the zoo gate, saying "If you can not run with large dogs, do not leave the porch", it still ran through my bored mind. Save time and skip this movie. I can guarantee that if you dare to watch it, you will sit back and wonder why someone is wasting money, time, energy and effort to do this offensive indignation at American cinema.
