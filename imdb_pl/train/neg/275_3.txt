It is absolutely unbelievable for me that someone can comment that this film is not instructive. It is not only oppressively preached, but also absurd, scenographic, dramatically devoid of the mantle and painfully strained. Looking at this, it feels like an 8-year-old child has been punished by writing "I will not become a fascist" on the blackboard 100 times. <br /> <br /> Now I understand that it was done at the height of World War II was to be courageous Hitler's condemnation and terrible suffering, which he brought (which everyone applauded with all their hearts) and I am sure he captured the mood of the day exactly. But it is presented in such an immature, too obvious, youthful way that it fails as a work of art. <br /> <br /> The only good performances here are Paul Lukas, who brings sincerity and intensity to his role of a quietly heroic anti-fascist; and Lucile Watson as a playfully dressed rich grandmother who slowly realizes how dangerous the world has become. Although their rootless upbringing has subordinated them to all kinds of difficulties, children are ridiculously shown as a robot that behaves well in small scissors. They do not even resemble real human beings. And Bette Davis, a great actress, is so noble in size that I crouched every time she was on screen. Her every word, every gesture of her, is to convey how SUPPORTING and UNDERSTANDING she is with the SACRIFICE OF SACRIFICE her husband must make and the great CAUSE she fights for that she must have been subjected to a painful electric shock if she dares. there was some doubt or shading in her performance. <br /> <br /> So yes, this is a very important movie, just not really good.
