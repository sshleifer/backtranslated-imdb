If the only sex you've ever had is with a farm animal, the designation of the movie is probably still misleading. <br /> <br /> This is definitely one of the most boring movies I've had the pleasure to try and watch lately. I found a DVD lying in my friend's house and made a sad mistake that I did not burn it. <br /> <br /> I can not give any details without breaking the movie, because there are only about 5 details of the movie. Try to imagine someone making a movie about things on a c-span, only a fictional movie is 10 times less interesting than the most boring debate on c-span. <br /> <br /> I think there is a conspiracy somewhere, but I was not able to say exactly what it was when I picked out the eyeballs and threw them to Richard Gere.
