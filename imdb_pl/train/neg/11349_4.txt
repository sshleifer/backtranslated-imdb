Actually a lie, Shrek 3-D was actually the first animated 3D movie. I bought it on DVD about 3 years ago. Did not Bug's Life do it either? I think it was at Disneyworld on this tree, so I say before they go and use it as a logo. In addition, Shrek 3d was a motion simulator at Universal Studios. They should still consider it a movie because it appeared in the "theater" and can be bought on DVD. The film was charming, at least the little flies were. I liked IQ. I agree with the animator, did a divine work, making a movie from something that is simply an adventure. I recommend it to families and children.
