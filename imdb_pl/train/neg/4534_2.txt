The book on which this movie is based has seriously changed my life. But saying this movie was a disappointment. Acting, directing, cinematography and plot were terrible. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. I have told countless people about the book, but now I will tell them all that they definitely should not watch the movie! I did not expect the conspiracy to follow the book, but they omitted too many key elements of the book. The film tried, but failed to deliver a powerful and inspiring message and only broke the main theme of the prophecy. Putting myself in a position that did not read the book, I saw the Celestine prophecy as a handful of B.S. I'm totally disappointed with Redfield for the way this movie appeared.
