Films of this kind in which a psychologist of one or another variety tries to destroy the reputation (and eventually eliminate) a naive person to take their lives. Mortal attraction, Pacific Heights, a hand that rocking the cradle, a single white woman and a thousand television films are just some examples. But while a few, especially Fatal Attraction and Pacific Heights, could offer at least some extremely paranoid, uncertain characters or a few twists, Unlawful Entry plays everything according to the book. And if not for the fame of his stars (Kurt Russel, Ray Liota and Madeline Stowe), this film would fall into mediocrity faster than Danielle Steele's miniseries. <br /> <br /> Russel plays Michael Carr, an unwaveringly na√Øve guy who calls the help of two officers when someone breaks into his house and tries to attack his wife (Madeline Stowe). Unfortunately, he quietly unloads his anger because he feels so helpless in the situation of an inadequate policeman (Ray Liotta), a typically psychopathic villain with no limit to his power. At the beginning, sympathetic to Carrow (probably only pretending to be doing this), the policeman befriends the couple. But soon the cops want Carr to get out of the way, destroying the lives of men in almost every way possible (which is quite easy when you're a cop, and when you're a cop who has installed a guy's security system into his house) to take over and presumably get his wife. He seems less goal oriented, and more like a policeman, he just wants to prove his power. The wife is more of a trophy, in other words than the end. And the story takes place entirely in the book, you can probably predict any event before it happens on screen if you see enough of these movies. From the "shocking" moment, our main, naive figure realizes that he is a victim of fraud with the use of credit cards (committed by a psychopathic villain) to the finale "he does not mind."
