This film seems to have many people saying that it is one of the most brutal of all time. After watching it, I can say that it does not meet these expectations. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the movie is really insane. But overall, the execution was not worth the effort at all. Even the last scene (thing from the eyeball) is not that bad. I was expecting something crazy, instead it was of lower quality than gore published in movies such as the very low budget of Violent Sh! T. <br /> <br /> Anyone who wants to see a real movie will be disappointed because it's not a story (though most people know it). Gore's fans will be disappointed because, contrary to belief, blood and guts are few here. Not to mention that an actress playing a victim may be one of the worst in history. <br /> <br /> Regardless of what people say, this movie is not so shocking, just everything sucks. Avoid this.
