In the end, I saw INCUBUS after waiting 20 strange years to see it and good, certainly not worth the wait all the time to see it. INCUBUS is closely related to the horror game: an invisible killer / monster rapes and murders women in a small town. <br /> <br /> The film looks like this: the film opens with killing; then blah blah; more blah blah; then another murder; even more blah blah; continuing blah blah; another murder (surprising, eh?); bla bla blah, etc ... <br /> <br /> The movie is completely predictable from the beginning to the end. Even the stupid "big" red herring used throughout the film will not convince a five-year-old. And I discovered the secret identity of the incubum the moment I saw the character, so when the "shocking" surprise arrived, I was not shocked or surprised. In fact, it was so funny that I giggled a few days after watching the movie. It's so stupid! <br /> <br /> In any case, the film is so numerical that the sequence of the "rock band" is one of the few outstanding moments in this grim film. It's a stand out scene, not necessarily because it's good, but because it's so fun and pointless: the movie on the big screen shows a rock-like movie with a guy in red leather pants that has obviously fake long hair, all edited with the girls' scenes which is attacked by an incubus in the toilet of the cinema. The best thing I can say about this movie are the photos I liked. But besides, there is almost nothing worth mentioning about THE INCUBUS, except that it is involuntarily fun.
