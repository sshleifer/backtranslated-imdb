To be brutally honest ... I LOVED watching Severed. That's why <br /> <br /> gave him 1/10 stars because of clearly unimaginable <br /> <br /> historia / filmowanie / aktowanie / wszystko. This movie was RIOTEM to watch. If you like <br /> <br /> you like to watch bad movies to play with them, you'll be surprised <br /> <br /> by Severed. <br /> <br /> The story really does not matter, it engages a guy who is bald <br /> <br /> and has a sword and spins, cutting down random people. <br /> <br /> But he has a supernatural phrase ... no one sees him. <br /> <br /> Even when in one very memorable scene, he enters a <br /> <br /> night club and pushes the girls' dumplings and nobody sees it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Severed not only looks as if it was shot on video - it was <br /> <br /> filmed on someone's home camera. Film makers had <br /> <br /> knowledge about lighting (very thin knowledge) and composition <br /> <br /> in fact they behave together in some scenes. But usually you can not hear the actors <br /> <br /> ... you can not understand what they are doing, and you are laughing <br /> <br /> when the next vicitm gets his pumpkin from his body. <br /> <br /> Go and rent this movie. Support movies like this - they are hoot and <br /> <br /> hollar!
