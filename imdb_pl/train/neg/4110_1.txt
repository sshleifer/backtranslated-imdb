It is simply breathtaking - you really have to see it! <br /> <br /> Depending on your perspective, Dylan Walsh is either a savior or a problem here: because he is the only one on screen that can get him growing out with something akin to natural cadence and inflection, or ruining a movie, pointing to all disadvantages of others, or save them, providing a context for their horrors. <br /> <br /> I'm inclined to later view-- it works like a high comedy. He is the 7th in the game of dwarven basketball, his skills are not applicable in this context, and his awkwardness is delicious. <br /> <br /> The real treat, however, is Mrs. Eastwood, whose inability to speak English is so ubiquitous that I actually went crazy, expecting to find out that she is a Russian beauty who is phonetically speaking her lines without understanding them meaning. But no: she is just a talent-free American who lets you laugh at every line she loses. Whether she knew what the lines meant, she must remain an open question.
