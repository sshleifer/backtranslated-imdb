Actually, I felt bad for the actors in this matter. Without a doubt, the high school theater class could do a better job or at least work. The actors had to think that it would be their big chance to work in a film, it certainly was not. In addition, horrible acting was a boring story and mostly predictable. The one about the pilot did not even make sense. That was wrong with the best assumption in this group. <br /> <br /> I am in favor of supporting low-budget films and giving new creators a chance, but this turkey is a waste of time and an insult to the viewer. I just watched it because of the good comments posted here. They had to be planted by people connected with the film. You can cheat people to see it, but you can not fool them to like what they saw. <br /> <br /> I gave her 2 instead of 1, because at least the boxer's story tried to warm up the heart. Sure, it failed, but he tried. I reserve 1s for the worst of the worst. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and skip this dribbling. I would like to have.
