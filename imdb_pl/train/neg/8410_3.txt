This movie is all flash and has no soul. Actors put a lot of passion into numbers, but these numbers often did not connect with the film and were like stand-alone music videos. And no effort was made to make the numbers sound as if they were right in front of you, each one sounds like a studio sounding, basically sucking up your life from the songs. Beyond the stage, the performances were boring and unfulfilled, especially Hudson, who basically plays the same angry, "strong" (is a stubborn and selfish) black woman we've seen before. Her character had absolutely no depth or any other female role. Although I think that the movie wants us to believe that Hudson's face faces difficulties because of its weight, it's really her refusal to do what's best for a troubled band that makes the end of the movie completely unheard of meaning. The Hudson Academy Award is a joke, there was no justification. When she sang, she gave out emotions (though she was often misplaced, but it was the script / director's fault), but when she was just playing, she did nothing to develop the already signed character. Eddie Murphy's character is the only one with a bow and he did a great job, but he still does not deserve an Oscar. The only actor who really brought something was Danny Glover, who took a small, relatively irrelevant figure and made something real of it. There is nothing here that can sink your teeth, no drama or heart, and even laughs. The location of musical numbers was so bad that sometimes the movie seemed to be joking with musicals instead of being one; the number with which Hudson argues with other girls is so long, if it can pass for the Family Guy skit. The movie has no idea what's going on, and I've been offended for the past few minutes. It's a great, boring waste of time and really is the worst movie I've seen in 2006, and nothing last year was really great.
