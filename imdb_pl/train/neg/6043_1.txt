You must see my comments on many films under Evren Buyruk. I'm leaving to comment on a movie that is not even worth talking about ... This movie is basically two hours of drinking Dafoe - almost literally - until death. The only surprise in this movie is that you did not have enough tips or knowledge about characters to be surprised. It was just a grim, sad waste of time. <br /> <br /> Willem Dafoe is a great actor. Peter Stormare is a great actor. But this movie just pulled. Slow does not make the movie bad, it was just bad. A sketchy plot mixed with artistic ramblers of anamorphic details is not consistently connected in a sensible way to the story, with the exception of highlighting some blood, which is illustrated from several perspectives, and finally at the end. I really appreciate the artistic vision, but as an entertainment, he lulled me. (Seriously, I fell asleep and had to watch the movie again - which was even more disappointing.) Basically, I do not like to make negative comments or reviews about the work of others, even when they are sucking, but this movie was guaranteed by one. It is a pity that these great actors were embarrassed by this final result.
