I will not argue with anyone who announces this amazing movie, as does Jones Jones, but please check it out, if you have not already done it, on the Mad Men TV series that will start this month. like the whole cast. I will charitablely assume that she took the role of "Tabu" solely for money and, realizing how terrible the mess was, she turned into a minimal acting job to avoid hunger. I know if it is, but I (now) know for sure that it can work. <br /> <br /> At first, watching "Taboo", I was convinced that her apartment was a clever choice, which would later give rise to some significant revelation about her character or story. There is no happiness. It is hard to believe that the director did not suggest her at least once that changing the expressions for 17 consecutive scenes may cause lockjaw. <br /> <br /> Ironically, her winning performance in "Crazy Men" appears as a character who, at least at an early stage of her performances, is very suppressed, restrained, insecure herself and rather colorless, unlike hers " Taboo". But as the show progressed, she began to flourish in someone who questions her traditional early 60th role as mother. I can not wait to see where they will take their character in the second season. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, avoid "Tabu", such as leprosy, but definitely check "Mad Men".
