Quote: theurgist: each of IQ. more than 50 people would see this movie as it is, a smart, well-played prequel of modern classic, yes, no hit cast or big budget, BUT still is very well made and caught me all the time. <br /> <br /> IQ over 50 you say .. it means that you have I.Q. below 50. is called CARLITOS WAY: Rise to power !!! which means that he should have something a little bit the first to do ... <br /> <br /> all right, if ... CHANGE TITLE AND NO NAME CARLITO BRIGANTE !!! /> Ps does not comment on the movie if you do not know anything about the movies. but IQ probably. under 50, you will not know what the hell I'm shouting ... <br /> <br /> Calm !!
