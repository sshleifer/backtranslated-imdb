Mike Brady (Michael Garfield, who had a small part in the classic "The Warriors") is the first person in the community who realized that there are murderous snails in his small town. Not just snails, but a carnivorous killer larger than normal, mutated by toxic waste snails (which still go as fast as a regular snail, which is not so scary, but digression). Nobody will believe him at first, but it will be. Oh, they will. <br /> <br /> OK, deadly snails are just above the psychotic sloths, and just below Johnathon Winters as a child of Morków in the creep factor. The absurdity of all this is quite obvious after leaving. Flip is funny and is "so bad that he is good." I appreciate that they said it was Slugs: the Movie as opposed to Slugs: the Children's Game or Slugs: the Other White Meat. Probably not worth watching more than once and immediately forget it, except to play a little-known trivia game. Director Juan Piquer Simón is better known for his previous films "Pod People" (which MST3K has tasted) and "Peices" (which is probably the funniest bad film ever made). <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Kari Rose shows T & A <br /> <br /> My class: D + <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Only the theatrical trailer of this movie
