This film is another attempt by director Tim Burton to use the well-known title to bring his "vision" to the screen. He did it with the help of "Batman", "Sleepy Hollow" and now this. This is not a remake. The only thing that has to do with the original is that it has monkeys that can talk (and Charleton Heston creates a cameo). Burton reconstructed the whole story, watering it to today's mass audience. <br /> <br /> The original Planet of the Apes was a product of its time. In the 1960s, America fought to redefine its civilization. It was a turbulent time to search for the soul and to think about social norms. It was an era of civil rights, in which groups long considered to be inferior needed to be treated equally. In this context, the POTA was allegorical, reflecting the philosophical turmoil the audience of the day faced. POTA was an extremely intelligent film that touched on difficult questions and elegantly subjected oppression to American society, causing the white guy to justify his intelligence to a species he considered inferior. The dialectic between Colonel Taylor (Charleton Heston), Dr. Cornelius (Roddy McDowall) and Dr. Zira (Kim Hunter) was thought provoking and intelligent with both subtle and obvious irony. <br /> <br /> The Burton version is just as the product of today's times as the POTA from the sixties. This is Apes for Dummies. It is superficial and rude, replacing politically correct phrases with intelligent dialogue and focusing more on form than substance. The ending of the "surprise" is completely false and adds nothing to the film except the "cliffhanger", which creates a sequel. While the ending of the original POTA gracefully bound everything together into one powerful scene, the ending of Burton simply mocks the audience, mocking, "I know something you do not know, and you'll have to wait for the sequel to find out. <br /> <br /> From a technical point of view, as always with Burton, the film is perfect. The make-up is fantastic, and Burton's work is excellent (though I still do not like its dark appearance). However, thirty-three years of progress in prosthetic makeup can not compensate for an insulting empty scenario. <br /> <br /> The story has been reduced to the monster's movie. People join together after Captain Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) to fight monstrous monkeys, assisted and assisted by several smash-hit (especially Helena Bonham Carter as Ari). The presentation is formal and simplified with a lot of violence, ideal for today's fast food mentality. <br /> <br /> Acting is mixed. Mark Wahlberg is a great actor who is simply wrong in this role. Walberg copes well with dark, grim characters who are tormented but strong. This part requires an inspirational hero, not a profile in Wahlberg's repertoire. Helena Bonham Carter is a brilliant actress whose character is so far below her ability that disconnection is ridiculous. Desperately, she is trying to do something with a faint character, but her interpretation is like a cross between a demonstrator of peace and love of a sick teenager. <br /> <br /> Then there is Tim Roth. This virtuoso performance, which alone saves the film from total ruin. Roth is devilishly hateful as the sinister general Thade. He creates one of the most wicked and vicious evil people I have remembered for some time. In addition, its physical action is superlative, making the chimpanzee such a perfect combination that you can almost believe that the species exists. <br /> <br /> This movie is a huge disappointment. It's decent entertainment, as long as you check your brain at the door. I rated it on 3/10. From a technical point of view, it is much better, maybe 9/10. However, history is an insult to the original series. This is just another Burton attempt in self-praise, using a familiar title to attract crowds to the checkout, so many people can see who the genius is. Of course it is true, but it would be great if he used this talent to produce meaningful films instead of simply thinking about mass consumption.
