I'm sorry, but this is a bad movie that's funny. Football hooligans arguing in a shelter? Suits? Shades ?! Alan apparently had no idea what he was talking about when he did it, he's as far from the truth as you can. <br /> <br /> The cast was terrible ... Gary Oldman as a hooligan? It does not look scary, it's scary and even meets someone who likes football. And what about Yeti? What the hell? Suits, shades and a seat in the Travelodge are childishly provoking each other "time for a diaper". Please. <br /> <br /> And the Yeti gang spraying the ICC underwear? <br /> <br /> I do not see how anyone can take this movie seriously! <br /> <br /> 4/10. This is probably the most imprecise picture of hooliganism of the late eighties that I have ever seen.
