A cheap movie about mothers looking for their daughter who has been kidnapped by people who are snorting for porn movies. The trail leads her mother across Europe when she is looking for her child and we are in the audience fighting for a dream. <br /> <br /> This is one of the innumerable soft-core movies that are created for people who want emotion related to porn without stigma or the danger of appearing on a credit card bill. Personally, I would prefer the stigma because these films seem to be more interesting and honest with what we see. This is supposed to be a sexy thriller, but it is not. Mainly her people talk about things that are followed by a lot of walking from place to place and lead to leadership. Periodically, throughout the film, people undress and everything has more than just a bit of S & M to do. Violence and fetish are such that they provoke laughter rather than horror or even excitement, all of this is incredibly false. What's worse, there is not even enough nudity to make it interesting. (Essentially the same course for many of these movies) <br /> <br /> You'll forgive me the lack of details, but it's just a boring boring movie I've been to the end, hoping something amazing will happen, but nothing there was no. The most interesting thing was a dark-haired blonde with a huge bite and a Buick-sized nose. I looked at her with morbid fascination, wondering what she looked like as a young girl and wondering if she had plastic surgery, not things you should think about in a thrilling thriller. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
