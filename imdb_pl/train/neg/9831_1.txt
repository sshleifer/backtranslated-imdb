I tried to watch this movie without being able to really go through it because it is supposed to have a "good" message; the problem is that it is obviously produced according to one particular interpretation of the scripture. Interpretation, in my opinion, will mislead many people. In addition, I am a movie freak, and the acting in this film was totally unacceptable. I've never wanted to get a negative result before to rate a movie. So if you want to be preached constantly by those who have no authority, just get the movie just in case. This comment is also a warning to people who like or love sciFi, because the title will also deceive many people. It was an unfortunate movie, because the basic idea had possibilities and these possibilities were wasted. The only advantage of the film is that it made me realize that the character in "Time Machine" should probably show some more moral outrage due to the strange behavior of people in his future.
