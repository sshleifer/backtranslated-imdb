Another, the worst, the lowest that can go here is one. Otherwise, we will get an easy zero. Really one of the worst movies I've ever seen. In fact, the name Peckenpah was not in a thing that I would never guess that he did. Actually, one of the people in San Francisco that I know of was on the set very often and almost in the east says that Sam was just cool. It shows in spades. Laughter at the beginning of the movie is THE ONLY thing about this mess that is worth the second look. Even Gig Young is not visible. It's a real test of masochism. If I was forced to play in the theater to see it, I would jump screaming. And now I really feel guilty, watching all this from a very comfortable couch, which was too nice to leave. What a mess, it seemed less written than invented. It's not just a bomb, but a bmob written from the back. Yikes !!!!!
