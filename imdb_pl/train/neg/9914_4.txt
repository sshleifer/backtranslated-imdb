This film deals with the subject of child abduction from the point of view of mom (fox Hartman Black), who behaves like a man in the action thriller. Unlike other films on which the police focus, mum tracks her ex-husband who kidnapped their son. He gets help from his lawyer, who eventually falls in love with her. <br /> <br /> Before he finally catches up with his son, many strange things happen. Mum is trying to take a child who looks like her son from a local children's play in the social theater. She gets caught and then realizes that she is not her child. This alone would lead most people to the Mental Depot or a few months in jail waiting for the trial. However, in this movie the mother is released after a few hours because the victim's parents regret it. Moments later, my mother breaks into her mother-in-law's house, and then the police arrive and aim at her, but let her escape because they recognize her (and regret her?). <br /> <br /> At another time in history they found a child, but when the police come to search the house, it turns out that they left the back door and got into the river with a boat, which Dad apparently only kept for such an emergency escape! Mom gets somebody who lends her a raft, and although it must have taken a while (in the real world), she and the lawyer-boyfriend and police quickly catch up with the second raft and upside down into the water at the landfall. Instead of going out of the raft to look for a dad on land, my mom assumes he drowned the boy and jumps into the water when he sees his life jacket. Of course, he can not swim and sink like a rock. The lawyer saves her, but they miss her father's escape. At some point, my mother says her son died in a clinic in Mexico. He goes on it and nobody knows where it stops! In a sense, this movie really uses child abduction and is not very positive. On the other hand, seeing a woman doing all the crazy things that men do in these kinds of movies was fun (or fun?).
