*** May contain spoilers. *** <br /> <br /> If LIFE IN THE TIME OF TOKY was some bold experiment, in which real actors were given cinematic parts provided that they would have to combine a powerful prescription with an anxiolytic drug, antidepressants and antipsychotics (this is a classic combination of psychiatric wards, which makes the patients become drooling zombie) during filming, then this movie would have much more interest. Or, if film production was a different type of experiment in which all actors were deprived of sleep before and during filming, then TOKYO TIME can be more easily explained. <br /> <br /> In fact, the movie is filled with dead, low-energy actors. In the scene where the new husband was sitting on the stairs talking with his sister, it turned out that he had a problem with keeping his eyes open. He speaks his lines almost in every scene, sitting down with each part of the body immobile. From the beginning to the end, his facial expression is best described as "close to sleep." <br /> <br /> Do not worry about the actors who talk about each other, because these actors can hardly end up fooling around on the line of dialogue. Everyone speaks in a depressing, monotonous voice. Do not laugh. Do not shout. No vigor. No one has enough energy to smash a smile. The result: complete and total boredom. <br /> <br /> And it does not matter that the direction is simple and amateur. <br /> <br /> Avoid this dead movie at any price. It's better to watch GREENCARD, which has a similar story and has charm and energy. Or, for an unconventional Japanese love story, check THE LONG VACATION, which has a lot of everything that LIVING ON TOKYO TIME does not have.
