Even if you could think that these boring characters personally witnessed every significant moment in the 1960s (ok, so Katie did not join the Manson family and no one died in Altamont), this movie was still incredibly horrible. I got the impression that the "writers" just locked themselves in the room and watched "Forrest Gump", "The Wonder Years" and Oliver Stone's films from the 1960s over and over and called them research. The Canadian television critic called the ending of the first episode "spinning the head". He was right.
