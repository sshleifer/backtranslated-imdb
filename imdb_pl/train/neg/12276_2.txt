The film had great potential, unfortunately, it broke down due to poor / unbelievable plot, bad thinking and general lack of content / content. One of the obvious flaws was that Sean Connery, who played an Arabian man, did not know how to pronounce his own Arabic name! This may seem a small disadvantage, but indicates the apparent lack of effort in paying attention to details. The quality of acting was equally lower than average. <br /> <br /> The lone grace of the movie was the turn of the action at the very end; and the French song (I do not remember the title). Overall, it was quite a bad movie, in which Sean Connery was clearly unsuccessful.
