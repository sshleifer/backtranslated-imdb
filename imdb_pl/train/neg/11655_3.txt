I was very disappointed with this film. I thought that the "Scary Movie", although it is not a great movie, was very good and funny. On the other hand, "Scary Movie 2" was boring, not funny, and sometimes plain stupid. <br /> <br /> The false script from Exorcist / Amityville was probably the best part of the movie. James Woods was great. <br /> <br /> Now I admit that I'm at a disadvantage because I have not seen a few movies that parody as opposed to the first, where I've seen them all. But bad comedy is still a bad comedy. <br /> <br /> Something that really hurt this movie is a sense of time that ruined some of what could have been a good joke. Scenes and jokes last for a long time. <br /> <br /> The same jokes are still repeated. For example, a talking bird. Ok, it was funny first, maybe even the second time. But it kept repeating up to the annoying ones. The routine between a guy on a wheelchair and Hanson (Chris Elliott) was fun at first, but it kept repeating and ended up stupid and even tasteless. <br /> <br /> Some jokes were repeated even from the first movie. For example, "creaming" which I think you would call Cindy (Anna Faris) was funny in "Scary Movie" because Cindy had kept her boyfriend for so long that he basically had blue balls from hell it was fun when it "dairy." But this time it was out of place and it was not funny. <br /> <br /> The bathroom and sexual humor in general were more fun and well planned the first time. The scat humor was excessive and rather unnecessary in the second movie. <br /> <br /> Tori Spelling was annoying and really had no place in this movie. <br /> <br /> But I liked Shorty (Marlon Wayans), who in my opinion was the funniest character in the first movie. The scene with him and the pot plant was one of my favorites from the second movie. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I love the Wayans family and their mood. That's why this movie is so disappointing. . . they have much more comic skills than endless jokes.
