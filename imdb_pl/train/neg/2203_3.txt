Look out for all the crazy scientists around the world: if you're going to turn your son into a genetically mutated monster, you have to give him a more terrifying name than "Paul." I do not care if he is a terrifying hammerhead shark with a bite of sharp teeth of a dagger and the ability to ambush people both in water and on dry land. Give your child a more worthy name, such as "Thor", "Rock" or "Tiburon". Because even if he eats me, I will probably sit down and laugh: "Ha! Collect the load !!! Paul Monster tears me apart !!!!! "This is the worst aspect of this movie that this shark is called" Paul "throughout the movie. This makes it seem just stupid that what could be a decent horrific horror. Not that there were other camp and fancy parts of "Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy". Scientists spend the whole film wandering along this island and suddenly one of the girls starts to itch wildly from walking through the lush forest and simply pours water on her feet to experience itching, which of course allows "Paul" to get out of the water and kill her. The only thing SciFI Channel did in this movie, let the hottie live. But it's a small lining in another disappointing movie.
