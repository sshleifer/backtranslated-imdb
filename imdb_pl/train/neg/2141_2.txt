I was dissatisfied with watching this movie with my girlfriend who, like me, is a fan of the first one. This movie has been drawn in! He lacked the first magic. Actually, you understand every word that mice say, the animation is bad, the palace is very different from the first movie, there are new characters that have never been mentioned before and they were terrible, fortunately the prince did not have many lines that stopped him from sounding stupid. Basically it resembles the Lion King 1 1/2, except for the various stories told by mice. The reason why I gave it 2 in 10 is that the songs not sung by the heroes were the most pleasant.
