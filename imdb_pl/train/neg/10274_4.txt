In Texas, seven friends meet at the bar to celebrate Halloween night before going to a party. In the meantime, they are calling the American Nightmare pirate radio for fun and professing the innermost fears. A serial killer who listens to their confessions makes their nightmares come true, killing each one in a sadistic way. "American Nightmare" is a strange, low-budget film that has a terrible beginning: without explanation, the woman kills two couples on an isolated campsite, as if it was Friday 13. Then the story goes to a bar where seven friends celebrate Halloween. From this point on, the story has enormous potential, and the unknown cast has a very reasonable performance, showing beautiful breasts and naked bodies as usual in this type of production C. However, the end of the scenario does not give any explanation for the killing instinct and motives of the nurse Jane Toppan, giving the impression that the budget ended before finalizing the shooting. With a better start and finish, this strange story would be a good film with a low budget. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Agony" ("Agony")
