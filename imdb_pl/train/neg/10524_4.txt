Actually, I was going to watch this movie in the theater. In fact, it was sold out. Instead, I went to see Solaris, which was the worst film that appeared in 2002. <br /> <br /> Victor Rosa (John Leguizamo), a hard street street pharmacist, goes crazy when he sees a child being shot, so he decides to purge himself and invest all his money in Jack (Peter Sarsgaard). Everything goes well until Jack leaves the city with his girlfriend Trish (Denise Richards). It was very late in the movie, so if it was not revealed in the preview, it could have been an interesting discovery. But it was so, so it is not. <br /> <br /> There is nothing really interesting about this movie; everything is distributed in the preview. If you saw one or more previews, you saw the whole movie, so you can just really think about filling the gaps. Go to the site, download the preview, save 3.99 USD. There is not a single surprise or twist in the whole film, except how horrible the soundtrack is. <br /> <br /> I hope that whoever was responsible for writing the soundtrack was released. Twice. Most of them would be what music would be like if the only songs that could be released were the duets of Ricky Martin and Gloria Estefan, and (I can break the fabric of the space-time continuum with a stunning concept like this) He had less talent and musical abilities. <br /> <br /> Acting is weak at best, the scenario is, at best, a crime against humanity, and Denise Richards is at best 67% styrofoam and 33% ziploc. You know that everything is wrong when John Leguizamo (he was in The Pest!) Improves the rest of the cast with his acting skills.
