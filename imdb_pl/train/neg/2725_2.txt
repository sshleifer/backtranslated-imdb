Chesty gringo Telly Savalas (as Frank Cooper) is an American "Cop Cop". He serves as father to the father of the young immigrant Danny De La Paz (as Benny Romero), who wants Mr. Savalas to be the best man for the upcoming wedding. Savalas is tough, but the boss of Eddie Albert (as commander of Moffat) may be more difficult. It is difficult what you need to stop the smuggler Michael V. Gazzo (as Chico Suarez). Alliances can be liquid. <br /> <br /> If you find the opportunity to hear "Kojak" and "Oliver Douglas," uttering insults to be repulsive, you should avoid "Border". If not, you may not have a stomach for a "realistic" scene of slaughtering cows. Although it is not worth much, Mr. De La Paz and Cecilia Camacho (as Leina) steal the show. <br /> <br /> ** The Border (1979) Tony Richardson ~ Telly Savalas, Danny De La Paz, Eddie Albert
