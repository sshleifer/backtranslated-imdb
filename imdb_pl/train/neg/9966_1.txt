Although I never like to be a person who negates the personal preferences of others; if you like something, fine. But this movie was horrible and you can not get around it. I do not like Ani Difranco too much, but he is a great guitarist and songwriter, which I can admit. But I can not admit that there are any advantages in this film. Many people say that this is an accurate representation of the problems faced by high school students. Maybe, but everything is presented too far. It seems that there is an attempt to "Naked Gun" - esque kind of comedy, but the time is off; there is too much space between the actors' lines, as if they were holding laughter (there was not any). Whoever wrote the script was everywhere. In one film, they tried to crush so many controversial issues that they almost never developed any of them. I did not laugh once in this whole movie. This attempt of humor and satire was too offended to me to do anything, but I rolled my eyes on the screen.
