I was looking for the right words to describe this movie. At the beginning I was just willing to go to more meaningful things because the film does not rise to the level deserving of comment. <br /> <br /> But I stopped, amazed at how to describe such things and the somewhat intrigued challenge presented by the question: "What can you say about such a film?" Garbage? No, it's not rubbish, garbage can be recycled into something useful. Greenhouse gas? No, this is not a greenhouse gas, greenhouse gases help plants grow and be healthy. <br /> <br /> In the end I hit "Even bad", reworking the phrase "Even bad" sometimes used in theoretical physics to describe a theory that is hopelessly flawed and even not worth the correction. That's all, Georgia Rule: Even bad.
