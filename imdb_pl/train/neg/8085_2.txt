Oh, cheerfulness! Oh, joy! Another movie that is so bad that it's good! Or I thought so. In fact, this one does not hit the "bad" good phase and sadly goes straight to "it can be so bad that it's good, but it screwed it up and made it wrong". <br /> <br /> Too start too long. Cut off half an hour and it can be more bearable. Then take on such absurd threads as "a man who sabotages the mission of saving the Earth because he has all his food supplies and he will be rich if the mission fails!" Duh! Or a "talking bomb" feature device last seen in Dark Star. Guess what .... like in Dark Star, the bomb has a failure ..... hmmmm. Add a bit of "we can not get out of the pre-school game" and you have Solar Crisis in a nutshell. <br /> <br /> The light relief is to be in the form of Jack Palance (or Jack Pants, as we called him in this movie), whose only goal in the movie is to bring the kid in the desert and call the father of the child to come after him ... finally. Between driving and telephoning, Jack distributes meaningless nonsense, gets bored and croaks, but makes a small contribution to the plot. In short, it's the best song in the movie. <br /> <br /> My award for "The most ironic line straight from the face" goes to Charlton Heston, who for the first time in centuries meets his eldest son, comments that his son looks a little "out of shape" while he he is standing there with the convexes in the waist and urgently needs Captain Kirk Corset. <br /> <br /> There's also a bad guy, henchman, who, for some reason, has a bright, white hairstyle that makes me think of Andy Warhol. <br /> <br /> In addition to these games, there is not much to recommend in this video. The end is a sequence copied from (but fortunately shorter than) the final sequence from 2001. <br /> <br /> Tips on how to enjoy this movie if you're stupid enough to watch it, like me: <br /> <br /> 1. Every time the bomb speaks, imagine that it's called Tarquin (trust me, it works!) <br /> <br /> 2. Whenever Chuck Heston is on screen and is going to speak, warn him, reciting a line from the Planet of the Apes, for example, "Take your dirty paws off me!" or similar. <br /> <br /> 3. Every time a lead woman looks stressed (this is most of the time), still hope she has an aneurysm and she will soon die. <br /> <br /> 4. During the endless scenes, "the ship crashed again", let's hope that technical and engineering guys will kick out Scotty-isma, like "You can not change the laws of physics!" or any such nonsense. <br /> <br /> Besides, do what you need to go through it. I dozed halfway and woke up to realize that I had not overlooked anything, and the conspiracy (though it was funny) had not developed. So do not worry that you will not think about it, you will not miss anything.
