This movie is completely junk. Some of the imbecile intellectuals console themselves by doing everything in their power to claim that the aristocrat is superior to the working class. Nothing more than a piece of catharsis of complacency. Disgusting. <br /> <br /> If this type of film is set in the US, it will definitely be a big joke. And because it comes out of the "other side", it becomes a masterpiece, a great pastime for some brainwashing and / or washing the western brain (maybe George W. :). Typical consequences of the Cold War, and some kind of joke. <br /> <br /> I would say that if this - as in this film - is everything that the Soviet intellectuals thought about all these years, they may deserve all the miseries that they claim have passed. BUT NO! Because, like many others, I have read and watched real masterpieces made by eminent Soviet intellectuals. For example, something important for the dog "White Bim Black Ear" - both Gavriil Troyepolsky's book and the film by Stanislav Rostotsky - is a real masterpiece. Real life, real tragedy, real sadness, real pride and dignity, one of the best in Soviet times.
