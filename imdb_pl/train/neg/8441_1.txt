This movie was long and boring. Surprisingly, he was chosen for Cannes, though they like pretentiousness. The point is that unlike other Dutch stars of this artistic genre, such as Kerkhof and Kruishoop, Guernsey feels completely empty. The more that there is no cinematic quality. A long shot does not mean cinematic depth, it's just a long, boring shot. The story was not interesting, and the characters had problems that I could not identify at all with. The actors did not shine under her direction and sometimes they seemed lost. Leopold tried, but she is not the talent I counted on. Where are Kerkhof and Kruishoop? They really did a few waves in the Dutch cinema. Leopold made another attempt.
