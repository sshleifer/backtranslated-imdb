The characters are cliced ​​and predictable, and everyone is either snow-white or completely evil. Acting is too stiff to be bad in a playful, exaggerated way. This is doubly disappointing if you're a fan of Bette Davis because her character is not a typically entertaining character like Bette-Davis; it just wrinkles. <br /> <br /> In general, neither my wife nor I thought the film was interesting, moving or pleasant.
