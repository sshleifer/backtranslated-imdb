The fact that someone has actually spent money on such a bad scenario is beyond me. It really has to be one of the worst movies, in addition to the "Haunted Highway" I've ever seen. Bad actors and a really bad story. There is no normal response to any event in this movie, and even if it is Halloween, normal people will have more reactions when they witness the death of their father, not to mention gutting, people with a tape covering their respiratory tracts that can not breathe (in a room with whatever the least 50 people I can add) and some person dressed as a devil pulling dead people from his home, even an 8-year-old will see the difference between a doll and a person. Not to mention that no one could be so naive and stupid as to believe in the reality of the appearance of Satan and Jesus on the same day as this kid. When I was 8 years old, I certainly had more brains than this. <br /> <br /> But, it is really stupid that everyone else seems to fall into this silent, satanic look, as well as without asking questions. The question in the whole movie is: is it really Satan, or maybe some crazy man kills people whenever he wants? Well, he has human hands, arms, built, and anything else, so I suppose he should be in the movie too, otherwise he did a poor job of hiding him. Then, when this person was a man and everything, he was able to kill an elderly woman, a man and his lover, 5 (!! ???) cops (everyone with weapons and training, I suppose) and a few other people. ... and of course everyone just stood there waiting for him or what? <br /> <br /> The whole concept and way of telling stories is absolutely the worst thing I've ever seen, and I would never recommend anyone who wants to waste 1 hour and 30 minutes of their lives to watch this total nonsense.
