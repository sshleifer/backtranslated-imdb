We all know that some of the best films of all time were based on books. Although they were not particularly apt adaptations, these films were excellent films. The Harry Potter series, the Lord of the Rings trilogy and, to a lesser extent, almost every Disney movie are excellent examples. However, I must regretfully announce that A Wrinkle in Time is not one of those films. Not only does it not meet the most basic expectations of fans of Fanele, but it defies the standards of writing scripts, acting, special effects and, ultimately, respect for the audience. Remember, I'm not trying to be mean; on the contrary, I entered into this affair with an open mind. I came to the conclusion that it was made for T.V. the movie would make up for the lack of stunning in your script. After all Ewoks from Star Wars was decent, though a bit stupid. Think about it, the original Star Wars arose on the "budget for lunch" and look where George Lucas took you! However, from the first scene, disappointment began to overwhelm me as if I was too close to Black Thing during tessering. <br /> <br /> In the same way that shooting with Greedo became for the first time the symbol of the Special Edition of Star Wars in 1997 (a disaster of monumental proportions involving an unhappy director making some hideous changes in his beloved classic), Whatsit officially become my personal symbol of confusion and stupidity, which is the wrinkle in time. The reason for this is that it has been unbelievably mutated. In addition to the slightly controversial decision to cast Alfre Woodard (Star Trek: First Contact and Radio) as our favorite star-mentor, the filmmakers decided to present her as a crow. That's right, crow. What's more, the celestial figure of a centaurion of this beloved character has been hacked by what looks like a mad eight-year-old; a majestic half-man, a half-horse with wings became a huge human head with a frightening smile awkwardly attached to the archery body of a horse that has just a pair of wings in the middle. If I were five years old, I would have been mentally able to survive for my whole life. The worst thing is that when they spoke, they were shown from the back to avoid responsibility for lip synchronization, which caused the scene that she spent looking at the back of the head and seeing a single, still cheek, thus rendering a piece of special effects less reliable than ET < br /> <br /> After getting rid of the most painful part, I have to go to what causes tears: character, acting and history. I personally imagined that Meg looks a bit like Moaning Myrtle from Harry Potter movies: ordinary hair, glasses and a character that most supermodels consider funny. She was always a somewhat restless, humorously pessimistic genius of mathematics, who simply could not care less about the import and export of Nicaragua. In the film is unpleasant knowing-everything for which I have no sympathy. In fact, he makes me feel sorry for poor Mr. Jenkins, the headmaster who still has to deal with her. Calvin, a nice, intelligent kid who all thinks he's a joke, he's become a jockey! Irony is terrible. As for the unforgettable Happy Medium, they took a pleasant old woman who liked to look at happy things and replaced her with a being that is "over sex" and likes to look at "funny" things like girls falling from a swing. The only three people I can think of who did the decent work are Charles Wallace, Mrs. Whatsit and The Man With Red Eyes (called "The Dude With Red Eyes" because of its total reactivation as a character). <br /> <br /> History is a mess. A good comparison to this aspect of the film is Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, who did not do well, telling the story found in the book, but retaining the soles of the original work. Here, the only part of the book is a pleasant chat with Hades in the underground, apparently unaware that her body is being destroyed. When the Dark Lord completes the sole on how well it shows that the truth needs to be felt and not seen, Ixchel's flat burrows (which replace the wonderful creatures that hold Auntie Beast among their ranks) are tearing the spine. Because the God of the Dead notes how subtle terror was like Camazotz's terrestrial world, the torn pages are scattered in a sandstorm and lost in the darkness of the land of evil. <br /> <br /> I am very sorry that this movie exists. I do not believe that the actors were really bad. In this way, they write characters who destroy them. Wrinkle in Time deserves the adaptation of Lawrence Kasdan directed by George Lucas or Steven Spielberg, reinforced in Industrial Light and Magic, earned by John Williams, because of his sound in Skywalker Sound, edited by THX and sold by Twentieth Century Fox . In the present condition, the film is not worthy of showing respect to people. Even Madeleine L'Engle thought it was wrong. The book was good, the movie was bad, and Mrs. Whatsit was ugly. <br /> <br /> Result: 0.1 / 10 (if you could) <br /> <br /> Advantages: <br /> <br /> They have correct names. <br /> <br /> Cons: <br /> <br /> He had terrible problems with the level of adaptation, scenario, acting and special effects of Cliffs Notes, not to mention the lack of evidence that you have ever read the book. Oh, and the main cover / poster has a photo of three main heroes riding a horse through the castle. Some may say that it symbolizes a high adventure. I say it symbolizes the irresponsibility of a cover artist who has not even bothered to make Photoshop Meg stick well.
