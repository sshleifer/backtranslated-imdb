Shecky, it's a goddamn legend, do not be wrong. Until recently, I worked in the British HiFi & Video sales network, running the testing department. We would go through many new starters, who are expected to learn how to wrap up, find various detritus that come back as not working in one way or another from the stores. Now, to test the solution of these new staff members, we would issue them with a copy of Going Overboard. We had hundreds of copies of this movie because every time someone bought a particular DVD player model Goodmans, who had this movie as a free present, took care of sending a DVD player, and never sent Shecky back. Our new employees will be forced to use only Going Overboard to test these machines for errors until they find a disk or two of their own to test with. <br /> <br /> Now why this movie is so bad, where to start ? <br /> <br /> Adam Sandler, who can be very funny, like Happy Gilmore or Wedding Singer, must have had a really good day. The rest of the crew stinks, what about Billy Zane? His name appears in several of the worst movies of all time and is a decent actor. Crazy. The production quality is equal to absolute zero. <br /> <br /> I would be willing to admit this zero if I could, because they did not even have the courage to call it the full name of "Unsinkable Shecky Moskowitz" after the release. Still, it's worth watching to see how far Sandler has gone and how low he can go.
