Who really created this shit is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, it's a waste of time and money. I hate how they create low-budget sequels with D-Lister actors and a story so similar to the first one. <br /> <br /> I found this movie in a basket for occasions, next to Wild Things 2 and Death To Supermodels for $ 2.99. What a fool, I thought it might be good, but I looked with disgust at how weak acting stereotypes break the plot and script from the first. -to-video production was even half-decent movie that you have to be on a crackd or something like that because I think most people who saw this movie thinks WHAT CHARGE CRAP !!!!
