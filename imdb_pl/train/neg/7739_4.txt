Do you remember when Harrison Ford was the biggest Hollywood star because he made great films? These days are like more and more distant memories. <br /> <br /> While Hollywood Homicide is not terrible at all, it is a routine and surprisingly boring movie of a buddy. This comedy is not very fun and an action movie that is not particularly exciting. Excess subplots can not mask the weakest of the main storylines. <br /> <br /> Ford at least seems to be happier than his latest projects, and is able to wear the movie most of the time. Hartnett is right, but he and Ford are not exactly Newman and Redford when it comes to chemistry. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, "Hollywood Homicide" is quite a funny pastime, but barely. Take out Ford, and that's not even it.
