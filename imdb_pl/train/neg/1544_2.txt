I think I laughed twice. A line in which the main character says something about being on the street. And then I forget that I used to laugh. It was probably early. <br /> <br /> It must be one of the slimmest films in history. Does Hollywood not realize that this kind of humor is really humiliating and sad. You can insult only so many times. <br /> <br /> 2/10
