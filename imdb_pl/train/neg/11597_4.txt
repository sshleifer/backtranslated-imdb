I will play with the story of Alice, who survived the previous part of the Nightmare series, and again finds the deathly dreams of Freddy Krueger. This time the mocking killer hits the sleeping mind of Alice's unborn child. His intention is to "be born again" in the real world. The only one who can stop Freddy is his dead mother, but can Alice free her spirit in time to save her son? This movie started really well when we see that Alice dreams of being Amanda Kruger, who will get stuck in the room and be raped by 100 maniacs, and then she will be taken to hospital, but then she is no longer pregnant, but then Amanda gives birth to Freddy 'ego again. <br /> <br /> Alice and Dan are the only two people who came back from the fourth movie and then got some new friends, "not long before Freddy starts killing again, I liked the first dead, all right, wrong good as other deaths or dreams. <br /> <br /> Freddy was not at all frightening in this movie, the nightmare was just boring, they were not really scary or frightening at all. <br /> <br /> It was okay for the fifth movie in the series, but overall I think it was really boring. (Still not the worst movie in the series, Freddy Dead is the worst) <br /> <br /> 4/10
