It is difficult to find a film that emerges from the still dominant mythology of Senator Joe McCarthy as the king of political demons. Boyle (as Joe) presents an irresistible, but historically inaccurate portrait of Wisconsin Senator, whose caricature McCarthy considers to be real. Meredith, like the cunning army lawyer Joseph Welch, who outwitted McCarthy during interrogation in 1954, is very good, as usual. <br /> <br /> In fact, McCarthy and Cohn were right, worried about the terrifying security situation in the army, and the interrogations in the 1954 Army were trapped in the smokescreen used by the military to reverse the investigation from their security flaws the commission investigated, through counter-arguments, which McCarthy and Cohn tried to get for their employees, David Schine, during the service. <br /> <br /> The film is a polemic based on self-satisfaction based on ubiquitous myths that for decades spoke for the truth that the "red fear" was essentially false and McCarthy, HUAC, etc. always shot at evil targets, being just a lie, a career that destroys advertising dogs that trample the constitutional rights of surprised innocent liberals who have been accused of being a security threat / com munists. <br /> <br /> People who do not know much about this case, they still feel confident repeating disinformation about McCarthy, and the example is the "red fear" to this day - Murow Clooney's hagiography. Erroneous information is omnipresent, no wonder people have swallowed it. A recent comment by Buddy Schulberg in the serious leftist British newspaper The Guardian was that the Hollywood writer "named the name" "McCarthy" - capturing the lie that McCarthy "examined" Hollywood as the head of HUAC - the truth is that McCarthy never he was not even a member of HUAC, and he was not interested in Hollywood politics - his investigations were limited almost exclusively to the weapons of the American government. <br /> <br /> The mythology of "red fear" is unfounded is now completely exploded by the recently opened documents of the Soviet and American government, if at all McCarthy underestimated the scale of Soviet infiltration and traveling companion in the US, but decades of public disinformation at the theme of this period will be difficult to correct. <br /> <br /> One day maybe a really brave Hollywood soul will make a movie telling the truth about how many American men and women secretly helped a mass murderer Stalin and worked to impose his mistaken regime on the Western world, giving an accurate description of a career Joe McCarthy - but I will not hold my breath. Until then, we have this mythical, drunk liar of the popular imagination, so well known in the media ... "The tail of the gunman Joe".
