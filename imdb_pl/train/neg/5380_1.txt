At the time of writing this review, it seems that more than 50% of IMDb voters awarded the film a 10 or 1 rating. I can only assume that those who gave him 10 were either cast members or crew members. <br /> <br /> They say that given the sufficient number of monkeys and enough time and a sufficient number of typewriters, these monkeys, simply by accidental mischief on the keyboard, will eventually write out the complete works of Shakespeare. However, I seriously doubt that with the same number of monkeys and time, you can find one that would give the film a rating of 10. <br /> <br /> Patiently watched the first half, stupidly assuming that the film at a certain level would develop the story or characters, and maybe they would create some kind of social commentary or provoke a mere intellectual thought. Otherwise, I was ready to accept action, tension, comedy, horror or even free sex as a way to draw my attention. In the end, I was disappointed, so most of the second half was watched twice, when in vain I was looking for a small piece of cinematic redemption. Unfortunately, there was no one. <br /> <br /> If "The Choke" was put to the test of the Scooby Doo episode, I'm afraid that the comic will win in terms of mystery, intrigue and unpredictability. And speaking of cartoon characters, the acting abilities of different cast members differed between the acceptable (at best) and embarrassingly poor portraits of Brooke Bailey depicting a bizarre, pseudo-gothic with an obsession for death, London, being so bad that I almost felt sorry for him. Br /> <br /> I would like to finish with a positive note, but even the soundtrack, a second-class feast of modern punk rock, did not even manage to entertain, let alone strengthen a very bad movie.
