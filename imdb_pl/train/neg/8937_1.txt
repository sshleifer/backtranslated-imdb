Generally I like horror movies, but unfortunately it fell out of one pound basket on the hand of my friends. We sat down to watch it, ready to be scared and ended up spraying food wherever we were laughing. The concept is not so bad, but why they decided that the number ten in the series will be lucky, I do not know. The worst in the film are the actors. The camera's work was weak, the special effects are not bad if I'm generous, but in general history did not merge at any level, because the actors were as effective as a small lump of ill charred elm. They were inexperienced, especially a young, younger actor who was fifteen years young to be taken seriously as a government agent. He looked more like a public school boy. There was a really funny sex scene in which he looked like he was bouncing on apples when a busty lady rode on him, and later his panties in the size of the nappies were hysterical, but then I remembered that it was not meant to be a comedy. We desperately break the brain to find something positive to say about this movie, except for the occasional flash of the breast, but it's just gone. Let's hope that the tenth was a lucky number, and they did not do another, I'm not sure if my ribs could take it.
