for a long time I could not wait to see this movie, here in Latin America Japanese or any oriental films have no distribution in cinemas, we can find some of these movies in some underground stores, and just found Avalon, I expected something good, but the only good side of this movie is the first scene, the rest of the movie is boring and senseless, just stupid, with many useless scenes and a boring story. I waste my time even by writing about this film. I'm sorry, but it's true.
