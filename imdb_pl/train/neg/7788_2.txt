I noticed how all the other reviews in the movie mention how "healthy" and "funny" it is. These people have to leave the house more often. I do not know why they are shilling on this boring, insipid, brainless piece of fluff. Pat Boone has absolutely no acting talent, and his ineptitude is crossed only by his star, Pamela Austin, a former model (one more reason to forbid the tricky practice of giving models without talent unsuspecting public, foul habit, which unfortunately persists to today). A good supporting cast (among others Terry-Thomas, Edward Everett Hortyon) tries to take advantage of it, but to no avail. I noticed that the two directors share the loan, although "credit" is not a word that I would use (it is not a "director"). When it comes to "healthy entertainment", many such films are available without torturing relatives, forcing them to do so. Find one of these videos and skip this one.
