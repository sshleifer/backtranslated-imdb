Let's face it; some lame kid who dies and has a soul transferred to a scarecrow. It will not become a neva! OMFG This stupid loser who can not get up gets his ass in the hands of some drunk bastard who fucks his mom. Just as he dies, he looks at the scarecrow and his ghost falls into a scarecrow. The drunk guy covered his death, making him seem suicidal and thought he had succeeded. Later, we see that he is thrown out of the trailer, and later gets another meeting with scarecrow. They had a brief meeting in which a drunk called him a loser, and the scarecrow reflected from "He is getting to know him, he is lost!". The scarecrow dumps the building, calls it "daddy-oh", and then cuts the poor man. We see how this amazing movie is developing. Then he kills many people. Mainly kills people who have worked hard on rl, and kills some random people, only for some laughter. He is not laughing here. It also adds punch to every kill. Each time he killed someone, he did several karate kicks and ended it with one of his signatures. In the case of someone who had hearing problems, he would say, "EAR maize!" Then push him in the ass. OR we can actually take an example from a movie! He just finished killing the cop and he was on his way to kill the only person who ever applied for him. Her father, the sheriff, shouted to the madman to stop him and he said, "Hey, stay a moment!" and threw him with a dagger, threw his chest and stuck him in some tree. At the end of the movie, he killed two guys and threw a punchline "I have to split up!" And killed two guys, pushing a scythe in their heads. Wowzors, this movie made me want to wear my pants so badly. Maybe next time this guy makes a movie, he will not be gay.
