It's a documentary, it's not, it's a filmed kind of a documentary, but I suspect it's just because they avoid trembling camera and suspicious filming. This was just released in the UK on DVD as a "American Pie comedy." It is not like that either. <br /> <br /> Basically it's about a group of teenagers in the spring break, when they drive to Mexico for cheap vodka and for the mission of getting a virgin friend there. Throw is a pair of dwarves, also performing the same type of quests, and you have a not too funny story about drunken teenagers trying to get a few girls. <br /> <br /> Given the grade 18, it has very little nudity, and virtually zero sex scenes, I mainly think that the rating is about cursing, which is a lot. <br /> <br /> If you like Jackass's primitive behavior without humor, it may be your thing, if you have some brain cells left I probably would have avoided it!
