I've probably seen bad movies in my life, but this one was so bad that I got mad at the theater. I wanted to get my money back. I wrote to the director asking him to return the cinema ticket, of course I have not received a refund (or even an answer), but that matters. On a scale of 1-10, I give this film -42. Why did the "Jeep" (Chevy Blazer ??) stop running from hitting the stick? Why did they hit the Jeep (Chevy Blazer ?????) with the stick in the first place instead of cracking the bum skull? The plot was thin, the film was filled with obvious clich√©s, and some of its parts simply did not make sense.
