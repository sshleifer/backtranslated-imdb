Great CGI effects and the truly Oscar-winning performance of Gary Sinise as Lieutenant Dan. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks is one of the tricks in this film, as he won an Oscar for Best Actor in the same year as Morgan Freeman was a crime. <br /> <br /> This movie is an incredibly nice love letter for the baby boomer generation, with barely hidden right-wing prejudices, from Forrest's Vietnam service to the "resolution" of Jenny in the end. <br /> <br /> Still, it is a very funny and American movie. I think that some parts of this movie are extremely offensive, Zemeckis fools this film almost to the level of Gump himself. . . Maybe that's what it was about. <br /> <br /> Watch this video and ask yourself: "What does Robert Zemeckis say about what makes a good American?" <br /> <br /> It seems that Forrest made the "right" choices and was in the "right place at the right time" for the last 45 years. Those who are wrong according to the director's vision seem to pay a high price. So does Zemeckis say that idiocy disguised as innocence and naivete is patriotic and even AMERICAN quality?
