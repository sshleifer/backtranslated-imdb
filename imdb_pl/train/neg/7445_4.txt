Extremely boring drama with the participation of the very young Roddy McDowall, who trains a wild horse, Flick from the title, and is the only reason for watching the film in the first place. Covered with blessed, overbearing music and overwhelmed by mad dialogue, this is one of those endless films that bother you with a headache. The pleasantly titled sequel "Thunderhead, Son of Flicka", in which McDowall trains the next generation of nudes, is marginally better than the original, but the pace remains slow, and the result still hits you, even though there are one or two scenes that do not cause a coma.
