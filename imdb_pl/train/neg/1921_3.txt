For some strange reason, the world of film is driven by fashion. Someone is making a movie about the killer's shark, and suddenly the oceans of the movie world are flooded with giant squid, deadly octopus and marine monsters of every kind. The man is persecuted by a former lover of hell, and every movie character is persecuted by a police officer from hell or a roommate from hell or a helper from hell. When a large Hollywood company produces large budget hits about tornadoes, other film producers follow fashion, and the fact that they do not have the budget to download it does not stop them. THE NIGHT OF TWISTERS is an example of this. What struck me in this TV movie is the fact that he is trying to hide his lack of budget by interrupting the breaks in commercials. Each time a tornado appears, the camara closes on the frightened expression of the actors, when they shout things like "Oh, my gawd, it's going this way" and "Run for your life". special effects budget. Unfortunately, the budget NIGHT OF THE TWISTERS should be raised to include better actors. The cast is not bad at all, but it is not impressive and they lack the ability to move a movie that is driven by the character. Where is Josh Hartnett and Elijah Wood when you need them? <br /> <br /> And the last word on the fact that it is a TWISTER clone ..... Yes NOTT was released a few months before TWISTER, but TWISTER was hiped for several months as the hit of summer 1996 and NOTT has a hasty feeling , which leads me to believe that it was produced and released to connect with the buzz around TWISTER
