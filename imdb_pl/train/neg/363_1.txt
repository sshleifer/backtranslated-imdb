what ends with the killing of this film is, among other things, his self-awareness. Here's a short list: 1. disrespectful behavior. when the beatles came and injected them with the brand of "bizarre, disrespectful" behavior / humor, he was greeted as fresh. it was over 4 decades ago. jump it. <br /> <br /> 2. false sophistication. throwing out a base, quasi-socio-political-isms is a difficult base of comic work. ask woody allen. <br /> <br /> 3. Postmodern "I am hard in this false world and yes, I recognize it in myself" snake them alone - used as an illustration with another animal in the film itself! - it is retreaded. <br /> <br /> 4. smarmy, happy with myself. <br /> <br /> 5. Amateur writing, acting, direction ... Have you ever seen student films? the victim of myself, the only thing I can say is positive, is that she has at least a sense of self and shame, now I fall into a self-reflective thing that she considers valuable and valuable. br /> <br /> but towards ... what? in the end it just sounds as empty as any other pretentious song - hey, have you ever seen Woody Allen in bergman, or "Interiors" ??? Well, it just makes it more amateurish.
