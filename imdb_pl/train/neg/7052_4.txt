God, this movie was so boring, except for the music that I really loved, that is, what was the point in making this movie. Anyone who reads this review does not watch this movie, it is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Emraan can work, but he was really pathetic. In this movie I'm really ashamed to be one of his fans, especially in this movie, it was really bad. <br /> <br /> Celina is another pretty face with no talent, what ever, can not work at all, and there was no point in being in this movie, like another girl, Radha, everything's fine, but it could be better. <br /> <br /> what a waste of time. buy great music and do not watch this movie.
