As they can from Joe Don Baker (as Bufford Pusser in the first sequel) to Bo Svenson (as Bufford Pusser in the second part of the sequel). Why did they do it? "It did not change because the first sequel was Joe Don Baker as Bufford Pusser and that's one of the things I wanted to see in the second part. <br /> <br /> I would give this film 7 out of 10 and give it 1 in 10 if history had nothing to do with Bufford Pusser's life, but it happened and that's why I gave this movie 3 out of 10. <br /> < br /> I strongly suggest that anyone who plans to watch this cheese, suggest not to watch the first sequel.
