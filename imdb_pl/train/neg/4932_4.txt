Silent Night, Deadly Night 5 is the last of the series, like part 4, is not related to the first three, except for the title and the fact that it is a Christmas horror story. <br /> <br /> With the exception of being unaware that something is going on here ... Mickey Rooney plays Joe Petto on him, and his terrifying son's name is Pino. Calling, someone? One evening a little boy named Derek heard a knock on the door and opened it to find a present for him on the doorstep. Although he said "do not open until Christmas," he starts opening it, but he is stopped by his father, who scolds him and sends him to bed and opens the gift himself. Inside there is a small red ball that grows on the shoulders and head of Santa Claus, and kills Dad. Oops, maybe he should have left alone. Of course, Derek suffered an injury from the incident, because he watched him from the stairs, but he did not grow up to be the killer of Santa Claus, he just stops talking. <br /> <br /> A mysterious stranger is lurking nearby, who seems very interested in the toys Joe Petto does. We even see him buying a pile when Derek's mother takes him to the store to find a gift for him to get him out of trauma. And what exactly does this guy do? Well, we're not sure, but it seems that it takes these toys separately to see what causes them. He keeps his owner from eviction, promising him to pay him cash the next day and presents him with the toy "Larry the Larvae" for his child, but of course "Larry" is not a good toy and goes out of the box in the car and of course, well, things are not nice . <br /> <br /> Anyway, finally what happens to Joe Petto and Pino is obviously revealed, and like in old history, Pino is not a "real boy". Pino is probably even more agitated and rude because he suffers from "Kenitalia" (a smooth plastic crotch), which may explain his wrong ways. And the identity of the lurking stranger, and even a kind of happy ending, also reveals itself. Whee. <br /> <br /> Step up from part 4, but not much. Again, Brian Yuzna and Screaming Mad George are playing, so some decent special effects, but not enough to make it wonderful. A few leftovers from Part 4 are also spinning, like Clint Howard and Neith Hunter, but that does not really matter. In any case, I now see the whole series from my system. And now, if I could get some out of my brain. 4 out of 5.
