Many years ago, we went to the cinema with a friend and saw a horror movie that we think is good because John Cassavetes played in it. For the uninitiated, John Cassavettes was an actor, scriptwriter and director (married to actress Gena Rowlands), three times nominated for an Oscar, who wrote and directed many good low-budget movies, using his income as an actor to stay afloat. Until we see Inkubu, we do not understand that John Cassavetes's income comes from any movie that has been offered to him. If we knew what the movie was about before we saw it, we could avoid it altogether. But we did not leave. At that time, my friend and I jokingly pointed out that it was the worst film ever made. Honestly, this is not true. I saw a lot of poorly filmed movies on Friday nights at Cinemax (did I just say it loud?), Which is much worse than The Incubus. Almost every movie with Brian Bosworth is by definition a worse film than The Incubus. Certainly Santa Claus conquers Martians is a worse film than The Incubus. However, since then I have consistently used Incubus as a threshold below which I do not want to fall. Talking to this friend about the film I could see, I will always notice that he was better (or worse) than The Incubus. <br /> <br /> http://thevillagevideot.blogspot.com/
