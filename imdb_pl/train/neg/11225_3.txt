This documentary is a reconstruction of the last few years of Betty Page's career (Paige Richards). Tennessee tease was the most recognizable queen of pin-up ever. Her most remarkable work appeared in the 1950s and were fetish pictures, bondage and "girlish movies" of cat fights. Irving Klaw (Dukey Flyswatter) told Betty on his Movie Star News what to do in front of the camera. There were no nudity on famous photographs or "bachelor movies", but Klaw was accused of distributing obscene materials and ordered to destroy them to avoid prosecution. No wonder Betty had a cult at the height of her career. A neighborhood girl with black hair, blue eyes and an hourglass figure, dressed in fetish gear, has not been fascinated for decades. In the end, it was said that she was photographed more than Marilyn Monroe and gave way only to the most photographed image in the world, Elvis Presley. Betty Page will disappear and sacrifice your last years of religion. This movie could have been much better; but good enough to interest. <br /> <br /> Miss Richards is stunning in itself. Bra, panties, garter belt and hose do not harm her image. Also in the cast: Jaimie Henkin, Jan Strain, Emily Marilyn and Julie Simone. Remember that this movie can change your heart rate.
