This piece of dirt is practically impossible to imitate. The sound is nonsense, the image quality changes from bad to worse for good or bad! Things happen for no apparent reason that characters appear and disappear. Did the director suffer from massive brain injury during production? <br /> <br /> Poor film aside, history is nefarious, only ill evil Sh * t If you like rape, murder and self-mutilation, it's your right alley. And if simulated murder scenes are not enough, you can enjoy the clips of real people that are being performed. I watched almost everything, but I had to turn off after I saw someone flew out of the brain. I've never seen a movie that would make me feel so embarrassed and dirty.
