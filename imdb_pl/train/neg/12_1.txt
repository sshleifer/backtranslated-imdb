The only thing I could think about while watching this movie is the B class slop. Many people spoke about its salutary quality, namely how this film presents such a realistic representation of the effects of drugs and the individual, and then their spiral into a self-feeding state of unfortunate events. However, the techniques actually used (as many have already mentioned) have been abused, and therefore unconvincing and irrelevant to the whole film. <br /> <br /> As for the story, it was weak, unimaginable, unbelievable and intricate. You can read most of the other reports on this movie and they'll say almost the same as me. <br /> <br /> Admitted that some actors and actresses are attractive, but in the face of such a boring action ... it seems that so far, carry a movie. The action is poor and interrupted: a few blows to be cast here and there and the last shooting at the end. There's really nothing to write about. <br /> <br /> As others have said, "BAD" movies are great to watch for the same reason that they are "bad", you enjoy this fact. However, this movie is not valid. That `s nothing. <br /> <br /> In addition, if someone really needs an educational film to scare people away from using drugs, I would seriously recommend many other movies that contain such problems in a much more effective way. "Requiem for sleep", "Trainspotting", "Fear and disgust in Las Vegas" and "Candy" are just a few examples. Although you should also check out some more light films on the same subject, such as "Go" (generally, both serious and funny) and "Halfbaked". <br /> <br /> Finally, one of the redeemable lines in this movie, released by Vinnie Jones, was stolen from "Lock, Stock and Two Smokling Barrels." Thinking that some of this wonderful movie has been tainted by "Loaded" is vile. <br /> <br /> Generally, I suggest you save your money and your time by NOT seeing this movie.
