I must admit that there are a few books with the relevant movies that I read before watching the cinematic adaptation. Nineteen Eighty-Four is one of those rare cases. The book was great. It was engaging and interestingly prophetic. But the film is simply useless. This is the worst movie I've ever seen. The only reason I did not turn it off after the first 5 minutes was because watching the movie was half of a two-piece class task. It was dark and grotesque, but it did nothing to achieve the right atmosphere. Acting was nothing above average, and given the fact that there was not much to play, it was very disappointing. The book, for example, did not give me the impression that Winston could not exclude more than one syllable at once. A boring, disturbing and visually unattractive movie completely absorbed the book. Wait ... Is not it British?
