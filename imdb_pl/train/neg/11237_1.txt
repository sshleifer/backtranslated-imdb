I went to see this movie with low expectations, but hoping that I would be charmed by my hometown in the film. Unfortunately, that's all I have. The story covers well-known territory (meeting in high school), but the story is complex, and the supernatural element adds little to this well-known topic. Although the quality of the game was generally good, the content of the movie was terrifying. The sexuality of the film was glaring - women apparently are unfulfilled, unless they are married, procreative or both (although this was defined as a post-feminist choice). Racism was even worse - a penetrating Jewish mother, a black man who still lives at home - and unjustified cruelty (tormenting a class maniac). We should be ashamed if these figures are believed to represent the inhabitants of the city of Kalamazoo, and writers should be afraid that they have introduced such broad and cruel stereotypes.
