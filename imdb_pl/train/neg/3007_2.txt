Well, during an endless search for a horror movie, we come across this movie that was recently released on DVD recently for some ungodly reason. The transfer is terrible and the quality sucks. I do not think this is due to a bad remaster or anything else. I just think that the movie is badly made. <br /> <br /> Of course, filmed in an abandoned school with a budget that was undoubtedly wasted on cheap beer and without talent, "Slaughter High" starts slowly and does not gain momentum until an hour. First, we see a "nerd" as the group chooses him ... Actually, you do not even know who they were ... jockeys? The leader, with his ultra-hooked, is so ugly that he should have been cast as a gull. Then there is a "big guy" and some stupid losers and chicks to be "hot", but they are not. It is a mystery why this group of the rejected chooses one of them, but I suppose that the viewer must assume that they are "cool kids" dweeb. Choosing the casting is frightening, because most high school students play thirty people. As other reviewers have noted, the actors (if you can call them that) are a bunch of Britons whose accents elude many times throughout this shit. It remains to be assumed that this group of "children" was the only students in this school, because their "reunion" is only them in school, which, as it turns out, has been abandoned, it is only them. <br /> <br /> The killings are bad, gore is not great, and the script is like Scooby Doo with real people; lines like: "This place gives me creeps ..." and "Someone gives me a beer" are the most important ... Just not good. Skip this one, unless you are wasted with friends and you want to laugh at a real lame attempt to break in. If you want to see well, get the Bay of Blood Bavy 14 years earlier and much better. If you want to see a good BAD slasher, see "Just Before Dawn" or "The Burning". 2 in 10 children.
