Norman Maclean's story is a masterpiece; Redford's film is mediocrity. He adds the trivial scenes of Maclean brothers who are going through falls, and their double dates in a seedy bar that is not even mentioned in history. A cipher, Brad Pitt, trying to play the charismatic Paul Maclean, a genius outside, turns out to be either risky or depressing, depending on what the original story has for you. Some casting scenes are beautiful. Also Tom Skerritt as a father and Craig Sheffer as Norman are strong and male, as men were once expected. None of the women makes an impression on the film, which is deplorable because Maclean loved women in his story and made it bright, even poetic.
