Do you know when you look at your collection of old videos recorded on video and you realize that there are ones that you only saw once or twice and do not remember if they are worth the time to see them? The Alibi is / was one of those movies; I found him recently and decided that I might as well give him a chance. I'm not entirely sure if I'm happy with my decision ... on the one hand, the movie is really, really bad, on the other hand, now I have another free tape ... yes, you understand. The plot is predictable and is not in any way original. Stimulation is bad. Acting is bad, but this is not surprising, because the two heroes are the former stars of the soap opera ... they are used to being abused. Characters are poorly written stereotypes. The film manages to even spoil the easiest way to impress me (through the movie): court scenes. Even these do not evoke any emotion behind or against any thin cardboard character. The film simply has no real advantages ... even the dialogue is bad. The thing is, it's so full of stereotypes that it's funny. And this is the only thing that raises this above the 1/10 mark: (though unintentionally yes) the comic relief of many stereotypes and stereotypes. I did not pay too much attention to the film, but every time I looked at the screen, it was something to laugh at. One last remark: I was considering using the "Tori Spelling" line as a summary in one line, but I think everyone knows that, so I decided to present because it is more informative. In conclusion, a completely bad movie, but not the worst, if you have nothing else to do and if it's on TV. Good for a few laughter, if you can sit through it. 3/10
