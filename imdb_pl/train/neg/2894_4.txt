I admit that the problem that I have with the known Ealing films I have seen so far can be mine. To my taste, either they are black and extremely funny, or so light that they are not satisfying as comedies or stories. This is a very important way of saying that I wanted to like "A man in a white suit", but I barely sat in his short time. <br /> <br /> The Sidney Stratton (Alec Guinness) textile worker may be humble but stubbornly strives to progress in the form of attempts to invent a piece of material that can not be broken or soiled. Using the factory laboratory in his latest experiment, he opposes both material and human limitations - the latter are dark mill heads who do not understand what he's talking about, and then they think and become even more involved in stopping him. br /> <br /> "These little minds, like yours, stand in the way of progress," complains Sidney, practicing in the mirror, trying to tell Man. <br /> <br /> One problem with "Man in a white suit" is that the vision of Sidney's progress is terribly small, and even more so than the vision of bosses or workers who also offend his work. My problem is more lively: for the comedy "White suit" is not funny. This is a rather serious scenario, which too often tries to bring out its weak attempts to humor from spits-ups, double-takes, triple-takes, and dizzy. <br /> <br /> The best joke is the sound of the machine Sidney struggles, walking "Bleep-Blop-Bleep-Bop" endlessly and pulling strange looks from each guest until Sidney does not get his miracle out of him or blow him up, trying. Like any other stray humor that works decently in this movie, it's too long. <br /> <br /> I've never seen Guinness less influenced by the movie, although it looks impossibly young and serious (though at the age of 30). It seems so bloodless, even more than the waxed general in which he played in "Doctor Zhivago." He is the same cold fish, regardless of whether he ignores sad feelings affecting the young girl who offers him savings in his life when he loses his job (pan-face Vida Hope as Bertha) or the more sensual charms of the young Daphne Birnley (Joan Greenwood), his only real ally in his fight against "shabbiness and dirt", as he puts it, making these words sound so sexy only Greenwood could. <br /> <br /> Supporting players make "White Suit" work as well as it does. Ernest Thesinger from the fame of "Bride Of Frankenstein" plays an extremely nasty captain of the industry, who looks like Nosferatu and laughs like a rattle of death. Howard Marion-Crawford as another factory leader is just as memorable here as he was playing in the flashing doctor in "Lawrence Of Arabia." There is also the undeniable charm of Mandy Miller as a little girl who steals her a few moments on the camera from everyone. <br /> <br /> But most of the scenes are played so simply that you could not think about the director Aleksander Mackendrick once worked on comedy (his previous comedy Ealing "Whiskey Galore" does not reverse this impression, unfortunately). The art of Roger MacDougall assumes that the notion of scientific progress is a potential disaster, but it does not depict boring Sidney in anything other than the most bland pleasant lights. <br /> <br /> Ealing comedies are remembered for capturing the human side of comedy. However, the Ealings that I have seen, they never do, they only work when they play aggressively against our own sympathies. "Kind Hearts And Coronets" and "The Ladykillers" (Mackendrick again, characters) are thus classics. The "white suit", on the other hand, is a senseless journey that falls apart when it should come into contact, just like this unfortunate suit.
