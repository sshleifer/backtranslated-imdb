It was not good. The characters were poorly developed, and the only personality was the memories from the previous movie, which contrasted with the "new" personalities (or their lack). I seriously thought that the opening scene was Ariel's nightmare, because it was absurd. It was serious. It reminded me of all annoying characters on the Disney channel - everyone is hyperactive, and history jumps from action to embarrassing scenes without any connection. <br /> <br /> The most disappointing part was the horrible songs - not catchy, not amazing. In the original, Ariel had an amazing and powerful voice, and the whole song is catchy and fun. You remember them and you want to sing them. But the songs in this movie were not the least creative; it is as if they were talking in an irritating, singing voice - quite weakly, disappointing. I do not have the feeling you want to sing, which you usually get from the Disney movie. <br /> <br /> It's like nobody wants to make this movie, so they barely try. . . this movie would require a new story, new catchy songs and more warmth and enthusiasm without annoying "looking at me! look at me! I am so annoying! "Mentality of this generation of Disney. : "(
