This movie is so unbelievably bad that I almost felt ill at being watching it. Until then, the other installments had at least one good thing. Part 1 was full of tension and bloody. Part 2 was unbeatable and fun. Part 3 was interesting with great effects. Part 4 had great music, good special effects and new entertainment Freddy Krueger. Part 5 is more boring than anything I've ever seen. Alice, a much nicer blonde from part 4, returned with her boyfriend Dan. In part, this supposed installment of Elm Street turns into a daily soap. Newer characters seem rough, and even this sweet Alice has a chip on her shoulder. Freddy seems completely out of this. He looks tired and does not seem to be so macabre. Its one-liners seem out of place and others, where, like in Part 4, can be quite fun. The story of Leslie Bohem never disappears, and the direction of Stephen Hopkins is so bad that my grandmother looks good! The whole story of this film is ridiculous and unreal. It is also confusing and quite stupid. Avoid part 5 at all costs!
