I never like to comment on a good movie, but when it comes to a bad movie, I have to take care of it. Speaking of Vivah, this guy, Sooraj Badjatya, lost him completely. After the success of Hum Aapke Hain Kaun thought that he could make money with bad wedding movies. Vivah is so tawdry that Badjatyas left Johars and Chopras. <br /> <br /> There was not a moment in the movie where I can say: "Oh! at least this thing is good. " Aloknath has a phrase in the role of a father, Shahid kapoor looks thick, and Shahrukhed, Amrita rao is another disaster in addition to ugly-looking sets, bad costumes, trite storyline, monstrous stepmother, difficult actors, cacoustic music in the background, cheap soundtracks. <br /> <br /> Now a spoiler, I am warning you that this is happening in all his other films, after the unfortunate movie ends with a happy note.
