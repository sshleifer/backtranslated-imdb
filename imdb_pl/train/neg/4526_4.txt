A rather stupid attempt at the thriller-mysterious type of Hitchcock, impossibly listing spying for archeology and based on Robin Cook's novel; By the way, I recently acquired another adaptation of his work - COMA (1978) - in honor of the late Richard Widmark. As a reminder, the director Schaffner just did THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL (1978) - a fanciful but much more intriguing lift and, unfortunately, SPHINX was a false step from which his impressive career would not have been successful. <br /> <br /> Despite its scope and quite decent cast, this turned out to be critical and commercial - mainly because the narrative is simply not too exciting: in fact it is quite gloomy (weak attempts of terror - heroine of archaeologist to endure burial rotting bodies and even bat blasts attack Lesley Anne-Down is a charming leading lady who has come across a lost treasure - in fact she was hidden by a local sect so as not to fall into the hands of foreigners who have appropriated the legacy of this country (under the pretext of culture) for too long Sir John Gielgud appears in an ungrateful moment at the beginning as an antiquarian who puts himself in the booty and pays for this "act of betrayal" with his life. <br /> <br /> It usually turns out that some characters are the opposite of what they claim to be - so that seeming allies (such as Maurice Ronet) are ultimately exposed as evil the actors, and the ambiguous character (Frank Langella, whom I saw in London in early 2007 in the West End performance of "Frost / Nixon", which has now been transformed into a movie, passes from Down's antagonist to her lover and back because she decides to keep wealth belonging to the Egyptian high priest Menephta as a national treasure.
