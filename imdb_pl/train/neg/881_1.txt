Thanks to the infamous home video distributor who introduced the so-called German independent series, Four For Venice is not only horrible but really terrible. So horrible that I abandoned them in the store with goods used for extra cash. <br /> <br /> Nick and Charlotte are a married couple who reached an agreement on sex only on Tuesday because of their hectic job plan. Eva and Luis are a couple of spouses who live by the mouth, where Eva works as a waitress and Luis, an artist. Nick indirectly causes Eva to lose her job as a waitress. Luis and Charlotte had an affair at the back of Eva and Nick. Luis betrayed Eva, lying to her and telling her he was going to London to do something related to his work, but the fact is that he is flying from Charlotte to Venice for adultery. Eva kidnapped Nick and dragged two children to Venice for a confrontation. A trip to Venice ends with Nick and Eva becoming each other. <br /> <br /> The presentation of a trip from Germany to Venice between Nick and Eva means the failure of the comedy. It does not just look senseless but also draggy. In the film, Nick tries to seek help in several ways, but ends unsuccessfully. Or strangers around him who act like morons, or are just stupid. <br /> <br /> Comedy also tended to add unnecessary scenes to extend the story. While some problems that can be solved with common sense, no one in the film uses common sense to solve the problem. They prefer to go through one large round to solve the problem. <br /> <br /> It's not so bad that even beautiful landscapes in Venice do not improve the movie's reputation.
