This movie is so bad that I can not believe it was actually filmed. People who voted 10, 9, 8 or even 7 are you crazy? Did we really watch the same movie? Or the same sh ** should I say. In this movie, everything is wrong. History (is there any history?) Nowhere is going, completely inconsistent, acting (some dialogues are just ridiculous), score (what is ****?), Editing, and especially the artistic direction, pure disaster. It reminds me of old films with the Macista ... To give an example of an amateur performance, the mermaid costume is a sleeping bag with sequins glued to it. I'm not joking, that's exactly it. <br /> <br /> Another example of the huge errors that we found here: you see in the scene an extra, fat woman about 200 pounds, who is talking about her cell phone. The next shot, which is in a completely different place, you can see the same woman still talking on a cell phone (!) Yes, it goes so far. <br /> <br /> Big, huge waste of money. Useless.
