I'm really shocked that a great director, like Chuck Jones, started making one of the most boring cartoons I've ever seen. I have not even laughed at this short one and this is the Bugs Bunny cartoon, for God's sake! Cartoons Bugs Bunny are always funny, not boring! Unfortunately, this short turns out to be Goodnight Elmer (another incredibly boring shortcut of Jones) with the addition of Bugs Bunny. <br /> <br /> The first warning sign of a boring cartoon is always the lack of gaga payouts. Goodnight Elmer was boring, because he was pulling the same two gags forever with a predictable payout. On the other hand, this cartoon is affected by the second caution sign of a boring cartoon: there is too much dialogue. The cartoon has at least two gags on the sleeve, but most of them seem longer than it is due to a huge padding of dialogue. At some point, Elmer finishes eating supper and comments: "It was an amazing awhoo good wamb," probably the most unnecessary dialogue I've ever heard in a cartoon (characters reading the text aloud in later Woody's cartoons does not count in my book). Although this cartoon has only 8 minutes, it seems that 20 thanks to unnecessary dialogue in this way. <br /> <br /> Elmer's Pet Rabbit was not a funny cartoon for me, but if you sold your soul to Chuck Jones and are not able to admit that he has directed several clusters in his career, you can enjoy it.
