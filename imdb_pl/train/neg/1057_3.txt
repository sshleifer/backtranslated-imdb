I'm sorry, I had high hopes for this movie. Unfortunately, it was too long, too thin and too weak to attract my attention. When I realized that the whole movie is about only an older guy who is going through his dream, I felt cheated. Certainly it could have been a device that brought us into something deeper, something more meaningful. <br /> <br /> So do not buy a big drink, because you'll run to the toilet. My children did not enjoy it either. Ah yes.
