This movie is indulgent garbage. Watch this video if you just want to hear Gaelic or enjoy a nice soundtrack. Watch out for another reason and you will be disappointed. He should be charming, but not - just annoying. Heroes are hard to care about, and acting is weak. The stories in the film are also graceless and sinister. I was expecting a family movie that would be nice, but it also did not appeal to my fourteen-year-old daughter. It's rare that I do not see the movie until it's over, but it got from both of us. <br /> <br /> Although the film is embedded in the present times, it has the appearance and character of a cheap Eastern European film made during the Cold War. Even beautiful Scottish scenery and cinematography are not enough to make it happen. A real shame because as a movie it's a pity for Scotland.
