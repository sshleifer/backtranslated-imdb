Marvin (Rob Schneider) has no ingredients to be a clay, which is his dream life. But his happiness changes when he crushes the car (very bad) and is found by the doctor. The doctor must use animal organs to rebuild it. After this moment, he begins to unknowingly behave wildly and becomes the best policeman. During this time, he realizes the changes and his animal instincts begin to take over his human side. In the meantime, he finds a charming girl and tries to be a perfect gentleman, which means that he must control himself and keep civilized. I'm not much fun with Rob Schneider. In fact, this is his first movie that I saw. However, I can easily say that he is the best person to play the loser. (See part of it at Ally Mcbeal, quite funny). There are several good parts in the film, such as his flirt with a goat. In such films the biggest problem is that the script makes the viewer feel less intelligent. I'm sure this movie is fine to watch until it's taken too seriously. But it's very sad that such films do very well at the box office. Animal is not the worst movie I've seen so far, but it does not reach more than *.
