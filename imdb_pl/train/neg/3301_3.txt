The standard procedure for Swedish films seems to be to start believing through the window and continue this path to the end of the process. RÃ¥narna is another great example of a movie that makes very little sense. <br /> <br /> Banks in Stockholm are robbed by a highly effective "military" band of robbers. Two policemen are starting to investigate the matter, which soon becomes more complicated than initially. <br /> <br /> As usual in the Swedish film, the cast consists mainly of the same people you've seen over and over again. Mikael Persbrandt must be in every Swedish film from the last few years! But that's okay, unless Persbrandt is one of the few that appears solidly here (as usual). The problems with this movie are mainly related to the story itself. First of all, seizures are usually similar to the background. It is rather a film about a young policewoman struggling to prove herself in the masculine world (this has not been done a thousand times before with a decent actress instead of Sofia Helin). There is also an incredible twist of action near the end, which seems as probable as the alien landing. But still, I thought it was quite a nice accent, considering I was half asleep at the time. It seasoned a bit (and actually saved the rating before the next step). <br /> <br /> In the end the main problem is the same as in most other Swedish films of this type. It's just action and tension that does not meet the standards we're used to with other such films (mainly Hollywood). In comparison, it seems cheap and rather weak. In my opinion, Swedish filmmakers should try to focus more on the plot and acting and forget about attempts to create a "Hollywood light", as now. Because it becomes another one forgotten by the Swedish film industry. I rate it on 3/10.
