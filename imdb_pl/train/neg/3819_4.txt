T.Z. Post, a college professor, receives a fake letter stating that he inherited $ 750,000. Now, thanks to financial means, he withdraws his life savings of USD 4,000 and decides to leave and live in the end. After sending his luggage to Chicago, he meets a traveling vandalism tandem and decides that he only needs to put on Broadway. On the night of the concert, poor prof. Post must hide from the creditors, settle the misfortunes between Pansa's girlfriend and the delightful Diva Eleanor, and yet make sure that the program must last. After seeing Keaton's many silent jewels, this one is difficult to navigate, but I felt that it could have been much worse. Supporting the cast of Durante, Todd and Selwyn are sometimes annoying, but still they like it. Pre-Charlie Chan Toler is good as a frustrated director. 90% of the script is badly written, because MGM tries to convey it as a Marx Bros. movie in which many eye gags fall from the beginning. Developed at this time with problems with drinking Keaton, this movie is just a sad moment in Buster's life. Rating - 3.
