Unfortunately, poor Hamlet. I knew him, dear reader, and let me tell you, THE DRESS VERSION! I do not know who from among all the people has spent money on this flotsam, but I hope that they are proud of themselves. They took classical art and turned it into the most boring melodrama imaginable. This version is literally so bad that even the presence of a great thespiana, like Maximilian Schell in the title role, can not save him. The only advantage of this movie is that it was a great material for "MST3K"; Mike, Servo and Crow had a great time with it. <br /> <br /> But anyway, I'm sure Shakespeare, if he lived, when they did, he would not want his name to be related to it. This "Hamlet" is not even that bad, it's good; it's just bad. Absolutely terrible.
