The phrase of a warrior who is shaken by the shell of a soldier is boring here. It is a shame that a great cast, operating within the limits of their high talents, can not buy back the Soldier's Return because of the rigid, inability to transfer the viewer to emotional engagement. The best moments, as another reviewer noted, come when Glenda Jackson is on the screen; but even Jackson's creaking movie power can not pull the chestnuts out of the film from a cold, never-heated hearth. Ann-Margret, known for her sexual kitten and too often accused of lack of acting, wasted her real and rather profound ability here - even though she speaks with an almost faultless Middlesex accent. Stunning note, smelling of many flaccid emotional emotions of the TV miniseries, has an annoying chance of emotional rejection of the scenario, blocking and excessive formalism of the direction; with the exception of the score and the shortened script and direction, "The Return of the Soldier" has all the right elements, but it does not make them work together.
