You must tell Steven Seagal: regardless of his other flaws, he has good taste for women. If you choose a Seagal movie, chances are that there will be one or more very beautiful women in it. Usually they do not work like ordinary sweets; engage in action and fight, shoot with weapons, kill knives, etc. "Flight of Fury" offers Ciera Payton duo (who has a very sexy face, with juicy lips to fit Angelina Jolie) and Katie Jones finds time to engage them both in fight with cats, as well as small lesbian caresses! And if it seems to me that I spend some time talking about them, it is because the rest of the movie, although it is possible to survive, is so unexpected that it is hard to say much more. Ironically, the weakest aspect is probably Seagal himself, who looks like he can not even try to pretend that he cares. He is a military-type activist, in which there is very little fighting and he does not fit his role (pilot of a hidden fighter, of course "the best in the world"), which may explain his almost insulting sleepwalking.
