A movie about Vixen (Erica Gavin) who has a husband from Mountie whom he loves ... but he also loves sex! During the film, he gets a lot of men in bed - including her husband and brother! There is also a (tamed) lesbian sequence. <br /> <br /> This movie put Russ Meyer on the map and was (I believe) the first critically acclaimed X-rated movie in history. It was a big hit when it came out. Unfortunately, this is not a good date. <br /> <br /> It's well-directed, and Erica Gavin is just great (whatever happened to her), and she was VERY colorful ... but by today's standards she's very tame. I am surprised that she now has NC-17 rating - no hardcore sex and only a topless woman and no male nudity at all. Also (unfortunately) it is quite boring, and the addition of a policy at the end was misleading (and quite stupid). However, it is worth looking at what in 1968 was considered very shocking. Apparently I saw a cut version (which has an R grade) but I only heard a few seconds here and there. <br /> <br /> Meyer's next film "Beyond the Valley of the Dolls" is much better and it dates VERY well. Instead, catch it.
