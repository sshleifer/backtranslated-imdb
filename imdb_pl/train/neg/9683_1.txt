I give this pretentious piece of rubbish simply because I do not believe that there is a worse movie in the world. <br /> <br /> I hate this movie, I hate acting, dialogues, set design, writing and leadership. I hope that all who have been involved in this movie are burning and rotting in the darkest circle of hell. <br /> <br /> Shit, this disgusting waste of time. <br /> <br /> I pray every day that this movie is just a figment of my imagination. I pray that I will have a dream, and that I will never have to watch it in <br /> <br /> my local video store. <br /> <br /> SMOKE IN HELL
