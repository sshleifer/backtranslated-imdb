I remember seeing this cartoon when I was 6 or 7 years old. My grandfather picked up her video for free at the mall. I remember that it really sucked. The plot did not make sense. I hated fox, who became a friend of Kacper. He was so stupid! Casper tilted his head if he could not find a friend. So what? End with it! The only good part I do not want to sound exciting when the fox was shot and died at the end. I laughed with courage because the cartoon sucked so much. The bad news is that the fox revives and becomes a ghost. It is a pity that he did not remain dead. I think I even gave this video to someone because I hated it. No wonder they offered them for free at the mall. If you have a child, do not let them see it. They'll probably agree with me that it sucks.
