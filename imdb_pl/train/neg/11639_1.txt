SPOILERS: I am always surprised how many people have given this game good reviews. That was awful. The script and the voice itself ruined it. Gabriel and Grace are the most unlike characters in the game. You are almost praying for their death. And worst of all, there are fewer vampires in this game than werewolves in The Beast Within. <br /> <br /> The lack of real vampires was incredibly disappointing. If you expect some vampire history in the style of Anne Rice, forget about it. The story of this game has little to do with vampires. You will not even see any to the end, and even then you will not be able to fight them. <br /> <br /> The story has radical and almost blasphemous views on Christianity. I'm amazed that he got off the drawing board. I'm not even a Christian and I found it offensive. The story focuses mainly on searching for the Holy Grail and buried treasure. Kidnapping a royal child who should be a target really gets pushed aside. Gabriel does not need to find the child urgently. In fact, he hardly ever asks anyone about the child after the first time blocks. <br /> <br /> The graphics are very bad. The heroes move at a snail's pace, even in the best systems. They are thick and outdated. And it's hard to go from FMV The Beast Within to this horrible Blood of the Sacred game engine. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Gabriel and Grace is also terrible. I really do not know why it was so much in a hurry, but they sleep together. And it is not fun. Gabriel spends most of the game telling his best friend Mosely how he thinks of Grace as a sister and does not think she is the only one for him. And it seems that he really was worried that they were sleeping together. But it's so unlike yourself in the whole game that you hardly care. His dialogue was the worst in the game. And he kept making stupid sexual insinuations in every feminine game. At the end of the game, Grace leaves him with a letter that seems to be dear John. It seems to me that she was as tired as most players. <br /> <br /> I find this story annoying and boring. I expected to play a story about a royal child who was kidnapped by vampires. And I expected to see and fight vampires, maybe even have Gabriel or Grace in one. But no. Instead, history has focused on the distorted vision of the author's Christianity. What a pity. Here they had elements for a great adventure, and instead got it. <br /> <br /> For me, the only interesting parts of the game were at the very end. At the end, we receive several action-style puzzles. But it was not worth suffering throughout the game to get to them. <br /> <br /> I can not really recommend this game. I regained it when it came out, years ago, and I hated the game engine so much that I put it away for years. I recently vacuumed him to see what I missed. And I'm really sorry that I did it. My favorite characters were ruined. I hope that it will be the fourth game to realize the series. And I hope that the next time everything will work. It would be a terrible shame to finish the series with this part.
