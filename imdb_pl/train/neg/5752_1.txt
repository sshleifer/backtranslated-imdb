I usually do not comment, but there are things that need to be said. Where to start ... <br /> <br /> Acting as Jeremy London was terrible! I did not think it could be so bad. The story could be good if it was well-directed, and also a good solid performance of the main actor. Unfortunately, this is one of those movies you read about and you think it has great potential for entertainment, but you can be disappointed from the very beginning. <br /> <br /> Well, at least I liked it. If I were you, I would not waste my time.
