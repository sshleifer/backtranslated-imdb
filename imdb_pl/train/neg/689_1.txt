What is it ........... Undoubtedly it must be the biggest loss of film, settings and camera. I know that you can not set your expectations for the superiority of the eighties, but it is too stupid to be true. I managed to get this movie for $ 0.89 and I still feel the urge to return money. Can you imagine who is STINKS? <br /> <br /> Who is the brutal killer in this film and what are his motivations ??? Actually, you could not care less. But why? The creators of this piece of rubbish certainly do not care. They did not try to create a bit of tension. The director (Stephen Carpenter - it's probably easier to find money with that name) also made Kindred (1986) rather pleasant and recently he did Soul Survivors. Fill the nonsense too, but at least she had Eliza Dushku. This trash has the debut of Daphne Zuniga !!! (Who ??) Yes, that's right, Melrose Place staff. Her very memorable character dies about 15 minutes. after the initial subtitles. He is the second person who will die. The first victim dies directly in the first minute, but no one seems to remember or miss him later, so who cares? The rest of the actors ... do not deserve the term "actors", they are completely uninteresting. You hope that they will die quickly and painfully ... and not just their characters. <br /> <br /> My humble opinion = 0/10
