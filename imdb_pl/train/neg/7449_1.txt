A very disappointing version of Lorna Doone. Too many missing characters, no romantic scenes, no changes in the story, too short, there was a low budget. Few dialogues to understand history if you do not know the story. In some scenes it looks like Lorna has herpes on the upper lip. I'm sure the makeup is best to hide. I think they did not want to stop pictures until it healed, it's a pity. Most likely, this is why the film was missing kissing scenes. Only one disappointing kissing scene at the very end. Lorna Doone is a wonderful epic tale that must be told the truth. The Lorna Doone version of 2000 is twice as long, more romantic, much more pleasant and more faithful to the book.
