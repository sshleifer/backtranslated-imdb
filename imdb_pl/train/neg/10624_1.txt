In another good review, loleralacartelort7890 says: "The truth is that Americans use a secret aluminum-anti-radiation alloy. This is not so well known. The exact specifications are a secret. why would they reveal it then? If in a space race with the Russians, it would be VERY stupid to reveal that they have a new technology that could protect the crew from radiation. This is completely wrong. There is (and was) a "secret" of radiation protection in Apollo. The design and construction of the Apollo control module has been publicly available for a long time. It uses a light "honeycomb" of aluminum and stainless steel. The entire outer surface (except of course the windows) is covered with a thermal protector made of phenolic resin, thicker on the bottom, which faces forward during re-entry. These materials are in fact * better * in stopping the type of radiation we have in space (charged particles) than lead, which is better suited for stopping ionizing photons, such as X-rays and gamma rays. <br /> <br /> Cosmic radiation is a definite problem for * long-term * space flight due to the risk of large solar flares. But that was not a serious threat to Apollo astronauts. The command module provided them with fairly good protection during their short (half an hour) passage through the Van Allen belts. Everyone wore dosimeters, so we know exactly how much radiation they received: no more than 1.5 rema, and usually much less. Of the 24 men who recommended to the moon (of which 12 landed), 18 are still alive. Only two died of cancer: Alan Shepard (leukemia) and Jack Swigert (bone cancer). The rest died of a heart attack, pancreatitis (Roosa) and a motorcycle accident (Conrad). These are actually pretty good statistics for a group of men who is 70 (Shepard would be 86).
