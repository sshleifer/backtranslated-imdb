This is the first time I have seen a movie with Jamie Foxx and I bet it will be my last. I could not understand why he was funny, although people in the audience thought it was very funny when he made a face to the camera or saying, "I'm going to take a shower." <br /> <br /> the plot is completely predictable. A bad guy comes for a good guy. A good guy has a woman, so a bad guy uses her. In the meantime, the officials have screwed up. The last scenes are unbelievable. You spend 2 years and millions of dollars chasing a guy, but you do not do your homework to solve a trivial puzzle? <br /> <br /> There is no big acting, there is not much plot or story, and shooting is done in the style of MTV. Do not waste your money on this one. <br /> <br />
