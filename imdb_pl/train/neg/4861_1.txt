In the heyday of the '90s (the soul rests on the soul), you can turn on the great Central Comedy at any time of the day and see the greatest sketch of the comedy of all times Saturday Night Live. What a glorious program that was, whether it was the original Not-Ready-for-Primetime Players or the second Golden Age of SNL, in which they performed wonderful - Chris Farley, Adam Sandler, David Spade ... and then everything went to hell. For the first time I was exposed to MadTV about a year and a half ago and I think I had to pass out. How can such a terrible show survive for so long? There are so many terrible flaws. I suppose I'll start with writing. In most of the letter is terrible. It's nothing but humor in the pre-school bathroom. The cast is mostly without talent. There are some sketches that I liked, such as some of Mrs. Swan and Stuart, and there are several talents in the show, such as the great Alex Borstein. Phil LaMarr is a talented actor, not a comedian. Although there are a few rare ha ha moments, they are not enough to redeem this endless line of horrible nonsense inhabited by babbling idiots. I miss this.
