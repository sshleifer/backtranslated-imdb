characters on a rip off without depth. You've seen all the characters from other movies, I promise. the script tries to be sharp and unbearable, but it fails. throws himself in a hangover, he meets with a super-comedy comedy, but jokes come out of the left field, completely forced and are almost completely disgraced. the hot chick is old and has no personality, she is just a blonde from the early thirties with a few wise assholes, no panties, dressed in jokes, which is less than endearing. the attraction between Molly (hot rod) and Kirk (dorky's interest) is hardly communicated. attraction in any place where you can find its completely platonic relationship, until there is an awkward and predictable kiss on the seat belts. the afer is fully in the relationship and is simply unbelievably bad. the main goal of this movie is not a relationship, but an unsuccessful attempt to make a sharp super-evil movie with a semi-attractive story. I could compare it to a hangover, in its forced nature. I will not go into it. I can go on, but it is simply pointless. just do not pay to see this movie.
