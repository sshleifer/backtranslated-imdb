Despite several exciting (and bold) sequences, NBTN simply never moves. There are exploding boats, high-stakes murders, mass suicides, pathologists with body parts and all kinds of classic scenes with mystery / horror, but they are intertwined with long periods of pure exposure. Everyone in the movie looks bored. It is a shame, because many sequences would be considered bold at the time when it was filmed. <br /> <br /> Add to this "too appropriate" British characters and feel that you fell into the Sherlock Holmes movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, the pictures are very ordinary. There are many opportunities for beautiful shots of the village or complex shots of someone caught in a huge bonfire, but the whole thing is unimaginable and boring. <br /> <br /> Definitely only for Lee and Cushing fans.
