I can not describe how scary this movie is. Am I the only one here who thinks his animated totally disgusting? The Men of Rohan look 100% false with their faintly colored hair that does not even come close to what the actors look like. Orcs looked terrible. Why is gandalf going with bad flaccidity? Why can not they pronounce things correctly? Saruman is not Aruman. There were others that sounded like the terrible pronunciation of Tolkien's sp signs. Everyone, enjoying the studio that did it, pulled out the sequel plug, it was just terrible horrible adaptation. Go and watch a cartoon of the Hobbits to see a better cartoon of Tolkien's work. Hell, even the cartoon version of ROTK is better than this dribble. 2/10
