Cheezy action movie starring Dolph Lungren. Lungren is a one-time military man who retired to teaching work. But the changes in the neighborhood and the student's body made him frustrated and decides to suspend the connection. Things become risky when, while supervising a group of students in custody, some robbers take over the school as an operational base for an armored car attack. His battle with enemies in the fight to the death. The jaw returns to exploitation films from the late era of the grindhouse, where bad guys dressed up as punks and some bad women have a sparkle of hair. What a stupid movie. I can not believe that people did it this way, it is an action movie that was probably doomed to failure, before low budget, false escape sets and poor direction were even a flash in the eye of the producer. Watch how late in the movie, when the cars pass through the school (do not ask), collide with the safety turret (do not ask, because it looks more like a prison than high school) and smash its barely constructed form (it does not look like in previous photos ). What did the gods of bad movies do? Actually, I'm embarrassed because he directed (?) Sydney J Furie, a really good director who made films like The Boys in C. Did his skills fail him, or was he hopeless from the beginning and did not even bother? It's a turkey. You can watch it, but still turkey.
