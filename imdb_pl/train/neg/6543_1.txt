The nineties began to appear in daily conversations that grow to the left and right. Each network had one and all of them lacked one thing Originality. Ricky Lake is another entertainment program for an obese mother from a trailer park with a Marlboro cigarette hanging on her lips while breastfeeding one of her dozens of toothless, illiterate children. The English language and other cornerstones of humanity, ruined by this, indicate existence. Titltes, starting with Girl you and Pigeon Head and so on. How could anyone want to see this clean and complete rubbish? Did our society really become nothing more than a cluster of hill-fathers and a dead rhythm? The people who appeared in this program are Trash. People who watched this program were rubbish. Anyone who wants to see this program on air or put on DVD is TRASH. People wonder why Americans are becoming huge stacks of lard and too fat to get a job, and this type of show tells them that they can be overweight 500 kg and have 12-year-old girls behaving like prostitutes. Having such trash on TV ruined morality.
