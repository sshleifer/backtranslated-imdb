Almost in the same league as the rather cruel Yonfana Color Blossoms, Spider Lillies leads a turning point to your home, thanks to which you can create innovative cinema without edges or to a large extent on the way to cutting. This is a Taiwanese film, which nowadays is becoming an innovation at an alarming rate, but more than this tidbit, we can find little worthy of attention. <br /> <br /> You should know that apparently Spider Lillies is also a lesbian story, but in all respects it is just a trick of plastic to lure easily seduced and gullible. In a few respects here we have a replay of the recent edition of Taiwan Eternal Summer. Then homosexuals began to treat myopia, now we have the same with women. Zero Chou presents, for your nonexistent building, a story that can excite a maximum of 15 years old. They managed to cope with a certain attitude of the art house, but in the end it results in the most ridiculous, simply uninteresting getaway. <br /> <br /> The angle of Hong Kong takes the form of Isabella Leung (Bug Me Not, Isabella, Diary), here with its most butch look. Although she liked her previous job a bit, Isabella in Spider Lillies is apathetic and is missing in most departments. Either her heart was gone, or the whole lesbian dramatic play did not appeal to her sensitivity. <br /> <br /> She is doing a tattoo artist in Taipei who is shy, lonely and responsible for a younger brother with a mental disability, played by John Shen, who gratefully admits to the film the unique program of redemption associated with this area . Isabella's character, strangely named Takeko, but apparently from Hong Kong, soon falls into dissatisfied youth Jade (Rainie Yang from the affectionate Meteor Garden). The latter lives with her grandmother and has a whole list of complaints due to leaving her parents and life in general. Sure, the grandma's component works well and touches, but otherwise Jade as a heroine is just as unimpressed as her counterpart Takeko. <br /> <br /> Two women share the past and a lot of inadequately covered anger, with Jade working as a webcam girl, while Takeko upholds his father's legacy with a unique tattoo adorned on the spider's shoulder. Jade also wants to get the same project, which leads to the fact that Takeko discovers the internal feelings of the problem using retrospection and a rather minimal discourse with courageous Jade. <br /> <br /> Well, if there is no question of writing a home base, or at least the ratio is unforgettable? In a word, no. They kiss and pretend to be nasty at the end, but just as Eternal Summer has reminded us recently, there is a gulf measured by light years between showing sexual content and making ticket buyers think they will soon see sexual content. > <br /> This cynical building of expectations seals the fate of Spider Lillies. Thanks to the poor history, acting and the general lack of relics that can be taken to the theater, this one kind of makes Flower Color look good, think about it. At least we got a little bit of Teresa Cheung. No, Spider Lillies is not a masterpiece of AV and should be removed from the playlist of even the most mundane and timid GLB film festival. <br /> <br /> Amazingly for pseudo-indie, even the soundtrack and photos do not give moments of inspiration. That's as good as it makes moving to Spider Lillies a lot easier. Believe us, avoid this and not miss anything good. <br /> <br /> Rating: * *
