Men, do you love police movies full of action, shooting, racing etc. <br /> <br /> Boy, was I disappointed after watching this short and unsatisfying movie. We've seen it before, the hostages, the bank, the neighborhood ... And yet two bad people who shot down many officers and innocent people who just stay on the firing line - not getting hit by Kevlar. br /> <br /> Not just a few pictures, no, hundreds of photos. Returning to the bank, where stupid hostages did not close the safe or door when the villains left. Like a stupid director, he thought we would. <br /> <br /> Okay, the photos between this fake documentary were good, but after watching the movie I came up with the idea: why did not the police get a decent shooting course? And why are there so many cops and SWATs for a really long break. Very bad.
