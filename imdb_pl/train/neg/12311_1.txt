I know I have already added a comment, but I just wanted to explain something ... <br /> <br /> I'm not an old foggy boy from the Baby Boom generation who grew up stuck to the glittering picture of Phil Silvers, Jackie Gleason etc. <br /> <br /> Bilko was 20 before I was born, but I had the pleasure of discovering Bilko Phil Silver courtesy of BBC2. I wonder if I would enjoy the parody of Steve Martin if I had not seen or heard about Phil Silversie - I do not know - maybe I would. <br /> <br /> Some of the other reviewers think this movie is worth "10" admit that they did not see the original. I can only persuade you to spend 21 minutes of your life watching one episode. If, after watching the original Ernie, Colonel Hall, Ritzig and Emma, ​​Duane Doberman, Henshaw, Dino, Flashman, Zimmerman, Mullin and others, you still think that Steve Martin's movie is something above "2" - I'll let you know half a pint ... ..
