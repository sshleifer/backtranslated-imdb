I have a question for those who have thought about this idea. Why? Which prompted them to make the second film. If the memory serves, did not Cinderella end with the words "Everyone lived happily ever after?" I'm pretty sure it was, or it was suggested. Wait a minute, if everyone lived happily ever after, how could it be a continuation? Unless they tried to create the most boring history in history, there would be no continuation. I mean, probably, they could have Cinderella sing nonsense for two hours, but why? A film that ends "happily ever" can not have a continuation; if that happens, they do not live happily ever after! Something must go wrong, which causes problems with the first termination! Why? It's not right, it's bad. This is my last word in this matter.
