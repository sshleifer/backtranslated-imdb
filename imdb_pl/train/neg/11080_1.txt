You must love poor low-budget movies. This contains a set of bad effects, props and bad actions (really bad). Besides, every time I see a Mercedes McNab (sister), I still think "Look out! She is a vampire! "- for those who know Buffy / Angel. <br /> <br /> A great example of what happens when someone with bad taste and wants to waste money, making a quick move, a little issued of course. I do not know if I am more sorry about the author of the film or the producer who has not recovered any money. <br /> <br /> I would say that it is good for small children in its simplicity, but I do not know if I would like to submit this child ... <br /> <br /> umm ... 1/10, because This is the lowest.
