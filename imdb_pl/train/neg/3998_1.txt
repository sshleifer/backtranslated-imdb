Can you say, "All shock, no conspiracy?" In this film there were many unexplored directions. There was no history of peace other than death. * WHY * was it bad? What happened? Why counting down the "hour"? Then uncharted things appeared; for example * we saw * a camera in the breather he mentioned. But when he climbed this hole, there was no camera. <br /> <br /> And what about the fact that all the ghosts looked "digital" and things "blinked" before they hit the ground, generating static noise? Hmmm ... when you combine all * those * things, room 1408 will look like a ghostly house. Only that there were no further actions. <br /> <br /> Oh ... by the way ... electronics do not work in 1408. Well, except for the TV ... the cell phone has no signal, but the wireless internet is working properly. How much can you add discontinuities? I'm sorry but this movie was just a "shock after shock". It was all done before. Reflections in the mirror. Things outside of the site. Change of images. Bleeding walls. "Oh, it was just a dream ... no, it was not." And if the room was "bad," why did our main character come to terms with the death of his daughter if he had trapped him forever? It just did not make sense. <br /> <br /> In addition, there was no information on the "first book" he wrote. Just vague information about "dad was a jerk" and so on. Speaking of fathers, what was it about his father? "You will be at my place". <br /> <br /> Overall, really HORRIBLE movie. It was a 100% adrenaline shock factor, with no new or innovative effects, and certainly no history, character development, etc. <br /> <br /> The overall impression is that the whole movie was made on "Cheap"; almost with just one set and a few location shots, and it was just a movie with recycled effects, tacky, "seen before".
