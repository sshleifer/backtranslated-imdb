Roger Corman is unquestionably one of the most versatile and unpredictable directors / producers in history. He was personally responsible for some of my favorite horror movies in history (like Edgar Allen Poe's adaptations "Masque of the Red Death" and "Pit and the Pendulum"), as well as some not-so-cheap and cheesy garbage (eg "Creature from the haunted sea" and "She Gods of the Shark Reef"). Corman also did some movies that are simply unclassifiable and ?? just put it? almost impossible to properly assess. For example, "The Trip", as well as the imaginative titled "Gas-s-s-s" can in a sense be called psychedelic exploitation. In other words, they are incredibly strange films about hippie culture. In the middle of time you do not have the slightest idea what is going on, who these characters are, who walk back and forth on the screen and where the hell is all happening. The plot is simple and highly effective: a strange but deadly nervous gas is accidentally released and instantly annihilates the entire world population over the age of 25. * It may * be the basic premise of the atmosphere, rough and depressing uncertainty post-apocalyptic turning point Sci-Fi, but writer George Armitage and Roger Corman decided to turn it into a "trippy" film comedy. None of the characters even tries to prevent inevitably coming death; they just play on the streets and find small underage crime syndicates. "Gas-s-s-s" is disappointingly boring and too difficult to be bizarre. The entire script seems to be improvised on the spot and is not funny at all. Definitely not my cup of tea, but the movie has a loyal group of fans and many devotees, so who am I to say that it is not worth your time or money?
