In a word, this movie was boring. He lacked life and sparks. A big problem concerns two leads. Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow did not have any chemistry. He was boring, and she was annoying. <br /> <br /> The graphics were interesting, but they did not improve the scenes. If at all, the graphics tended to take the audience away from what was happening on the screen. None of the action sequences seemed real, which is why the film did not create any real drama or sense of threat. <br /> <br /> The film had potential, but it needed a better script, better acting and a better director. During the movie, I thought this movie would work if Harrison Ford was Captain Sky, Karen Allen was Polly, and Steven Spielberg was the director. <br /> <br /> Ignore the critical acclaim for this movie. Critics, I think, praise this movie because they * want * to like it and want it to succeed, even if it fails on many different levels.
