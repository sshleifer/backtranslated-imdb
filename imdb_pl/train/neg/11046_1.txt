This is probably one of the worst films ever. Bad acting, bad special effects, bad plot, bad everything. In the last 15 minutes, a cat-colored cyborg was introduced, which mixed everything up. Malcom MacDowell had to make a payment at home, because otherwise he would have to sell himself on Hollywood Blvd to pay the bill. I just do not know how you can go from Clockwork Orange to this shit and be able to look in the mirror every morning. I could do better special effects in my bathtub. There is no continuity. on drugs is so bad. It works. Do they have to smoke to be bad? The gun either shoots blue flames or bullets, he decides. Whay is called 2013 Seadly Wake, it has nothing to do with the movie
