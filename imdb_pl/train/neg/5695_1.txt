This movie is described as an action / comedy. The first 15 minutes and the presence of James Belushi indicate that it is a humorous gangster movie. <br /> <br /> However, the introduction of a funny female advantage begins a series of absurd twists, which conceal the imaginary ending. The film moves between a comedy (description used loosely) and a surreal drama in which some context scenes are thrown. The main woman (Angel of the title) is poorly preserved, and the actress does not help the script, which requires incredible extremes of the character to be presented. James Belushi is the only one who deals well with his part, but he is also disappointed by the poor script. One to avoid.
