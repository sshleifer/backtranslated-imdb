When I sat in front of the TV watching this movie, I thought, "Oh, what Alfred Hitchcock and even Brian DePalma could do with it!" Chances are you, too. It begins to intrigue. A British park guard living in Los Angeles (Collin Firth) marries a beautiful, modest brunette (Lisa Zane) whom he met recently in the park. Then he disappears one day. The police can not find any documentation that ever existed, and Firth carries out her own search. So far, good. Just as he is about to give up, he turns to his best female friend (Billy Zane), and they have stumbled upon their previous lives in the dirty Los Angeles underworld of drugs, nightclubs and filming amethometers, and then into her history of mental instability. At this point, Firth's life is in danger and the film is falling apart. None of the characters from Lisa Zane's past is interesting. The film moves slowly and there are very few actions. There is a subplot on the lack of money for drugs, but it's just getting fired. No chases, no cliff sequences and no voltage. Just a boring beating and a lot of conversations through boring characters. It is worth noting that Lisa Zane and Billy Zane are brother and sister, but they never appear together on stage. At the end of the movie you are torn between wondering what could have been and trying to stay awake.
