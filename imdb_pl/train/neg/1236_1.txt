What has happened to one of the most innovative and brilliant storytellers of our time? Well, he created a typical summer feed of action that anyone who is available at the film school could direct, or rather they would probably do a better job. They would put at least half a thought in a terrible script. <br /> <br /> Mark Wahlberg plays an astronaut who traveled through a wormhole and landed on a planet ruled by monkeys. (puffing!) With the exception of this time, the monkeys are twisting through dignified dialogue, meaningless conspiracy and spectacular special effects that steadily strengthen my mind that this money could have been spent on about 10 independent films that would be considered a "masterpiece" alongside these guts. <br /> <br /> Just as I enjoy a great acting talent like Tim Roth, his performance as the evil leader of Thade's monkeys is nothing but an intense composition of tanned and heavy breathing. Fortunately for him, makeup allows the actor to remain dignity, and most of the nonsense dialogue is hidden behind his groans and nose. <br /> <br /> And, unfortunately, a reliable Hollywood tradition always takes a man and leads the woman and ties it at the end without any connection or reason. And "haha, we're so smart, right?" The way Hollywood goes through the references to the original POTA. Westchnij ... <br /> <br /> Instead, see, spend the night and call friends and rent "Ed Wood", "Edward Scissorhands", "Batman", and even to a lesser extent "Sleepy Hollow" and recalls the times when Tim Burton was a man of vision and originality ... not ashamed and ridiculous.
