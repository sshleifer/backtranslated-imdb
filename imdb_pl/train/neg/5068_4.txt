I am stunned by the discovery of the number of fans this concert has. I did not say Friends is, at best, "average" sitcom, and not as great as others. Let's face it, were it not for the cast of Courtney Cox Arquette, David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry, Lisa Kudrow, Jennifer Aniston and Matt Le Blanc, who knows if this concert would last as long as it happened. I doubt it very much. Although, as the series progressed, Friends became more and more predictable, lousy and boring, that I did not care about the characters, the most overrated in the history of television or their fate, or who sleep with whom. And it was fun in the first four seasons and sometimes fun. And even if all those Hollywood actors from around the world on the A-list list, I still did not care about tuning. Writing in Friends has become obsolete, I have lost interest in this series since the sixth season and how to the end, well, you could have predicted at least. <br /> <br /> It was annoying, however, that it lasted for ten seasons, while some of my favorite programs only lasted three or four seasons, for example, and were finally canceled and taken down for good. The show should be immediately stopped when the cast wants larger salaries. To tell the truth, as much as the series decreased, it was a bigger program than the actors themselves, and not the other way around. <br /> <br /> When it ended in 2004, I felt relieved to see the back of this series. We're talking about a friendshow show that will soon appear on our TV screens. And yet I will not wait for it.
