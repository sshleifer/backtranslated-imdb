I am an avid fan of horrendous movies, anything cheesy and ridiculous, it's my game. So imagine that my spirit went to the local Rent Shop and I found Vampires vs. Zombies. The name is just too funny, you know that no one in the world can do something like that, it just has to be bad. <br /> <br /> And boy, is it BAD. After watching this terrifying movie, I was speechless. Me and my buddy sat outside without a word to each other for a few minutes, both of them contemplating the future of our life after watching the movie. I broke the depressing silence with the words: "... old ... What?" Yes, I am a fascinating person. <br /> <br /> Here is a quick "street review" of The Plot; He is not in "WTF" mode at all. characters; Without development, forgotten. Music; Worse than porn. vampires; Their vampires? Zombie; Ichs Zombies? <br /> <br /> Finally; Everyone should see this movie, to be honest, it's so bad that I want to see it again. So do yourself a favor, look and depression.
