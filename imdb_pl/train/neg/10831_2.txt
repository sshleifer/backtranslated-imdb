I guess the director / writer had something to say. Let's see what could have been ... a. Frog fright would be frightening? b. Can I make someone like Tom Cruise say "C" many times and look like a bad Patrick Rafter? down. Throw my wife and tell her to say "F" every 2 seconds. Besides, I really liked the beginning and the storm of frogs. The rest were adamant, too long (insufficiently edited), excessive indulgence. I am glad that many of you liked it! <br /> <br />
