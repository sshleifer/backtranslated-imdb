Like Freddy's Revenge, this sequel has a rather strange idea and does not do its best to squeeze the story out of it. Essentially, Alice from number 4 is pregnant, and her child is haunted by Freddy, which gives him the opportunity to persecute her friends. It has the least deaths from the whole series, and wise cracks are quite weak, so neither horror fans nor comedy fans are happy. <br /> <br /> I do not have much to say about it. It's moderately interesting to see the heroes of Alice and Dan coming back from the foursome, but it's not worth watching the movie. Incredible and unpleasant, perhaps only the competitive direction saves her being the worst in the series.
