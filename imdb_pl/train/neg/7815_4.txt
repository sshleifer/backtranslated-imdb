As a longtime superman fan of comics, from the series from the 1950s, the first two films of Chris Reeves and Lois & Clark, and finally Smallville, I really * counted on something clever in "Superman Returns". br /> <br /> Instead, we have Lex Luthor * trying * to transform the property, another sequence of superman beaten during kryptonite and internal inconsistency: he could not resist falling into the ocean when he got stuck with kryptonite 6 ', but when Lois breaks it off 3 ", * leaving the rest embedded in it *, can raise the * continent * into space? Really, the only hero in this story was Lois's partner - I can not remember his name. He did all kinds of life-saving, heroic things with courage and skill - no superpowers, no insensitivity ... just a normal person. <br /> <br /> They still make Superman so small. Why can not we have Superman fighting with Brainiac or fighting to save the universe from General Zod instead of Lex's small plans. Oh, I forgot ... they do it in Smallville. <br /> <br /> Yes ... I think I will stick to Smallville ... <br /> <br /> You probably should, too ...
