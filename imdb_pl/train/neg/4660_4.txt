At first glance it seems that it will be a funny blaxploitation movie that contains moments in which it is heading in this direction. However, the basic idea of ​​the story is much stronger than one would expect and is a respectable effort to present racial issues in the army of the Second World War. Recognizable cast is a hit and miss, and Glynn Turman, Richard Pryor and unused Billy Dee Williams are doing their best. Stephen Boyd, however, stops just before he shakes his bushy mustache at too fast a pace. <br /> <br /> Of course, a low budget leads to inconsistencies in production values. Locations are great, effects and action are poor. Imagine that "Saving Private Ryan" consisted in the fact that half of the platoon was killed exactly the same as Caparzo with Vin Diesel (except that we will see the shot, because the effects can not cope with it), and then Hanks, Damon and Burns rode around in the jeep and shot five Germans at the culmination. However, the solution in which the heroic soldiers do not receive respect for their achievements, because they are black, and the racist Captain Boyd, who is called by this, is convincing, as are the sequences of writing Turman in the journal of his imaginary feats, if the soldiers could fight instead of digging latrines. <br /> <br /> In short, the "Black Brigade / Carter's Army" fails. But this is a serious failure, not a bad joke. It can be converted as a very good movie and, in its present form, is an interesting effort.
