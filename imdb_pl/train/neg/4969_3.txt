First of all, it's not as close as other garbage produced by the Sci-Fi Channel; it does not mean that Grendel is a good movie, in fact it is very bad, but it can certainly be much better. The disadvantages of the film come from the design of characters, characters, absurd additions to history, visual effects, music and mostly: acting. <br /> <br /> Speaking of character design, I, of course, means the way our heroes and villains look. Beowulf and the other Danes seem to be funny Vikings, not warriors of brute force - this helmet, which bears our main character, is simply too stupid. Grendel looks like Hulk, but with strange tentacles on his elbows. <br /> <br /> Characters are very limited. Beowulf is the same from the beginning to the end, but Finn - a useless helper - has achieved a certain two-dimensionality, thanks to his romantic subplot plot, and Unferth also has a certain idea, because it becomes less conceited. <br /> <br /> Like Finn, there are useless additions to this story to make it your own, still sticking to the source material. The crossbow given to Beowulf is so funny that I'm surprised that the cast did not leave the set. In addition to the additions, there are omissions, such as the underlying themes of Christianity and paganism, as well as the consequences of lying. <br /> <br /> The special effects are terrible. Grendel and his mother Hag are poorly conceived and as such are presented on the screen less than credible. <br /> <br /> Music is overbearing, especially when a character dies. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is not the worst Sci-Fi movie. No. It's actually one of the better movies, although it's still rubbish, it's a good junk, which makes it a pleasure at best. The only thing that works is a dialogue that is still wooden here and there. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend omitting this film and watching Robert Zemeckis' ancient Beowulf story, simply because this movie (Grendel) is only half the story, not the whole thing that collects this film into three stars .
