This should be a film about Sam and his wife, wonderful Peter Falk and equally great Olympia Dukakis. It would be a movie that is worth seeing. Instead, it is Paul Reiser's vehicle with a small Falk. The great Elizabeth Perkins is also in this movie, but it's hard to know. I suppose Reiser has the impression that he is a giant movie star who needs the right vehicle. He is not. Even more annoying is that Reiser took the trouble to hire some of the best female characters on the screen, and then he pressed them all into his background. Dukakis does not appear for the last 15 minutes, but when he does, the screen shines. The tale is really about Falk and Dukakis, but we give up a pointless, stupid, ridiculous journey, in which Reiser shows how sweet, valuable and deep with psychological insight (wrong!) Can be. For example, in the restaurant scene, which I imagine, Reiser hoped he was "similar to Cassavetes", there is a ridiculously false confrontation between Reiser and Falk, which is so absurd that I was ashamed of Falk.
