The only reason I saw "Shakedown" was that Erika Eleniak was in her. She is always sexy, but she plays the second violin with the lead Wolf Larson. It is a pity, because it has more possibilities of action than it can show here. The film consists largely of endless shootings, which quickly become monotonous - especially when most of the time you see evil armed with machine guns, still missing Larson and his armed only with a revolver (which NEVER runs out of bullets), taking them all rather easily. The effects of the earthquake are decent, but there is also a lot of blurred traffic and weak CGI explosions. As a psychotic "spiritual leader," Ron Perlman tries, but the pseudoreligious mumbo-jumbo he has to throw away is simply boring. Eleniak, Perlman or Larson (assuming that he has) complete may want to give it a look, for others it's barely worth renting. (* 1/2)
