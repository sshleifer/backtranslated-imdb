Carnosaur 3: Primal Species (1996) D: Jonathan Winfrey. Scott Valentine, Janet Gunn, Rick Dean, Anthony Peck, Rodger Halston, Terri J. Vaughn, Billy Burnette. Why even bother with browsing this movie? Another stupid movie about dinosaurs in which secret military men discover these deadly (and very false) prehistoric monsters running around killing people in a bloody way. The original was bad enough, the sequel was even worse. It falls somewhere in between, although it is not related to any of the previous CARNOSAUR films. RATING: 2 out of 10. Rated R for graphic violence and gore, scary images and profanity.
