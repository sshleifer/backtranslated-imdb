Remembering the dirty details of this insidiously deplorable "film" is like digging a rusty, salted spoon in the chest cavity. Perhaps "Home Alone 2: Lost in New York" (1992) was somewhat predictable, but this pathetic excuse for the film is just one of the most shameless commercialization deals I've heard of. A boy fighting spies / terrorists when he's home alone in suburban Chicago with chickenpox? Funny! Why did this movie have to be done? I am a person who believes that even terrible films are not a waste of time, but rather experience. However, this is a waste of time. This should be avoided at all costs.
