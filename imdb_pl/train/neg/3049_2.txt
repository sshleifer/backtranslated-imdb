Why such a general title? Santa Claus??? So bland and unpredictable. The films that previously tried to earn a holiday spirit, first of all "Saint Nicholas conquers the Martians," at least they were fun to watch because of the abundance and the entire footage used ... seemed to me happy. But this movie just turns Christmas in the ass and brings joy to all children. Does Santa live in space? His enemy is the devil named Pitch? Santa gets help from Maga Merlin? How is it random! Ever since it was made in Mexico, some of you may understand the way the movie was made. I had to admit that some of the effects were just weird. It was a complete cluster of madness! Although despite all the problems with the film, it still looks like a Christmas movie. Good overcomes evil, and Christmas still plays a role in our hearts of every good girl or boy in the world, or maybe the universe, thanks to Santa Claus, Conquering the Martians ... apparently. So I think you should try, even if it's one of the worst Christmas movies of all time ... although it should bring a smile to your face every day.
