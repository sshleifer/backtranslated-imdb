For movie fans who have never heard of this book ("The Haunting of Hill House" by Shirley Jackson) and never saw the production of Robert Wise with Julie Harris from 1963, this remake will seem pretty bad. <br /> <br /> For those of us who have, it's just awful. <br /> <br /> Bad acting (what did Neeson think?), Silly computer upgrades and further departure from Jackson's story of the doom of this remake. <Br> <br /> Do yourself a favor and rent the original movie. He still scares effectively without special effects. Acting is professional and reliable. <br /> <br /> For readers of the book from 1963, he follows her much closer.
