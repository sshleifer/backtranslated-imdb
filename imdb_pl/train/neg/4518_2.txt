Few movies lost their expectations and upset me as much as Fire. The film is a pretentious trash. He does not achieve anything at the artistic level. All he got was a ban in India. If only because of the poor quality of film production and not current controversy, the ban would be more justified. <br /> <br /> Now that I've lost patience with my system, I'm more able to analyze the movie: <br /> <br /> * From the very beginning, the movie seems unreal, especially when the characters start talking in English. The director obviously did not make the film for the Indian audience; however, she did not appreciate the international audience, simplifying it. Watching the nature of domestic help, speaking in perfect English is too unrealistic to be true. <br /> <br /> * Then we regularly see Radha's dreams. These scenes are not very effective. They appear as shocking and obstructing the flow of the film. I still wonder how this philosophical dialogue was related to history. I felt that surrealism was lost. <br /> <br /> * Love scenes seemed voyeuristic and are probably intended for the excitement of the audience, and are not a powerful statement. In any case, they do not achieve any of the two. <br /> <br /> * Names chosen for women, Radha and Sita, are names of Hindu deities and have therefore been chosen to shock the public. However, as the film was not intended primarily for Indian audiences, the choice of shock by name is not intended to achieve its purpose, which is absurd. <br /> <br /> * The quality of the direction is very poor and some key and delicate scenes have been mistreated. A better director could make a powerful emotional drama about the subject. <br /> <br /> * Acting was wooden, although Nandita Das brought some of this life to life, others were wasted. I always thought that Shabana Azmi is a good actress, but her talent is not visible in this film. The male leaders were simply nonsense. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Earth and you want to see more director, stay away from it. Please.
