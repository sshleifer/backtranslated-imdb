Immediately after borrowing and watching this movie a few years ago, me and my friend decided that it defines an absolute zero in the film scale. There was nothing in the film that could be done worse than it actually was. To this day, we still evaluate movies, even the very bad ones, if they are better than "The Lonely Lady". <br /> <br /> A long time ago I saw an interview with Eleanor Perry, who wrote scripts like "Last Summer" and "Diary of a Mad Housewife", and she said she was asked to write a screenplay for Harold Robbins' book "The Lonely Lady". She said she had sent the treatment and was rejected because they did not think she understood the difficulty of the female screenwriter in Hollywood. Then she said, "I think they have someone to write it." The interview was made before the film was released. She died in 1981 and I bet that the first thing she did after coming to heaven was to personally thank God for saving her from involvement in the result.
