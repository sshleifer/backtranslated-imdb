Almost from the very beginning, this movie is poor and devoid of conviction, but then most people struggle to show commitment to the script as uninspiring as this one. Dialogue does not really flow, and sometimes, as in this case, there is less (or should be) more. This is also supported by strange scenes (eg Cemetry's slow-paced Walk), which in your opinion may lead somewhere, but they seem to be wasting only a few seconds of your life. <br /> <br /> The plot is a strange combination of a gangster-situation comedy that certainly seemed like a good idea at the time, but if there ever was a case that someone must be honest with the writer, that was it. <br /> <br /> but then it seems that he has one character who always plays, so I start to wonder if he got the script, if he was just filmed and told to react normally. <br /> <br /> Finally - humor. This reminds me of the quote "Python (I think) about Shakespere, his" comedies "- if he meant a humorous joke, he would put a joke on it. Well, I did not see any. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time - I did it because I watched it with a friend and I hoped it would be better. <br /> <br /> No.
