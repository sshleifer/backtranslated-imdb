In the so-called "documentary film" there are so many incorrect statements that I was shouting on television. <br /> <br /> Bart Sibrel may be able to create a gaudily-looking DVD, but unfortunately he lacks the appearance in science behind his claims. <br /> <br /> Is based either on the fact that it is inaccurate, does not tell the whole story, or that the old favorite "government always lies to us" and people believe what they say and do not check accuracy or details regarding claims. <br /> <br /> What's more, its "exclusive" or "unreleased" footage is freely available on the Internet from various websites. <br /> <br /> Further reading about the circumstances of filming this production shows that he used false claims to get interviews and used creative editing of answers to promote his own opinions. <br /> <br /> All claims made by Mr. Sibrel about "inaccuracies", "errors" or "informing about irregularities" in the Apollo program were thoroughly refuted. <br /> <br /> How can I recover 40 minutes of my life?
