"In 1955, Tobias Schneerbaum disappeared in the Peruvian Amazon. A year later he left the jungle ... naked. Apparently, "Keep the River On Your Right" is a "modern story of cannibals". In fact, anyone who is looking for some insight into cannibalism will unfortunately be disappointed. The first half of the movie is more like a New Ginuea travel diary, mainly advertizing native art. The other half is based on still pictures of the Peruvian tribe of cannibals, but that's really the point. Unless of course you are not interested in home movies of a Jewish wedding or Schneerbaum depicting his former male lovers. I give up. Big disappointment, not really a "modern story of cannibals". - MERK
