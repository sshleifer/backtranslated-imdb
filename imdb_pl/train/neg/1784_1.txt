OK, I recorded it from television and missed the very beginning. The movie was about 10 seconds in titles (I assume), so if anything happened before, I missed it. <br /> <br /> Many people say that Mark Hammill is in it, I have not seen him. I met Clive Barker, John Landis and of course Stephen King doing a really terrible acting as an assistant to the cemetery. <br /> <br /> Alice Krige looks beautiful except for the scenes in which she has a cat's face or is completely alien. -up. <br /> <br /> Even with the initial titles, it has never really been explained exactly what the sleepwalkers are and where they come from. From the title sequence, I assume that they are similar to the cat's two-legged ones, which live thanks to the extraction of life force from humans. I assume they live long, and these 2 are probably the last of its kind. <br /> <br /> Add to this a very large dose of incest (yes, I thought it was a bit suspicious), change of shape, deadly cats and invisibility, and you have Sleepwalkers. <br /> <br /> It's a very bad story that has no real explanation for the main 2 characters and too many episodes to distract attention from the simple fact that it's not enough to explain to the viewer. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
