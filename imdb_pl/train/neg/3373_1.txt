I was lucky to see A Chorus Line when it came to my city ... I was younger then ... but it was perfect game .. so could anyone tell me why in the name of heaven they had to make a movie with this ... and why Michael Douglas ?? ? He did not fit this role ... this movie really took BIG time !!! <br /> <br /> my advice is not to rent this movie .. save money for something better like "Cats" ....
