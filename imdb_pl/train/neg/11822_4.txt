I thought Harvey Keitel, young, fresh from Sex Pistols John Lydon, and then as a bonus, the music of Ennio Morricone. I expected an old school, sharp, Italian thriller policemen who originated in America. Istead, I have a mishmash story that never made sense and a movie that told me: WTF !!! Too many unanswered questions and too few actions. The result: the potential cult classic has been lowered in the toilet. Keitel and Lydon work together well, so maybe Quentin Tarantino can connect these guests with a better script. Oh, and the result Morricone: OK, but not memorable. <br /> <br /> In general, it's not a waste of time, but it's not "a must see" unless you're a Keitel fan.
