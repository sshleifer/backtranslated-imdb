Let me start by saying that it does not seem to be a film. It looks like it is another television program about popular girls and boys without a real movie language. Summarizing. connect with it. This film takes us to where we have not seen any film before: to the world in which the Film Theater becomes a warm medium, giving the public every element of interpretation. Too obvious. A large movie screen is only used as an enlarged television, from which we can see every attribute of these women in a way larger than life. <br /> <br /> Recently, it seems that young directors risk the art of making movies. This is very scary. The industry is spoiling art in movies. We need to educate ourselves and our children about what cinematography and language really is. Not only sales and entertainment, but also a way to communicate feelings, passions and even culture. Not as a starting platform for young divs and jockeys.
