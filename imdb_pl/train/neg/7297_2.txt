From the initial dialog and scenes, I knew that I was on the train wreck. I did not want to look, but I could not turn around. If not for the sweetness of the eye of this film, I would give one star. The fact that the interaction between characters and behaviors related to relationships was so far-reaching, added by a bad direction and a horrible story, make this film nothing more than a low-budget catastrophe. Money is not a must to make a good movie. But this movie fails so badly that there was no chance of reflection. <br /> <br /> If you were stuck in the woods, your childhood best friend dying of an unknown disease, other friends dying around you, trapped in a strange place, what would you do? <br /> <br /> A.) Run away from everyone and try your luck on your own. B.) Make sex with your friend. C.) Take a hot bath to relax your sorrows, including shaving your legs. D.) Hit the best childhood friend and lifelong shovel. E.) All of the above. <br /> <br /> According to Eli Roth, none of these answers is so far-fetched. In fact, they are all reliable and well represented in Cabin Fever. A complete lack of reality and an illogical attempt to explain what people do in traumatic situations, throws this film in the basket at the local rental store. Stay away. Stay away.
