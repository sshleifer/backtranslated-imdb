Think of a darker version of one of those children's programs like "Power Rangers" and you've got this 1990 movie, Robot Jox. The movie, in which you fight with gigantic robots, two men enter the arena and who leaves the country wins. Robots are huge and look like slightly better versions of these programs, mainly because they are less colorful, so while this movie is not good, watching it is not a bad thing. As I recall, there are two robot fights in this game, one ends badly and the last game. There is a certain turnaround, as the traitor reveals, but in the end the plot is nothing that stays with you for any time after taking the picture. The battles themselves look like giant toys in a frenzy, but they are still pleasant to watch. This movie would also have produced several other movies with similar feature devices, such as giant robots and tournaments. So check it out once, but probably not more.
