Somehow, they summarized the sixties, ten years, which radically changed our country within four hours. And what a painful four hours. They trivialized the most important events and events and claimed that it was about two families, and you barely saw an Afro-American family. If I was at NBC, I would be ashamed and embarrassed for emitting such rubbish. What was fun was the happy family you saw from the very beginning, she was tortured in many ways, but they managed to participate in every major event in the 1960s in the country. The second family was a non-factor. They have devoted five or six scenes to this family. This poor son ... Please, NBC, do not make any movies about other eras ... leave it to PBS and History Channel
