This should be re-titled "An interesting case of unscrupulous filmmakers who falsely portray the non-horror film of Snorer as a shocking movie." It's one long, boring story about a dizzying fraternity, gagging so clear that even the Flounder from Delta House could see through it. Jeff East, an actor at the stage of paying premiums, can be forgiven for taking any work. The same can not be said of Charles Martin Smith, who previously played in such heavy films as George Lucas and Sam Peckinpah. Once available on tape, but fortunately not on DVD. Incorrectly presented garbage belong to the landfill and nowhere else.
