This movie was not just bad - it was awful. After I looked at it, I felt the need to shower to remove dirt from me. He runs "gag" with an older couple who is coming up, it's not funny, but he's disgusting. The makeup of the monsters was cool, but that's all. The same continuity errors will annoy you - at least I was. The editing is very poor. <br /> <br /> Almost anything you could do would be better than spending time watching this movie. Even if your group of friends is in "bad movies", this one is unique in its ineptitude, I could not even make myself laugh. You have been warned.
