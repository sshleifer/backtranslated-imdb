It's a very cheap movie about werewolves. The film is dark and poorly lit. The sound is uneven and poorly recorded and mixed. Scenario is a trashy junk with ordinary characters, such as a tough detective who shoots silver with werewolf guns! [naturally filled with silver balls]. Acting is as wooden as characters. FX does not exist, lots of extreme close ups of werewolf's jaws and biting. the only thing that is shown is a lot of soft cores. Instead of dropping $ 30 for these guts, check out a really great picture of a werewolf: "Dog Soldiers" with Sean Pertwee.
