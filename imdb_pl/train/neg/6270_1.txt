Somehow, a woman working with a scientist puts round metal balls into the mouths of people who allegedly change their personality, but in reality they turn them into crazy, zombie-killers. "Guinea pigs" for the experiment are scantily clad, young women in desperate need of acting lessons. This movie is terrible, horrible and incredibly angry. There is no logic in the script. You'll really have trouble tracking what's going on. There are no special effects. The computer screen, which is supposed to resemble a huge scientific progress, looks like an old Atari screen. What's worse, there is also a puppet with felt hair bands (it seems like a lonely child in a summer camp) named George, who is like a personal servant / confidant of Jessica (the main "actress"). Throughout the film you will be subjected to the idiotic, sophisticated statements of this puppet. But wait ... you also get a lot of softcore scenes, non-erotic, barely naked with girls with a few bar guys. All the time the most annoying soundtrack appears in the background, as if some spiritual discovery took place. None of the actors is good. There are only different degrees of evil. Gore and "horror movies" are particularly improperly filmed. The film really looks as if it grew up together. It is no coincidence that Henry Sala, whose name is the director, but not in trade, did not make another film. I was bored with almost a coma watching this stupid, stupid, stupid! How to finish it? What happened? If you know, let me secret, because I can not understand it for me. All I know is that I lost time spent watching these trash that made the beginning of my weekend a real nightmare of boredom!
