This is by far the worst movie I've seen in my entire life. Acting is weak, and the story is almost incomprehensible. It does not matter if you like lanterns or ships. When it comes to special effects, the movie does not have any. The whole film crew was probably on a boat in a stormy sea, not in the studio, and when some men are stabbed (if you can even call it that), their reactions are completely unrealistic. The guns are more silent than mute. How this film can have two awards raises serious questions about the state of the human mind. Good about it. This review is probably nicer to read than a movie to watch. If someone was considering watching or buying it, I would seriously advise him for obvious reasons. I said it contained a spoiler. If the fact that some people have been stabbed and the shooting is fired, it is a treat. I suppose it's because they're the only good parts of the movie.
