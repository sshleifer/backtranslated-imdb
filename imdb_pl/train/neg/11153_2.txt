Another in a long series of films made by people who think that the ability to use the camera is the same as telling stories. Within 15 minutes the whole room is arranged in just a few lines, so there is no secret that eliminates the whole aspect of tension. The only half-competent actor is killed 10 minutes in the movie, so we stay with stupid characters running around doing stupid things. Low-budget movies can not afford expensive special effects, so CGI parts are surprisingly low, but they were at least an important test. The creature's costume is horrible, as you can see when it falls on the pavement, and the director still emphasizes eyes that are not even the red color shown in the mirror shots. Dialogue is clumsy and boring, with several lines resembling Aliens or the Terminator. The last sequence of the action takes place at the police station, as well as the extortion of the Terminator, and everyone is hiding in one glass office, which Darkwolf does not get into. In the end, the girl calls the protagonist a "good defender", but he gets both his partners, the original defender, and at least three other civilians, not to mention a dozen cops, all killed without a decent shot, despite the arsenal of silver bullets and machine pistol. But here's the real reason for bad writing: They could have killed the beast right after the initial credits, when they were holding the stripper, blinking with red eyes. Instead, they took him to custody?!?
