Buford's Beach Bunnies gives class B movies a bad reputation. As a fan of the genre, I was terrified when I tried to use the talents of young actresses. I am specifically referring to a clear lack of nudity and simulated sex scenes. What's the next generation of sad teenage boys watching on TV late at night?
