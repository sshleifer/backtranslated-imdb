I really wanted to like this movie, but I never gave it a chance. Essentially, it's supposed to be a Spinal Tap with a hip-hop motif, but it does not succeed. He constantly feels like he's been written and acting by high school students for some school project, and this is the level that humor seems to be heading towards. There is no subtlety and, what's more shameful for mockumentary, it never seems to be a document. And although the lines are not fun, the attempt to deliver a dead-man would help - surely everything would be better than the penetrating takeover that we are subjected to. <br /> <br /> And I recommend it to people who like "comedies" in the style of "Big Momma's House" or "Norbit"; people who think that words like "butt" are hysterically ridiculous by nature. Other people should stay away and not waste time.
