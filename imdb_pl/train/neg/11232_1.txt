It is so sad. Although it was filmed, it seems to me that it stinks a little more than filming like a Bloody Lake, there's nothing there. The music they play is the funniest song I've ever heard. I like my brother and sister in this film. They both do not try to sound sarcastic when they say things like "My friends will be so jealous!" Hey, what about the killer wearing only a mask at the beginning? It's delayed! I practically ignored the second part of it. My favorite part of this movie is the sound effect they use when the killer uses an ax. The same exact sound for every chop!
