I really hope that Concorde / New Horizons did not try to create a serious horror movie or even an action movie when they created Carnosaur 3. The movie is very stupid from beginning to end. Even humor in C3 is funny because it's bad. Definitely high water level in the "So Bad it Good" genre. If you like the worst of the worst, it's for you.
