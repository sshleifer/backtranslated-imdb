The animation in this re-image of Peter and Wilk is perfect, but after 29 minutes the movie triggers a dream. They should call it "Piotr and snails" because everything moves at a snail's pace. I could not even watch the movie in one sitting - I had to watch it after 15 minutes, and it was pure torture. <br /> <br /> Save 30 minutes - do not watch this movie thank me. <br /> <br /> I can only guess that the Oscar nomination committee only watched the first minutes of the nominees. Unfortunately, to vote for the winner in the Best Animated Short (short!) Category, voters will have to go through the whole matter. I feel sorry for them - and I have to predict that this film will not be close to winning.
