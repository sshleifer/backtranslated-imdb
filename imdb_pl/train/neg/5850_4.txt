Nell Shipman attempted to conspire to the final of the pursuit in "Back to God Country" from the previous year and failed. This time it does better, although it seems pointless. Something New almost does not have a story lying outside of the pursuit. There is a brief premise that assumes that the hero (co-author and Shipman's boyfriend) must save the girl (played by Shipman), and then it is an exciting, unbelievable pursuit. Of course, you play like Maxvan Sedan's hour-long advertisement, but the whole movie is ridiculously ridiculous. It does not seem that she learned a lot from D.W. Griffith or his parodies by Mack Sennett and other comedians he imitates. <br /> <br /> An interesting fact is that Shipman writes and directs himself in the film as the author of the film, whose protagonist is the writer (again Shipman), although he does not do anything smarter or humorous with her, although he tries. Again others were the pioneers of the writer's joke in subtitles like Anita Loos from "Wild and Woolly" or Frances Marion from "A Girl's Folly" (both from 1917). At least Shipman gives the impression that he does not take himself or the movie seriously - and me too. "Something new", despite its assertion, is trite.
