Final result: 0 (out of 10) <br /> <br /> *** Possible scene specific spoilers (but who cares) *** <br /> <br /> Yes, it's true: zero. And I rarely give 1. Even in the case of the finest films I am looking for things like music, photos, imagination, humor and even good pace to be as objective as possible. Looking at it within your own types or subgroups. But here is absolutely nothing. I do not remember when the movie actually sent me to the room after it was finished. The only reason I got to the end was that I could not change the channel - I just sat there, terrified, watching the insulting stupid fall into the next one. It was like watching a snake digging a rat. <br /> <br /> But let's have some fun and let's break this child, right? First of all, there is nothing technical about "whipping" that works. All visualizations are sitcom style. Cut scenes are just pictures of street traffic that takes place at night over and over again. Music and the score not only do not add anything to the film - it is unbearable. Not to mention that there is nothing to do anyway. Acting is just as cardboard as Amanda Peet (clearly the "star" who smashed the wreck of this train). These guys, apparently good friends, no longer have chemistry or sense if director Peter M. Cohen rounded them up at the bus station a few minutes before the shooting began. <br /> <br /> On the creative side, there is no original bone in your body. There is no imagination. It does not show us anything we have not seen thousands of times before. The whole premise of this "film" is based on the male strike and the "idea" that entitled women can play men "just like playing". Anyone who thinks it is somehow twisted or in any way original, has never turned on the TV before. Twisted, shallow women are commonplace. Men's pounding is the norm. He does not steal anything specifically, it's worse: he steals the cliches. I can not imagine a woman who makes a movie that presents other women based on stereotypes and with this sense of contempt. It makes me want to rent "In the company of men" - and even better "There's something about Maria". This movie wants to be a "sharper" version of "There's something about Maria" so much that you can see the sweat. <br /> <br /> The film has no insight into women, men, dating, sex or anything. Cohen is simply happy to recall the myths he was indoctrinated from other sexist films. On the other hand, the film does not work as a satire, because although it is exaggerated, it can be considered "satirical" because it has no grounding in the reality that satire needs. He does not even know what satirical it is. Then there is a dialogue that is not much more than characters shouting for abominations. Example: Figure 1: "F ** k" Figure 2: "Oh yes, well, f ** k" (repeat) <br /> <br /> And what can justify all other discretion: There are many movies without plots, without a good game, with morally repulsive characters and indecent dialogue, which were fun, and therefore good. "Bita" is not funny. Not for a second. There is no comic or time skills. All situations are completely false, not based on any shred of truth, especially to squeeze us out of laughter. All characters are widely drawn, so SEEM will be able to be associated with the lowest of the lowest common denominators. Just look at the "cult" scene with a hair gel. One of our inept anti-heroes opens the first aid kit and sees Mena's vibrator (Peet). For some reason, the light shines on him as if he found the Holy Grail. Why does Cohen think that men react to vibrators in this way? I do not know. While he rubs against himself, he drops him into the toilet and then tries to pick him up with his bare hands when, oh, Mena comes up to him. Oh, my side. <br /> <br /> But it's strange that people really like this movie. Of course, people also like "friends" and dating with reality, so I should not be surprised. However, all this has a common thread. "Bita" is a big proof for me that in America there is only a huge pocket of people who will laugh at every joke just because it's about sex. They will like any program or movie (or think they like it) just because it's about dates or relationships. The lack of any quality has no effect on these people. Just as people are indoctrinated to want whiter teeth and thinner bodies to sell toothbrushes and weight-loss programs, they are also indoctrinated to blindly deal with any dates / relationships related to their sale of cheap, empty, effortless TV, movies and any the number of products. <br /> <br /> The only console will be that when I die because I saw this movie, I have a loan to recover 80 minutes of my life. <br /> <br />
