Yes, the subject is a simple quote from the movie and I think it is quite accurate. I was so bored with dead this senseless effort. All flashes etc., Which do not make sense after the first 20 minutes, are just bad filming + If you're an epilepsy, you'd die at least five times. Of course, all fans of David Lynch would raise a flag for this kind of turkey to be "the best film ever made" because it makes no sense And when it does not make sense, it must be art and art the film is always good. Well? I say WRONG. This kind of artificial capture is simply a pathetic way of showing that you're a good filmmaker. Anthony Hopkins as an excellent actor should just play.
