The wonderful channel "Z" in Los Angeles showed this movie Pia Zadory about six months after "Butterfly". I had such great hopes for the actress, and then she goes from bad to obvious WORSE in this movie. <br /> <br /> Again, it was the 80's and I have to tell you that Harold Robbin's works have been overshadowed by wiser writers. Jacqueline Susann buried herself in him (she hated his way of writing women), Irwin Shaw's work attracted many women and of course Sidney Sheldon had his kingdom in the late 70s in the early 80s, and then Jackie Collins came, who made women stronger and more equal for men in every respect in her books, the more. That's why this work smelled. Harold Robbin's works in the 80's simply did not catch up with the audience. Pia Zadora appearing in one of Robbin's works was like throwing kerosene in the fire. The supporting staff was not helpful either. <br /> <br /> Ooooh ... it was awful to look at, and even 20 years later it looks even worse. I was hoping for Pia as an actress and everything was shot when it happened. Pia would be difficult to redeem as an actress (although John Waters throwing her in "Hairspray" was a spark), although she has a nice voice. <br /> <br /> Hey, Pia, wherever you are. ..Hairspray can go on tour! Join the show. You can be the biggest plot from the return. <br /> <br /> I hope you burn this movie for you if you do.
