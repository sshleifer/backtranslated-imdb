When talking about great combinations of directors and actors, the band of J. Lee Thompson and Charles Bronson is usually not mentioned. Probably because the results of the nine joint ventures between them lead from really good entertainment to the average. Unfortunately Kinjite: Forbidden objects fall into the latter. <br /> <br /> It's sad because Kinjite could have been much better. But all my life I do not understand why it was necessary to make the father of a missing Japanese girl, a man used to cheap dances, because the affair in his marriage was over. It could have been pretty good for another movie, but it did not serve any purpose. <br /> <br /> A simple drama of a policeman with Charles Bronson as a deputy minister who has seen too much in his work and has a strong prejudice against orientalists. This part could also explain a bit. But he will have to overcome it if he and patient partner Perry Lopez locate a captured Japanese student. <br /> <br /> Bronson's time as a substitute told him exactly where to look for the kidnapper. The stylish, murderous pimp played by Jaime Fernandez is the guy, and he and Bronson have a story. In the best movie scene Bronson ordered him to eat an expensive Rolex watch and set fire to his car. <br /> <br /> At one point Fernandez will meet Bronson and Lopez in the all-night deli, and this is after his rolex snack, he sprays the place with Uzi killing everyone, but Bronson and Lopez. I really think this little incident would have more than a few LAPD vice presidents after Fernandez. But this is another horrible hole in the story. <br /> <br /> Still, Fernandez is very uneven. I would like the whole movie to be better. This was the last film by the band Bronson-Thompson and the last movie of J. Lee Thompson as a director. He should have come out with something better.
