Brief summary: This video shows everyone it touches. It means that you. <br /> <br /> First, let me say that I'm not a purist, and that could have been fun for a few minutes. Impersonating is not bad. But overall it is simply boring and not terribly funny. A few simple jokes are repeated over and over again. <br /> <br /> It is clear that these films only exist to squeeze the last few dollars out of the currently registered trademark Laurel and Hardy. Producers can not have a real respect for their place in film history or their talents. That's what hurt me the most. <br /> <br /> Of course, my daughter liked it, so I'm also a failure as a parent;)
