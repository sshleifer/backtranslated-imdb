I'm sure it was the worst movie ever made. If you can not force a 13-year-old boy to laugh with stupid humor, you should give up comedy forever. Unfortunately, Joan Rivers chose differently. The film is full of predictable gags (some of them are racist) and very unpalatable jokes. Especially memorable is the scene in which the doctor tells the main character that the rabbit has died, and he is pregnant (when I write this, I can not believe that it is actually a movie scene). The man runs up to the dead rabbit on the doctors' desk and tries to give him mouths. ROTFLMAO! NO! A line that can tell you how bad things are in this movie is "I knew I should be at the top." ha ha ha ha ah ugh ........
