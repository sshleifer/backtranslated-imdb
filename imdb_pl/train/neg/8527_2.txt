There are three movies with this style of animation that I recall from my youth. This movie "The Last Unicorn", "Flight of Dragons" and "The Hobbit". I have copies of both "Dragons" and "The Hobbit" (both excellent) and have not seen "The Last Unicorn" for over a decade. That was until today, and now I would like it not. What worried me the most was the script. It was incredibly rough and often incomprehensible. Things would happen for a reason, and other things would happen without explanation. We're not just talking about small things here; we are talking about key points of the story! The story itself is not very good, but it could work if the script was decent. Not even close. Besides, the music was terrible! I know that music in movies like these rarely has anything that could be called classical songs, but the music in this movie made me want to get rid of the bowling ball. It was one of those movies that one day I was supposed to show to my children, but it just ended. I do not think I'll ever be able to sit back in this feast. Disappointed it gently.
