Thank you for killing the series with this turkey John Carpenter and Tommy Lee Wallace. This movie sucks on so many levels that it's pathetic. The first VAMPIRE was fun, but this low budget retracts me yawns. <br /> <br /> Jon Bon Jovi (Kevin Bacon of a poor man) rides through Mexico with a surfboard in which there is a hidden hiding place holding the vampire equipment to kill ala Antonio Guitar Banderas in desperation. On the way, he chooses a few lame "hunters" (including an annoyingly feminist girl who takes pills so that she does not become a vampire), and decided to stop a vampire master woman who has not had any history, so we could care less about her task (walk in the sun, stealing the Black Cross and perform the ritual so that he can do it). If you saw the first VAMPIRES, you've seen it before and done it much better. <br /> <br /> John Carpenter was recently responsible for many bad movies. Honestly, I think he is beyond his peak and is unable to make another classic horror movie. The only decent movie he has made since THEY LIVE (1987) is VAMPYA. Everything else is complete, up to the incredibly cheap and delayed Spirit of the Marx ... now celluloid waste. Where are more such great heroes as ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13, HALLOWEEN (1), ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK and RZECZ? <br /> <br /> Carpenter crony Wallace proves that he can not write his way out of a paper bag - a bright script full of yawns, groans and waste paper from the original. Did I mention that I hate every character in the film? There was not one unforgettable character in the whole film. How does it happend? This movie has nothing to recommend. Even the DVD presentation is not good; the menu looks terrible. <br /> <br /> For comparison, JASON X: "FRIDAY 13. IN THE SPACE" was a masterpiece. In this way, you create a sequel and re-power franchise, ladies and germs, and create an exciting DVD menu.
