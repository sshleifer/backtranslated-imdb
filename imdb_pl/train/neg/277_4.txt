The art of Lillian Hellman, adapted by Dashiella Hammett with the help of Hellman, becomes an interesting project that will emerge from Warner Bros. , pulling his American wife and three children across Europe before finding refuge in the States (across the Mexican border). They settle in Washington together with their mother's wealthy mother and brother, although the dormitory residing in the court is immediately suspicious of newcomers and spends a lot of time in the German embassy playing poker. It seems that this drama will take forever, and when we realize what this material is (wise, honest, direct refugees teaching ignorant Americans, how the world has suddenly changed)), it seems a bit condescending - the viewer is literally placed in the place of loved ones , lectured. Lukas has several speeches in the third act, which undoubtedly brought him the Academy Award, but for most of the pictures it seems he does little, but he goes in and out, goes in and out. As his spouse, Bette Davis speaks like no one else and works with wide-open eyes, but the role does not allow her to have many colors. Their children (all with different accents!) Are alternately jocular and annoying, and Geraldine Fitzgerald has nothing to say as an abandoned wife (and the dissatisfied texture she brings to this part seems completely wrong). The idea was to show us tastefully, tactfully just because a man (from World War II) may be a German, which does not make him a sympathizer of Nazism. We get it in the first few minutes; the rest of this tasteful, tactical film consists of exposure, defensive confrontation and, finally, compassion. It should be a strong combination, but rather dry eyes and indifference. ** with ****
