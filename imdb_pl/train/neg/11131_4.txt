First of all, I agree with something that escapes Mr. Chomsky's lips. His factual delivery of an interesting counterpoint makes a man a hit in the university campus circus. He meets sympathetic, humble, pragmatic. It does not satisfy the current political style (an unpleasant bipartisan relationship), and it sets itself both on the left and on the right side, rebuking both and for a reason. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie itself is a dud. In fact, I would not even call it a document, but only a collection of speeches. Watching "Rebel Without a Pause" is no different than watching a speaker in a 3-part segment on CSPAN. There are no camera movements, no changes, no stylistic accents. There is no history, no narrative. <br /> <br /> From a technical point of view, production is strictly amateurish. Audio is horrible and incoherent; sometimes we do not hear Noam's voice, other times we do not hear the questions that are asked by those present. When Noam speaks rarely, let us see the reactions of the audience, except when we get a quick picture of his wife, who apparently attends all his speeches and rays with pride every time we see her. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie and I would say that it is probably better to check his recorded speeches on a cassette or a CD to listen to the car. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 stars ... and today I am in a generous mood.
