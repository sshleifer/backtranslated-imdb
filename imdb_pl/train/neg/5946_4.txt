There is absolutely no plot in this movie ... no character development ... no culmination ... nothing. But he has some good fight scenes that are pretty good. So you go ... as a movie is generally bad, but if you like an idle movie that only offers a good action scene, watch this movie. Do not expect anything more simply. Final game and not so bad direction .. Several episodes with Kimbo and Carano ... I wanted to see Carano a little more in this movie .. she is a good fighter and a really hot girl .... White is great martial artist and a decent actor. I really hope that in the future he will be able to get a better movie so that we can really enjoy his art ... Imagine a movie with White and Jaa together ... that would be amazing
