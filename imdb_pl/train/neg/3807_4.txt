Do not get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of many of Woody's films, of course his masterpieces from the late 1970s (Annie Hall, Interiors, Manhattan) and most of the late 80's / early 90's dramas (Hannah, Crimes and Misdemeaners , Husbands and Wives) in fact I liked some of his recent efforts (Melinda, Anything Else, Small Time Crooks), but it was fatal, but it could not have been worse than last year's Match Point, but how wrong I was. <br /> <br /> It was lazy crossed - basically the Match Point intersection, Manhattan Murder Mystery and Small Time Crooks, with all the jokes stretched out - Woody also seems to be on the way, throwing off most of his lines and delivering "funny" slogans "I mean, with all due respect ..." over and over again, the vagueness of all this will be too much. <br /> <br /> I know that most actors are waiting in line to work with him, but they should at least read the script first - Scarlett Johansson and Hugh Jackman are much better than this - and Woody should look more closely at the role of the camera in the future if he's about 20 miles behind him. <br /> <br /> It would not be so tragic if we did not have so many great Woody movies compare it with - but it's clear that his best days are behind him and judging by this effort, Woody should call it a day before becoming a joke in the industry. <br /> <br /> Embarrassingly angry
