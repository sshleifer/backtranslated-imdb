I was not particularly impressed with this movie, which has poor music and lasts only 40 minutes. Thank God, because I fell asleep. I make perfect use of stop-motion photography to show the passage of time in the movement of light and shadow, people, water, clouds, etc. Unfortunately, that's all. <br /> <br /> I prefer his predecessor, the exquisite Koyaanisqatsi made in 1983 after 87 minutes and to prove that the sequel could be better than the original, Powaqqatsi did in 1988 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Try them both.
