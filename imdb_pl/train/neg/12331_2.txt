One of those films about "maturing" that should have longing for adults and a promise for children. This movie has none. This is a bad excuse to let Sylwia Kristel do double jerk with dorky Eric Brown. What's worse, the movie is either stupid or stupid when trying to be funny, sexy or dramatic. Laugh awkwardly, because we are to believe that the teenager will go alone, burying a dead woman in his backyard. Think energetically over why a woman known from Emmanuelle needs a double body. When the film lasted and continued, I began to imagine a hybrid of Private Lessons and Little Miss Millions, in which Sylvia Kristel seduces Jennifer Love Hewitt, and Howard Hesseman makes us miss WKRP. Watch it to laugh at the folly of other people or because of Ed Begley Jr. performance, or wonder what Sylvia Kristel from Jennifer Love Hewitt would look like. But I can give you an idea of ​​your lesson, stay away from the movies that Sylvia Kristel is looking at, which are not Emmanuelle.
