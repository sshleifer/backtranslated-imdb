It was a really bland film. The performances are the third round, and the dialogue is so stiff that it sometimes seemed like it had just turned over and died. My reason for borrowing was simple: find a movie with a script. I needed visual assistance for my presentation, so I thought, why not use the clip? Boy, I was wrong. After searching my local video store, I came across where he was suspiciously titled "Starstruck." I thought "What a hey" and I decided to give it a try. Well, I was very unhappy with my results. I could use one scene, and in the meantime I practically fell asleep because of the pure banality of this movement. So ..... I took it and picked up Ed Wood. There is an example of a movie that I can use as an example. On the other hand, everything would be presentable compared to nonsense, which is "Starfucker".
