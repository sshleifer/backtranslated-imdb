WARNING: OVERVIEW ZAWIERA LEKKIE SPOILERY <br /> <br /> There is a parallel world in which Gone In 60 Seconds is a dark, sharp, controversial independent film. Unfortunately, in this dimension, Gone ... is a flashy, vain, testosterone-driven moronfest with Nicolas Cage. <br /> <br /> For reasons that are not worth interfering, he and his large number of buddies have four days to steal fifty expensive cars, of which only one has an alarm. This crew consists of a guy with toy-shaped ears that apparently is the new Superman; a guy who ran electricity in X files; there was a professional footballer and two black men. <br /> <br /> Their enemies are the cops, the thieves of rival cars and Bilborough of Cracker, his accent in Manchester appropriately flattened and widened for the American public who is now used to this kind of thing from Daphne in Frasier. There is also Angelina Jolie, who has no character; in addition to being a tank for the sexual desires of men. She and Cage are supposed to be old flames, which is strange because they never have anything approaching a normal conversation over the entire 135-meter duration of the movie. <br /> <br /> In fact, the characteristics are so weak that whenever anyone has a "moment" in which the violin plays in the background to emphasize "emotions." This is not a spoiler that reveals that Vinnie Jones (who plays his famous maneuver of the "manual ball" by Paul Gasgoine and is quite dangerous when he is silent) receives only one line; not because his inability to speak is an integral part of the story, but because his eloquent summary of the dubious morality of the film after the appearance of silent all the way is ridiculous. Allegedly. After struggling with this in his "incompletely-acting-but-is-done" draw in London, Cage quips "I always thought you were from Long Island." My ribs, as you can imagine, were well and really tickled. <br /> <br /> In reality, humor is the most undeveloped aspect, from a tactical comedian policeman to two tokens of black figures. He sees this the biggest aspect of Hollywood; why a black man can not appear in a big movie without constant awareness of his skin tone and endlessly refer to him? A younger man, who, like the older one, talks all the time, says: "we, black people, do not like cold ... we are tropical people". Then he wants to burn the joint and see the roots. He is, of course, a parodying image of black people, but how funny is that? His older counterpart can not speak without referring to himself, and thus to his color, in the third person. "My black ass" is this "my black ass". Does anyone know any black people who say that? I did not think. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of the film is played almost continuously and with increasing volume, some songs - especially "Do not Stop The Rock" Apollo 440 - are so loud that they are more audible than sound effects and dialogue. The surrounds system separates even two to the point that it makes them sound like two different films running together. There is no concept of background music here, it's a phonetic equivalent of trying to watch a movie, while someone at the back of the cinema has a full stereo set. "Calm down, young man!" <br /> <br /> This is not the worst movie in the world and I liked it in many respects. It is simply predictable, lazy and thoughtless, with minimal effort in its construction. Apparently cinema expectations are much lower for this movie. It seems that after a few years of trash feeding for many years, the society is starting to wake up.
