When I work at a video store, I think it's my job to talk about the worst movies I've ever seen and to warn my friends and colleagues. In one day of particularly heated debate about what is the worst film, my friend dared to see me. The killer, even stating that if I could watch the whole movie and still claim that my previous choice was the worst film ever, he would watch it. I've lost. I believe that even I made better films than in high school, and these were not the great achievements of a young genius. The film lacked not only the production value (it looks like it was filmed on a bad camera, although it is surprisingly clear), but also in action (wooden, empty and pathetic, does not scratch the surface), and generally bad film feelings. I remember the scene in which I heard the breaking of glass, I suddenly remembered some bad plays in high school (I know I refer too often to high school, but this film seemed very young) both in terms of a set that seemed too fake, but also as if people were reading their poems from the script, not quite sure what is really going on. My review does not do this film justice, because I can not describe how awful the time I spent watching it. It's almost ironic that I'm doing a pitiful job describing a sorry excuse for the film.
