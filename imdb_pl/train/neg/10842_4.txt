Noting the cast, I recently watched the movie on TCM, hoping for an underestimated gem because I think a lot of movies from the 1930s. This is not a jewel - even semi-precious. The anachronistic clothing and Rolls Royce limousine from the 1930s hit you immediately. Casting is also weird. But above all, there are too many dumb and unnecessary plot devices. This film has many good ingredients and a basic plan that it promises, but the ingredients are not mixed according to the right recipe. It just does not connect as it should. It's a pity. With some fairly obvious but minor changes, it could have been a very good movie. <br /> <br /> The film is about an American dancer (Jean Harlow) looking for a rich British husband - preferably from the nobility. He meets Franchot Tone and his buddy who are on a lark in Rolls Royce belonging to his buddy's employer. Harlow mistakenly assumes that Tone is the Lord who owns the Rolls, and she adjusts to him. This early part of the movie is a light comedy without a real distinction. <br /> <br /> However, Tone unknowingly discovers the fact that his employer is in fact the German 5th columnist on the eve of World War I, and then the film changes tone completely and begins to fall apart. Tone and Harlow are married, but when the honeymoon begins, he is shot by Mata Hari (Benita Hume) and Harlow escapes from the scene and the observer accuses her of murdering Tone. (In fact, Tone regains health after the wounds.) <br /> <br /> Harlow escapes to France, where he falls in love again - this time with a rich French cary (Cary Grant). Tone, now in the army, and Harlow unexpectedly are brought back to Grant's hospital room, where he is in rehab from the plane crash. In the next scene, Tone accuses Harlow of abandoning him, because he is in fact a seeker of gold. Harlow never explains the witness "accusing her of murder and her panic! This is one of those unreal, feature-length interludes in the film. <br /> <br /> Then Tone again makes contact with the woman (Hume) who shot him. He's on hand to watch his lover, Grant, test the new plane Tone gave him from England. Incredibly, both Hume and Tone are poorly recognized, but they simply can not put in a place! Okay, so Tone was shot and almost died; maybe his memory is a bit unsuccessful. But how many men shot Hume, that he would forget one of his characters? (It seems that she fails to expire.) <br /> <br /> This is inexplicable and unnecessary. Hume should have recognized him completely, but he played it uncomfortably when she realized that Tone could not put it on. It would be a much better solution to this problem. <br /> <br /> The final is also very unsatisfactory. The film, as it was made, has Tone and Harlow conspiracy to preserve the good cad reputation, Grant, which led to his false funeral as a hero. Then Harlow and Tone just leave. It's great to keep the perception of the French hero of the national war, but very unsatisfying as a love story! <br /> <br /> The film begs: Harlow explains that she has fled in the face of accusations of murder; Ton forgives her and softly rekindles his love for her; then he carries a torch for her, even helping her to set up a crash site to preserve Grant's reputation. In the meantime, Harlow finally recognizes Grant for the cad he is. Then, seeing Ton for the courageous and noble man he is, Harlow also rekindles feelings for him. After the film is over, both of them will reconcile, even when they work together to mask Grant's death. After the funeral of the hero Grant, we see them embrace and kiss each other at the end of their lives. That would be a nice little movie. For fans of Cary Grant, it would be even better if Tone played the French cad who was killed and Grant suffering the first husband connected to Harlow. <br /> <br /> It is incomprehensible that Franchot Tone is cast as an Irishman living in England, while Cary Grant is cast as a Frenchman. This film would be much better if they changed roles. It would also be more beneficial for the movie, which should have been ...
