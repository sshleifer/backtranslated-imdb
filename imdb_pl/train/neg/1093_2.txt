Natividad kitten from the fame of Russ Meyer plays Chastity Knott, a woman who discovered she has breast cancer, so she goes to South America to get a special fruit (Crockazilla?), Which is supposed to have healing powers. After switching to some of these fruits (which seem to be plastic bananas on stems), Purity is endowed with certain mystical magical powers that make it a superhero, specifically a Double Avenger. Note that he also has underpants as a mask. In writing, everything sounds pretty good. Well, it leaves more than a little to be desired. It seems that Chastity owns a pub, and the local stripper is upset because he takes their business, so some of the strippers (including Haji, also from Russ Meyer's movie) follow her to destroy her. Of course, Chastity fights back in the Double D Avenger disguise. Watch how he performs a "Wonder Woman" spin to turn into an outfit and lose balance due to excessive centrifugal force. Bad jokes and lame, double people fly as if there was no tomorrow. With an endless theme song that is still repeating, it resembles a twisted "live" program from the 70's with adult content, although this is not a grade assessed in advance by PG-13 in the worst case scenario. And probably the blessing is that the faded stars were well covered. This makes Doris Wishman Chesty Morgan's films look great in comparison. The special appearance of Forest J. Ackerman, but so what. Very stupid and I never buy another movie with Joe Bob Briggs on the cover. 2 out of 10.
