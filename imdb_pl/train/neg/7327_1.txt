Severe moralism. Writers using characters as mouthpieces to speak for themselves. Predictable, crafting feature points (let's say five times quickly). Children's imitation Britney Spears. This movie has all the features of a special Lifetime Special. <br/> <br /> I sincerely believe that Jesus Nebot and Julia Montejo decided to create a provocative, emotional film about a difficult topic, exploring the idea that things are not always black and white, that one who by definition is a criminal, he is not necessarily a bad man, and there may be mitigating circumstances, especially when the child's good is placed first. However, their seriousness ends with conducting dialogues with teaching and banal situations to move the story. Decent production values ​​and interesting use of material from a documentary camera are not enough to achieve their goal when the script and acting collapse. <br /> <br /> Logic is often threatened because of tension: Soid first tries to blackmail Pablo to participate in her documentary film in exchange for help in escaping, and then in the same breath basically tells him not to he trusted because he does not help them in altruism. Well, duh. And for a man on the run, Pablo is too impressed with the rage of anger. Cristina's well-being is so important to him that he escapes capture, imprisonment or deportation, but is willing to risk everything to calm her down when she does not want to go to Mexico. Well. Discussion of excessively permissive parenting. Thirdly, when Pablo's employer, Charlie, gives the phone to Detective Bright, she is unprofessional, especially considering her seniority - did she really think she was persuasive? Oh, yes, I would join. Detective CCH Pounder could wipe the floor from it. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I would like to mention things that I liked. Um, I liked the little town. I liked the fact that the dwarf was called Sexy. Is cross-dressing, always a plus; juvenile cross-dressing! Harry is infinitely nicer than Cristina. But my favorite moment in the movie must be when Cristina kicks the detective Not-So-Bright. It is also interesting that in the cast of a very minority (which I also appreciate very much) the black figure is a racist. It is a pity that he is simply thrown out and is not investigated further. <br /> <br /> It is a distinctive, unconventional result, but in spite of this it is generally uncertain in terms of context, it does not improve the mood or tension in any scene, except for the pathetic, tormented wail every time the main character is in torment, as if he thought that his the acting does not show it enough: "In case you are not sure, he is upset, and we have musical proofs to prove it." <br /> <br /> A permanent, banal dialogue causes a depressing lack of subtext; everything must be expressed in dialogue, even if the body language was already up, until it was okay to give it. For example, every passionate speech by Pablo and Mrs. Knight's lament that her child will not fall into bed with them in the morning. <br /> <br /> "Papi, tell me again about my mother" - what a shameless, glaring exposition depicting a generic dead wife! (She is always the most beautiful woman the widower has ever seen, the sweetest one he has ever met, why do not we see a man crying over a woman like Shakespeare - he can be fat, ugly, ugly, but his love for her is Deep as the oceans? that would move me.) <br /> <br /> The police always literally take a step behind them, give you many scenes from the out-of-place feeling of a French farce. The most boring pursuits of the feet - Light and Lightning are so informal and easy to cheat (certainly not as fast as lightning, and she, well, I do not feel the need to say things). A guy pulling a small child who overtakes a bike policeman, along with a macho biker who is fighting and then beheaded by a child? Quoting Margaret Cho, it's so sad. Would we ever see it on "Cops"? <br /> <br /> Hackneyed and over-the-top deus ex machina: would you really give up checking your green card as an employer because it can quote the author's inspirational saying on the poster behind your desk? <br /> <br /> In addition, a few scenes, including the above, threatens to be transferred to pornography: "Well, I will do this favor for you, if you do something for me ..." I can almost hear the bowm-chicka-bowm-bowm . <br /> <br /> When parents see shots of Pablo's remorse, we have the weirdness of the most real movie. Unfortunately, this is diminished by the fact that it looks completely moved by its emotional speech until it goes ballistic. A more ambivalent appearance would be more convincing here. <br /> <br /> I am in constant fear of the stupidity of the main character doing everything for the sake of the story: holding a grocery store without a mask, visiting the grave of a deceased girl. And why does not her mother recognize his face when she saw him before he left ?! "You look terribly familiar ..." <br /> <br /> What is the purpose of this completely unnecessary, somewhat free scene with Soid and artificially improved bartender? Character development? Tch. Not enough, too late. <br /> <br /> Speaking of unnecessary features that have not gone anywhere, Detective Lightning says skeptical Detective Bright must be a Scorpio, shows how little he really knows about occultism. And I do not think faith in destiny really qualifies as jumbo voodoo mumbo. <br /> <br /> Finally, when Bright is holding Pablo, when he dies - wait, why is he worrying about her now? Her character is as inconsistent as Soid. What, she must shoot him just because she said "Stop, or I'll shoot"? (She cared about her honesty so far.) He was unarmed. There was no need to kill. What's wrong with shooting him in the leg to immobilize him? <br /> <br /> Finally, Cristina's childish acceptance of her mother's death gave Dr Knight a room with her daughter's death - so forced. And the idea of ​​a family whose child was killed becomes Cristina's new family ... It angers me that she can be the "deputy" of their little girl. It is also unrealistic that the white couple will occupy the Latin daughter of a man who killed his own daughter. I'm not saying that there are no generous, loving people who would do it. I'm just saying that the characters here are never sufficiently developed so that I can believe that __ will do it. <br /> <br /> I find it offensive that another IMDb reviewer said that, of course, as a woman, she was moved through the luscious scene. I am a woman who reserves my emotional movements for moments that are not sentimental in production. <br /> <br /> Co-screenwriter, co-director, co-star Nebot said he wore too many hats during this production. Too many chefs can spoil the broth, but one chef alone can end up in a special school. <br /> <br /> In summary, the title of this movie has less to do with the story, and more with the title feeling regret, helplessness and loss accompanying the discovery that you will never see your money again.
