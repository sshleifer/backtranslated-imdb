It is a dry and sterile feature film on one of the most interesting events in World War II and the history of wars behind the front line. The bad dramatic composition is the worst in this film, because the plot to kill Hitler was to be quite a dramatic event. There is no character development at all, and the idea that Tom Cruise is supposed to play the role of a high-ranking commander who questions his deepest inner thoughts of patriotism and betrayal is completely insane. I believe Mister Bin would play better. In general, the film looks more like a cheap copy of a good German TV movie "Stauffenberg" from 2004, but can not get closer to this movie when it comes to any aspect of the movie. However, the movie apparently reaches its financial goal thanks to the pop-corn audience who values ​​the Hollywood mood and shallow artistic values.
