Maybe you should not compare, but Wild Style and Style Wars are original hip hop. Beat Street has many original early Hip Hop artists, but it's clear that it may be a big break, of course it was nice for some and it's nice. But if you consider this to be an original hip-hop culture, you are wrong. It is overproduced and has a Hollywood sauce. Rather, look for the first two films I mentioned. They convey the gratitude that accompanies life in the ghetto. Yes, the rating of this movie is low, but the reviews are mostly positive and even crazy. Probably because history, acting, dialogues and direction are terrible, but music and dance are what people love about it. I, I love dancing, but at the time I thought that electro was the death of Hip Hop (I was glad when in 1986 a new generation of classic Hip Hop artists appeared, such as Krs One, Public Enemy, Ultramagnetic Mc, Jungle Brothers, Bizmarkie just to name a few), and I still do not like most bits in this movie and that's why it does not work for me. I mean, Wild Style has little history, but the music is great and authentic. Of course, flavors are different and that's fine. But when it comes to me, this movie is rubbish, with the exception of break dance and parts of music, so I can not rate it above 4 in 10.
