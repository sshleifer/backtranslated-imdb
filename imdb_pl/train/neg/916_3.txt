Lauren Bacall and Charles Boyer do not provide adequate chemistry in this film from 1945. <br /> <br /> There is a good story about the axes that are trying to get coal for the coming war. Unfortunately, this part of the story is not underlined. Instead, we're dealing with an allegedly contradictory Boyer. By the way, Bacall is as British as Vladimir Putin. <br /> <br /> Real acting actor wins an Oscar veteran, Katina Paxinou. As with her memorable Pilar in the Oscar winner of 1943, "Who are the ringtones for," Paxinou is again playing the Spanish revolutionary, but this time he is a double-handed match for the pro-Franco group. She is quite malicious here, especially when she throws a 14-year-old child out the window. She believed that Boyer gave the child important material to hide.
