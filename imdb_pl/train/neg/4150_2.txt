Oh, it really is. I've seen movies I did not like more for some reason, but I've never seen a movie that just fails in every aspect of making a movie. He can not even make a movie, in a way that can be said to be Hercules in New York. This is not a movie that I like the least, but it's the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Acting is the first thing that hits you. I've never seen a worse movie except pornography. In fact, I have a lot of pornographic films that work better than this. It's really awful. <br /> <br /> Technically, it's terrible. Working with the camera is amateur. Editing is pointless. I suppose they could not afford the right sound equipment, and that meant that every scene in the car (and there are a lot of them) rides at about three miles an hour, and each scene set outside in the same piece of forest (and is they're also a lot of them), or actually it's studio dubbing, again giving the bad porn climate. <br /> <br /> The plot is pointless, as many have noticed. I will defend vampires walking in the daylight because by the fact that it was popularized by Nosferatu, it was never originally part of the myths of vampires. <br /> <br /> Speaking of the myths of vampires, the writer apparently read Carmilla or at least saw The Vampire Lovers. I'm not sure how I feel about it, swaying under the impression that the film, in which this tragedy has at least some aspirations to the gothic novel, which I really like; or annoyed by his best references to the hammer, and in the worst total defilement of the source material. At least "General" is an offense to Peter Cushing. <br /> <br /> However, he gets two stars, just because I can not get to vote for one star for a movie he has, or at least supposedly has both vampires and zombies in him. By the way, I saw Lifeforce (another movie that has vampires and zombies) on the same day, and although it's a defective movie in itself, it really comes out of it. <br /> <br /> So in the end, it's not a movie that's so bad, it's good or bad, it's nice or drunk in any way. It's just a mess and it's not worth watching.
