Is it a coincidence that Orca was created two years after Jaws? Orca is not exactly a "rip off", but it is obvious that he tried to take advantage of the success of Jaws. First of all, Orca was in my opinion a bad movie, not terrible, but definitely not very good, at best mediocre. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically a male orc (plowing) after seeing his partner and his unborn boy killed by a fisherman looking for revenge. I could not watch this movie again. The direction of this film is poor, and compared to JAWS it seems that the director, producers and writers were almost without talent. <br /> <br /> In terms of acting, it was very average and reliable, but the real characters are not the least sympathetic. The effects were fine on time, and the orc movie material looked pretty good. <br /> <br /> Violence is confusing, bloody and not recommended for more sensitive people. The music is exaggerated and very loud, drowning out sound effects and sometimes annoying. I hated it, as they exaggerated the killer's whale intelligence (plowing is not associated only with one partner, as shown in Orca). reasons listed above. Some people may appreciate this movie more because of the concept of revenge among animals and people, so I'm not going to break this movie and I can understand why some people like it. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 10 (but probably 5/10 for his concept)
