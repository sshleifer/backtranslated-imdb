The beginning of this movie was good. It started to be really stupid when he told people he wanted to kill himself. I think if I came from such a small town, I would be offended after watching this movie. They made many of them look stupid and crazy. How can these people do so little that they follow him all day. Many times these people told him how to kill themselves, as if they were persuading him to do so. How can so many people have little respect for other people? I also think that they could finish this movie much better. There were also some good parts for this movie. Some may like it, but I do not recommend it to anyone.
