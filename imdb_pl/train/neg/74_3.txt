They constructed this as a kind of fantasy Man From Snowy River meets Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid, and for romantic touch Ned and Joe can play with high-class talent, bored young wives of rich older men. OK, there are many myths about Ned Kelly, but there are also many well-documented facts, still leaving room for artistic creativity in creating a good historical dramatization. This is not the story of Robin Hood, not Arthurian legends, not Beowulf, not someone who is so wrapped in the fog of many centuries that any reproduction of their lives and times is 99% guessing. These are just a few lives ago. My grandparents were already in school when Ned was hanged. <br /> <br /> So it's stupid that I fancy imagining that this movie was a serious attempt to tell the story of Kelly. After reading Peter Carey's great novel "The Real History of Kelly's Gang" recently, I was looking forward to seeing it in a similar tone. But no, the fact is that Mick Jagger, a very ridiculed 1970 Kelly, was probably much closer to reality and a better movie at all, which does not say much. <br /> <br /> I'm glad it just cost me two dollars to rent a DVD! I'll give him 3/10, and that's just because some pretty pictures of the Australian bush make me feel generous.
