Well, this is the first post I'm commenting on IMDb., You understand, this movie has caused me to come and warn all good souls who will stop experimenting with films. <br /> <br /> Like most of them I have published my comments. I thought about seeing this movie because it seemed like it had some decent actors (although reading the worst critics against this movie) I thought about experimenting, assuming it was some comedy movie . Well, it all started well, comedies ... it all began to be pathetic ... you can believe your own self, you feel like walking and banging your head every time when a hopeless woman is called the heroine of the movie. ..Huh ~~ Well, how much a person can digest sick ALL PERFECT spirits that try to do everything to irritate you and stop you from doing what you do. <br /> <br /> Another worst thing about the film is the hero of "ZOMBIE", just as he loses his fianc√© who wanders like a goat, with black marks under his eyes. And the "terribly stupid" sister of the hero. You will bleed from head to toe, if you try and succeed, watching this whole movie ~!
