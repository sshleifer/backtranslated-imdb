The DVD was a joke, the audio for the first few minutes was awful with a synchronized sound, and the Segal√≥w voice was not even its !!!! Pathetic! When sound synchronization was better in about 5 minutes, poor plot, lines and actors should get a different job because the film business is not where it should be. <br /> <br /> While Segal had some good films in the early days, the latest ones are a joke and should be for him and for the company that created them, shame. <br /> <br /> If Segal was the one who did it, it's better to return to the next party running the show because there is no talent, what ever is in it. <br /> <br /> This film is a complete embarrassment for everyone involved in its production and a disgrace to everyone who saw it. I turned it off in about 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> I am asking for a refund in Block Buster! Mark from Ontario, Canada
