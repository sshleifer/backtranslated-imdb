First of all, this movie is not a "thriller". It is not "gripping, tight". It could be based on a script, but the slow pace of this direction makes it difficult to get into it. <br /> <br /> The thread itself is very interesting and ingenious. Unfortunately, we only have * an idea * how brilliant after the end of the photo. We have more than two hours of long sequences with music over them interrupted by some action scenes that will not catch the viewer, and "clever foxes" that introduce a bit more overt intelligence. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that it was not a quick thriller that promised a box. It would be a great movie. Instead, Spike Lee forced him to the end.
