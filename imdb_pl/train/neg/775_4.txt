John Candy. Do you need more information? He is the main reason why you should see this movie. Most people do not realize how talented he was as an actor. Watch him change from a poor man into a horny moron. It's enough to change your face (subtle) and leave. There are many great bits in this movie and a lot of really stupid bits. The best moments for me are KUNG FU U scenes, as well as a great moment when John (in a trance) enters the stage and talks about how much he loves his girlfriend - so much he and his genitals love his girlfriend. I'm sure you'll read this, you can think that this sequence sounds really primitive. It is, but it is also very funny because John Candy does the same. The story is generally pretty bad, and Eugene Levy and Joe Flaherty (both SCTV graduates with Candy) did not get enough to do in the film. Levy has his moments, especially making the wedding at the end (think Rod Serling) and a great scene when he talks to his mother on the phone. Generally a good movie if you've had a hard day and you have to put your mind on stupidity. I give it 4 out of 10.
