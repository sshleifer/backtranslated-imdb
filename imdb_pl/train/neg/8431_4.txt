Although the actors do a convincing job, playing losers who parade the screen, the fact that these characters are impossible to identify, made me look at my watch only 20 minutes in the movie (and more than once). The development of the plot is chaotic and slow, the verbal diarrhea of ​​the only friend of the main character is practically unbearable, the basic quality of most of the protagonists' actions and the bachelor way they treat is annoying. <br /> <br /> It is typical for Ventura Pons to issue disruptive mentally handicapped people. However, this artificial sociological analysis is a big step down from CARICIAS or Caresses, where the heroes get hurt and despise themselves for the well-founded reasons that take place during this film. At AMOR IDIOTA, we are forced to follow the meanders of a truly atypical intelligence when it follows a depressed and detached woman. Apparently this is due to his own depression, but the script does not support it. I will not reveal the rest of the story in case there were masochists there? Is he cured by his obsession, or is the woman shocked by her own depression thanks to his unwavering remark? Even though I was watching the whole thing, it was not taken care of even for a moment. <br /> <br /> If you can sit through all these prejudices, ignorance, betrayal, bad dialogue, poor philosophy, etc. the work with the camera was quite good and it seems that it is inspired by the DOGMA group. The makeup seemed to be meant to show these players in raw and austere light, because the worst thing was that I saw Cayetana Guillen Cuervo in any of her films (while he personally is really attractive). <br /> <br /> I suppose that when it comes to the fact that we should be forced to see the lower classes of society, so that we would be grateful that we are not part of it, Pons achieved its goal. The barrage of almost identical sex scenes was a proper waste of the movie (if the actors were filmed, but once in the blue-green clothing the background behind them could be changed in the special effects studio for a pittance). It is true that I have heard most of the male audience squirm in their seats during this, but objective viewing proves that this was not the real purpose of these scenes. <br /> <br /> Save yourself and watch something else.
