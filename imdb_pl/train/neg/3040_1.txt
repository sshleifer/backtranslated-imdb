With a title like this you know that you have a lot of garbage. Acting badly. Bad script. The director is angry. Grammar of evil. <br /> <br /> The film makes a lot of noise that really is not music, and many people shout. The film makes a bad racial stereotype. Why does every movie with a black hero have a drug addict? Why does the hero always have to dance to succeed? Why does a famous rapper always have to be in a dance film? Why the letters "s" can not be in the title? <br /> <br /> Hollywood must stop the stupid audience and make a movie in which people with brain know how to speak English. > Do yourself a favor and do not go see.
