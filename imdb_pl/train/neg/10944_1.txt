I've seen a lot of bad movies. I like bad movies. Particularly bad action movies. I saw (and liked) all of Jean-Claude Van Damme's films, including the one in which he is his own clone, both in which he plays the twins, and all three in which he is a cyborg. Actually, I own the one in which the fashion designer plays and fights in a truck full of durians. (Hey, if he has nothing else, he has a great ass and you can almost always see it.) You can even pause and enlarge the DVD!) So you can trust me when I say that this movie is so bad, it makes Plan 9 look like like Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> Everything about Snake Eater is bad. The plot is bad. The script is bad. Sets are bad. The fights are bad. Acrobatics are bad. FX are bad. Acting is spectacularly evil from Earth's time, probably portraying the worst performance of every so-called cast actor, including Lorenzo Lamas, and that really says something. And I would like to bet that everyone involved in this movie is poor in bed to get started. ESPECIALLY Lorenzo Lamas. <br /> <br /> Manages to be involuntarily funny, so it is not a total loss. However, I recommend watching this movie only if you are an inborn idiot or very, very high dose. I could sit down myself because I had to watch something that distracted me from washing away the cat's urine from the laundry room. <br /> <br /> It did not help much, but it was better than nothing. One point for Ron Palillo's episode as a gay arsonist.
