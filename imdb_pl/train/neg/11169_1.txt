Are you joking?! A show that highlights a person who opens cans and envelopes for a meal? How much do you have to be talented to do it? MAY be able to cook, but this is NOT presented in this half-hour painful production of the stomach. I know he has the empire of Martha-Stewart-esquire. Like Warren Buffett, but I do not see it with fake knockers that open cans of corn cream and Alpo. <br /> <br /> He has a nephew named ... Brycer. Brycer? Stop talking about someone so stupid. <br /> <br /> More time is spent on "table-tables" than on cooking. Who has such a time ?! Silicon should be on the spatula, not on my TV set. This program should be at Cartoon Network, NOT Food Network.
