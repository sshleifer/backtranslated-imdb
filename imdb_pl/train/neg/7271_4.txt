It could have been the gay equivalent of Gone With The Wind, given its epic length, but instead it satisfied itself by being a huge chain of empty episodes in which nothing happens. Characters are one-dimensional and have no other development in history (there really is no history) than searching for themselves and kissing. It is a pity that an interesting aesthetic proposition, like almost no dialogue, is completely wasted in the film, as it makes no effort to study the heroes' psychology with some dignity and achieve real emotional resonance. In addition, he pretends to be an "artistic" film, using the worst naive stereotypes of cinematic snobbery. But in any case, if someone can identify with his heavy banality, it's probably good.
