This film is a rather strange combination of musical, romance, drama and crime with the smell of noir movie. Essentially, this is one mess with different species, none of which really works as it should. <br /> <br /> This film is Mickey Rooney's attempt to be treated more seriously as an actor. He is a former child-star who has always played in happy comic and musical productions at the beginning of his career. In this film, he chooses a different approach (although musical aspects are still present in the film). But his role in the film is quite funny. I mean Mickey Rooney as a tough player? He is an extremely small boyish-looking man. He was about thirty years old during this film, but he looks seriously at the age of 16. Hearing Babe talking to women and hearing them talking to gangsters who are about three times bigger than him, he does not look and feel good. It is simply not convincing in its role. <br /> <br /> Because the film combines so many different genres, the story also seems to be messy. There's a crime plot somewhere, and there's a romantic plot in it and one about your dream life, but none of them really works because of the mess and dealing with it all. It is simply not an interesting or attractive movie to watch. László Kardos is also a director who has made only 10 films during his lifetime, despite the fact that his career spans from 1935 to 1957. He had to be a director struggling with difficulties who had difficulty getting to work in the industry and instead, once he received a smaller script to work. His films are unknown and usually they are not very high quality. <br /> <br /> Let's also not forget that it is a movie from the 1950s, but more like a movie from the 1940s, and maybe even from one summer to the 30's. This is of course mainly due to the fact that this film was shot in black and white. Generally speaking, black and white movies from the 1950s often have a cheap look, and this film is no exception. <br /> <br /> It's a rather strange sight when Mickey Rooney and Louis Armstrong and his team appear together in sequence. However, it was not the only movie in which Armstrong appeared and often appeared in this type of films, often just as a film. I think jazz fans can still enjoy watching this movie because of his music, because there are quite a lot of it in this movie. The film was nominated for an Oscar for the best original song. <br /> <br /> Awkward little movie and leaving Mickey Rooney. <br /> <br /> 4/10
