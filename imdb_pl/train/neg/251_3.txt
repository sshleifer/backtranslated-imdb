I was sooo excited to see this movie after I finally read the book this week. My 13-year-old son waited for it too. I rented it and hugged it to enjoy the classic holiday history revived on the screen. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was disappointed. This movie has detached itself from the book more times than you can forgive. George C. Scott is a great actor, but in this case it seemed that he was only about 20% of the time. For the rest of the time it was quite flat. <br /> <br /> I realize that it was in '84, pre-CG effects, mostly. But it looked like it was a B-quality movie, especially a meeting with Jacob Marley. <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointment was that they missed one of the most moving parts of history: When the Spirit of Christmas Present takes Scrooge on a vortex journey around the world, watching people in the darkest circumstances still having light and love for Christmas. <br /> <br /> I admit that Mr. Scott did a good job with the "reformed" Scrooge at the end. It was a refreshing portrait. <br /> <br /> I would like Bob Cratchit to be portrayed as a little ragged and trodden. And Tiny Tim ... oh, do not even start me with bad actors ...
