It is a sensible effort to summarize this movie. A good movie from the sixties, but without a sense of achievement. Maggie Smith gave a decent performance that was credible enough, but not as good as she could, the other actors were just horrible! A scary portrait. It was not too funny, so it did not really reach its genres because it was not particularly fun and it was not dramatic. The only genre achieved at a satisfactory level was romance. Target recipients were not hit and the video sent misleading messages. A very simple storyline and a very simple storyline were not removed or made, and people were confused about why the film was not so good and who the target audience was, etc. However, Maggie was quite good and the story was fine with the moments of opportunity. <br /> <br /> 4.
