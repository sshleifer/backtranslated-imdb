I thought they should name this movie "White" instead of "Highness". A nagging ... kind of movie that makes people hate New Yorkers. People who are so obsessed with themselves and think their life is so important ... give me peace. Such a white lily, which Glenn Close was the most ethnic figure in this film, demanded that someone really come in and steal it ... so they represent, gain, a figure even whiter than the rest I cast (I thought he was an albino at the beginning), who should be Welsh! I'm still trying to decipher this accent! Intellectually dishonest ... this film is a kind of film that can deceive so many people that they think it is worth it, because it has something more ambitious in itself. It's better to fill MI5-10 theaters than that pretentious shit ... there had to be a better game because you can not fall off the floor.
