This film has received a lot of bad press from people who do not understand what it was meant to be. It must be understood that this film was never to be taken seriously. It's a camp, like the Army of Darkness. AoD was stupid, but in a fun and bad way. "House of the Dead" is not "good bad". <br /> <br /> There are good qualities for good camping videos, the most important of which are reliable. You have to believe in what is happening in the movie to see humor when the situation goes incredibly bad. Without borders, the film becomes absurd. HotD has no credibility. <br /> <br /> What's worse, HotD brings nothing new to the genre and repeats the same twists and reactions of characters that many horror movies inevitably show off. For example, too often, horrors fall into a trap in which the main characters find love among blood and destruction. I do not know about you, but when I'm chased by zombies, I want to meet a hot rod. Believe it? No? Then you probably will not believe it when the characters start to suck each other's faces in this movie. <br/> <br /> In addition to the obvious problems that plague this movie, like many other horror movies, Uwe Boll decided to add scenes from a video game with zombies being shot, randomly when the character shoots zombies in the movie. Not only is there no clear justification for this artistic choice, but it distracts attention from the already unbelievable plot. What's more, there are frequent and numerous examples of bad acting and seemingly no director's attempts to direct the actors' reactions to events ... leaving the film unnecessary. Avoid...
