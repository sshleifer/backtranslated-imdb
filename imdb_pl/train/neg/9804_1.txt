Power Rangers, a moronic television program for children from the 90s, must be the most meaningless and funny television program ever made. <br /> <br /> What is the purpose of this program, apart from selling the second, evaluate the plastic nonsense for children? In any case, there is nothing that can be done or interested in this program. <br /> <br /> Look at the costumes that look like a broken spandex. <br /> <br /> Hair, earrings and fashion from the early 90s look quite ridiculous today. <br /> <br /> Avoid this program at all costs!
