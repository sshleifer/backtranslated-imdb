I recently saw this with my wife and I found out that he is better than Caine believes, although it is not much of a policeman. The biggest British film actor in history does not seem too interested in this role, which is a pity, because he could raise it with more conviction in his game. Rex Harrison seems even less embarrassing, maybe not surprising because his character is very poorly written. William Holden is better, but his time on the screen is fleeting and again his character is not well written. <br /> <br /> Beverly Johnson is such a beautiful woman as I've ever seen, but she has little to do, the film could have gained a lot by focusing more on her history. Ustinov steals the performance, but basically a comic character that does not match the serious tone of the movie. Music is poor, and Omar Sharif creates one of his aimless scenes (his career has been based on it for decades). an annoyingly unpredictable film director, and this is one of his weaker films.
