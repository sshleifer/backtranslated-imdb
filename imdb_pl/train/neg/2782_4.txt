I just saw this movie last weekend, I'm upset and disappointed with it. Basically, the movie tells you that immigrants, especially those from the former Soviet Union, come to this country, bring with them all who can with each other from the old country, and attack and take over what the Americans are working for. This is a very bad way of looking at immigration and a much worse way of talking about people. This is the most important. Another thing is general writing, directing and filming at the level of rural amateurs. The actors did quite well, but they did not care to save this shit. A few jokes were funny, but most were bad and bad. I could not wait to get out of the theater, ask for a refund.
