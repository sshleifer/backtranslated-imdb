I must say that it was the worst priyadarshan movie (release with much better kyonkami, which was also his director's venture), it does not contain any specific plot and focuses only on the shows of the body of debuting actresses and stupid comedic sequences. I think that priyadarshan is becoming too repetitive in his comedy movies, as did govinda and David dhavan in the past, after they gave some good artists who also lost their audience. So it will be good if you focus more on the scenario and try a few variations towards it. Give us more weekly herapheri and malamal, than duds like garam masala!
