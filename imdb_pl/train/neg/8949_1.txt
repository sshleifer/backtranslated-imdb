A few weeks ago I read George Orwell's classic novel from 1984. I was fascinated by it and thought it was one of the best books I've read lately. So when I rented a DVD, I was intrigued by how this adaptation improved. Unfortunately, the film did not even come close to creating an atmosphere or creating characters that Orwell did so masterfully in his book. The director seems to think that everyone watching the movie read the book because he does not try to show WHY heroes work and feel like they do. John Hurt, the main actor, is shaky all the time and almost does not work to the end. We never really know what he's doing for life, why his romance is forbidden, what the political climate is, and why the protagonist wants rebellion. This book can not be done fairly in the form of a film without proper narrative and explanation of the political system oppressing heroes, and the fact that they are missing is the biggest disadvantage of this film. In addition, John Hurt was an awful casting choice, about 15 years older than the 39-year-old Winston he was about to portray. However, more positively, the rest of the cast was well chosen. It is a pity that they were placed in such a terribly adapted film with the wrong main actor. -Brian O.
