It seems that everyone can make a movie today. All you need is a camera, a group of people to be your cast and crew, a screenplay, and some money and a walla you have a movie. The problem is that talent is not always part of this equation, and often such low budget films turn out to be a failure. The shelves in video stores are filled with these so-called Films. They are not even pleasures, they are just a waste of celluloid, which is better to forget. Troma Entertainment is known for producing a trash cinema, but most of their films are film gold. However, some of the films they staged had nothing to do with the creation, and some, like Nightmare Weekend, did not deserve any form of release. <br /> <br /> Pros: cast members do their best, with bad material. Some unintentional gaiety. Moves at a good pace (it should be 81 minutes). <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: a horrible letter that contains a rotten dialogue and countless holes in the story. Poorly lit, especially night scenes and ending that is not visible at all. Does not make sense. Badly rated. Cheap and very old effects. The total lack of character development and nobody cares. It's supposed to be a horror movie, but it's missing in this area and it's not the least scary. Nothing exciting and exciting is happening. Loaded with an unnecessary complement. <br /> <br /> Recent thoughts: I never expected it to be a forgotten gem, but I never thought it would be so bad. I do not know if it's the worst movie ever made, but it's a definite rival. Troma should let this film be rotten rather than spend it. Do not make the same mistake I made and let your curiosity get the best out of you. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/5
