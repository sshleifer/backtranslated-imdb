This is embarrassment for everyone and everything used to create this joke. Personally, I do not care if Jessica Simpson and her talent or anything that fascinates her. Like a movie, it's something that does not even get a positive rating at a film school. The script is a mess, the acting is terrible, and the fact that Luke Wilson (co-writer of "Bottle Rocket") did it, makes me wonder what the hell he was thinking. He did "Old School" for loud crying! It does not even belong to the same state as my DVD "Old School"! Please, for any reason DO NOT WATCH THIS! I see that there is such a comment that it is so bad that it is good, but to be honest it is too nice. When we stop seeing singers who apparently can not act, we try, hopefully it will end soon. The worst thing is that there are indeed some decent actors (Penelope Ann Miller, Rachel Leigh Cook and Luke Wilson) who are part of this drop. As for the story, it is almost non-existent and so badly made and written (yes, I know it's another transformation). I doubt very much that anyone would remember that. Please, whatever you do, do not waste your time, but if you do, regret the REAL actors involved in wasting time bombing. Jessica Simpson you are pretty, but stick to singing, although I'm not too fan of it. And who made this movie, I would not put it in my CV. 1/10, because you can not give a zero.
