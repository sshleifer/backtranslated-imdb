this movie has no story, no character development or budget. it really sucks, in short. Because there is no development of the film, you can not even consider him an artist or attempt to make a statement against torture. Which leave two other reasons to watch it. Be shocked or get off like a sick little freak. Well, it's not here either. The girl's reactions seem stupid. it is very easy to say that this is false (honestly professional stocks look more realistically than the nonsense they try to get around in this movie.) They throw on her guts, but most of them are asleep, so she's just stupid. really worth the trouble is the end when they quickly break the stage to the stage just before the needle enters her eye, but honestly the girl is extremely ugly and everything is incredibly fake except the eye. Torture film, watch Hostel and Hostel 2. Both contain not only realistic violence, but also a real story that attracts you and makes you take care of people, and tow films really work at a deeper level, taking into account topics such as American fears of foreigners, issues of morality, testing how far a person can go, human instincts and civilization and many other things, iolence. They are much better six choices for this piece of nonsense
