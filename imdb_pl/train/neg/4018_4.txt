This movie is too skeletal. It's quite a low-budget movie (I hope!), Which justifies it a bit, but the lack of a decent cast and a crafted plot hurts him too much. Phillips is quite credible in his role as a torn son of a wealthy family who is looking for himself (though his family is ... e ... well, a bit too white ...), but the rest of the cast captures the straw. Any moment that has potential is ruined by excessive melodrama and there are * way * too many sub-threads (which is an obvious sign of no plot ... I need a filler ...) I would not recommend this movie to anyone who is not a hard Phillips fan or not it has absolutely * nothing * to do. 4/10.
