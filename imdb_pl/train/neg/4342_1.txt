I have to say it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. They had quite a good plot, but they did it so badly. First of all, the cast is wrong, where does the van peeble come from (nonsense actor) and puff daddy ??? It seems that Carlito came from the hood and used to hang around with real idiots. This film does not do the "Carlitos Way" of any justice. I am so happy that the first part of "Carlito's Way" appeared first, if I saw this trash first, I would never give a chance to the pacino version. Anyway, pacino is going to read this story, he thought it was shit and he did a sequel instead. Carlito's Way: Rise to Power - 1 of 10 Carlito's Way - 9 out of 10.
