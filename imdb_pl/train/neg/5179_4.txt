Without an effective supernatural or poetic inducement motivating the nuances of humanity, this entire creative team must hope for the effective use of its average, non-original elements. "Party of Five" has become manic, and genetically unavoidable is not of much interest, because the unique non-lethal element is the secondary mesthee "Wes Bentley." In fact, all activities are deep. Although dark-haired women speak, flare-up is kept to a minimum. No nakedness here. There is also a lack of enough buckets of blood. All sensations are kept in a sensitive, safe distance ... the unfortunate fact, given the name of the directors, is "butcher". Only the soundtrack, the buzzing of an angry alt-country and the strained, variable note provide tangible tension. Sometimes, some static storyboard compositions add attractive lower angles that add a bad feeling ... but in the case of a movie that is called a horror film, I have not even come close to flinching. Perhaps a greater emphasis on social rejuvenation through blood consumption, scenes aimed at various geometric shapes outside the square and constant focus on playfulness through the maliciousness of the family or the trap of sympathetic characters that must escape to escape the dilemma, would improve my opinion but it was not good the beginning of my trip through horrorfest.
