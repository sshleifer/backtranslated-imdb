This film is considered by some to be classic - I have no idea why. It's so scary that it's funny. The only advantage of this movie is to provide bad lines that are so embarrassing that you have no choice but to laugh at them. <br /> <br /> There are a few good songs and a good choreography movie, but YES WHAT! There is no plot, it is set in the theater without any change of scenery, and Michael Douglas is just as depressing as ever. My brother once forced me to watch this movie because he said I would not believe how a bad movie could get! He was right. <br /> <br /> I usually recommend with a film so terrible that people will not watch it, but in this case I think people should, because it will put every other bad movie that you saw in perspective.
