I just sent an email to a friend who is at the film school about this movie. Something to avoid when creating a movie - characters clanging meaninglessly, overflowing, intricate screen monologues that are ultimately banal and unconvincing. If the film is an attempt at social realism, these verbal barriers are so exaggerated that they pay attention to a film constructed as a film and effectively neutralize this intention. Is this acting or a scenario that is bad or both? <br /> <br /> The hero is also unbelievable in social realism - voraciously absorbing canonical English literature and the Bible, when it is high or hangover, and is able to produce such deeply complex histories of monologues in the state of intoxication? And how can such an unattractive, unwashed and verbally harmful figure sleep most women in a few minutes of meeting? (I had to applaud when one of the staff finally threw him out onto the street, despite his moan and regret over himself). <br /> <br /> The spectator meets pretentious references to ancient Greek literature, Nostradamus and the Book of Apparitions. The imminent punishment of humanity, in the form of bar codes imprinted on our foreheads or right hands in a terrible, biblical way, is presented to a character who is so cleverly revealed in his role as the guardian of empty space. <br /> <br /> This film is exaggerated and at the top - melodrama awkwardly filled with pedestrian "philosophy" about the meaning of humanity, life, etc. It is trivial, overgrown and tedious. <br /> <br /> There are some very good English movies with content similar to this movie. "Nil by Mouth" is a perfect, much more interesting trip in the lives of individuals in a similar social environment. As in "In the Warzone". And although the comparison is not even justified, check out everything that Peter Greenaway, who cleverly deals with dialogue, wit and absurd figures and situations.
