Sundown - involving the weakest, most expensive vampires I have ever seen, which was accompanied by one of the most unsuited, pretentious results ever written - and Shane the vampire, whose every move and spoken word was so absurd that I burst out laughing half a time and turned down looking at rest. <br /> <br /> It seems that vampires do not have any special powers - out of power (sometimes), being able to turn off the lamp with their mind (once) and ... That's it, really. Have you ever imagined Count Dracula distracted from battling because he lacked bullets? Me neither. Virtually any other movie - Dracula would eat this for breakfast, slim his followers and use their bones as toothpicks. <br /> <br /> The main story of the movie is that four people are caught in a fight with a gang of vampires - Dracula versus an old man. It could have been a good old B-flick game, but too dramatic music was clearly written by someone who took the film a little too seriously, and eventually ruined the rest of the movie that has not yet been ruined by clay bats, average acting and a funny script . <br /> <br /> In the end it's too stupid to be funny. Sure, he has some fun moments, but they are few and far from each other.
