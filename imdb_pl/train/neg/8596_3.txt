Essentially, it is a pale shadow High Fidelity, which was a witty and wonderfully preserved movie with some truly winning characters. Watching detectives has nothing like that. <br /> <br /> The premise of a video shop geek swept away by a bizarre mysterious woman is good, but it is never fully or adequately explored thanks to a very poor script and misunderstanding in running, not to mention the real visual style of storytelling. I mean, this movie focuses on VIDEOS, but it's incredibly unceremonious in itself! It is a serious failure. <br /> <br /> But the main problem is that we do not care about the main characters, because the script and actors (Murphy and Liu) do not make them real or nice in any real way. So the film becomes a series of episodes with the participation of two people who seem to be, not terribly interesting. <br /> <br /> Oh, yes, another thing: for a romantic comedy? It's not funny. Romance is not too romantic either. <br /> <br /> So avoid this. Even during the 90-minute run, it's just not worth sitting ...
