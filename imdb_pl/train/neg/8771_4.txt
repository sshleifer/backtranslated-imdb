Okay, I was bored and decided to see this movie. But I think that the main thing that brought this movie was the recording time, actually the same hour repeated 4 times. It consists of 1. Meeting of soldiers and discussion of the plan of attack, 2. Retrospectives for male wives 3. Approach of soldiers marching in a long line 4. Men run up the hill and shoot, usually the first hits the head then three other men rescuing him. 5. Defeat the enemy and call the base to tell the story of success. 6. Men return to their wives and sing 10 minute songs. It was a basic movie and the same order of events took place about 4 or 5 times. and each time he made a retrospective to his wives, he would show the man, his wife and him. There were about 10 men or more who would have a flashback, so it took a lot of time. Besides, men could not kill the enemy with bayonets or grenades. I liked music and there was a lot of action, although the action was repeatable. Generally, I probably would not see it again, but it was not too scary.
