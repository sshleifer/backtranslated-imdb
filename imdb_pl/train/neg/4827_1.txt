If this movie is to discourage people from doing drugs, it fails. I was ready to start using them. I waited for something that happened and nothing really happened. This film is neither a horror nor a drama. It's just a paranoia of met users. This movie can win an award for using the word "F" so often and so uselessly. It was not well said, but I felt that they were doing Meth to replace Meth, who was guilty of someone. Hector was getting worse and more paranoid when the film lasted and the girl became even more hopeless. The ending did not really make sense. The movie did not make sense unless it only showed how annoying it is to get stuck in a deserted home with a met-head. I based my opinion on other opinions when I decided to watch this film, and the rating of this film should be much lower.
