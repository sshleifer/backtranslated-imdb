It's a terrible movie! The nomination for the Golden Globe had to be against some real smelly one. They took over the history of the first famous renaissance painter and distorted him beyond recognition. My complaint is not that they used the facts; if the story was good, it would be fine. But it's just weird - in every respect, the real story of this artist would be much better, so why did they come up with this boring scenario? I suppose there were not naked people in the actual version. Finally, the artist's life was hurriedly summarized - we could save a few hours if they favored the rest of the film with the same brevity.
