This movie was bad. Bad acting, bad directing, bad writing. But it was not bad in a fun way. It was bad in a boring way. I watched "Surface to Air" because I thought it might be laughter. There was no. Do not make the mistake I made. There are many more pleasant ways to spend one and a half hours, such as watching dry paint or reading a dictionary. Seriously.
