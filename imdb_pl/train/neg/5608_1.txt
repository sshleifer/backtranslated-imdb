I was curious to watch this movie. Many people seem to be excited. I also have my beliefs. I believe in Jesus Christ, but I am open to all views and opinions. It does not matter to me whether Jesus existed in the way it is written in the Bible. If Mary was a virgin or not, or all similar pagan coincidences. For me, the idea of ​​salvation, the idea of ​​love is the only way to find peace in this world. <br /> <br /> What angers me, when someone takes a sentence, presents it as a fact, but without showing the context in which it was written. For example, they showed the following sentence in this film: "My enemies who did not want me to be king over them - bring them here and kill me before me" Jesus (Luke 19:27) What did they do? tell it's a context. Jesus told the story of the evil king. There is no passage in the Bible in which Jesus supports killing. He is love! After citing the wrong Bible, we are presented by shouting people (pseudo-Christians) filled with hatred. Most viewers do not check the information provided, so they start thinking that Jesus = hatred = not for me or for anyone else. They are people of pure manipulation. Use your brain. Do not take everything for the fact that they are telling you in this movie. We destroy our own foundation, our civilization, if we start to dismantle Jesus in this way and the message he brought us. You saw the branch you're sitting on.
