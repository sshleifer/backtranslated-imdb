I rented a dubbed English version of Lensman, hoping that since it comes from well-known novels, it will have some content. While in the film there were traces of content, most of them did not exceed the cartoon level for kids. Maybe the movie was a bad adaptation of the book, or it lost a lot in the dubbing version. Or maybe the source novels were light. But for some reason there was not much. <br /> <br /> I noticed many details that were derivative, slovenly, poorly dramatized or otherwise inadequate. A few examples: Opening scenes looked like borrowed from the 2001 scene of the "Star Gate" and the image of Star Wars hyperspace. The robot on the combine looked like an anthropomorphized "R2-D2". <br /> <br /> It starts to try to borrow a comic style of Star Wars relief, but fortunately (since humor does not work), he gives in to comedy and plays seriously. In this sense, it is better than the Star Wars series, which started with a clever sense of humor and eventually worsened to Jar-Jar's annoying stupidity. <br /> <br /> The agricultural details were apparently pulled out by someone who had never seen a farm. The combine traveled through the uncovered field center, throwing the silage into uncollected crops, instead of working from one side to the other and throwing the silage over the already collected rows or to the truck. Maize (maize) poured the chute, but the farm lands were drawn like a field of wheat. <br /> <br /> When it was time for Kim's father to face his fate, there was no dramatic weight on the stage. It could have been partly the fault of an English-speaking voice actor, but the drawings did not show any weight either. Kim's reactions in this scene were similarly unconvincing. <br /> <br /> Similarly, when a character named Henderson was killed, Chris showed a very small reaction, although apparently they were supposed to be close. (Henderson's death is not a spoiler, his name is not revealed until his death). It seems that he immediately forgets him. Someone expressing compassion shows more feelings than she does. I think that the voice actor deserves the majority of guilt in this case; Chris's drawings are at least a bit of a feeling. <br /> <br /> On several occasions villains do not follow their orders. The leader of the villains often punishes these failures with unhappy deaths. I can not tell if it's a Star Wars effect or if it comes from an earlier source - probably Lensman's books. <br /> <br /> There is a scene in which the spaceship lands. As it sinks into the ground, the parts break the ship. But so many pieces fall away that by the time he lands, there should be nothing after him. <br /> <br /> Although in most cases Chris seems to be a competent, hard space hero, there is a scene in which he screams like an incompetent lady in danger. Someone hard enough to deal with Henderson's death so quickly should at least be able to shout, "Help me, I can not reach my weapon!" instead of just yelling. <br /> <br /> The character with the greatest personality (almost too often) is D.J. Account. It sounded like Wolfman Jack, D.J. in American Graffiti. I wonder if it is so well expressed in the original language. <br /> <br /> Two planets in the film exploded. The explosions were impressive and they seemed to owe much to Star Wars inspiration. However, in his favor the cause of the explosion was completely different than the main weapon of the Death Star. The dialogue had a good, interesting explanation of the cause. Many other explosions in the film looked good, not just planetary explosions. <br /> <br /> Some sound effects are very cheesy, as if borrowed from a video game from the late 70's. Some images look like primitive video games and the influence of Tron is also visible. On the other hand, sound effects are often quite decent, although it highlights the cheesy sounding parts. Art is also good, especially when there is often cheesy-looking computer graphics. <br /> <br /> At the end there is this story. If the film tells a good story, it can escape many production defects. But the plot was quite light. A na√Øve boy tries to help someone on a mutilated spaceship and gets a great power he does not understand. He and his team of very virtuous companions are fighting a powerful, irreparable enemy. He befriends himself, learns about his special power and grows into a young man. If he is persistent and virtuous enough, he can even defeat the evil enemy. Details along the way can make this story rise above the simple outline, but there is little more in this film. <br /> <br /> After all, it's just a childlike drawing. But because it seems that the main target group are older children, it may not be anything more.
