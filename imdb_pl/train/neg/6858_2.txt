Wise Blood by John Huston was a more frightening misinterpretation of Flannery O'Connor's book than I could have imagined. Of absolutely horrible acting performances (and no, "Oh, it was deliberately done, you just do not get this" me! ") For a score that was more suited to the Rockford Files episode, this movie was outrageous. From the very beginning, I watched him without ill will, or rather expected a nice experience. But the misrepresentation of the southern heroes, from the absurdly deceptive, southern haul to the dark, comedic manner in which their faith was portrayed, was unforgivable. Until the very end, which was completely devoid of the sentiment of the character, he failed in every place that O'Connor's book flashed and rang. Actors playing the "southern" policemen might as well have been eating stupid hot dogs from New York stands and quoting the godfather. The only redeeming actress was a living and dead representative of Hoover Shoates, a religious artist who hears Moates proclaiming the Church of Christ without Christ and sees dollar signs and business opportunities. O'Connor's powerful book is best known for its horrifying, religious subtext that defies the seemingly dead body of Faith. Mr. Huston's film is a shameful mockery of the author's intentions because they are understandable for me and most of her fans if I can be so brave to say so. Although I admit that I can not know exactly what the author wanted to convey, I have enough affection for her to want to remain a fan. If I saw Wise Blood in the way that Mr. Huston apparently would, I would throw him in the trash. For the sake of Flannery and for me, I forgive you, John Huston. Forgetting .... it will take some time.
