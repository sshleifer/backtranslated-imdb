This film, originally released on Christmas 1940, was lost for a long time. A very poor copy returned to the CD, now for sale. Do not buy it! The film is unimaginably terrible. Casting is weak, the script is horrible, and the director is terrible. <br /> <br /> Obraz Roland Young sings and dances. And that was the main attraction. <br /> <br /> Maybe this movie was lost intentionally.
