The story of a man who has unnatural feelings for a pig. It begins with the opening scene, which is a great example of an absurd comedy. Formal orchestral audience becomes a crazy, brutal crowd through the crazy singing of their singers. Unfortunately, it remains absurd ALL the time, without a general narrative that ultimately makes it too difficult. Even those from the era should be excluded. A mysterious dialogue would make Shakespeare easy for a third grader. At the technical level, it is better than thinking about good photos of the future great Vilmos Zsigmond. Future stars Sally Kirkland and Frederic Forrest can be seen briefly.
