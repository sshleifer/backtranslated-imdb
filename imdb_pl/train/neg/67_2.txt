From the very beginning, the political topic of this film is so obvious and heavy that the result is completely predictable. Any good script-writing guide will advise you to build characters, including character arcs and the structure of three acts. In this movie you will not find anything. The police are a bad man, and hence, he is shallow, incompetent and coward. The creators of this film never seem to believe that the police can be honorary citizens who see joining the police as a good way to contribute to the well-being of society. <br /> <br /> The viewer is not able to catch up on his thoughts about whether Ned Kelly is a good guy or a ruthless villain. The film begins with arresting him for stealing a horse, but we have no idea about his guilt or innocence. We see him passing through the prison door, but I only know he's inside for three years, when we hear it much later in a dialogue. <br /> <br /> This video contains many pictures of Ned staring at the camera with a serious expression on his face. I think the film is a real job to watch. This is the direction for contemporary movies, and this has cut me off watching.
