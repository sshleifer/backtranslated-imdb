Return of the Boogyman is a scary movie that does not play like a movie, plays like an episode of a TV series when it returns to older episodes. Return of the Boogyman is just a music video. <br /> <br /> The movie's dispute is constant and annoying memories from the first movie. Still the same footage. How boring it is. <br /> <br /> The film really concerns a psychic woman who has visions of the first movie. <br /> <br /> I saw the first movie I do not want to see the same scenes over and over and I do not know who would do it. The whole movie looks as if a few bucks are done quickly and that's all.
