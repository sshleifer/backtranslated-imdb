It was a strange kind of movie about low life in New York and around the main character (title, played by Brad Pitt) who thinks he is a Ricky Nelson type musician, except that he has no real talent. <br /> <br /> It's nice to watch until a blasphemous, hard woman from New York appears in the picture with a frightening accent. It ruined my movie. It must have been Catherine Keener, who usually plays hard and brazen women. <br /> <br /> Hairstyle by Pitta - exaggerated Pompadour - was pleasant. I can better imagine Johnny Depp in this role. One last remark: it is strange to hear a movie made in 1992 (Other than Woody Allen) with mono sound.
