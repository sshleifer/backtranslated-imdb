My girlfriend once brought The Zombie Chronicles so that we could watch as a joke. We did not realize that he was joking about her for paying 1 pound. While watching this movie, I started to think of things that I would rather do than watch The Zombie Chronicles. They included: <br /> <br /> 1) Drinking the bleach 2) Rubbing the sand in my eyes 3) Writing a letter to Brad Sykes and Garrett Clancy 4) Reintroducing the American Civil War 5) Tax declarations 6) GCSE Mathematics 7) Sex with an old lady. <br /> <br /> Garrett Clancy, alias Sgt. Ben Draper wrote this? The guy could not even dig a hole properly. The best thing he did was to kick the door down (the best part of the movie). It was the worst movie I've ever seen, and I saw White Noise: The Light. Never had the movie had so many mistakes. My girlfriend left him here, so now I'm living with the shame of having this piece of shit. <br /> <br /> News only in: Owen Wilson watched the movie and tried to kill himself. Fact. <br /> <br /> DO NOT WATCH
