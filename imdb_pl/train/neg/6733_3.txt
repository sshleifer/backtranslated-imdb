The exclamation point in the title is appropriate, although it is misunderstood. This film not only cries - screams loud enough to break the glass. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers Andrew and Virginia Stone made penetrating, humorless thrillers that sought a semi-documentary feeling. Here they shot on real New York locations with metallic "real" acoustics to increase credibility. But the naturalism of the sound recording only serves to reinforce the wrong dialogue of the Stones and the bubbling butterfly of Inger Stevens' butterfly. <br /> <br /> In the show, totally devoid of modulation, Stevens plays the electronics wife Whiz James Mason (looking haggard and bored); both are imprisoned by the blackmailer Rod Steiger (look distended and bored) and his slimy cohorts in the scheme of blackmailing the airline with a deadly bomb that Mason unconsciously helped to build. <br /> <br /> Here is another pressure of credibility - a case of a criminal murderer so brilliantly attentive to every detail, and at the same time sufficiently knocked down to employ a drug-addicted degenerate as a subordinate. Stones' idea of ​​the tension of tension is the imprisonment of hysterical Stevens alone with the rapist Benzedrine Neville Brand, filling the frame with his sweaty, salivating kiss. But the work with the camera is so lead, and Brand (unusually) fears that the effect is not too sharp, much less uncertain. The Stones, a couple in the heart, do not even have the courage to not have their own beliefs. <br /> <br /> The movie, which ends with the agile Steiger chasing Stevens on the subway train, is as clumsy as it is awkwardly heavy. With Angie Dickinson as Steiger's amorous girlfriend, Jack Klugman, Kenneth Tobey and Barney Philips.
