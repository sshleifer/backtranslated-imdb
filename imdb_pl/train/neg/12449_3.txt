Sondra Locke stinks in this movie, but she was a terrible "actress" anyway. Unfortunately, he draws everyone else (including then the real boyfriend Clint Eastwood with her.) But what did Clint Eastwood think when he agreed to play in this one? One screen reading should tell him that this one is a really bad story, basically no neither story nor story, add bored, bad acting, even from normally good Eastwood, there is absolutely no action, except for a few arguments and as far as I am concerned, this movie ranks at the top of the pile of natural sleep enhancers Can the movie be more boring, I think that watching dry paint or growing grass can be more fun. A real smelly Do not worry about it.
