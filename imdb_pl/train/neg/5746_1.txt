About the worst film in distribution now! I love zombie movies and I saw it in a used stand, so I thought, why not? Oh my God, it's a pity that zombie movies and fans are of the genre! Whoever made this movie, must put down the camera and go to film school! There are so many gore hounds who put time and effort into their films and have something that this movie is not worth. I know what you need to make movies, and I'm sure there was a lot of money and time to make Meat Market, but none of the money and time was good. You need actors, a script, a real camera, invest in books on how to create independent films. I do not know how you have a DVD edition, but whoever did it is either a really good friend or a head banging against the wall. In movies gore is quality, not quantity, the effects are poor! I was so angry that it is in stores and I could not get my money back. If you've seen this movie, write here and close the shlock. I know I'm very strict, I only had 10 lines, so I'm trying to get to the bottom of it.
