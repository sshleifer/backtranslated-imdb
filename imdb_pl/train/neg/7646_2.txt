In a movie that tracks a fighting actor, apparently played by a fighting actor, it has nothing to do with Chris Klein. He fights to bring in something that is memorable and meanders through a shallow writing that can be displayed, which can only be described as a bland leader. History exists, but it does not show any basic beginning, middle and end, and the viewer remains a shrug, feeling that nothing in the last hour and three-quarters really happened. <br /> <br /> One of the bright spots among this is Fred Durst, who manages to stand out above his seemingly talented co-star and performs a semi-decent work reviving the backward character of Legde. Will Fred be able to recreate this, working with a higher casting caliber, will remain to see, but in the future I will be watching him.
