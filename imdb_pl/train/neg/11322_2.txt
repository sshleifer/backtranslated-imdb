There is a word for this kind of film, and this word is "drivel". It was nonsense when it was a VHS rental and its drift on the satellite was starting again. <br /> <br /> It can fool you because it has 2 moderately known names in Kistofferson and Henriksen, sound music for the soundtrack, and cool scenery of Monument Valley. <br /> <br /> He also has a curly woman who fights a lot. <br /> <br /> If it's all you want from a movie, then maybe it will keep you happy. <br /> <br /> However, it is still a drift.
