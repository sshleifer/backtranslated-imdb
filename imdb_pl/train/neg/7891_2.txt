Summary of the plot IMDb in no way describes the essence of this film. He should have been "Be prepared for a catapult back to the prison of the third bench at the back of your family's church at the age of 8, listening to the preacher's drama about God's will, while all you can think about returning home to your Lego." <br /> <br /> It starts with good intentions, building intrigues, giving real and surreal tips, such as "Renny is healing his thumb so quickly? ". moment. Then he slowly transforms himself into a Christian jamboree, devoting his conspiracy entirely to the laundering of evangelization. I believe that I was counting the use of the word "pray" about 53 times in five minutes at the end. After the 31st, I tried to turn the context of the word into its synonym "prey". Unfortunately, my little mind game has made the film bearable for the last 20 minutes. In addition, he made me laugh when the character said "prayer" ("preyer" to me) because it became completely funny. Indeed, even my Catholic wife sank into a chair of boredom, almost to the point where she ended up on the floor. <br /> <br /> For all drooling Christians who rated this film as 8-10 stars, I suggest you stick to your theological theories of security, such as Circle Square, the Ten Commandments, everything from Narnia, Jesus Christ, Superstar, and similar. Stay away from more intellectually difficult topics in films such as "Camp of Jesus", "God who was not there", "What Jesus bought" or "Soon released to freedom." <br /> <br /> Maybe Robert Whitlow's book is better.
