This Charles trip is decent, but it is quite low performance. Marlon Brando stands out. There is an auxiliary thread with Mira Sorvino and Donald Sutherland, who forgets to develop and hurt the film a little. I'm still trying to understand why Charlie wants to change his name. Each film with "Karol" was quite bad.
