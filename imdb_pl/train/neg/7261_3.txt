This British-Spanish co-production is one of the innumerable films made in Spain after the unexpected phenomenal success of Italian "Spaghetti" westerns and, as is typical of such species efforts, characterized by an eclectic range of established and emerging international stars: Robert Shaw, Telly Savalas, Stella Stevens, Martin Landau, Fernando Rey, Michael Craig, Al Lettieri, Dudley Sutton, Antonio Mayans, etc. Ironically, this inconsistent mess in the movie serves as a great example of why most Americans of movie genres have become a dying race in the 1970s. and now it is practically (or officially?) extinct. <br /> <br /> I really wanted to like this movie, not only because Western is one of my favorite types of movies, but also because it had all the features, including an intriguing assumption to be good - not to mention it that my father acquired the original version of the novel A TOWN CALLED BASTARD after her original rel ease! In fact, the only advantage of the movie (if you can even call it) is its eccentricity: Stevens, playing a widow of revenge on a man who betrayed her revolutionary husband, sleeping in a coffin (!) Rode in a carriage through her stupid servant (?) Sutton ; Savalas, as a bloodthirsty renegade who initially appears to be the main villain of the film, is unceremoniously sent by his assistant Lettieri very early in the picture; in this case, the dark character of the song turns out to be Landau, who in the first scene of the film is seen as a plunder next to our legendary hero-priest Shaw! Fernando Rey, playing the blind peasant, is the only one who can identify the rebel Shaw, who in the end proved to be just a front for ... well, never mind! As you can see, the plot is very misleading and from there it becomes stranger! The production team responsible for the film was also responsible for other western routes during the same period as CUSTER OF THE WEST (1967), BAD MAN'S RIVER (1971), CAPTAIN APACHE (1971) and PANCHO VILLA (1972).
