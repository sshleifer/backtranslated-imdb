This movie was like a bad indie with talent for the list. The plot was stupid until the end. It reminded me of something that appeared on the home video market in the 80's. I would give him one, but there were short moments when you could see how the actors really try to make it pay off. I think the worst part was that the underwater scene was sticking out of the dock. Underwater lighting seemed to come from there, and whenever someone on whom we should care was close to exhaustion, this air tank would look like it was. I would avoid this unless there is nothing else on the shelf. Good day.
