I love the confused TV series "Masters of Horror" often. Horror fans live in a constant lack of food. Projects like this (and similar "Greenlight Project" with a given "Feast" - like it or crush) are a breeding ground for wonderful thought bubbles in the minds of directors with horror bent on developing and bringing about ripening for us, I love to eat on horror. <br /> <br /> This one started with the really-kool-idea kernel and escaped ... right on the edge of "where in the world do I go with this? !!!". <br /> <br /> I do not know, how to spoil the spoiled, but "SPOILER AHEAD" Suddenly ... no, it was light drifting in the night sky ... we have long hair luminescent aliens (huh? ... HUH?) men boring the brain and ... yes, I understand, but ... well ... the worst curse of a story - a thrilling and promising setting without a satisfactory solution. br /> <br /> Cue to storytellers ... your expansion must have a payout that is higher than building. Not Storytelling math 101. <br / > <br /> End of Spoilers - Big Oops!
