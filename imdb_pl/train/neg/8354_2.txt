Every film in which Brooke Shields plays Fonda will be both anomaly and horror. Shields are actually bad only because they are youthful, inexperienced and clearly not well directed by their star. Peter Fonda is angry because he is angry. I liked Ulee's Gold, years later, but the Lord above is awful here. Not that someone else was good. There is not a single show (except for the amazing Henry Fonda cameo) that would even be satisfying. I've never seen a movie with so many bad performances. In the case of Luke Askewa, the main villain, it is clear that this is due to poor dialogue and direction because he has done a good job in the past. But his partner, played by Ted Markland, is an embarrassing ham. Writing is awful, and actors can not be blamed for the terrible things they have to say. But they say so bad! Editing and direction are worse than for pedestrians. Shots are held for too long without a dramatic reason or are interrupted before the scene can be realized. This picture was much worse than I imagined and would have been completely forgotten (and probably never even existed) without the participation of several well-known names. One bright point: the cinematography in the Grand Canyon is unique, rendering the beauty of the area in a way that even the great productions of Imax do not quite do well. And finally: either it is a bad version of Paper Moon, with a nice pair of father and daughter types, or it is a bad version of Pretty Baby, with a much more disgusting romantic relationship between forty and 13-year-old. It suggests more of the latter than the previous one, and is therefore quite disturbing.
