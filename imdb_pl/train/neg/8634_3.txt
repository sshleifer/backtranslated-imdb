Seeing a photo of a man attacked by a zombie gave me hope that Lucio "Zombi" Fulci can apply for his old tricks. Unfortunately, in addition to the close-ups of the rotting corpse, in this story of murdering a wealthy man and his daughter, to know who killed him, little can be recommended. None of the characters is attractive and until you find out how they did it (at least, it was cool), you stop being worried. The only good thing I can say is that it made more sense than Nightmare Concert!
