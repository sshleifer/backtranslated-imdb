This is a German film from 1974, which has something to do with women who come to the castle, and besides, I can not say for what purpose, or even what the purpose of the film is. I can tell you that there are a few women who also play the role of the moon in the service of this particular castle, which they break, put paint on the body and spin on bongos, as it was in the Goth Kit-Kat Club, and it seems to be a good portion the time of this movie. Yes, there seems to be something with devil worship and vampires, and there is some girl on the girls, etc. But the main purpose seems to be painted cupcakes swirling in the basement. I preferred to throw one eye on one of the main devilish devotees who gave authenticity to the proceedings and made it even more evil. Was this Wanda ZÅ‚a Lesbijka (as it appears in loans)? Irrelevant. If you're not too fussy about your lesbian devils who love movies, you might like it, otherwise it's pretty boring, and I can not even finish it, I was so bored. 3 out of 10.
