Too many holes in this movie to be pleasant and HOT ALL is a strange almost Hollywood ending that is completely out of context with the rest of the movie (it's not a spoiler because you'll never guess how it ends!). <br /> <br /> You will also have to have thick skin for all politically correct shades. The conflict between whites and blacks was highly sophisticated and one-sided. I did not understand why the author had a local black community to behave in such an unacceptable manner, does he / she try to be racist? <br /> <br /> A truly bizarre movie. Just watch if you like to be really upset with holes in the story and you like to discuss all things that may or may not have happened. <br /> <br /> But positive filming and acting are perfect.
