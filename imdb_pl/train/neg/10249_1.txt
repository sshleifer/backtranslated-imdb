What can I say about this film differently than "I do not see". I waited and waited, and waited for something to happen (or whatever) and simply did not come. Watch amazingly when two people walk while setting the record for most of the time on the screen filling in one movie. What are they doing? Do they solve the mystery? Do they collect tips? Perhaps it is difficult to say. At the end of the movie, after decoding many radio signals (illegible on a PET monitor), and this guy gives lectures, the plot is finally revealed and rejected as soon as possible. Some aliens want to return to their native homeland and are so happy there that they want to blow up the earth (probably do not like to share wealth). My guess is that they finished filming and saw a 35-minute work or art (rubbish!) And they decided to let the assembly crew turn it into an 88-minute feature film. Watch your own risk, it's not even funny because it's so bad, it's just bad.
