What the hell is this? It's one of the stupidest movies I've seen. I do not understand why people on this site love so much. His senseless and naked for no reason. This is the worst of Resident Evil. I definitely do not recommend it unless you want to watch bad, nonsense nonsense. Watch real horror films such as Stephen King's It, The Shining, Jurassic Park (kinda horor), JAWS, etc. Leave this shit for rent when there is nothing else to rent. It's bad, like Cruda vs Gayson. Attack of the Killer Tomatoes is better than nonsense. <br /> <br /> Oh wow, flesh eating zombies. How many damn movies do we need. Drop this one. <br /> <br /> * outta ****
