Do you know how sometimes you can watch a shitty movie with friends and laugh at all the disadvantages of the movie? Well, that was beyond that. I bought a DVD in Tower Records because it was $ 3.00 and I heard that it was a movie that you can laugh at. This is really pathetic. About 30 minutes after the film my friends started to ask me to turn it off. About 45 minutes they begged me. After an hour we went to a compromise to speed up to the end, so we could see how the conflict was resolved (and because we watched Matt Walsh all the time). Seriously, do not watch this movie. It is painful.
