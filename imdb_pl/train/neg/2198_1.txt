The scientist and his friend drive when his speeding causes a car accident. He escapes unscathed, but is cut off. He saves her head, brings her home and keeps her alive (!!!!). Then he looks for models and stripteasers to get the perfect body for the head. His crippled assistant watches over his head, who begins to speak and has a telepathic (or telepathic) connection with a deformed monster kept in a closet .... <br /> <br /> As you can see, it is quite stupid, but I had a certain fondness for it . When I was growing up in the late 1970s, the local TV station showed this movie about 20 times a year (without exaggeration). They always showed it on Saturday afternoon on television - uncut. Then watching this on TV was great! Clear blood and gore with a macabre monster and poor sex - who cares if it was good? Seeing this now, I realize how bad it really is. <br /> <br /> Acting is perfectly miserable, production values ​​do not exist, the script is quite stupid and (apart from the still rather disgusting gore) it's boring. There is also a gentle fight between two women and a wonderful monster at the end. Also add a tip that leaves a lot of loose ends. On the one hand, this is an interesting example of an exploitation film from the 1960s. On the other, its total rubbish. Anyway, this is not a good movie, but it is obligatory (only once) for fans of horror and gore. <br /> <br /> Also, the laughter of the head is quite terrifying. Pay attention to the final credits, which cause that TITLE is wrong (calling it "HEAD, which will not die")!
