Thank God! I did not waste money by renting it, but I downloaded it! It's the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, ***** visual effects, unnecessary gore and nakedness! Far from other Zombie movies like Night of the Living Dead and others. There are many holes in the loop and errors in the film. OK, if you have time after reading this comment, check out the profile of the director (Ulli Lommel). After seeing that I have my own explanation why the movie is so, I mean that every movie directed by Ulli Lommel gets a rating from 1 to 2. And now I do not want to search for movies that are directed by him, but I can end it all with one strong opinion. Even for fun or moving in time or even in an extremely bored situation, DO NOT WAIT THIS FILM.
