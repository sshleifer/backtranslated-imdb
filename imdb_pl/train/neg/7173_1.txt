I hate movies from an airplane crash ... EVERYTHING! In fact, I hate all of them with passion! First of all, they are cheap and they do not have any crafts! Secondly, they insult the airline industry and tell the public that all planes are ... DROP FROM HEAVEN AND CRASH! <br /> <br /> Why am I inclined to such a movie? This can happen to any of us and have worse consequences than those experienced by the heroes of the movie ... which is the only freezing aspect of yarn in a plane crash such as this one. I hate this movie because it's like all 50,000,000 stupid movies about chaos in front of it! Freefall is like all the others: nothing more than boredom before kitschy nonsense begins. <br /> <br /> First of all, we have the same cast of delays in this deadly death trap: the Cleaver-esquire three-man family, yuppie baastard and bitch stewardess with a great blond hairstyle from 1987 scold anyone who is the least terrified! <br /> <br /> The second problem is that it should not be a full-length movie, but a documentary explaining everything about the Air Canada incident "Gimbli Glider" aka "Freefall", to the precautions. <br /> <br /> My third and final caveat applies to all of the air caliber movies (except Fearless) Why the hell did the male steward order the passengers to take off their shoes there? (I could understand high heels and sharp, loose objects, but come on!) How will it "make them safer than now! This plane, if they (passengers) did not know better: they knew they were going to break the ground. Why would you force 100 wounded people out of the gum that could cause skin peeling and bleeding on impact, just to walk in their socks on the rubble field! Does it make any sense? <br /> <br /> Intrepid and hit series ABC "Lost" had more depth and realism to the air disaster than just "plane crashes - panic-stewards people become land of soulless aircraft without wheels in the field, people wander without shoes and jackets, etc. The same old crap from the 1975 airport! Freefall was so typical of a movie about a plane crash that I almost expect Charlton Heston or Peter Graves to fall into the damned passenger cabin. Could we at least see how these poor heroes return to normality instead of people rejoicing in the face of an approaching tragedy? A typical Lifetime moronic movie! Cheap and stupid! <br /> <br /> The director of the movie "Freefall" should stick to cheap TV movies with white middle-aged women with stupid teenagers who use drugs and have marital problems. hack! Why should we sit for over an hour and a half at the airport that wants to refresh. I hope that God will no longer make such films about the plane crash. If it was like the ABC series "Lost", it would be something to watch. But this is complete shit, then a bit. Stop replacing every plane crash movie in "Airport 1975"! This is not an "airport", it is a cheap, pathetic waste of my time. I would not recommend this movie or any TV movie about a movie catastrophe to anyone, not even my worst enemies.
