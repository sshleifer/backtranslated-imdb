I have never heard of this film until I played Robert Mitchum's retrospective at the National Film Theater in London. Almost 60 years on the list of castings looked tasty, saying the least with seven names - in addition to the top Mitchum - in the public domain; Charles McGraw, soon to The Killers, Barbara Bel Geddes, long before Dallas and probably even better known as Norman's production designer's daughter, Walter Brennan, who did not need introduction, Frank Faylen, sadistic nurse in The Lost Weekend and much nicer little towns in "AA Wonderful Life ", Robert Preston ten more years from Harold Hill in" The Music Man "with Tom Tully and Phyllis Thaxter creating numbers. Unfortunately, most of them wasted their time. I searched in vain for any "signatures", considering that it was Robert Wise on the bullhorn. At the time, he made about half a dozen films and he still had to find a style. This story is our old friend, a war at a distance, and Mitchum probably thought it was just a cut above the Hopalong Cassidy waters to which he had cut his teeth. There are no new twists - if you do not count the incredible scene, when Mitchum accuses Preston of sleeping with Thaxter to get information about his father's plans to move his cattle. This is completely true, but how did Mitchum KNOW? We have not seen or heard anything to indicate how it was discovered. All in all, little to say about it.
