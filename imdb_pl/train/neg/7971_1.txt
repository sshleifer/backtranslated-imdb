I'm not sure who writes those <br /> <br /> glowing reviews for this movie, but trust me STKINKS. I've seen hundreds of horrors and film, and this one is LAME, it's only about 80 minutes and believe me, that's all I can do. The plot is terrible, the acting is even worse. And there is no development. <br /> <br /> Even David Cocteau's films are better than this. RUN AWAY from JIGSAW. I expected to hate acting that can be forgiven directly to video if the plot is good. <br /> <br /> It was not a scary, very small Gore, <br /> <br /> and a truly unattractive cast. <br /> <br /> I watched it with three other friends <br /> <br /> with whom I hope to continue to talk to me! <br /> <br /> They wanted me to throw the disk out of the window. I can not believe that someone could have <br /> <br /> this flute with a good review.
