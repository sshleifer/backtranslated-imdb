This movie did not have great stars in it, but it had a very good cast filled with excellent actors supporting I Gene Tierney before she became a big star. With George Sanders, Reginald Gardner, Harry Carey, Bruce Cabot, Jospeh Calleia and Cederic Hardwicke, you can expect more from the film than actually delivered. I suspect most of this is due to the secondary script, because director Henry Hathaway was a competent and well-established man at the forefront. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in East Africa during World War II - before the Americans entered the war. The British are trying to control their African colonies, while the subversive elements of the Nazis are trying to cause trouble among the inhabitants. One of the white men in the film is a double dealer - works for the destruction of the British Empire! But the adorable Tierney, playing the sultan's daughter (!), Is to help save the day for good Britain. <br /> <br /> The American filmmakers have long supported the Empire, and the 1930s and 1940s saw a lot of pro-imperial movies. Now, with a changed sensitivity, the idea of ​​the death of happy black natives for the queen and the country seems preposterous - and it would be difficult to eradicate both sides! However, in those days this propaganda song was effective in gaining support for the British - although watched today, he suffers from a lengthy script and stupid castings. The only bright moment in the film is the final game between George Sanders and a hostile agent. It is a pity that after such a strong scene the film just talked and talked - losing some strength.
