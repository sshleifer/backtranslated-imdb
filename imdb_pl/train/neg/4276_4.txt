This overrated, short-lived series (poor two seasons) is almost as experimental and unique as a truck driver riding a belt. I'm not quite sure what they mean by "breakthrough" and "original" when they eat all Lynch and his stupid little television work. What exactly are their originality criteria? Of course, compared to the "Bill Cosby Show" or "Hill Street Blues" is original. Definitely. Next to "Law & Order", TP reveals the originality on the left and right. <br /> <br /> TP fans often say that the show was canceled because too many viewers were not smart enough, open enough to suppose "quirk", its alleged wild resourcefulness or anything. As a fan of strangeness, I must correct this misunderstanding. There is nothing beyond the wall about TP; it's just an observable, rather stupid criminal who circulates around, whirling in every corner, but eventually (or for that reason) is not going anywhere. Alleged strangeness is always forced; the characters do not behave as strangely as they behave in an IDIOTIC way half the time. There is a difference ... <br /> <br /> Every time I watch the sequence of "strange dream" in "Living In Oblivion", in which the dwarf criticizes the director (Buscemi) for undergoing tired old use - a stereotype of a scene with plums , I'm thinking about Lynch. Do you want a weird one? "Eraserhead" is strange - in fact it is more than strange, basically abstract. Do you want a unique television program? Watch "Prisoner". Do you want a strange looking cast? This film offers films by Felini and Leone. TP looks like a too talented television drama in which all young people look like models. The casting gives a plastic look. Kens & Barbies en masse. <br /> <br /> In fact, one of TP's producers said that Lynch was looking for "unique faces" for this series. Unique faces? Like Lara Flynn Boyle? Sheryll Fenn? How are these effeminate "pieces" straight from men's catalogs (or gay magazines)? Do not get me wrong; there's nothing wrong with getting an attractive cast, especially in the case of beauties like Fenn (like Madonna would have been 1000 times prettier), but then do not do it, saying you're doing a "weird show with weird looking people" and never I did not understand the erroneous fascination of Lynch Kyle MacLachlan (I should get a medal for bothering to write his name). It is not unlikely, but it lacks charisma, it seems a bit too bland and polished. The ridiculous "oddities" of his character were not at all interesting, it was just one of Lynch's many attempts to extort bizarreness, trying to meet his reputation - he completely lost the lead, but this time. Everything Lynch did after the Elephant was very weak compared to his first two films. What followed later was often mediocre efforts that were based on Lynch's relatively small but fanatical base to keep him in the public eye, interpreting meanings in his misconceived stories that hold no water at closer scrutiny. In other words, Lynch is the favorite of every intellectual. <br /> <br /> So Laura Palmer was killed by her father ...? He was obsessed with the devil or such nonsense. This is the best idea that this "great mind" could come up with ... You have movies with horror B, which end with more originality. <br /> <br /> Lynch is not bright enough or hard-working to come up with a great story. <br /> <br /> Go to http://rateyourmusic.com/~Fedor8 and check out my List of "TV and Cinema: 150 worst cases of nepotism".
