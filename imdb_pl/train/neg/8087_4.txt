The film has no faith in helicopters that did not exist until the 1950s. But no woman will do what has been done here, not even a woman before the women's movement in the 1960s and 1970s. The only part of the movie you could believe in was that the Germans want to know where the landing will take place. Ignore for a moment that the British have caught all spies, but even if they did not, they would not allow anyone to wander in this way just to reassure the Germans that the landing will be in Calais. This is not one important thing that makes the movie not work. It's the culmination of all the bad things that make the movie fail. Bad directing, bad scripts, no attempt of authenticity (in general) all together make the movie fall. Generally speaking, spies should disappear in woodwork. Tension occurs when a spy wonders if the information they possess is important or not and they worry that they will be detected. The game is over at this game. This spy did everything but spying. The only chance to get something that has some credibility and some tension can be reading the book.
