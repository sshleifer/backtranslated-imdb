This show made me feel physically ill and completely detached from British society as a whole. Programs like this and Blue Peter pretend that there are no class divisions in Great Britain. They always say such things; "Go to your attic or maybe you will find it ..." or "Go to your garden tonight and ..." - and what about "delicious" children of the working class who have never had an "attic" and "garden with back "" which was nothing more than 1 square meter of balcony on the 14th floor of the council block? Broadcasting public services - yes, right! And it was terribly depressing to see these stupid, middle class kids bringing up the pieces of old plastic, "playing" ... do me a favor and "why not" t "go and cut your wrists or overdose for money "Mama and Papa" ... it's not good for me
