... with the exception of Jon Heder. This guy has refueled the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The story sounded fun. The 29-year-old son of a loafer (Heder) still lives with a widowed mother (Keaton) who meets a new love (Daniels). Slacker's son is jealous and wants to lose a comfortable life and tries to sabotage the relationship. He also meets a girl (Faris). <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the performance of Daniels, and especially of Faris, but whoever threw Hager, it would be better to sell hot dogs on the beach. The Heder performance is annoying, which would be a good thing, because it's an annoying guy, the problem is that he has a bad actor to lose this act, making this guy nice in the final. Finally, you still want to hit the guy personally in the face and you're upset about the end. In the future, every movie with this guy will be useless to me!
