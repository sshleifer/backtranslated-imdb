Disappointed, unclear, bad script, poor photography and direction ... all in all a very bad first impression in creating commercial films by good people in TBN. success in the past, helping to bring "China Cry", the story of Norah Lam, to the big screen. But "Omega Code" is an unfortunate mistake. As a Christian who supports TBN and much of his programming and loved "China Cry", I still can not recommend this movie to anyone. They do a lot of good with their ministry, but this is not an example. Do not waste your money ... instead, go and hire "China Cry".
