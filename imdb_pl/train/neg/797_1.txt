I just lost 2 hours of my life watching this mindless plot. I could make a better movie with my camera. How do they manage to get actors to play in these movies? Porn movies have better scenarios and effects ... I'd like to have those 2 hours back ... <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie is cast. Although their acting skills in this were not able to raise this film to bear, the rest was simply WAY too bad! <br /> <br /> This is the type of film that I would recommend to torture prisoners in order to scare them. <br /> <br /> What's worse, I saw a translated version of this movie ..., a bad movie ... with the worst translation ... Yikes!
