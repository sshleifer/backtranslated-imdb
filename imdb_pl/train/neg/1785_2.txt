.... And after watching this pile of nonsense you will not be surprised that it has not been published <br /> <br /> !!!! SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> This is a terrible movie by any standards, but when I emphasize that it is one of the worst films that has Stephen King in the captions, you can imagine how bad it is. The film begins with the fact that the two characters stare open-mouthed at the horror scene: <br /> <br /> "My God. What happened here? "<br /> <br />" I do not know, but they definitely hate cats "* <br /> <br /> The camera moves outside the house, where hundreds of cats are rolled up and maimed. Boy, this guy is right, someone hates cats and should be a police officer with such deduction. Oh, wait a minute, he's a policeman and when the movie starts with a policeman doing such an obvious observation, you just know that you'll be watching a bad movie <br /> <br /> The reason why SLEEPWALKERS is angry is that it's very illogical and confused. In the end, we find out that the monsters in the title need blood of virgins to survive. Would not they look better for a virgin in the middle biblical belt than in an American seaside town? Having said that at least we know about the motives of monsters - this is the only thing we learn. We never find out how they can change shape or are able to make cars invisible, and this jar with a tip that seems to be stolen from TERMINATOR. Monstrous mother walks around, killing several cops with your bare hands or blowing them up with a hand police gun (!), But if her monstrous race is immune to the police firepower, why do creatures need to change shape or become invisible? The fall of creatures is just as badly thought out as killed by the massive attack of domestic cats. If they can be killed by cats, why did not the monsters kill all the cats that lay in the garden? There was a whole horde of moogs around, but the monsters never thought about killing them. I think that the production team can come up with the ending. It was that they started the movie, my complaint of lies. <br /> <br /> We are treated to several scenes where famous horror film directors such as John Landis, Clive Barker and even Stephen King make scenes. I think the reason for this is that when a difficult unknown actor read the screenplay, he immediately decided that regardless of that, they would not appear so bad in the film that Stephen King had to call his horror buddies to fill up cast the cast. It's so bad. SLEEPWALKERS <br /> <br /> * Unbelievable, it seems, it was not the worst film in the movie. The worst line is "This cat saved my life"
