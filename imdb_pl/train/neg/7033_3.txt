Black candles are a rather chaotic mess from the same director who brought us "Vampyres", and much later, "Rest in Pieces", among others. I only notice the ones I saw. In any case, we have a couple who love each other, and then somewhere near the pin is placed above the voodoo doll, then pierces it and the man falls over. At the moment I'm not sure if it was good for one of them. Quickly forward, to the place where the man's sister came home to examine and hear the read of the will, or something in that direction, and of course everyone else but her are on something that is the devil's worship. It's really hard to say who is who during the movie, and sometimes it gets a bit confusing. However, to spice up the scene, a simulated bestial scene (simulating HOPE) with a black goat, which will surely appeal to the crowd, has appeared. Ugh. Sometimes it is an echo of "Rosemary's baby", without a child, because the host always gives one woman a herbal tea, and the place reeks with all the nasty satanic herbs that are also, because it constantly turns to her. However, herbs are not the only thing that reminds you of this film. The end seems to be coming back to the beginning, and many viewers may wonder where they were in the middle. It is not impossible to watch, it just is not very good and I think it all depends on what you like to watch in movies, and there were not many things that could do something for me. 3 out of 10.
