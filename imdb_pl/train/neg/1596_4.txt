Not one of the best pokemon movies. <br /> <br /> Two legendary pokemons enter history. You see how strong Celebi can be, although he becomes angry first. <br /> <br /> Suicune also looks, did not seem so strong. <br /> <br /> Marauder, you do not have many strong pokemon, except for this taranitar? Some scenes of fighting his pokemon could make him better. <br /> <br /> Ash and Pikachu meet with much younger Professor Oak, though they do not realize it. Misty, I thought he had it at the end, but she did not come close. I saw it in the subtitles. <br /> <br /> Do not expect too much, the worst of the previous series.
