The highlight of the film for me was without a doubt Tom Hanks. As Mike Sullivan, he was definitely against the type and showed that he can handle the non-traditional (for him) role. Hanks is usually a good guy in the movie - the one you like, you admire and the root. Sullivan was definitely not a good guy. It is true that in the context of this film he turned out to be a bit noble - his goal was to avenge the murders of his wife and youngest son. Even so, he was already a gangster and a murderer before these killings. Hanks took a role that I would not have expected, and he did it well. <br /> <br /> Hank's good performance aside, but I certainly could not call it a nice movie. After opening, which I would best describe as enigmatic (for some time it was not clear to me), turns into a very grim movie, about complicated relationships that Sullivan developed as a gangster - largely brought up by Rooney (Paul Newman), who is a kind of mafia boss, and tries to raise his two sons and keep them "clean". isolated from your company. After the elder son witnesses a murder, the gang tries to kill him to stay calm, gets the wrong son (and mother), and leaves Sullivan and his older son (Mike, Jr.) on the run. It becomes a strange kind of film connecting father and son. <br /> <br /> Although it ends with some hope (at least in the general context of the story), it is very dark, and this mood is enhanced by many scenes shot in the dark and heavy rains. I must admit that, appreciating Hanks' performance, the whole movie just did not get me involved. 4/10
