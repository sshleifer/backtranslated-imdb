It is a film about how men think that women think about love. No woman describes a one-day sexual encounter and announces it with a love story. <br /> <br /> Of the ten monologues I thought, only three really had a ring of truth in them. I waited for the film to improve, a bit, but it was never better. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting concept, and I still wanted it to be okay, but it never did. Maybe if there really were love stories, it would work.
