What a terrible trash! Who are all these people who complain about how good it is? Yes, it's "arty"; and yes, it's "alien", but ... it's not enough. The plot is boring and chaotic, like a reality show, but not so shapely. <br /> <br /> People are inherently uninteresting; but as heroes they do not have enough depth to feel empathy for them. If they are based on real people, then I feel very, very sorry. <br /> <br /> Violence (and some of them are very violent) seems quite ostentatious and unjustified. It's as if the producer had visions of being Quenton Tarantino. Not that I thought about him too much. <br /> <br /> And so: if I had such neighbors, I would move!
