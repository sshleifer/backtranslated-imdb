It was really the worst movie I've ever seen. Michael Vartan is hot, but who is this woman? And it looks terrible throughout the movie, the hair is so bad! They speak like monotonous voices and there is no chemistry. A DVD cover does not even remotely approach what the movie actually is. Really boring. I had to rewind some of them because watching was so painful. I really want to know how I can think on the ground that it's good? hahaha, they literally like to say and say "yes" and there is no passion in it. I could not even say they were in love. I'm sorry, but that was the saddest excuse for a movie I think I've ever seen.
