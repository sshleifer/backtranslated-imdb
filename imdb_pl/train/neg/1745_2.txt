The first half hour of the film had a steady pace and depicted characters. but suddenly everything happened too fast, and Akshey Kumar could not do it with three girls, very loud because of Akshey and John Abraham. The highlight of the film was Neha Dupia, Paresh Rawal did well, but not as well as his performance in Hera Pheri. In general, this movie was the biggest disappointment, the film does not fully reflect its trailer. save money and do not watch this movie, watch Hera Pheri and Hungama again! <br /> <br /> to sum up: a cheap scene shows the performance and appearance of a film without stories or content, the plot was unusually unheard of the good music of Preetam who bought us Dhoom! keep it up! A film made in one room, new players (cast of women) were okay because it was their first movie, but renowned actors such as Akshey and John totally disappointed the acclaimed director such as Priyadarshan, giving his worst film ever!
