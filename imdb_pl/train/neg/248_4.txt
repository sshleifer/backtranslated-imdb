When will it stop hurting? I never want to watch another version of Christmas carols anymore. They're still making movies with the same story, they're bumping into each other, trying to improve the movie than the rest, but unfortunately they do not, because it's not a good story. Moralistic, old-fashioned, conservative happy-minded. As if people were learning. Numerous different versions of this movie prove that no.
