It's just bad. Sometimes modifications, even if they deviate from the original, are good in themselves. They can bring a different point of view and achieve a certain interpretation that makes them unique and enjoyable. It was as badly thought out and carried out as possible. It was not good, even standing on its own. Viggo Mortenson is a top-class actor, but some of his roles and projects leave much to be desired. The original "Vanishing Point" was such an exciting, psychological adventure; it is not an adventure that is not pleasant or fun. This has been done from the approach to film production by numbers, pushing into plot lines, which, as someone in Hollywood believes, will enjoy what they see as today's film audiences. Basically they see us as a group of idiots. It's offensive that someone will present it as a feature film, and even scruffy will try to convert a cult classic. Manipulating plot devices, aspects of "make-it-obvious-yes-no-skip", funny dialogue, stereotypical characters, amateur direction ... <br /> <br /> This is just plain bad ....
