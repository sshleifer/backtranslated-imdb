Great performances and artistic direction are not a good movie. This film is so gloomy and depressing that I could not feel any joy at the "happy" ending of a trade union strike. The humor attempts associated with Lake's pregnancy are absolutely catastrophic, and every movie with Brother Baldwin's involvement has already hit him. A positive point is that Lang is still one of the biggest underrated actors in America. I give it 4.
