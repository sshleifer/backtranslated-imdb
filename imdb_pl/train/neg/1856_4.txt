I am very happy and surprised that I am so interested in this film! Jack Frost was my introduction to films produced and distributed by A-pix entertainment, and without exception everything that this company deals with is pure nonsense! First of all, and it is very important, never watch this movie soberly! Why would you? Unlike many other bad movies, the one that I think is deliberately bad. I just can not stop thinking about how a fake snowman is, that's why it's always shown only briefly, the best way it moves! This movie is Waaaaaaaaaaay better than a piece of nonsense Michael Keaton, because it was also a good movie, and this version is equally bad.
