I think I've seen all of Grisham's films and generally everyone is very poor, except for The Rainmaker, but this one is so bad that it's unbelievable <br /> <br /> WARNING SPOILERISH <br /> <br /> It's one of those films in which the character does stupid irrational things that no one has ever done. He is a lawyer because of Christ. Why, when his children are missing, he does not call the police. Oh yes, because all the policemen hate lawyers, so they simply ignore him and let him be attacked. <br /> <br /> When he is arrested for murder, he just lets him free, he will be locked in a cell waiting for a bail release. <br /> <br /> Why would you pull your children in the middle of the country when you could easily protect them at home. <br /> <br /> The police did not bother trying to find a running psychic patient, do not bother talking to his daughter. <br /> <br /> What about the funny end ??. <br /> <br /> In summary, stupid, very unrealistic and a complete waste of time. /> <br /> 0/10 ?? One of the worst movies ever.
