I'm amazed that I really sat and watched it. I love independent movies, horror movies and, in general, zombies. But when you add ninga, you crossed the line that you should never cross. I hope that the people in this movie had a great time, or at least it was not a complete waste. However, you would never have noticed it. Scenario? You're kidding. Acting? I think even the trees pretended. Cinematography? Well, there must have been a camera there. Dot. I do not think there's any real planning to create this movie. Such a total waste of time that I will not prolong it, commenting on.
