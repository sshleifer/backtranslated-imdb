If you want to be offended, amused or both, you'll probably have to look elsewhere. LMOTP really is not even very provocative to think about, except re-inventing ordinary stupid stereotypes. At the end of the second episode, I felt a bit embarrassed that I really sat in an imagined mess. <br /> <br /> In addition to the poorly concealed artificial premise, which attracted all attention in the beginning, it is just another lame, harmless and antiseptic attempt to comment and entertainment that CBC usually produces. And once "ZOMG MUSLIMS IN RURAL CANADA ROFLMAO !!" the hype consumes its welcome, the program will probably follow the cancellation cycle, because it is so shallow when it is judged only on the basis of its advantages. <br /> <br /> Unless you are obsessed with Muslim culture in the west and / or I am easily amused by the weirdest idiosyncrasies on this subject. I really can not see how LMOTP is more pleasant than satisfying the curiosity resulting from this hype. Other programs have better addressed the issue of cultural / ethnic dichotomy in Western multi-ethnic societies. LMOTP will never be among them in the field of entertainment or insight.
