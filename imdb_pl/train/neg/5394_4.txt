I am irritated by the modern adaptation of Shakespeare, when the director can not decide whether to use the original or update it. If it uses the original words in the updated setting, it is especially difficult if it is set in the XX or XXI century, although it may work well in epoch styles, eg Trevor Nunn Twelfth Night very effectively sets the late Victorian. This could work with 30 settings, if there were much less song and dance and much more of Shakespeare's text. Unfortunately, it is simply a very trivial, but very nice program. <br /> <br /> Branagh is another problem. I agree that he is much too old to play one of the students, but more importantly, he is such an experienced Shakespeare actor that despite all his efforts to be just another student, his strength of acting performances all the time. Of course, he should have played the King - there is no problem with having a mature student King surrounded by younger students. Instead, we had a pleasant but unobtrusive actor for the King, an unbridled so-called King without royal attributes. <br /> <br /> The number of songs and dancing, which I found tedious despite the nice songs and pleasant dance, unfortunately meant that Shakespeare's great dialogue had to be drastically reduced. The whole thing ends with a trivial and mild confusion, and I'm very bored, also with comic phrases, and I was glad when it ended. Branagh did not do justice to Shakespeare in this production. <br /> <br /> Awards, however, for Richard Briers and Geraldine McEwan, absolutely great as an older couple.
