Wow! I watched the trailer of this and although "no, this is not for me." I watched my husband and the faces of our friend during the trailer and I knew it was a "movie for boys". I mean, hello! a handful of bartenders who dance - another striptease? <br /> <br /> then I started watching, it did not look that bad. so I watched. I watched it to the end. what an amazing movie. if anything, it's a hatchling. these girls have an attitude. it is a really good movie and a love story. really gives me a nice feeling. <br /> <br /> basically the story of a small town making it big in the city, after passing an ordinary big city **. there were several of them, it is almost a new urban legend. but also makes you think about your life and what you have achieved. Well, I still do. I think that's because all the work in the bar scenario is very familiar, not only for me, but for many people I know. Do not trust the trailers for this - it's aimed at bringing the men inside.
