Each scene is CHANGED BY HUMAN TRAGEDITY! <br /> <br /> I usually felt like a gag. However, like every train wreck, I could not take my eyes off. This dialogue could have worked on the stage, although I doubt it. The screen was cluttered, chaotic, hackneyed and almost any other stereotypical negative adjective that you can come up with to describe a really bad dramatic job. <br /> <br /> If you like melodrama in huge, stacks of doses, you can * enjoy the movie. However, be prepared to wait. Despite all this melodrama, this thing is sure at its own pace. <br /> <br /> This script had to sound completely different when the actors involved read it. It just does not work when they can deliver it in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> IMDB does us a lot of harm, sometimes when it uses a silly, computer-controlled "weighted result."
