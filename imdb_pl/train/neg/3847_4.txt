Much is happening with Helen and nothing is good. Shelley Winters and Debbie Reynolds play mothers of murderers Leopold and Loeb, who move from the Midwest to Hollywood to escape the past. Reynolds, the star of Jean Bath Harlow, opens a dance studio for children, and Winters is her pianist. Soon Winters (as Helen) begins to break. Everything is very slow and although there are moments of real terror (unpleasant calls, wine visit Timothy Carey), the movie is devoid of a real horror movie. Nevertheless, it is still worth the entertainment. Acting divas are fine, and production values ​​are great. The musical scores of David Raskin, photos by Lucien Ballard and Oscar-nominated costumes make a huge contribution. Could it be that the PLACE IN SUN and LOLIT deserve to be called, or did anyone rage the same as Winters? Directed by Curtis Harrington, the master of this type not quite used in the film A. In addition to Carey, the strange cast includes Dennis Weaver, Agnes Moorehead (as Aimee Semple McPherson, an evangelist), Yvette Vickers and Michela MacLiammóir (Irish Orson Welles) as Hamilton Starra, aptly called hammy.
