I bought this adaptation because I really liked Anne BrontÃ«'s novel when I read it some time ago and I usually like the BBC dramas especially. But I'm very disappointed, I never thought it would be so bad: the whole series made me laugh a lot more than moved me like a novel. <br /> <br /> First of all, music (and songs) seems completely out of place in the drama of the epoch (sounds like it was written for a modern horror movie) and like another commentator, I was particularly annoyed with the way the cameras they revolved and turned around the actors. I saw a few scenes shot in this way in "North and South" and it seemed to me that everything is fine, but in The Tenant definitely is exaggerated and just annoying. Camera movements can not make wooden acting alive. <br /> <br /> Most of the second roles were initially difficult to distinguish, and the script was not clear. None of the characters was entered correctly at the beginning. The little boy gave a very good performance, he is very sweet and the best in the film. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS Helen Graham Tara Fitzgerald's character made her look cold and rough, letting no emotions pass. It does not seem to be able to cry in a realistic way. I just could not believe that Markham could have fallen for her and I do not mention the horrible hairstyle she was given. I could not resist pitying my husband! Fancy being married to such a virago ... Besides, he was the only major actor who sounded good to me. Toby Stephens I was fine, Brother Helen Graham was not very good. <br /> <br /> It may be difficult to adapt a novel that deals with such grim topics as alcoholism and cruelty. In addition, what is only indicated and left to the reader's imagination in the book is based on complaining in television adaptation: making some scenes of both fat and comic (as when Huntingdon's eye begins to bleed) and others too sexed for the drama of the era! I mean, do not we have enough scenes with the beds in modern dramas?
