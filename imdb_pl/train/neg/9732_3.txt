First of all, the lead, Brad Dourif is KOOK. If you're trying to take this movie seriously, I guarantee it will destroy it for you. If you do not take it too seriously, it is really cool to watch. As with another reviewer, I loved the scene where Lisa (Cynthia Bain) and Dourif declare their love for each other - between avoiding the flames of fire from his arm in the car. Another great scene at the camps was watching John Landis as a snotty producer of radio programs, who raised toasts and waved around the room. In fact, the last 15 minutes of the movie were laughing all the time - I'm just not sure if Tobe Hooper wanted it.
