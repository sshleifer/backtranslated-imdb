From time to time I withdrew from the Asian horror movies after I was completely sick, seeing the same junk stories about ghosts. However, more and more often I use operating movies so I decided to give them another chance. My first phone call was the highly-rated director Takashi Miike with a highly rated "Q guest". I have already seen Audition and although I did not like it, I rate it as one of the better contemporary Asian horror films. So I went to that with reasonable expectations; and unfortunately I found only boredom. I suppose this movie is really smart and it just went through my head, but it seemed to me that it was just a set of brutal and nasty scenes with little or no consistency between them. All comparisons to the work of Luis Bunuel and David Lynch are blasphemous, as far as I am concerned; everything Miike did, make a movie; every intelligence surrounding him has been implemented by pretentious fans, desperate to find meaning. My headache took about 10 minutes (after my father had sex with his daughter for some reason) and did not give up until the film was over; at least twenty-four hours later, or so it seemed. Do not get me wrong, I am not against violence in movies and in fact I actively look for the best-known films; but although it may be violent, it is also pointless and boring, and I did not draw any joy from it. Takashi Miike may have many fans, but I'm certainly not one of them; and I certainly hope it's the last time I come in contact with one of his films.
