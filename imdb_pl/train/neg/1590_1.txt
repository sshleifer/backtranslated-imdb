HAH! This is the movie that "Next Action Stars" are entering. I'm glad I did not take part and I did not win ... <br /> <br /> Is not it funny how you can look at the first 10 seconds (!) And make up the mind about the movie? Come on! Just look at these titles!? I watched this movie (or part of this "teleplay" since it was made for TV and we could not stand watching it) one evening during my military service, and the audience with me was a typical hodge of middle-class guys who occasionally watch series such as Las Vegas only for girls in the series. so the bar was not really high, the most watched movie in my group was "Girl Next Door" (not because of a great script; D. But the lack of originality, acting, scripts and almost everything in this movie), otherwise the movie makes that it's quite easy to switch to Las Vegas (or maybe it's CSI? I do not remember ...) without any complaints from the rest of the group, and that's rare (!) For God's sake! Not in this movie! If he's on TV, then yes, look at him. And contemplate him. My application? Well, since Joel Silver has actually produced some of the best action movies (Die Hard, Matrix 1 to mention only some of them, I can only say that producers do not give the film its quality, provide money to directors, and sell the movie only because it is it's Joel Silver's movie, it's just a desperate attempt to hide the obvious flaws of the crew who really did.
