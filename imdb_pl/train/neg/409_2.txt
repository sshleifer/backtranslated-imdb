<br /> <br /> Paul Verhoeven finally bombed this one. He became a joke on himself. Once again, we have a film that includes sex and violence, immorality, slipping through women and many attempts to talk between characters and pans. <br /> <br /> It's all for free. Because there is no action in this movie. It circulates all its elements. All the actors give the kind of performances from the Verhoeven movie. In other words, he is crazy about acting on almost every level. Starship Troopers escaped because it was a macho world in which characters lived. In this, scientists work in the same way. I'm sorry, but soldiers and scientists are not really focused on the same way of thinking. <br /> <br /> One of the main drawbacks of the story was that after escaping for one night to do bad things, the character of Kevin Bacons returns to the science laboratory, in which we spent more time watching these animated dummies (except Elizabeth Shue) walking and talking. Why not show the scope of what a character can do in the outside world. How could they follow him if he could be anywhere? Think about all the different things that you could do with this concept, both in terms of history and characteristics. Then look at what the movie does, and you really did a bad job and decided that the whole project was really. <br /> <br /> Doco is more offensive on DVD, where everyone claims that Verhoeven is a kind of MAd Genius. Well, one of the two is not so bad. <br /> <br /> This movie has nothing special about it. As the title says. <br /> <br /> Hollow !!!
