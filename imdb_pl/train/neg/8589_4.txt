Let me post this post first, saying that I am a fan of the original Star Wars FILMS ... I do not read books, I do not play games, I do not wear underwear or eat cereal (if it is). I'm just a movie fan. <br /> <br /> With this in mind, I try to see how people praise this movie. Taking this film myself and not comparing it to horrible predecessors (EP 1, 2), I do not understand how one can say that it is an amazing movie. For all the terrible shortcomings in the scenario - cheesy dialogue, fancy scenes (eg R2 suddenly turns out to be ugly and long scenes of intense CGI chase, which have a small human touch), HORRIBLE acting and noticed holes of the plot ... how good? There was no real internal dilemma in Anakin; it seemed the switch was reversed and suddenly he was angry. The film has not interested me for the last 20 minutes (which was actually ruined by the Frankenstein scene "NOOOOOO!"). When BOMBSTRUCT a screen with amazingly amazing CGI effects and fill the gaps with absolutely horrible single lines, when more can and should be said, THIS IS NOT A GREAT VIDEO. In the case of such a "dark" tone, there was too much restraint in the speech of ALL heroes. <br /> <br /> I close the question: from the beginning to the end of the movie was really a sense of urgency and significance for what was going to happen?
