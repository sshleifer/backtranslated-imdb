If I could give it less than I would want. Do not bother with renting; if somebody gives you a DVD, burn it out. <br /> <br /> It's a terrible movie creation. The total loss of even a digital "movie". I saw better on Youtube made by 12-year-old boys. Lommel says he wrote it, if it is, it is a classic case of someone who is illiterate in two languages. The story does not exist, the dialogue is mainly screaming, working with the camera is some attempt of artistic trinkets with a nonsensical cut of completely unrelated jumps to industrial transport scenes or some strange anger of a young woman. <br /> <br /> I can usually follow a less-than-obvious plot or see a goal in a "creative" movie - I like David Lynch. <br /> <br /> This movie is so far beyond my limited understanding that I missed, it's totally pointless. I think it is "lets see if we can get the title that will come out soon and make a strange crack on it and see if we can catch some bucks". Convers. <br /> <br /> I do not see why Lionsgate even dealt with it. Completely worthless, it's so bad that I will not hire the same director.
