The boy has fooled me with this movie. I really thought it would be a camp horror movie in which absolutely no humor, boy, this time I have a cold arm. This movie was and I'm honest, damn good. It was not at all frightening, but madness and cunning humor really angry this movie. Some of the nasty acting and banal killings were so painful to see that I almost laughed at how bad it was, but to some extent I liked it. Kills are associated with snow sports and Christmas, which makes them more intriguing. The POV camera angles were amazing. <br /> <br /> The film is about a sticky killer who dies in a car accident while being transported to prison. Later it is resurrected in the same chemical with snow stuck to the mixture. These were the ingredients chosen to create the perfect killer murder. He will take revenge, like a snowman, on the police officer who sentenced him. <br /> <br /> This movie had such a bad performance, with the exception of Christopher Allport, it was fun. I will say that I am also quite disappointed that this film was not a horror movie, but in fact a dark sitcom. They had a great story with a good story, but it was not done well. All in all, I like the movie at the beginning, but now it is really annoying. But this movie is much better and darker than the sequel.
