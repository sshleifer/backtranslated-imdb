Good idea, badly implemented. Although it could sum up 99% of movies in the SciFi channel, it really applies. I love movies where the good story from the past is slowly evolving and I like action movies, and I like all the main actors, so it could be great. However, despite the good game, this movie fails because of bad writing and directing Bill Platt. <br /> <br /> Another review made you need to know where you are going to get there. This movie is not. It's arranged in such a way that you know that the words "second sketch" are not in Bill Platt's dictionary. There is one scene that is completely unnecessary and can be removed without notice. This scene begins and ends when you drive a car, so you can go from one car scene to another and never miss a senseless scene in the middle. <br /> <br /> This movie also had a strange habit of explaining some details while explaining others, some to the point where you can guess the whole "conspiracy" in front. He also had the habit of breaking the fight earlier, probably only because he can not afford it. There are also some ridiculous bad scenes in which the "plot" is revealed on the computer, and the last battle involving a conveniently placed "toxic glue" (seriously, what * is * it?). <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Shiri Appleby, watch this movie because it's okay. Several times she manages to break out of Roswell's personality and create a good, hard staff (but not always). John De Lancie plays the same character that he plays in everything he has been doing since playing Q in ST: TNG, so it's nothing new. <br /> <br /> In total, I gave this film a 4/10 rating.
