I bet none of you knew that the famous conquistador Hernando Cortes set out on an initial trip to Mexico before he took on the Aztecs. It's a good thing he did because he would never know about those T Rexes that lived in one particular valley, where the locals worshiped them as gods. <br /> <br /> It was understandable. Ian Ziering's blue eyes were not like Cortes. Even with blond hair famous in Beverly Hills 90210 dyed black, Ian looked ridiculous. At least he did not try the Spanish accent. <br /> <br /> The real hero of Tyrannosaurus Azteca is Marco Sanchez also late in a television series with a semi-repetitive role in Walker Texas Ranger as Detective Sandoval from Dallas PD. He finds true love for the Aztec princess, and life would be just perfect, were it not for the unbearable prehistoric beasts that the natives worshiped. <br /> <br /> The Azteca Tyrannosaurus seems to have used some of the famous Sid and Marty Krofft Lost Land scenes. All that was needed was the appearance of a Sleestak. <br /> <br /> If you want to find out about this exploratory trip that did not make the history books come true in all ways, check out Tyrannosaurus Azteca. Then try to sit on it with a straight face.
