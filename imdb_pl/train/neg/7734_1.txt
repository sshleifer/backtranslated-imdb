This movie is the worst movie I've ever seen. The plot is poor - I could not even follow it. Acting is of a school character. The soundtrack is irritating. Attempts at humor are not. Editing is awful. Credits are even slow - I would be ashamed that my name will be related to this film loss. Do not waste time, even thinking about this attempt to act.
