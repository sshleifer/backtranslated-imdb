Let me start by saying that I can enjoy almost every bad film from Italian horror or the exploitation of the jungle from the 70's. Seriously. This one was just terrible. <br /> <br /> There are too many elements that Martino tries to inject, and none of them works (except for things with a wild variety) very well. There are of course ignorants from the West who establish a resort in the jungle. I do not even remember where it's going ... how sad it is ... Basically people come to the center to see the native tribe and its ceremonies, but eventually they upset the "Alligator God" of the river, which then goes crazy, killing these holidaymakers and some tribe members. Sounds good, right? Do not give hope. The end is minimal violence, special effects are so bad that they were made in kindergarten class, and thrown in love story is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> There are a couple of scenes that seem to be set in the camera underwater in the pool and I put a toy alligator in the water, like an arrow, and this is going to be a gator attack. I am not joking. In another marvelously crafted special effect, the Matchbox van is the goal of an incredible drowning plastic gator who is suddenly five times the size of a van. (A few minutes ago it was big enough to eat a man, but now it obscures a full-size van ...) It's really pathetic. The only other movie that I could come up with, where the effects were so bad, I was pulled out of this story, was a masterpiece by Bruno Mattei, "Rats", what about plastic rats on the conveyor and those who CAN NOT be terrified. /> <br /> Normally I would say everything that Sergio Martino has to see, but this one is obligatory. A waste of time and definitely not worth buying at a price of $ 15 + No Shame sticker. This one is SHAME. <br /> <br /> 2 in 10 children.
