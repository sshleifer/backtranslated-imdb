There are some elements that save this movie from total disaster, but are overshadowed by bad acting, story holes, deus ex machina, stupid dialogues, poor script and predictable clich√©s ... <br /> <br /> We have a horror story with a storyline which does not take place most of the time. A group of unlikely heroes, including a black guy who gets it first (yes, this banal seems still very alive even in Finland), seems to have problems with leaving the mysteriously empty hospital. There are screaming ghosts (very ingenious), zombies (at some point I thought that at least they do not use zombies, but they came) and the Finnish glam rock band with demonic makeup, getting in their way. There is also a bit of a doodle with a shift in time, but nothing makes up the story. Autistic girl and hobo seem to have a deeper understanding of the situation, but never give it to the viewer or his confused friends. Their poems consist exclusively of deep life thoughts such as: "What will happen ..." or "Light can not live in the dark ..." or ominous "I need a red pencil ... a red pencil". So all these characters (including worried father and sweet doctor in the type of suffering) end up, running around them on dark floors, or mistakenly with demons. From time to time, a ghost or a group of zombies appears, and if it seems that a demonic keyboard player can not see a group of six people approaching him, waving a flashlight and talking, he only pretended. And apparently this demon can break through the walls without much trouble, but opening the elevator door is beyond its capabilities. <br /> <br /> In the end, we even get a twist of the sequence "it was all a dream". Maybe not. Oh, boy, I'd like this film to be, and the kind that makes time seem to move faster, so it all takes place in just 10 minutes ...
