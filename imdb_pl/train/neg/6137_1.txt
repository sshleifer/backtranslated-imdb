Whew. What can you say about Gymkat, which does not exist yet? This is just pure halarynka from beginning to end. If you want to have a movie that will make you laugh, this is the perfect movie. From Cabot's wild-style comic and Parmistan sweater (and this is four billion ninja), everything in this film reeks of shit. <br /> <br /> Director Robert Clouse, the infamous mind that brought you the scene in the death game of Bruce Lee, again presents his complete lack of directing talent. A few other faces that you will most likely not recognize will also appear for your pleasure, from Buck Kartalian to Tadashi Yamashita, though you will not remember or care for them after the movie. <br /> <br /> Apparently based on the book entitled "The Terrible Game", which, if I could find a single trace of its existence, I would be interested in reading it, to see where this thing went wrong. Instead, the book apparently is a figment of Gymkata's imagination. Probably something Clouse came up with to sell his bad idea. <br /> <br /> Choose this and Yakmallah for yourself. It's easy to be one of the best bad movies I've ever seen, and that's quite a lot.
