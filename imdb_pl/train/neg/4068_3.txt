With such a title is above and beyond my understanding, how this movie just did NOT speak to me. It's true, there are some decent moments and a bit of gore, but the way the movie was filmed and the general story just hit me as a stupid and lazy attempt of a copious "shock" tactic ... a guy raping and murdering a woman stuck on the side of the road. He and his inciting brother are imprisoned until the brother breaks out and makes an appointment with his girlfriend in the forest. In the end, he forces her to enter the house where she turns, and then shows her a collection of kidnapped guys in the basement. Hard-addicted prisoners consist of her old boyfriend who raped her, "caught" neighbor and her sexually rough boss. He explains to her that he will kill them all. She ended up killing HIM, and then focused on men (or pigs) that she herself tortures and kills ... Most violence and humiliation is related to the destruction of food and the destruction of genitalia - all of which are far from disturbing and generally mild. The best scene is graphic masturbation with a broom, followed by painful human rape ... Certainly "I Spit on Your Corpse, IP! Ss on Your Grave "was to be an unofficial continuation of" I Spit on Your Grave "- based mainly on the title and reference that the main character gives - suggesting that her mother was Camille Keaton. Personally, I think it's a blasphemous statement! This film is a boring, amateurish mess that tends to shake up, but fails miserably ...
