Actually, I did not mind Geico ads in the first 50 times I saw them, and even thought they were a little flashy and fun, BUT SERVER! This is the BEST thing that these people could come up with ?! This show sucks! He is bland and wants to watch the episode "The Office" with characters dressed as cavemen (I know that many of you hate me for saying that, but "Office" just does not do this for me). Okay, I understand: we have a poor man who only tries to keep his nose clean and he has an ugly boss who hates him; a pseudo-intellectual who simply has a poorly functioning intellect; and stupid who wants to be accepted, but SO WHAT !!! I worked with these people and found that they are just as annoying in real life as on television ... why would I want to waste another 1/336 of my week watching more such nominations?!? Call your parents and ask them if they drop you on the head, if after reflection you are still cheating, thinking it's entertainment.
