Despite the great touches in the future project, the clever assumption of Asimov and the reliable, good performance of Will Smith, this film does not live up to expectations. Cliches come thick and fast; (waking up from a recurring nightmare, an independent policeman has a badge voided by a lieutenant hardass, to mention more, it can spoil - you can see the end of a mile) This film is also scenic - you never feel that you have traveled anywhere; what should be a global catastrophe never leaves CGI Chicago. The robots themselves are good at getting closer, but the "crowd" scene looks more like a bad Disney - CGI is still exaggerated. And if you can destroy robots, smash them, why do they have to inject "nanites"? You know, it's a duff movie, when such stupid questions start to bother you before the climax. It could be great, but it's less than the sum of its parts, mainly due to the completely predictable story that could have come from any action movie of the last forty years.
