I will abandon the usual comparisons to a legendary filmmaker known for his neurotic personality from New York because, to be honest, comparing him with the inept loser Josh Kornbluth is just an insult to any such director. I will also avoid mentioning the "Office Space" satire in the same breath as this celluloid catastrophe. But I can compare this with waking up during my own surgery? watching is painful and you wonder if surgeons really know what they are doing. Haiku Tunnel is a kind of movie that you would like them to plug in in the early stages of production. It was cruel to let her live, and hence, the audience around the world is forced to suffer. <br /> <br /> Creating a movie? if it really has? it is not worth discussing, but because of caution. Josh Kornbluth, a temporary employee with a serious involvement phobia, gets a permanent job. His main duty is to send 17 high-priority letters to his boss. But it is ridiculously unable to do this simple task. My reaction? Great thing! This is not history? it is, at best, a passing thought - one that should be passed by any self-respecting filmmaker. <br /> <br /> The main actor? if you can call him that? it is a clumsy man's buffoon, with plump features, a receding, unbridled line of hair and a series of facial expressions that stretches from glaring to a simple disturbing. Where did the director find this schmuck? What are you saying ???? Is he a director? Oh, my mistake. Playing in your own embarrassment scenario is one thing, but I suspect that Mr. Kornbluth is not as convincing as a man, let alone an actor. Rest assured that this is not a pointless character killing, but I've never been so angry about the presence of an actor on the screen before! My frustration was further disturbed by his incessant monologues to the camera between scenes. I mean, if the spectator needed a bit of intelligence to understand this nonsense, Kornbluth insults us further, "explaining" the action (the first principle of making a film: "dramatize the exhibition"? Show, do not talk). Who is this guy? There is no charisma, no charm, and judging by Hawaiian shirts, there is no sense of style. His foundry agent should be shot point-wise! <br /> <br /> Supporting actors do nothing to alleviate the intense boredom I felt with one exception. Patricia Scanlon looks very funny as Helen, a former secretary who has been deceived by her old boss, and makes tormenting telephone calls from the basement, holding the flashlight under her face. It made me giggle, but the moment soon passed and I returned to check the watch for the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> The title of the movie is also misleading. The Haiku tunnel has nothing to do with the ancient form of Japanese poetry. Do not be fooled by the idea that this is a movie about an artistic home because of its pretentious sound or the fact that he only played a few cinemas and did not make money at the cash register ?????? there is a good reason for this! <br /> <br />
