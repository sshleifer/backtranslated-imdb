Oh, once a famous actress in the movie where she plays mother with child. It is shown on BBC 1 at half past midnight, I wonder if ... yup to TVM <br /> <br /> You have to pass it to TVM producers, and not settle for making one average movie, usually give us two average movies, in which two topics are mixed together and NEVER HIDE. The first topic is a woman in a dangerous topic, pollinated by a woman suffering from pain related to the subject of divorce, which means that we have a scene in which the heroine survived the murder trial, followed by the scene in which her son Sam asks why she divorced ? And being a TVM, he replies that the reason is "That people change," and they do not say something like "I'm right" or "Your daddy is in public sex toilets", as happens in the case of a divorce in real life . this is young Sam, I feel sorry for him, not only his parents are divorced, but he is as dense as two short boards. Actually, because he is so stupid that he does not deserve sympathy because he is not aware that the man is letting things down the toilet is a drug dealer, unaware that you can die if someone shoots at you and unaware that I LOVE LUCCY painfully awkward. If only our own childhood was so innocent, and like Orwell he said, "Ignorance is strength." Sam suddenly becomes an expert on marine life! Is this character development or a bad script? I know what my money is all about. And it's strange that Sam boy, genuis, did not notice that if history takes place in 1994, why do people often wear clothes, drive cars and ride trains from the 1950s? turns out when the plot turns into a mother who is a mannequin. Then there is the final turn of the action that made me feel like an idiot for watching this
