It's a terrible remake of a marginal but well-liked movie from the early 70's. I saw the original at least 6 times. Version from 1997 This is a 20-minute film "crowded" for 2 hours or any other. Trashy plot, which by the way is completely different than the original. The government's involvement was very far-fetched. There is no flow from one scene to another. In the original you can go for a beer or hit the bathroom and keep up. <br /> <br /> It took just a few hours to change the oil pan in the car. It takes many times longer than in real life. The guys from cars notice this. In addition, fools or fools who picked up the 1968 charger and abusing the 1970 Challenger should be shot in a heel with a blunt missile. The fact that they are not "people from the car" is painfully obvious, and their departure will not be saddened. <br /> <br /> Actors lacked emotions, everything was cut and dried. One step above monotony. Barmitzwa is more exciting and energetic. <br /> <br /> Finally, no less important, the radio DJ said that the Challenger hit bulldozers at 180 or 185 (??). It's total rubbish. Can you say that aerodynamics or lack thereof? Hahahaha !! This movie is a joke. Do not waste time watching this.
