The story of Nikolai Gogol "Viy" was filmed again and released in the American film through Faith Films. <br /> <br /> The original story concerns a priest who must watch over the witch's body only with his faith to protect him. Extensively expanded and embedded in America, although clearly filmed in Russia (houses, clothes and equipment are bad despite English characters), this is a strange movie that does not really work. Some of them are a strange setting that tries very hard. It's hard to be backwoods of America, but it's clearly not. There are also strange, deliberately oblique moments, when the main character is a reporter at the beginning and a priest soon. I'm not sure why they did it, even after watching the creation of the song on DVD. Another problem is dubbing, which is beyond terrible. It's done so that everyone talks when their lips are not on the camera - or if they are, the voices do not even match the lip's flaps. I do not know if it's the fault of Faith Films or the producers who made the film, wanting to throw themselves on the West (revealed during the creation of the song). <br /> <br /> The film is not very good. As I mentioned, it has many different technical problems that make it a strange curio. Despite the really good looking horror movies never work as a horror film. As a film to arouse faith, he is too confused in this repetition to make someone feel closer to God. <br /> <br /> Given the choice, I would give him a pass, even at a reasonable price. I would advise you to find a version of the story from 1960 called Viy, which will bring both shivering and understanding of faith in god.
