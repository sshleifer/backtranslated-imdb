My nose is slightly bent when I write it. I sent a previous commentary to this video a few weeks ago, which has not yet appeared, so I assume it was rejected, even though it met all the usual guidelines. <br /> <br /> I find this movie interesting for the first thirty minutes, especially the performance of Jordi Moll√†, an acting veteran who has appeared in such important productions as "Blow" and "The Alamo". Leonor Watling is also pretty good. Unfortunately, everything finally falls under the weight of a truly terrible, melodramatic scenario. There is also plenty of free nudity that does nothing to develop a narrative or give an impressionistic nuance to what is otherwise a beautifully filmed work of art. be much less intrusive than re-meeting with these fictional characters anywhere, anytime.
