As a child, the first part ("The Little Mermaid") was my favorite movie. He was full of great characters, songs and a funny family movie. Once again, I watched this movie for the first time. I believe that this movie was like most of the sequels and did not exceed their original. I think I feel that way, probably because I had high expectations and I grew up. However, this is not a bad movie. <br /> <br /> It starts when Ariel has just had a beautiful baby, Melody. Eric and Ariel feel threatened by Morgana (sister of Eurselas), so they build a large wall around the house, which is located by the sea. When Melody grows up, she begins to think outside the walls where she is not allowed to go. Troubles arise when Morgana tries to take control of the seven seas. <br /> <br /> I do not want to give away any movie, so you have to see it to find out. I liked the fact that the voices are the same and again great singing. I think it's a good family movie, though generally!
