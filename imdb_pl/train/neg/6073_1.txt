* MANY MULTIPLE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW * This movie was awful. I am a big baseball fan, so I thought I would watch it and I was very disappointed. It started well. When I saw DeNiro's bad influence on his young son, I was hoping to become a better father throughout the movie or something. Anyway, at first it seemed that DeNiro was supposed to be a hero. He was the only one who believed in Bobby and had his adorable son whom he lost in his care, which gave me a reason for feeling unwell. He wanted to help Bobby, talking to Primo, when he was absolutely brutally stabbed Primo to death ... Not to mention this sketchy, repetitive song "I WANT TO **** YOU !!!!" <br / > <br /> Later, when DeNiro saves Bobby's son from drowning, I was hoping the film would compensate ... He could forgive himself for having killed Primo if he saved Bobby's son. But of course this is far beyond the depths of the film, because all he cares about is to get a CREDIT for murder and theft of Bobby's son and dog and to hold them hostage - Bobby just has to get home and announce that DeNiro is "A real fan", displaying a photo of his biting knife. <br /> <br /> Now we come to a completely unrealistic scene at the end ... It's hell and we're expected to believe that the game was not called. Then DeNiro somehow magically appears in the field in the referee's suit and calls Bobby at home, pulling out the knife and starting to stab all those who run into the field. There are no officers in the field (but the police are on the way), so DeNiro steps into the mound and prepares to put the knife on Bobby when he is shot. But do not worry, this happy and pleasant movie has a happy ending because Bobby finds a son. <br /> <br /> This is not a sports movie. It's NOT a fan. As far as I know, fans are not mad psychopaths who threaten, rob, and throw knives in their admirators. This is probably the worst movie I will ever see in my life. The plot was shallow, the soundtrack was sucked, the movie had no purpose. I warn you not to waste time on this disgusting pretext for the film.
