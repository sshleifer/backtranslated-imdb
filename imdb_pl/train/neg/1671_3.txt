I saw it on the market during the Cannes film festival. <br /> <br /> It's a real cheap product - it's bad, but you have to make up for it with a little bit of sex or gore or both. <br /> <br /> Think of Larry Cohen. <br /> <br /> Sean Young is an interesting actor - well done to the producers for catching it. <br /> <br /> The scene opening the descending spaceship is fun - you can imagine all crew members are shaking it! <br /> <br /> Ha ha - but I wish people who have done it well - at least this is not pretentious.
