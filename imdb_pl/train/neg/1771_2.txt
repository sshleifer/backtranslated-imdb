It must be one of the worst films I've ever seen without a doubt. The only thing that's interesting in this movie are the performances of some great directors and the King himself. The film has a great premise, but it falls apart for about 15 minutes. In the movie, I liked Madchen Amick and I think she could have a very good career in the movie.
