I really wanted to like The Pillow Book. An intriguing story, interesting features of the character, Ewan Macgregor in an absolutely glorious whole. Unfortunately, I hated every minute of him. Greenaway was so impressed with presenting the film in a unique way, not in favor of the movie. I will not even fall into the hopeless acting of Vivian Wu. <br /> <br /> You are pulling away from history thanks to the 4 billion invisible windows and calligraphy that takes place at the bottom of the screen, displaying the lyrics of the music being played. It seems that he lost sight of the real story and developing the story, and got tangled up in foo-foo embellishments that have nothing to do with anything. It's a bit like showing a portrait of John Singer Sargeant in chintzy Hallmark, which says "GRANDMA LOVES ME!" In brilliant letters. <br /> <br /> This film seems to be the victim of the director's ego instead of what could have been - disturbingly and terrifyingly beautiful. In the hands of another director (Jeunet? Coppola?) It could have been a masterpiece. In Greenaway's hands, it's best to get art classes that also take themselves too seriously.
