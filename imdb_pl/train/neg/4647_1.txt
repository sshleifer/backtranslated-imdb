Half of the feedback was good, so I used the chance for $ 10. Sure, Priscilla Barnes had a conversation about sex, but that was not much. The whole plot later, that she could be the second mother of the actress and documentary filmmaker falling on a young woman, stretches her. It is not funny that it is not so lewd that there is nothing but a waste of time. Boogie Nights was based on real people who were in the adult industry, relying on nothing that did not happen in the industry. It could have shocked what is popular today in adult movies, mocking today's gonzo movies and this great orgy that took 5 minutes to make a joke that a larger orgy was made bigger and better decades ago in the early 1970s.
