I got a DVD "Bogeyman" and this stunker was an additional function. I assumed it was "Boogeyman II" because it was paired with the original. But you know what they say about those who "assume": it is the "butt" of "u" and "me". I read before showing that BII contains a lot of material from the original and that actress Love appeared in it. While watching "Return of the Boogeyman" I decided to go through the original material to see the famous death scene after a toothbrush. Before I knew it, the movie was over. Rip-off. I think I thought it was BII because it has a similar title to one of the alternative titles of BII. Well, at least it was just an extra function, right? <br /> <br /> Let me stop talking about my mistake and start talking about movie errors. Many, many mistakes. Who is this guy Ulli? Whatever he thinks? Do you really think that the same movie will be sold in various forms. There is nothing original that holds part III up. It is basically a retrospection of the original in the eyes of a psychic who gives us exhausting boredom when everything happens. It is a film. Oh, and one death scene after stereo, but you can read it from another person's review. My interest in "Boogeyman II" is lost forever. <br /> <br /> Last Note: This is not a series of movies that we watch from behind.
