Just like "THIS IS MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD WORLD" is at the top of my list of all the best comedies ever created, this one is at the very bottom. (Of course, I could have been wrong - I did not see "SAVING SILVERMAN"). In other words, it is a lame, lame, lame, lame comedy. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/2 * out of ** ***
