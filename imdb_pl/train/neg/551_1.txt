I've looked at the list of the 100 best AFI comedies and I have to say that this is really one of the worst. Not only from 90 movies on the list that I've seen, but from every movie I've ever seen. Drunks is funny sometimes, Dudley is not. Liza almost made it worth it, but unfortunately ... just watch Arrested Development if you want to see it in something good. Seriously, Dudley laughs and drinks to be funny? I highly recommend almost EVERY other movie about the 100 best AFI comedy. If you want to see a more fun "drunkard", try "The Thin Man". The funniest movie in general, every movie Marx Brothers will kill (especially if you're as drunk as Artur).
