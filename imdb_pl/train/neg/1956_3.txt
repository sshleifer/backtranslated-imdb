This movie has one exchange function. At some point, after the character is attacked by a sorceress with an ax, his brother asks him: "Why is your dick there, Chuck?" After suffering for almost an hour of bad film, it almost caused my drink to fall out of my nose. <br /> <br /> Some of the acting is not so bad, but all the children stink and PJ Soles should be ashamed of himself for making this movie. History is weak and no one does what you think (or what common sense dictates). They should. <br /> <br /> Of course there are many story points that do not add up. For example, in one scene the ghosts of young children must concentrate to move a physical object so that they can prove that they exist, which is a difficult feat because they apparently can not interact with physical matter. However, after a few minutes, everyone lifts branches from the ground and overcomes them with the Tooth Fairy. Apparently, you can sometimes move matter and sometimes NOT. Go to the figure. <br /> <br /> A lot of blood and guts ... some nice boobs. But that does not compensate for the shortcomings. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie about Tooth Fairy, go and rent "Darkness Falls". I think it's great, although many other reviewers do not share my opinion. At least it gives you a mood.
