This is certainly one of the worst films ever made and released in a large Hollywood studio. The plot is simply stupid. Dialogue is written in clich√©s; thanks to this you can do many sentences in the script. Acting is ridiculously bad, especially Rod Roder. "Choreography" is stupid and completely non-erotic. One can only sympathize with a reviewer who saw the dance of 23-year-old Yvonne as sexual; it's just a bad choreography. The ballet scene at the beginning of the film is particularly ridiculous. If you like bad movies and you like to laugh with some Hollywood turkeys, this is for you. I bought a colorful version on VHS, making the film even worse. Yvonne's heavy makeup, when it's colored, makes her look like a clown all the time. And is the best part of this movie. What a way to start a career.
