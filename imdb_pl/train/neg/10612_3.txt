Wow, what a great premise for the film: set it around a filmmaker with a writer's block who decides to take tango lessons. Hey, and what's even better idea, he gave the lead role to the creator of the movie, which is interested in tango. Man, I'd like to have this talent for genius. Yes, I'm sarcastic. <br /> <br /> It amazes me that this kind of zero potential for making money is created. Come on, unless you're a furious tango fan (I admit they exist, judging by comments) or a hard-core fan club Sally Potter (?) In this movie, there's nothing that would make you go to the cinema to see it. Even if you are in tango, a significant part of the movie is occupied with senseless scenes, such as home renovation or wheelchair riding a man <br /> <br /> Soon, a review, in which an unsuccessful screenwriter from Scotland sits in front of the computer writing very sarcastic, but very funny movie reviews that he saw. Shake up when Theo Robertson puts the shoe into the latest Hollywood hits, cries out of compassion when he receives another letter rejecting from the film company, falls into lust when he takes a bath and rubs the soap on a well-toned body. LESSON REVIEW soon in the cinema near you, if someone is stupid enough to fund the movie <br /> <br /> PS Sally Potter is not related to Harry Potter
