Ok, where will we start from this little gem? Mutated slugs start taking over the small town of New England (?). Only one man can stop them ... and this man ... it's Mike Brady! Now, if it was not fun enough, stay on standby. <br /> <br /> Recording of snails is known as film material. Regardless of who attacks the snails or where they are, the same shot of stacks of snails that are sifted everywhere is shown. Remember that this single shot takes up at least half of the movie. <br /> <br /> The actor in the movie was knocked down, dragged, steal the wallet, hit his girlfriend, killed the dog, BAD. I'm sure it is worse, but it will be difficult to find it. The only gem was ... you guessed ... MIKE BRADY! He had to take some night classes at YMCA because he was the best in this group. <br /> <br /> What about horror? This film should not be taken seriously. There is no horror! These are snails for loud crying. All the rising action could be avoided with a salt shaker or two. Watch this movie only in an MST3K environment, otherwise I see serious brain damage.
