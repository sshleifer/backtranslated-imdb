I've seen a lot of good Korean films, including thrillers and videos with a darker overtone, but this one sucks. The director seems to be a sadist who accidentally inclined someone to produce some trash. The film has no entertainment value and is not even a thriller. I can not believe that someone really did such a movie. Even though acting is fine, the plot and feeling it leaves is awful. <br /> <br /> I'm sure I will not watch any of the director's films. There is no point in filming and disappointment in the moments of the thriller. All this shows scenes of a psychopath wasting drums with ill-conceived scenes and showing more thoughts about blood and violence that make it exciting. A very disappointing movie and I definitely recommend skipping all of these types of films.
