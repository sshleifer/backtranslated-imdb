I'm sorry, guys, I've already written my opinion about this movie, but today was the first day I watched other reviews. There are quite a few people who agree with me, but it's scary that there are people who really like this movie. I do not like to write unpleasant reviews or criticize other people's opinions, but I think it's fair to warn anyone who can debate or see this movie. This is not a good movie. I really like movies, and I will watch almost everything, but this movie was not on the incredibly short list of movies that I watched and was happy to leave halfway. If you're really tempted, watch the trailer ... it's a mistake I made because the whole movie is essentially a trailer ... after that there are no surprises, just a shockingly bad dialogue wasting time. I love Michael Vartan in Alias ​​and I would not like to criticize him, but I think it's my job to stop other people from wasting hours of life in such a movie !!
