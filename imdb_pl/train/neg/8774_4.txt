Plot: A film of 4 odd hours includes, in appropriate detail, events in the Kargil sector near LOC in 1999, when the Pakistani infiltrators crossed LOC and entered deep into Indian territory and Indian retaliation. To learn more about this story, I would suggest to readers to read news about Kargil. <br /> <br /> Comment: If someone is looking for a story in this movie, then he can be sure he is absent. LOC is a story of pure devotion, patriotism, courage and a lot of balls and blood. A movie room in which I saw this movie full of whistles and cries when the film shows Indian Bravery. The film audience seemed similar to the audience, as in the cricket match in India and Pakia. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie as a tribute to the victims of the army and characterization of the real war heroes (4 heroes of the PVC) who sacrificed their lives so that we could see this day. The film showed the army, which fought with all the adversities in difficult weather conditions. Film negatives are such that it is too stretched, and the songs are extremely boring.
