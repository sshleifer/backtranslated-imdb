After finishing the book on the same day that I watched the movie, I knew what was going to happen. I had high expectations for the film because of the rating. The only reason I give this film 2 out of 10 stars is that everything was fine to be a movie. I have some major points that I do not like this movie. <br /> <br /> ********** SPOILERS ********** <br /> <br /> 1. Cast. Jack Nicholson narrowly fits the character of Jack Torrence. Besides, I would NEVER choose Shelly Duvall for Wendy. I imagined Wendy differently. But I see why they chose Jack Nicholson, a smile, pointed eyebrows, but he should not look like "bad." He has to look normal and he gets angry. In addition, they form one of the worst movie couples. Danny was fine, but he needed more life. He behaved like a droney. <br /> <br /> 2. Scenario. They cut out so many things that were in the book and added things. Some of the things that were in the book that I expected in the movie were either removed, changed or mistreated. Some of the things that were in the book, which I could not wait for (hedge animals, hammer, elevator) was not in the movie, and it was 2 and a half hours !! I was very annoyed. <br /> <br /> 3. Conclusion. The ending was completely changed, Halorann died, Jack died to death, Wendy was never hurt ... The Overlook did not explode. The Ending was so cool in this book that the movie horrified him so much that I was appealed. Hallorann never had to die, but Jack killed him with an ax. If they wanted to kill him, at least let Jack use the hammer. You never saw a hammer during the whole movie. <br /> <br /> There are other things that I did not like about the movie, but there are things that were fine. Angels from the cameras were cool, the blood coming out of the elevator (it did not happen in the book) was cool, but maybe I was too annoyed that the movie did not fit the book, to be afraid at all. I recommend reading the book before you see this movie. I praise Stephen King for actually agreeing to sign the contract, not to deactivate Stanley Kubrik. I would never do it, I would take all the laws that I could shout at him all day. I can not wait for the 6-hour version, at least it has hedges. <br /> <br /> Mark: 2/10
