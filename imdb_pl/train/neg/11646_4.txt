Kojak meets the mafia. Telly Savales is one of those guys from the past that seem quite forgotten. I never thought that his program was so great. This is his one-dimensional characteristics of the head of the crime, with very predictable results. If you take car chases and generally you will not get involved in them, there will not be too many actions or actions. I believe that mafia movies are boring because I have no respect or interest in ordinary criminals and their actions. Hollywood, and in this case Italian cinema, treat these guys like heroes. I saw this movie and I do not remember much about it in a few days. Lots of shootings, innocent witnesses dying, betrayal and this sick loyalty. The film is quite well photographed and the game is decent. But the dubbing is so bad (because of the voices that just could not get out of these bodies) that I almost started looking for Godzilla approaching the bay.
