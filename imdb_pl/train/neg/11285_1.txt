I'm reading a book by James Hawes. It was pretty neat, not great but fun enough. Without reading the book, I would not have the slightest idea what was going on, and this knowledge was still stress. <br /> <br /> Literally, every element of this movie is fatal in a way that you do not have the ability to describe. Half of the digested fish could make a better movie using matches and dayglo lipsticks. <br /> <br /> I've never felt so angry before as a movie. The next fragments of the mattress were closest, but even they never reached such deep, disgusting, disgusting horror as this bilge. <br /> <br /> From the moment I lost 90 minutes of my life on this scourge of human kind, I can not even look at every book by James Hawes without feeling angry. This is the depth of hatred I have for this piece of sh * t. No, it's unfair. Let me apologize for all the fecal matter for comparing you to the unearthly evil that is rancid aluminum. <br /> <br /> Plain and just cancer in the world of cinema.
