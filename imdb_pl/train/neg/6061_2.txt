This part of the Horror Masters was terrible. Apparently Mr. Carpenter must learn something about stimulation and decent, credible dialogue. There were times when I was literally shouting at the TV set for something to happen. Maybe he thinks he's building tension, but Carpenter has to cut off that exaggerated, too-simplified score of him (or his son) and speed up the action. How many times the girl said: "Oh no, I can not have this child!" And "Oh, no, it comes"? Carpenter downloads elements from many, much better movies (Assault on Precinct 13 and The Thing) and throws them here, as if we were to recognize and appreciate his style. There is a lack of real tension and energy here. It's as if he were idle through the process of making a movie. <br /> <br /> For better Carpenter movies, stick to proven and real classics - The Thing, Halloween and They Live. For better masters of episodes of horror, check out my personal favorites: Family, Jenifer and Dreams in the Witch House.
