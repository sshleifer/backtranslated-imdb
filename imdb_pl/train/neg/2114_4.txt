It's enough to look at sets, staging and editing, to make it easy to say that the project lacks the right budget. Maybe Bela Lugosi is to draw your mind away from such things. Young brides die at the altar after saying "I". Their corpse is stolen by the well-known gardener Dr. Lorenzo (Lugosi) and some of his weird minions because his aging wife (Elizabeth Russell) needs injections of glandular fluid of young virgins to stay forever young ... forever beautiful. An eager local cub reporter (Luana Walters) realizes that every missing bride wore the same rare orchid to the altar; an orchid in which Dr. Lorenz would be the most competent. A typical storm of horror evokes a terrible visit to the Lorenz estate; especially with a dwarf and a whistling humpback in the area. Other players: Angelo Rossitto, Tristram Coffin, Minerva Urecal and Frank Moran.
