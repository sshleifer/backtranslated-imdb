Anyone who has watched several Lifetime Movie Network movies knows that the credibility of the story is the first thing that is removed from the planning table. So when crazy Lara moves into Patti's house and methodically starts running her housekeeper, I did not even blink. When Lara finally increased her activity, threatening poor Patti and daring to do anything about it, I nodded. You see, on Planet LMN people do not behave as they do for some special reason, they just do it to continue the action. Only on Planet LMN could someone almost have a house owner thrown out of their home thanks to their seductive powers !! Poor Patti - she just trusted too much, and Lara left the medicine, and then there was a great fight at the top of the stairs, including a syringe full of deadly things that ends up being injected into someone's belly, and a body bag coming out the front door. Horror! <br /> <br /> But take it from me, this Planet LMN product is a classic. You have to watch it once, only for the big laughs that you will have. In the Improbability Scale I gave this movie 95/100. Make a large portion of popcorn and get apple slices. You will understand later.
