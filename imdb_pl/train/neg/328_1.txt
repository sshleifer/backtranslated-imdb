I am a HUGE fan of Adam Sandler and one day I looked at the selection of Cast & Crew on one of my DVDs and saw "Going Overboard" and decided to rent it. So I left with some friends and I hired him. We put it on and we were shocked to see Adam Sandler, who has not yet reached puberty, it looks like he was 12 years old when this movie appeared. I could not even watch 30 minutes of this shit, I did not laugh, I did not giggle, I did not even smile at the movie, actually I only once smiled when I saw how horrible this movie is. I could not believe how much he tried to make the audience laugh in this movie ... and it did not work once. Although, seeing the terrible camera angles and hearing the disgusting scenario, I understood why I had never heard of this film ... because it sucks more than anything I've ever sucked before. This film, in my opinion, was the worst film ever made, .... EVER!
