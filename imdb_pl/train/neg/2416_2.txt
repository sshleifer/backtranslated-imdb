2 stars, and I'm generous. (minor spoilers) Look, this is a low-budget zombie movie in the Oakland gangland. Over time, the scientist wants to bring his dead brother back to life after being killed on the road. <br /> <br /> The main problem with this movie: what zombies ?! All "zombies" make a snarl (which does not even sound horrible) and drips the false red blood from their mouths! No terrifying eyes, no decaying body, just a group of people snarling pitifully and running like idiots. <br /> <br /> The cover is also misleading. There are only about 6 zombies in the entire movie, so it's not like the entire "hood" is plagued by a zombie or something, it's just a few of them, and in a short time. <br /> <br /> Acting is actually so bad that it's fun. No one can act in this movie at all (except maybe one of the gang members) and it looks like a group of friends have gathered, decided to throw their family and make a movie one weekend. <br /> <br /> Last note: since when doctors wear tracksuits ?! Skip this one, please!
