If it smells like rubbish and looks like rubbish, it must be rubbish. It's definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my whole life. The poor director style of Tony Scott embarrasses the already uninteresting and somewhat untrue story of Domino Harvey's life as a bounty hunter. The story is completely discontinuous and confusing to watch. Some aspects of the plot were funny and unbelievable. It seems that all action scenes have been loosely linked by weak points and terrible acting. Keira Knightley, however, is completely naked in this. This is the only plus of this film. If you want to see her naked, just move the movie forward about an hour and a half and you'll catch a lot of nipple. I strongly suggest that no one see this movie EVER! </ 3
