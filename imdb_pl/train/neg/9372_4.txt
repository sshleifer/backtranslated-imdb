This is a typical late movie "Universal horror": technically consistent when it comes to numbers, with the story of cutting cookies and serious overcharging. The most interesting part of this movie is the stunt cast of Ronda Hartton, a man with bone disease as a "monster" of the film. It is sad that this man was used, but he probably used the money he paid him well. Hatton is less frightening than the studio expected, because I felt more and more pity over fear and even disgust. Martin Koslack is on board as a crazy artist and is very funny in this part. For example, I like to see Koslak in almost everyone; for some reason, a man is playing with me. The only other part of the movie that has entertained me is the absurd approach to the world of art. Here we have been shown bad art critics who enjoy their ability to break artists; it is next to the male "hero" of the film, which is an "artist" who paints ... get it ... pop girls. Somehow the work of our hero is reviewed next to the sculpture of the absurd village. The main nasty critic of the movie is also funny, who at one point claims that he despises the hero's madness, because "such women do not exist", which our heroine responds, assuring that the critic simply does not go out enough. Finally, there is some hints about the domestication of the heroine (who is itself a critic of art) by a leading man ... a completely anti-feminist and absurd witness. In general, this movie is a rather mediocre picture with a few funny elements.
