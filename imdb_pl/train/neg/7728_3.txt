.... this mini does not get better with age. I saw it and its sequel when it was originally broadcast, and like many others it was blown away. At the beginning of 2002, I borrowed novels for WOW and W and R and was even more impressed. Then I decided that I had to see both again and invest $ 200 into DVD sets. I watched both minis again in painful detail and realized that I had done something back - I should have bought novels and borrowed DVDs. <br /> <br /> I do not believe that this is terribly wrong? Read the novels and see for yourself. Do not you think that it is outdated? Screen for someone who is not old enough to see how it was originally broadcast and watch the reaction you receive (warning - the reactions of such people range from the appearance of the horror to the belly laugh). <br /> <br /> According to the trivia section, this mini - Dan Curtis himself chose Ali MacGraw and Robert Mitchum. Yikes !! Production quality, music score, dialogue - a great story has been transformed into a soap opera from the late 1970s by an overly ambitious producer / director who was on the right track. This thing was dated when it was finished. <br /> <br /> These two minis were great when they were original and for those of us who saw them then, they tug at the nostalgic string that reminds us of the younger days. IMO - this mini will not meet your reputation and seriously disappoint.
