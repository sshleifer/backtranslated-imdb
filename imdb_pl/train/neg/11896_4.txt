Before I start, I _love_ Eddie Izzard. I think it is one of the funniest costumes to this day. Perhaps that means I'm getting too big, but I just do not think Eddie is funny on this trip. <br /> <br /> I think the main problem is that Eddie is trying too hard to be Eddie. Everyone knows him as a completely unimportant comic book and we all love him for that. But in Circle it seems to be more irrelevant than funny and completely lost me. He discussed many of the topics he discussed earlier - I even think I recognized some recycled jokes there. <br /> <br /> If you buy a DVD, you'll see a scenario from Eddie's route (interesting in places, but not very fun) and the French language version of one of his programs. Die-hards will like Eddie in a different language, but a comedy with subtitles is not very funny. <br /> <br /> If you're Eddie's fan, you already have it or you're going to buy what I say. If you just go, buy Glorious or Dressed to Kill - you will not be disappointed. You'll probably be with Circle.
