A recipe for one of the worst movies of all time: a black man who looks like he has escaped from WWF has a terrible target with a gun that has inconsistent effects (the first guy he shoots, catches fire, but when he shoots someone he just disappears and sacrifices time) to pet the deer, then you have unlikely characters, 30-year-old students, a lame attempt to end the surprise and much, much more. Avoid at all costs.
