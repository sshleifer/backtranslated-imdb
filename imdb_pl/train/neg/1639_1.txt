"Bita" lasts 82 minutes. This review has 82 words. Three implausible New York Lotharios, ruthless "cheats", end up on the same woman played by Amanda Peet, with catastrophic consequences. This applies to history and film. Too sophisticated to be a misogynist, flaccid and funny, "Bita" mixes the philosophy of shocking jockey Tom Lykis with phantasies on the penthouse. Although technically proficient, it is dated, embarrassing, poorly written, medium and obvious. People do not behave this way. People do not say that. Really.
