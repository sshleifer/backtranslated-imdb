This movie was not as difficult as I expected. There are a few seconds of brilliance in this somewhat idiotic, paranoid-conspiracy Hardcore UFO conspiracy. Most of the acting is average, but quite typical for things in the 70s style, filled with pregnancy breaks. Photographer and model are witnesses of strange events in the forest and soon fall victim to the same events. Flying saucers are noticed, more and more people are disappearing - but are these aliens or a secret group of our hiding governments? Soon, the reporter and "UFOnautist" (apparently modeled on the character of the writer-director) are caught up in this revealing fiasco and become the target of ultra-secret agents who are as dangerous as unbelievable and ungodly. Then the fun really begins. <br /> <br /> The film, as you might expect, is more or less as sensible as the average UFO conspiracy theory, but it should be praised for such a serious treatment of yourself. The work of the camera is fine for a low-budget film, the stimulation is quite good, the scenario is stupid and absurd, and the problems with continuity are a pleasure. What few seconds did I mention? Honestly, I can not tell you much without writing a spoiler. Suffice it to say that the end of the movie is, at least, worth skipping forward if you can not do it in the middle.
