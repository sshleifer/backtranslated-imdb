This movie makes you really appreciate the invention of the fast scroll button on the remote. It's beautiful boredom in beautiful pictures. For the first time, Hamilton is relatively easy to take pictures with soft focusing. However, it was hard for me to think that although Anja Schüte was about 19 years old, when she was shot, the girls are presented as younger than in reality. This whole thing with Lolita, especially because of the older man, leaves me rather restless. The heroine is shaved in the pubic area to make her look younger. Come on, sex is a nice past time - between compliant adults. Another thing I discovered was that neither Beart nor Schüte had a naked scene in the film, or at least not the right one.
