Wow, I just saw it on T.V. as one of the "scary" movies that show around Halloween. Was this rated G? There really was nothing terrible in this movie or worth a look. Others also say it's a travesty, but I do not think so. You need something that is called "humor" for a parody. This low-budget crappy festival did not have any sense of humor, nor did it make any sense. Basically you have a foolish monster (a man in a rubber suit) coming out of the closets, killing people, I think, because you never see a monster doing violence against anyone or any bloody consequences. The swirling newspaper tells you that people have been killed by a monster, so I think that's enough. <br /> <br /> The military is trying to kill a monster that is not much bigger than a man. They have a very bad goal. Then the FLEES army! Wow, did this movie make the American army look miserable? The monster, though difficult to kill, does not do much except shuffling and roaring. Oh, from time to time, a second head pops out of his mouth and screams. It was a bit interesting and at the same time a total ripost of Alien. <br /> <br /> What was the deal with a xylophone scientist to attract a monster? It was difficult to understand many dialogues due to the low sound quality. Besides, why did the monster carry the main ugly guy for so long? Why did not the monster enter the wardrobe when he had a chance? Why do I insist on trying to understand meaningless sense?
