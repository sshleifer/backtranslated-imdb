Another weak entry of the third season, "Is There In Truth No Beauty?", However, has at least one key element of the plot, which is very different and, as Spock would say, fascinating. The main character is an alien who must be worn in a black case, because his appearance is so frightening that it drives people mad. It is a pity that the episode can not fulfill this amazing assumption. Of course, I think it was a mistake to "show" the stranger, because his real face is in no way approaching such a daunting accumulator; everything we get is a standard psychedelic Star Trek display used for any number of things in different episodes, usually when a ship is going through a magnetic storm or something similar. In any case, the appearance of Kollos can at least be tolerated by Mr. Spock, and then only when Spock is wearing a special visor. (For the longest time I thought the alien was called "Carlos", which I thought was humorous, but digression.) Spock must connect the mind with Kollos at one point so that the alien can pilot the Enterprise back into safety. This is achieved, but when Spock / Kollos come back to finish the mind process, by golly, Spock forgets about the viewfinder. Oh, she is crazy, but she finally recovers with the help of Kollos' assistant, a blind woman with psychic powers. It can be a really bizarre, great episode, but it is poorly directed and appears as one more badly made series from last season.
