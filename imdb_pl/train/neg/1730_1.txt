First of all, I would like to emphasize that I only know about the series because my younger sister always watches him. I consider it the most annoying program on TV. There is nothing funny in "jokes", and canned laughter is unbearable. The show will work better if it is shot in front of the audience live. In this way, laughter would show how "unkind" is this program. However, I deserve the acting talents of the young cast. However, I am dazed by the idea that in the future they will look at the program and see how bad their first television program was. The show combines with the general irritating voices and style of CBBC presenters. Why today's youth must be shouted out loud is beyond me. That's all.
