I just saw this movie yesterday ... I can not believe the reviews on this site. Those who give it to one-star must be Buffy fanatics. Well, I'm a Buffy fan from the first order, but I know it's shit. In every level this movie is terrible. Technically, most of the time you do not know where you are in this movie, even in one scene, POV jumps like crazy for no reason. Lack of logic in film categories. Emotionally, he is grim because of the bleak and tries to be a psychological thriller when he is simply confusing. Throwing nasty red necks in a movie is a cheap way to convey an "atmosphere". I did not have the patience with it long before the last act, but I played too much with friends doing the MST3K riffs to turn them off. Since leaving Buffy, SMG has 2 successful videos, even if the calculation of "Scooby Doo" on CV can count. Gellar is a great actress, but she (or her agent) certainly can not find a vehicle for her. And Mr. Shepard, if you're having trouble repaying your mortgage, I'll send you a few bucks, if you promise she will not appear again in that movie! (Also Patsy Cline's property should sue for libel!)
