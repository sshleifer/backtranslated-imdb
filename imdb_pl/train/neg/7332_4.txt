Despite the fact that it is a film from 2001, It is a style of the 90s, which was considered "old" and obsolete a few years ago. Trashy cuts and effects were painful to watch. The script is decent enough, and a few scenes have captivated me a bit (like when a taxi driver brings her to the bridge at night). But the story with the detective who killed her sister and how obsessed he was about suicide was just awful. The appearance of the actor playing married boy Selma Blair seriously disturbed me. However, I have read the whole thing, which is rare for this random one, what is the movie that you can find on TV and decide to watch.
