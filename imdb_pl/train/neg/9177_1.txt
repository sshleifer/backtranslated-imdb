The House of the Dead was the worst movie I've ever seen, between the pitiful "matrix" settings of the 360 ​​camera angle and the shoddy actor I slept in. I do not think the director and the set manager could decide if it was raining or not because it would rain on one side of the boat, not on the other. I would rate this movie for 1 in 10 (10 is the best, 1 is the worst). Jumping scenes from the movie to the game was really annoying, so you wonder if they made up for the lost time. I am begging everyone who reads this, so that he CAN NOT SEE. It is not worth the time.
