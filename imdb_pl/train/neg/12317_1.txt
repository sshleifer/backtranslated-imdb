I'm sorry for the fans of this movie, but that's the worst thing I've ever seen. Slow, poorly manned and poorly played is a movie that tries to escape the dead Romanies of recent years and failed! McDonald and Parker seem unable to convey real emotions and are deprived of life. They seem to be in this place for all the wage controls they receive for it, not because they thought it was a good idea. The story is DULL !! I love great movies about chickens, just like the next girl and it's not one !! If you avoid one movie this year ... let it be
