I can enjoy guilty pleasure, flick, but it's just bad. And not bad at how you can enjoy seeing MST3K from it. It's just sickly bad that you can not find anything you could like no matter how hard you try. I really regret wasting 2 hours of precious life on this shit. Looking at this, it can be said that no one was asked to act, and everyone knew that this film would bury their careers. Apparently "Walking Tall" collected enough income that someone decided that he could fight off his investment. If it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, it's so bad that it obscured the worst movies from my memories.
