Acting is good, women are beautiful and men are handsome, so if you're looking for a good soft porn, this movie is for you. Otherwise you are wasting your time. The motivation of the main characters, in particular the title lead, is often a mystery. She could just tell the truth - the truth presented in the film, not necessarily the historical truth - and her lover would be spared in prison for rape, which he did not commit. Did she protect her father who was half gone, how was it when he launched a malicious process? Did she protect herself, and her reputation suddenly began to worry, since so far her art seemed to matter? During the rehearsal, this strong woman turns into mush before our eyes. Conversely, her lover, who begins as a narcissistic moron, becomes a disinterested hero during the trial. At least his motivation is clearer: he sacrifices himself for love. Naturally, because no good deed needs to go unpunished, we were told that she never sees him again.
