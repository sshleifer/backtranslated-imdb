This movie had potential and I wanted to try, but there are so many problems on the timeline that are so obvious - it's hard to swallow being treated like an idiot. <br /> <br /> Rise to Power is set in the late sixties. The way Carlito is set in the middle to the end of the seventies. For this movie to be realistic, it would have to be set in the fifties, if not the late forties. <br /> <br /> Rise to Power has no trace of Gail (Pennelope Ann Miller), without a trace of Kleinfeld, there is no trace of Rolando, with whom Carlito reportedly had to deal with "hey-day". None of the main characters of the original movie was in this film. We should believe that Carlito met all these people in a few years. <br /> <br /> Rise to Power ends when Carlito goes to the beach, talking about retiring in paradise, what he wanted to do in the original movie. In addition, the pre-quel creates the characters Rocco and Earl - what is to happen to them, because they are clearly not in Carlito's Way? It is also difficult to understand how Carlito can have relations with Italy in the original film by watching the events of Rise to Power. Where are the Taglialucci in this film? Between these two films is probably seven years and spends five of them in prison. It's like trying to insert a square plug into a round hole. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that no one was interested in telling a good story and that they were more interested in making money by making an average gangster movie and throwing a character called Carlito Brigante into history. The movie had some good moments, but I think it would be better to leave this movie to stand alone instead of trying to make it a prequel to Dear Carlito. <br /> <br /> If you feel determined to see this movie, the only advice I can give is not to think of the film as a linear pre-quel. Think of it as spaghetti westerns with Clint Eastwood's man without a name, in other words about two films that have the same character, but are not necessarily connected to each other.
