This movie was so bad it was funny. However, I could not resist watching. The plot is standard, the acting quite horrible (the cast staff, such as a naughty neighbor and friend of a lawyer, were better actors). It's funny if you have some time to lose and you like to see a dramatic storyline. <br /> <br /> Headliner, who plays "Kathy" was simply fascinating, because I could not decide if her deadly, flat impact was the result of a bad operation or just bad action (I decided it was both). This leaves the script to comment, which was quite awful. Pat's comments, idiotic decisions and reckless stupidity on the part of every character in the movie. Maybe it was such riveting; I do not know. I just watched him to see how bad it could be. (Actually this dialog box does not even qualify to be called "cliche" - but it's almost completely unreadable.) <br /> <br /> All in all a very bad, cheap movie. Sets, the same scenes (house, building) were shown over and over without artistry or real connection with the action; more like props that randomly fell into action in a bad game. The chase scene could have been shot by every juvenile in a warehouse or old school: a bad shot, cheap props, minimal action ... and I still wanted to see the ending. Conjecture.
