SCARECROWS seems to be a botched horror encountering a supernatural movie. A bandit group is doing a paramilitary robbery of payroll at Camp Pendleton, California. They blow up a freight plane, capturing the pilot and his daughter with demands to fly to Mexico. Along the way, one greedy robber decides to save money with money landing in a corn field monitored by strange-looking scarecrows. These are not ordinary scarecrows ... that can kill. Acting is no better than a terrible dialogue. And humor tests are not funny. Very low budget and filmed completely in the dark. <br /> <br /> The cast includes: Ted Vernon, Michael David Simms, Kristina Sanborn, B.J. Turner, Phil Zenderland and Victoria Christian.
