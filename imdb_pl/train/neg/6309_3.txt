This movie had good intentions and a good story to work. The director and screenwriter of this movie has failed and created a boring, boring filmstrip that made me feel like I was back in the 8th grade of Hartford's Social Studies - at 67 years old. Waste, could anyone take this story and make a real movie out of it - history deserves it. <br /> <br /> Every time the scene had potential, we only had a few stereotypes combined with black and white footage, which probably got from The History Channel to show the action. Shy. <br /> <br /> Ossie Davis was the only bright light at this blunt festivity. The second game was incredibly boring - it suited the movie and everyone who played the captain set a new low standard for line delivery. <br /> <br /> However, if you are willing to accept all the disadvantages of the movie and do not worry about the fact that we are delighted or entertained, but I want to learn about the USS Masonie, it is worth watching.
