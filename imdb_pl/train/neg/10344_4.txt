I saw this movie in a few hours on TCM. From what I saw, there were a few problems with the movie. First of all, adults did not age when the children did for 10 years. Several parts of the movie had problems with continuity and for some reason the actor who played the youngest son looked the oldest when 10 years passed. <br /> <br /> The copy I saw was missing about 20 minutes, at least there was a huge gap with a black screen. It's a shame, because although the script left something to be desired, Bergman and Russell did a good job in the film in their roles. It is a pity that a large piece is missing, but what is here is to watch. <br /> <br /> I want everything to be intact. The script does not make much sense, because Bergman's character is sent back when the children are small and then brought back to take care of them when they are grown up? Some time lines also do not make sense. There is a stock market crash that resembles 1929, but children grow up to fight in the First World War. I wonder what was in the 20-slot film that I could not see because it was missing.
