I watched 3 episodes of Caveman and I have no idea why I'm continuing, unless I'm waiting for improvement. <br /> <br /> For me, this series simply pumps out ads without real humor. When we sat at the concerts, we all speculated about what was going to happen. <br /> <br /> The episode of a woman-cave woman with an attitude was big for us, yes. is primitive in the theater and works hard on strangers, and to tell the truth she needed a spanking <br /> <br /> I consider myself quite a pretty reviewer, taking everything, but I must say that Cavemen is comparable to an old show, My mother, a car . I give him 2, just because they deserve 1 better than 1, because they actually spent money on it.
