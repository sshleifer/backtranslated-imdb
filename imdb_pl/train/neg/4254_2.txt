I can not believe that the same guy directed this shit and Dracula 2000. Dracula 2000 was innovative, fresh and well written if it worked badly. <br /> <br /> This stack can not even claim it. It starts with Dracula's defeat at the end of Dracula 2000. Then he ignores the story that later describes what happened. Actually following the narrative could somehow make it a good sequel, but Craven chose the style of his older movies without having a good tie, but the name of the main villain. <br /> <br /> Even an actor playing Dracula differently (going from dark hair in Dracula 2000 to blondes here). <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie if you have any respect for your taste in movies.
