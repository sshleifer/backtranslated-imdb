This program is unbelievable in this. . . what he represents and what he focuses on. . . words can not describe how crazy ET is. They will report everything. If the celebrity is even remotely connected indirectly to the story, ET will report it. If the dog buys in Tom Cruise's yard, they will inform about it. If a celebrity dies. . . they will talk about it for many weeks, until the audience envies this celebrity. If the celebrity is tried. . . ET will report it at the end of the month. There is no end to what this program will report, nor a time frame that determines how long it will focus on history. Is this even considered legitimizing the application? Reports are also so annoying, with sharp, chaotic voices and end up with an unnecessary pause to convey a sense of importance. I can not watch this program without questioning the existence of mankind. ET is one of the main reasons why I avoid concerts before evening. I regret that IMDb can allow the rating of a minimum of one star, not zero or even negatives. This exhibition deserve -10 stars.
