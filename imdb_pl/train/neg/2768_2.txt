This movie was terrible. <br /> <br /> They did not develop any of the characters at all, and the plot was terrifying. It was definitely sleepy. You would expect the action scenes in this movie to be its strengths, but D-Wars will surprise you with even a cry in this section. <br /> <br /> Also acting was just a step away from the low budget level. And I mean it seriously. <br /> <br /> I was really happy to see the final credits on this page because it was so bad !!! Please, whatever you do, do not waste time and money on a bad movie like D-Wars.
