I tried to watch this movie twice and even quickly pass irritating parts, but I still could not get to the end. <br /> <br /> I do not understand how this movie really got good reviews. I think that those people who give such good reviews are just trying to make a movie for marketing purposes. Their reviews seem very unrealistic and look like inner work, which makes things more pathetic. Videos should get real positive comments about their own pair, not invented !! <br /> <br /> The actress resembled a cheap porn movie, not in a fun way. I do not mind low-budget movies with bad acting if they know how to work with it. <br /> <br /> I think that the main character is irritating. His mimicry and humor were unbearably childish. I thought it was intended that the conspiracy of the women would seem more pleasant and funded, but they were even worse. <br /> <br /> The script was also very awkward (his bosses were exaggerating with a business speech) and distasteful sarcastic remarks. <br /> <br /> I have not found anything that could be useful in this movie, except for some attractive women. <br /> <br /> I never felt that the assessment is so misleading. I was interested in setting up, but everything else scared me. Of course, look, if you want, but I just did not want anyone else to lay their hopes / waste time. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's just me ... Probably not.
