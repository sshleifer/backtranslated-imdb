and it does not help Rohoter's case that Syberberg appeared a few years later and did amazingly great work on the same subject (with little help from Wagner). <br /> <br /> maybe this movie did not look so bad when it appeared, no comparison of the movie syberberg, which was probably filmed on an even smaller sound stage with fewer resources. At the moment I can not remember if there are horses in the siberberg movie. I only know that the German version is pure magic, while this one looks like a certain production from a college documented on a film for archival purposes. <br /> <br /> music ... la musique ... is not even written here on IMDb ... but somebody based it on 'airs from XIV-XIV century' or something ... well, it's not great help for the movie. Comes as inauthentic and bad, comme le frommage mon cher !!! <br /> <br /> Rohmer is one of those French authors who like his leading people, also quite unattractive, and that does not help. Siberberg's parsifal was charming and you can watch it on German television today for sale some special bike, which he invented .... <br /> <br /> I start to think that watching a video on a video is similar ... I remember when the last time I saw a movie in the theater, the printout was so bad that the experience was an amazing five-hour parody, but even then it would have to exceed what that version has to offer, I'm afraid. <br /> <br /> points for seriousness, for chutzpah, but ... this movie just needed more money. it does not look like a medieval manuscript, it looks CHEAPO! BON MARCHE !! Oh and yes, it just ends very arbitrarily when Parsifal goes to church and this tacky passion is thrown in ... blah!
