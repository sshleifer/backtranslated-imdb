You've never seen any movies and you still know The Jerk Too is a disaster. The question is not how it happened, because if you throw money at someone and tell them to make a movie, they'll do it. <br /> <br /> No. The question is, "Why, oh, why did Steve Martin permit this?" I think he needed money to fight the cumbersome court proceedings and was determined that it did not cost him anything. He knew that the sequel would be so terrible that he would not even be proud of income tax. <br /> <br /> The only way the sequel can not be embarrassing is that Carl Gottlieb and Steve Martin will revive the favorite, poor, black family of the nation. <br /> <br /> And "dcreasy2001" (aka Mark Blankfield?): It's just obvious that you've worked on this film in a sad release, and the only way to feel better about your involvement is to be lonely cheerleader as a comment by IMDb. I prayed that you would switch to satire, but unfortunately, you really tried. Why not 10 stars?
