I often comment on the total horror of really scary movies on the market, and unfortunately White Noise has limited my belief that the film industry is capable of such a venture. I was surprised when I was getting tired more and more when the plot was growing and my headache caused by the electrostatic charge increased. I think White Noise is ridiculous, except our best attempts to suspend disbelief. Even after he had witnessed the shocking gehenna Michael Keaton, his death had no effect on me. Until credit, which I was urgently waiting for something - anything - substance to connect me with the story of heroes, but such a relief never came. Sure, there were occasional moments in which the heart was spinning, but only because loud sounds make it to the sight of the slumbering viewer. <br /> <br /> While acting was poor, Michael Keaton could play his role. Perhaps the only advantage White Noise has to offer is the stunning archiektktura at both Keaton's headquarters. In general, White Noise leaves the morbidly depressing idea that those who die are trapped in a world guarded by three malicious shadows, trying to deceive the living, to follow the dead to their graves.
