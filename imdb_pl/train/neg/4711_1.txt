I really hate this show! I watched one episode and knew that this series was really awful. The plot lines are both sparsely written and made, and the jokes are really bad ... that is, it's just a rip off Dexter from Dexter's Laboratory and Johnny Quest, an unbearable boy with blond hair burning with his twin, brilliant sisters and talking dog; Dad at home and a clever, very busy mother ... Like the god oh-my-flippin'-! Their dad is a crazy family member of his mother and family, he is not so gay! If my father was a host, I would personally die! It is a pity that ... I really would like to. <br /> <br /> I have nothing more to say ... this parody, but only three words; count 3 words to describe it: <br /> <br /> · Lame, · Stupid, and above all ... · F ** K UP! All I could say is definitely my list of the worst animated EV-ER series! If I had one that is.
