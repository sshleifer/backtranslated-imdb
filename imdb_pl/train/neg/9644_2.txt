First thing first. In this genre film, the first thing you need is good music, and where Mr. Shankar and his team fail. <br /> <br /> the music is completely pale and ineffective. On the other hand, there is AJAY DEVGAN, WHO HAS DELIVERED LETTER "A" from his spelling, did a good job, but was not useful for poorly filled movies like this one. <br /> <br /> ASIN is like a doll that is used to play with the audience, although it is good to look at it, but its role in the movie is dancing, actually it is a member of a rock band and I do not think any rock band had there the dancer as a member of the band. <br /> <br /> in the walnut shell this movie is a piece of nonsense. look, if you want to fool yourself.
