The satirical show of Monika Mitchell has some laughter and thoughtful violence. I would not say steeped in blood; but there is an insult and hurt. Max Matteo (John Cassini) is an actor who has a bizarre, adaptable presence on the screen, but he has terrible achievements because he is chosen for the parts on which he goes. There is always a nephew of the producer or a seemingly trivial reason why he has not been given the role he is looking for. The best thing to do is to get rid of the competition ... Max obsessed with such thoughts. An award-winning career is just a swing, a push and a departure. Other cast members: Rene Rivera, Molly Parker, Jennifer Beals, Frank Cassini and episodes of Eric Roberts and Sandra Oh. Well, it's a show business ... is it?
