When I first watched the program, the first few episodes seemed promising. Bill Compton introduced himself as a stereotypical "mysterious" vampire, and Sookie introduced herself as an independent woman. However, the performance has fallen from this place, and once interesting characters are as much fun as a cardboard box. <br /> <br /> As the story progresses, heroes lose their original personality as well as their acting abilities. In episode 5, Bill's wrinkled eyebrows are so low that his face is made of forehead. Sookie, or rather an actress, is even more dead than her vampire lover. All these tragic events surround her, and she only reacts to how pleasant it was to lose her virginity. Personally, I think they made the main characters sleep too early in the show. The way they were teasing was something that made me hook up and could easily play a little more. As soon as Sookie loses him, he diverges like a total ditz, thinking only about Bill's libido and the size of his supplement. Bill also loses his attitude and well, he just becomes stupid. His actions are never really explained, except that he does it for Sookie. Why? Their mutual love is never buried if there is any love. So far, it seems that sex is the core of their relationship. <br /> <br /> Yes, yes, vampires usually equate to sex, but continue. Every five seconds I see a kind of noise. This was not much of a surprise, because HBO is always trying to give soft porn as a decent television program. Bill jumped out of the dirt and just did it with Sookie for no reason, what is it? I laughed so much that I almost peed. <br /> <br /> The plot is just a stream of consciousness. Characters never enter the details of anything. All events that happen usually remain unexplained. The only constant thing is sex. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can say that I like are smaller characters. Tara and her drunk mother are much more interesting than the main characters. The only reason I continue to watch this program is to develop smaller characters. <br /> <br /> The negative sex and main characters of the show would be much more profitable.
