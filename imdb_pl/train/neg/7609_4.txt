Being a big fan of Corman's horrors, I expected a bit more than I did in the west. Well, I had fun. I had almost as much laughter as watching the brooks of Mel Brooks. <br /> <br /> See the track show on tires on the old West's prairie. You can kill time by counting them, if it happens that a boring scene happens. Horses are also racing, taking into account fast chases. See also swinging bar queens from a traditional wild saloon to the west, which remind you of some fashionable dance from the 1920s, here decades before the invention of style. I hope that the salon around them will not rot. <br /> <br /> In the middle of this chaos, the main actors do a decent job. Ireland, Garland and Hayes are really fine. Special praise for them for doing their best, with material that seems to be mostly removed from "Johnny Guitar", but it does not do the same. But there really is nothing wrong with such a funny western. Like a really bad old horror, it can go one way, but it still gives joy. This is one of the reasons why Corman's work appeals to me and that's why I dare recommend you to experience this movie if you have a chance.
