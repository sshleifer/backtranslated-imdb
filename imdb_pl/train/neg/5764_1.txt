Scary Movie 3 is so smelly that it is difficult to express it in words. This makes movies like Malibu Most Wanted look like Oscar material, let's just say it. <br /> <br /> The original Scary Movie was great fun, one of the best films faked in the 90s, coming from a great band that previously rocked our world with Dont Be A Menace to South Central while drinking your juice in the hood. But what the hell happened ?! After the tragedy of Scary Movie 2, I thought that changing the cast and crew would help, but it's even worse. <br /> <br /> I smiled twice in 20 minutes. Not one laugh, the jokes were recycled, and the originality was of course irrelevant. The fact that at the moment most people on this site voted in writing that 10/10 means that I feel physically ill. When great movies like the School of Rock appear, which have jokes * funny *, everyone wasting their money on such tripe needs their heads. <br /> <br /> missing stars / ****
