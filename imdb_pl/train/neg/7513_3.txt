What can I say? I think I have to write "Spoiler alert" and then "reveal" that they used the word F LOT in this film - as in two sentences. I did not like this movie at all - too many tips on sexual perversions, mistakes and scams. And this curse completely disappeared from the window. I gave this film "3", and two of them refer to Mira Sorvino's sexy moves on the dance floor.
