This is just the answer for yahoo, who says that this movie is more realistic than the classic one defining MASTERPIECE, Jaws. It is known that yes, brain, great white (and other species of sharks, bulls, black tips, oceanic whiteheads, tigers) populate areas where you can find easy prey. People often do not get to this menu, they admit, but the shark in the film has been repeatedly indicated as showing abnormal behavior. It's not like it never happened. The chances of a whale destroying almost the entire city, distinguishing a human nemesis, sinking several dozen thick North Atlantic boats and getting to know when some people, all friends of the said "nemesis", are close enough to reach the water, are so slim that they are funny. Like this turd discard Jaw. Funny. The big white sharks are also known for their often chewing boats, protective underwater cages and people on rafts and surfboards because they look like seals from below. A Bruce-sized shark (if you do not know, look up) would be more than capable of sinking a boat like The Orca (hey, that's the name of the gross rip-off we're talking about!), How he would weigh over 6000 pounds. I can go on, but I do not have to. Jaws is amazing (better acting, better effects, better music, better writing), Orca is nonsense (BLATANT rip-off JAWS, bad writing, disgusting effects, the most absurd plot of this page by Olson Twins). It does not require masters from Columbia University. Watch better movies.
