I'm VERY big fan of Jenny Jameson, but this movie is awful. At the time, Jenna Jameson was Brad Armstrong's wife and director of the movie, and Jenna was the hottest porn star ever. So, of course, Brad tried to make as much money as he could, doing this big budget porn movie. Now I know why they are not already making big budget porn videos. In the fantasy world porn stars can work, but this is a real world and can not work. That's why porn stars, if a woman as beautiful as Jenna, could act, then she would try to enter the mainstream movies instead of pornography. Just because your beautiful does not make you a movie star. A good example of this is Traci Lords, when she was a teenager at the age of twenty, she was one of the most beautiful sexy women on earth. She forced her to switch to low-budget mainstream movies and could not work. Where is she now? I gave him a grade of 2 instead of 1 just because Jenna is so hot, but there are better movies that she later made "Dream Quest". Come on, Jenna, we do not want to hear you talking, just the way we want you to have sex. Besides, you Jenna, you would have a lot more fans and more money on your bank account if you did an anal video.
