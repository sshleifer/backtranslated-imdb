Oh, wow, what a damn movie! ... I said that I want to become a specialist in bad movies from all decades, so I decided to start with this. It was quite the right choice. I started this adventure to find lost gems and incomprehensible masterpieces, but I did not see anything in this pastel color. I really have not watched so many bad movies before, but I get the feeling that what's called "bad, that's good", probably because it's so fucking funny! First of all, there are inaccuracies. There are inaccuracies associated with plots, physical inaccuracies, as well as psychological inaccuracies. Especially the latter are as crazy as Van Damme's cheeks in this blue spandex. There are also very shoddy lines and I will not even start talking about some funny moves. There is absolutely no bad behavior from everyone involved in this hot movie mess except for one particular case. Geoffrey Lewis looks completely miserable like Frank, who is a completely stupid hero. And, to be honest, I was very surprised to see that Van Damme did a decent job playing on twins. He managed to achieve a different tone and mood in two roles, which were convincing for me. But the film was mostly very bad, and its sad part is that it was produced by a large film studio ... which is now bankrupt.
