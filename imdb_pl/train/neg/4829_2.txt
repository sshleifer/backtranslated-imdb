As an ordinary movie observer, I can not say that I liked watching it. He is not too emotional for the drama, he is not too catchy for the thriller, he is not too fast for the action. In addition, some moments of the film are unreliable. OK, I understand, soldiers are losing consciousness, but it's hard to believe that someone would risk their life by entering the middle of a hostile city, and after the wife's professor's scream, he escaped, without asking (in the right way). It would seem that it would be very romantic if it was an animation, but it would be a SERIOUS movie about war. There are several such episodes, so the whole picture gives the impression that it is only a crude preview of the film, and requires considerable work. <br /> <br /> It seems that the creators of the film wanted to create an image of a brave emotional soldier, but all these "curves" of his psychology seem simply unnatural. <br /> <br /> This photo left a question in my head: WHY? Why did they give him an Oscar? Why SIX? And IMHO is the most exciting part of the movie :)
