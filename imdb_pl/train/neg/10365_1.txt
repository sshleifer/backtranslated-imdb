Horrible. This thriller should be buried. What a badziewie. A terrible letter, the characters are less than credible. Horrible Schlock !! Put some B stars in a terribly written POS to try and give them some credit, but he can not. If I did not have to write ten poems about this movie, I would give him the word word review, starting with "sh" and ending with "it". <br /> <br /> Horrible ending, delayed. Who writes this shit. The end of this movie is so fancy, weak, as if they had no idea what to do with this story, or just ran out of money. Most likely due to the number of scenes in this movie. It's good that these actors are on the right track, because it would be a career killer. It's good that hardly anyone will see it. At least no one is important as future investors. It may have ended in a thousand different ways, but it is, I feel cheated out of my precious time. <br /> <br /> Do not bother, you'll feel like you're wasting your time that you'll never get back.
