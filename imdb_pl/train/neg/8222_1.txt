Um ... Okay, I think I have a whole shaky technique of filming in the style of a gorilla, but unfortunately I think that the gorilla could have made a better movie ... This thing was just a complete mess. Bad acting, bad direction, bad story and scary photos. When this piece of garbage was released, I will never know, but unfortunately I watched it. Filmed on the spot in Tennessee by the director's team Greg Swison and Ryan Thiessen (Harry and Lloyd), "Five Across The Eyes" I assume it is like a Blair Witch movie, but not ... Nose dives from a cliff. I was ashamed of these young women who, I'm sure, had been promised Hollywood stardom, but it ended up with a pile of dung. The dialog box is funny and actually makes you worse when you listen to it. How it's supposed to be a horror story is another mystery, because there's nothing terrible about it, except for the fact that I watched it ... Try it out: 5 of you and 1 of it, do the math and beat it butt ... "End". Unfortunately, it lasted (and lasted) for another 95 minutes of paralyzing stupidity ... <br /> <br /> I saw it for free and I wanted to get my money back.
