This film is a chilling reminder of Bollywood as a Hollywood parasite. Bollywood also tends to feed on hits that have contributed to the development of its industry. <br /> <br /> Vidhu Vinod Chopra made the film with the idea that the cocktail "Deewar" and "On the Waterfront" will bring to the house of Oscar. It turned out to be a debut mistake. <br /> <br /> Even the idea for the title is inspired by the classic Elii Kazan. In the original, Brando is shown as a dove as a symbol of peace. <br /> <br /> Bollywood has to move out of the shadow of Hollywood if you have to take it seriously.
