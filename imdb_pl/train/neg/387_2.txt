You have to think about whether there was a <br /> <br /> script at any time during the production of this movie, which would make sense. Did a rough cut last for 3 hours <br /> <br /> long and was it included in the inconsistent mess that survived? <br /> <br /> Why would anyone finance this mess? I will say that Tom <br /> <br /> Wlaschiha is a handsome young man and does what he can <br /> <br /> with dialogical and dramatic situations (?) Which he was given. Ale <br /> <br /> characters come and go for no apparent reason, continuity is <br /> <br /> nonexistent, and acting, pictures and direction are (to <br /> <br /> put it politely) amateur. Not One Sleeps is an unfortunate <br /> <br /> choice of a title that will probably turn out to be untrue if anyone <br /> <br /> actually tried to watch this movie.
