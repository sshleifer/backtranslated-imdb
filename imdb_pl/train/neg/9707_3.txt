It was not what I wanted to see. I bought it on DVD and found an annoyance under the movie and turned the movie off for a moment. <br /> <br /> Here's what I did not like: <br /> <br /> 1 They shot their father <br /> <br /> 2 The tribes were really annoying <br /> <br /> 3 dinosaurs (mainly) looked fake. <br /> <br /> 4 Bad scientist was well irritating <br /> <br /> 5 The image quality on a DVD was very bad <br /> <br /> What could I do: <br /> <br /> 1 Music of Jerry Goldsmith. This music is really great. I have a bootleg soundtrack from this movie. Unfortunately, the sound quality is not good, but it is good for its time. <br /> <br /> 2 The first time we see dinosaurs, they inspire a kind of delight. <br /> <br /> 3 The child is a little cute when he's in the water and he's playing. <br /> <br /> 4 This funny scene with a tent. <br /> <br /> 5 Children who see this movie could hope that evil always loses.
