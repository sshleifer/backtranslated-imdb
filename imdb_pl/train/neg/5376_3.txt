THE CHOKE (aka AX in Great Britain) is a slasher supposedly produced as a movie straight on DVD. I say "apparently" because the movie title does not have a "V" in parentheses to indicate that it was a movie made for a DVD (even if it has the appearance of one). <br /> <br /> The plot is simple? the band organizes a concert in a former meat packaging factory and dies one by one. <br /> <br /> I think most will agree that the movie will never be a masterpiece, but that does not justify the flaws here. Even movies directly on DVD, such as BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE (which has a very low IMDb rating), have many advantages and are sometimes one of the so-called "bad, good" movies. However, THE CHOKE is neither a serious slasher (such as HALLOWEEN), nor a movie "so bad that it's good" (such as THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE). <br /> <br /> The movie begins well with the figure killed with a drill. The blood effects were very cheesy, but understandable, given the very low budget. But from there it's all the way down the hill. <br /> <br /> There are so many mistakes in CHOKE that I can spend all day talking about them. But a few obvious stand out and go to them. <br /> <br /> The previously mentioned concert of the band seems to start from about 50 people, but after stopping the music, it seems that only about 8 people remain (and yet they are all to be closed!). <br /> <br /> Characters from this movie are not nice at all. Most band members are aggressive, disgusting morons or just weird. Nobody really cares about what's happening to them, and even their supposed friends forget about them when they were sent. The culmination of the film is the presence of a homeless man who seems to treat the meatpacking factory as some kind of church (seriously!). It throws out some really funny lines for no apparent reason. Unfortunately, even his presence can not save the film. <br /> <br /> There are too many scenes in which people walk and talk without any characteristics. About 65 minutes of the film is spent watching the characters during the conversation. Characters disappear for a long time without explanation. As with other straight-to-DVD movies, such as CROCODILE and GRIM WEEKEND, the characters spend a lot of time cursing aggressively, without any provocation. There are many over-the-top explosions (mainly from male characters), and one almost leads to full combat. In fact, you can say that the format looks like this: characters walk - murder takes place - characters walk - murder takes place. You have an idea. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is awful and it seems that several lines are spoken without the use of a f-word. It may have been fun, but it's just sad. What's more, we've all seen it a thousand times (usually a much bigger effect). <br /> <br /> The movie is completely free of tension. Dead bodies serve as the only indication that the heroes are in danger. The maniac runs loosely, and the characters behave like a moron. They do not try to get out of the factory or find a weapon that would protect them. And most of the time, they do not even pretend to be scared. <br /> <br /> In the same spirit as DRIVE-IN MASSACRE, an assassin is not seen at the moment of committing murders (using an exception to the final murder when the identity of the killer is revealed). A random weapon appears out of nowhere to kill the victim in question. At no time does anyone have to follow the characters. In DRIVE-IN MASSACRE it made the movie fun (of course unintentionally), but it's not funny at all here. <br /> <br /> And, as another reviewer has noted, the soundtrack contains music that is very bad, even for those who like punk rock. Add-ons look awkwardly dancing to him. Sheet music (at the end there is no music at the beginning!) It consists of a band sponsored Sugarbabe singing a very bad song that has no relation to the film. <br /> <br /> Do not get wrong points made in this review. This reviewer likes bad movies (such as THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE and BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE) as well as classics (such as HALLOWEEN and Friday THE 13TH). But it seems that THE CHOKE tried too hard to fit into one of these categories, not matching any of them. And even for movies straight to DVD, this is a poor effort. <br /> <br /> From a positive point of view, the movie contains some fairly good murder scenes. But when the survivors do not take the situation seriously, these scenes quickly lose their importance because the intensity they provide disappears in oblivion. <br /> <br /> Fans of traditional 80's movie braids should take steps to make this movie. And fans of classics such as HALLOWEEN and Friday the 13th should do everything in their power to avoid it!
