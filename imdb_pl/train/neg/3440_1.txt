I never watch this movie ... it's the biggest pile of sh * ones I've ever seen in my life. and it says something. acting, plot and filming were absolutely tragic, this is the WORST FILM IN THE WORLD !!! seriously, does not it even give you a hit, because it cost me 99 pence from sainsburys and was produced only in 2005? hahaha this movie is like a cheap college movie that you can even see in the corner of the screen ... although if you really want to watch it, you have to watch the "scary scene of the shark" ... probably the best piece of acting I've seen in my life ... ha ha. I mean, seriously this is the biggest loss 2 1/2 hours EVER !!
