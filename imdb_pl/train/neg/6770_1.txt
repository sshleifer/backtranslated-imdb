I went to see this movie with my 17-year history. daughter. I insisted that we go to shows, not because I'm tense, but just felt that I have. In the spirit of NASCAR, it is a dream of a sponsera. So much glaring advertising that it almost qualifies as an advertisement if it were not for so-called acting. Continuing the tradition, franchise Herbie continues his series of fictional stories, and the car is just a "vehicle" (without words) intended for this corn film. Earlier Herbie installments (though also tacky ones) were produced in more serious times, which makes them somewhat easier to digest. Mrs. Lohan, the queen of Disney's drama, has little acting abilities. I was surprised that Mr. Keaton and Mr. Dillon would get involved in such a project. Only the snack bar was a bigger rip off!
