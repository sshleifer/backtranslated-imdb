I wanted so much to see this one of my favorite TV shows. I saw a universal trademark along with a newly renowned title and theme song that still make an impression on me. a spaceship approaching a funfair, and even more magnificent and fantastic. Shortly after that to the end ... I could not believe my eyes !!!! How lucky I was to forget everything I saw. Tiffany's songs and her thematic song in the new arrangement were in my head. In any case, I would like to see this old-fashioned family (also The Flintstones and Yogi Bear) in all graphic projects as Toy story or Bug's life. Hanna-Barbera is in my opinion.
