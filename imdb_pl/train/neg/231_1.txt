It starts badly, what about the three women who behave like chants of junior high school students sitting around chuckling with gin, endless cigarettes and caramel chocolate for the one who tells the best story of the "man" and then it gets worse - - spoiler alert = - = what with the character of Andie falling on the young organ player who was her student when he was 14 (she is the headmaster of an English school, believe it or not), only to destroy him thanks to her bitch - from "girl" hell. ... and then from there, it's basically unseemly: she forgives her "friend" and has a love child of the organ player and 3 women who finished when they started drinking more gin and smoking more cigars blah blah. Andie throws chocolate caramels into the street in a pitiful attempt to symbolize growth. Have mercy.
