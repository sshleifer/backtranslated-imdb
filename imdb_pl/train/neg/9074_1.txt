Another venture in the world of comedy-teenagers, taking place on the university campus, where the nerd is seeking to cool and how he decides to blackmail three of the popular jockeys to get him to win the girl. All this was done before and everything was done in a much more satisfying way. Disgusting humor that made teens like "American Pie" and "Dude!" The film is badly written, and the actors never manage to make any of them even slightly bearable. I will not even humiliate this horrible image, revealing it because it is a waste of my time and yours. At best, Slackers can never play or laugh, and at worst - terribly bad, and sometimes they can not be watched at all. <br /> <br /> Jason Schwarzman, who impressed on his Rushmore debut, humiliates himself by appearing in this picture and wonders how a career can end up so quickly in the toilet. Please avoid, please avoid. Save money.
