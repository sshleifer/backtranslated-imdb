I saw this last time and I have to say that the real basis of this story moved me. However, "Holly" as a movie did not really work. I am looking forward to watching a documentary, which was prepared by the producers who organized this project, because I think it would be a much more convincing work than this film. <br /> <br /> The international cast consisted of B class actors, but their acting was right and I have to mention the young actress who played Holly. It was her first role in the film and she did a very good job, considering that this is the most demanding part. <br /> <br /> Ron Livingston was just right, but bland like Patrick, an American whose job is to "save" Holly, but Chris Penn was good at it, his last role. Unfortunately, despite my most favorable opinion Virginie Ledoyen and Udo Kier, both of these actors were very much forgotten and did not do their best job in this film. <br /> <br /> I believe in the message and intention of the film, but I have to be honest, so I rate the 3 stars "Holly" based on her disadvantages as a film. But I think the subject deserves serious consideration and I am glad that the people who created this film also made a documentary that I hope will debut on the BBC and other television networks.
