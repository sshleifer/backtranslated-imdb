I will keep it short because I know I do not have to say a lot. <br /> <br /> "Alive" is a strange little movie that apparently appeals to some, but I found it shockingly insipid at almost the beginning. The film did little to make a character sympathetic, and the story was sometimes so complicated that I completely lost interest. As I said, I know that others liked it, but I think that "Alive" Kitamura is something other than - a lame, incredibly boring drama disguised as a science-fiction movie inspiring to think. I felt like I was drawn into watching this movie, based on his intriguing premise and the exciting cover. <br /> <br /> My suggestion? Give it a much more enjoyable first-class Kitamura "Versus" or its 2004 riots "Godzilla: Final Wars". <br /> <br /> ... And do not get me wrong, I'm always ready for a movie of good thinking, but it was definitely not. There was no time when I would care for one event in this overly-preaching, heavy dialogue. <br /> <br /> If you want to talk about something ... talk about boring.
