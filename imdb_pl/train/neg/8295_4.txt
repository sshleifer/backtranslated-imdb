I like character movies. I also think that Hope Davis is always in a good job, so I had high hopes for this film. These hopes are quickly over. <br /> <br /> The main disadvantage of this movie is the direction. There are many scenes that are dream sequences. The film often uses the character of Denis Leary as an alter ego of the figure of Campbell Scott. It does not work at all. It would work better as a game than a movie. <br /> <br /> There are also problems with the story. It is important that the film's heroes go on a journey and find themselves in a place other than the one where they began. I did not feel that the characters evolved in the experiments presented in the film. <br /> <br /> Finally, the editing was not well done either. In the middle of the film there was a very large deviation, which was extremely boring. <br /> <br /> With the exception of acting, which I thought was consistently strong, this film failed in almost every aspect of cinema.
