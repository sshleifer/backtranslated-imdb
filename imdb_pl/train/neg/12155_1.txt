If this movie was written and produced with the intention of creating a bad classic of the iconic movie, maybe (let's say it can) be a hit. Have you ever sat and watched a movie that was so awful that it became fascinating in terms of mistakes? Well, that's it. Each of the actors should be nominated for the worst actor's awards. It would be difficult to find another movie, with a production budget that would contain so little of any value. The whole thing, from the initial scenes, defies logic. The dialogue is completely unbelievable and illogical. The same applies to the behavior and general plot of the film itself. What really surprises is the fact that some buffoons in the conference room actually decided to spend money on this piece of rubbish. Wow.
