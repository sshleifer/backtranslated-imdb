Generally a very disappointing picture. Very, very slow expansion to the basic story. The role of Maria Schrader in search of mysterious families. (Every shot seems to last forever. The movie really has no rhythm.) *** SPOILERS *** Her mother Ruth is saved from the Nazis by a German played by Katja Riemann. The whole character of Ruth is so one-dimensional, so stereotypical. *** SPOILERS END *** The movie revolves back and forth between today's New York and Berlin and Berlin 40. Something. Please, when you do, give the audience an indication of exactly what time this story is taking place. There is never a clear indication of time? very annoying. The worst part is the end. *** SPOILERS *** The whole show and talk about the fact that Jews are so terribly tormented, simply by a bureaucratic accident! Give me a break. In this way, the Jews got off from Rosenstrasse? The question of who freed Jews is NEVER responding. Did Goebels release them? Did Lean Fischer sleep with Goebels? In Venice, the film won an acting award for K. Riemann, why? ?? I have no idea. This must be a Jewish theme?
