Let me start by saying that I'm not a fan of John Ford. (I watched The Informer just because I'm trying to get through the "big" list.) So if you are, just keep going, because you will not agree with me. /> <br /> What a disgusting and outdated piece of stupidity! I will say that there is a good idea for the film (he forced me to think about how few films about the Irish Revolution are), but as usual, Ford is determined to bury him under the influence of excessive acting and cheap sentiment. I guess watching for some time is a bit interesting to see less than a hassle-free transition that has been made from silent to "talkative" - ​​the styles of action of some directors have this endemic feature that are too early movies and movies have the impression that they are playing better with title cards rather than spoken dialogues. (Of course, title cards would prevent Ford from repeating each segment of the emotion six times.) What dialogue is there usually has "They are always behind me Lucky Charms!" The quality is exacerbated by the fact that every actor seems to have been allowed to use their own personal version of the Irish accent . Of course, as bad as they are, the accents are helpful in reminding us that we are in Ireland, because the sets look as if they were drawn from some German expressionism, which is filmed on the next sound stage. (Feels like you can see some of the villagers who watch the Frankenstein in the background.) <br /> <br /> Techniques are changing. The flavors change. So I will not say how crazy it seems that this movie was so valued at that time. But this is not one of the classics who stick - just "just warning" about the simplification of malarkey, which Ford intends to devote to his career.
