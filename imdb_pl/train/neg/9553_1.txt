No wonder it was released directly on DVD here in Australia, without a buy-back function. The dialogue was hokey, acting, horrible and the script was sucked !! Whoever thought it was a good idea to make a sequel or follow a much better movie from John Badham, Wargames from the 1980s, had to be on something because it was a bad idea !! Amanda Walsh was good at it, like candy interest / eye love, while Matt Lanter was good as the second main character - that's it. I do not recommend Wargames to anyone: The Dead Code, check Hackers or the original Wargames movie - both are better than this piece of nonsense !!
