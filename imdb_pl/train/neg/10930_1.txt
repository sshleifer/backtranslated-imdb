This movie is a total dog. It turned out that I was trying to find something that I could laugh at, so I would not feel like I was completely wasting my money - and my time. Writing in this movie is absolutely horrible. It is a pity that it does not match the standards of other Hale Storm movies. <br /> <br /> They should have saved money on capturing D-list actors such as Fred Willard and Gary Coleman, and spent money working on the script until he was right. Even Gary Coleman was not properly used for his role. <br /> <br /> This movie lets you think about the meaning of most of the story - including storylines. After watching this film, I have the impression that the producers hoped to capture a kind of humor similar to Napoleon's dynamite, where it is not about lines, but about character and delivery. Unfortunately, this movie does not provide a line, character, delivery or humor. I should have gone to the dentist!
