This is the last time I have borrowed videos without checking IMDB reviews. The Limey is directed by Steven Soderbergh, who also wrote a really awful Nightwatch with Ewan Macgregor and directed such garbage as Out of Sight with the anti-talented Jennifer Lopez. Terence Stamp is a great actor and it's a pity that he got involved in such a bad movie. It often happens that getting confused seemed to be a last-minute decision to make up for the lack or history, filming and common sense. This movie does everything wrong. What were they thinking?
