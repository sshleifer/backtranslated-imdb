There is a planet called Ceta in a distant galaxy. The natives love cats. But dog people are waging war with these feline loving people and have no choice but to go to Earth and crush people for food. This is one of the stupidest ideas f # @ k! Ng for the movie I saw. Leave it to Ted Mikels to make the film more incompetent than the one that previously had a low standard. It's like playing in a Limbo celluloid game. How low can he go? The only losers in the scenario are American viewers. Mr. Mikels and his stupid little mustache are actually people who are still buying this nonsense. <br /> <br /> My degree: F <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Ted Mikels' commentary; history behind creation (9 and a half minutes); 17 minutes, 15 seconds of behind-the-scenes material; Filmography by Ted Mikels; and trailers for "The Worm Eaters" "Girl in Gold Boots", "The Doll Squad", "Ten Violent Women" (with nudity), "Blood Orgy of the She Devils" and "the Corpse Grinders"
