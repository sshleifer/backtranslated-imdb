It was really hard for me to go through this move. It was very slow and sometimes wondered when the plot of the film would really come alive. <br /> <br /> This movie seemed to flow slowly and I wondered when it would end. I'm usually a person who likes a good indie file from time to time, but that did not satisfy what I was looking for. <br /> <br /> It looked like they were trying to do a lot of this movie. At one point, it seemed to change into a policy that I do not like in movies. If you're looking for a slow motion video with a small or zero graph, this is the right movie for you. As for me, I felt that I had wasted 2 hours when I could do something else.
