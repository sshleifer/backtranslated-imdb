If this movie was a comedy, I would give him 10. O my God, where to start? Put it this way - I've seen a lot of horrible horrors, but this one makes Troll 2 look like crazy Saving Private Ryan. It's as if a group of porn filmmakers decided to make a horror movie, changed their minds in the middle of production and decided to do a comedy, then returned to the horror, and then decided that they should just get stuck with porn (softcore). Everything in this movie is just awful: musical score (someone turns a guy who invented the Yamaha keyboard), script, direction, photography, acting. There are simply no words to describe it. Oh wait, yes, there are: Holy $ *%!.
