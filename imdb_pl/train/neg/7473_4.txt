My husband and I were intrigued by the spectacle - the strong will of a southern woman with a sloppy personal life solves the crime for LAPD. The first season was obligatory for us. Unfortunately, the stories of her personal life in the second season became so boring and unworthy of a strong character that we stopped watching. <br /> <br /> My husband and I were worried by the episode in which Mother tries to hide from her, that she is self-conscious. But the breaker turned out to be an episode in which he hides his possible pregnancy before the boy, but tells her boss. Why does a strong middle-aged woman do such things? The answer is: she would not do it. In addition, my husband and I choose a bad guy with almost perfect accuracy. Almost always a white man or woman appears in an episode at the crime scene or in an idealized family. Can scriptwriters not do something original from time to time? As I mentioned, we are no longer spectators. We prefer shows that do not betray characters and offend our intelligence.
