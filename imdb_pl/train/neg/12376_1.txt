This collection really sucks! <br /> <br /> I rented it, thinking that I would really enjoy myself. Man, it sucks! Fast, brilliant cuts, extremely annoying speaker and fights, which in themselves were heavily edited and shortened (I think especially about the fight of Jet Li in the fist of the legend and Jackie Khan's fight with the drunk master 2). > <br /> And what about these adventurers ?! What's so cool about it? I saw more interesting fights about martial law! <br /> <br /> This is a silly collection of cuts for stupid people. <br /> <br /> Never buy this movie! Do not encourage people who have done nonsense to do more shit! <br /> <br /> Instead, buy the movies they fought for and fight in their uncut glory!
