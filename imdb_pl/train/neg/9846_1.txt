You may be tempted to rent this movie because Peter Sellers appears in it. That would be a mistake. This is one of the most pointless films ever made. I was waiting for something funny, but in this movie there is nothing funny. Even the film industry considered it a very poor film and did not even try to promote it. I'm surprised that it has ever been placed on video. <br /> <br /> I wonder what kind of contract caused the sellers to be included in this film. I'm also wondering why the people responsible for the movie were allowed to do other bad movies. Surely this movie is a waste of money that was used to create it, and a waste of time to watch it. Certainly there are high school students who would be able to write / produce a movie as a story.
