"Feast of All Saints?" Where ...? When ...? <br /> <br /> Is the plot and theme of the Feast of All Saints edited? <br /> <br /> What a waste of a great title! There is never anything in history that has the most distant relationship with the "All Saints' Day". In the story about "All Souls Day" there is also nothing that refers to this term. Why bother with this title if you never intend to include any story or theme about "All Souls Day" or "All Saints Day"? <br /> <br /> Embarrassingly bad script and writing for amateurs <br /> <br /> How did they attract so much talent to it? Writing is so amateur - characters who know each other throughout their lives, go through long, long speeches about their life stories for the good of the public. Not at all like people talk to each other. <br /> <br /> What was a thinking director? <br /> <br /> The director is equally angry! The forced and over-thought-out style is amateurish. In one scene, the character yells "Take your hands off me" and no one touches him! The worst directed scene, however, is an amazing battle scene at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> An over-gore in a very fake, stupid battle scene. <br /> <br /> There are so many dead people on the most fake battle scene. It seems that on Saturday evening live !! You can see extras waiting for their tips to pass through the camera. Everyone plays on the stage of death like boys from the fourth grade - they exaggerate every small sigh and vibration. The blood on the victims of battles is so excessive and carelessly used that it looks like someone used a ketchup dispenser and just splashed straight lines of red on the costumes. <br /> <br /> This entire battle scene is a tricky really tawdry war movie. You almost expect someone like Will Ferrell and Mike Myers to ride a horse and deliver a punch line. <br /> <br /> Who in real life would ever behave this way ?! <br /> <br /> The most absurd piece of writing, directing and casting is actually the theme of the scene: <br /> <br /> A little girl is standing under the body of her hanging father - who is terribly crippled and literally dripping blood from his yawning wounds. Even an idiot would know he was dead! And yet it is - very monotone - repeated over and over again, "Daddy, daddy ...", looking at someone outside the screen. She provided it with the same credibility and passion you would expect from a non-acting kid who had been repeating the camera line all day. <br /> <br /> Even if a poor child had some acting skills, the scene is completely unbelievable. The girl would not even be in the middle of the battlefield after the hours of slaughter - surrounded by hundreds of dead bodies while she is still standing there! Natural instincts would make the child scream and frighten, fleeing the bloody slaughter! <br /> <br /> Should we be scared or laughing ...?! <br /> <br /> Particularly silly detail, which gives the stage satirical tone SNL, is hanged by the father's huge hook in his mouth and cheek. It looks like a fish on the hook! Unintentional funny details make the whole scene look fake and stupid. <br /> <br /> In Fantasy La-La-Mothers and Daughters they are the same age! <br /> <br /> Another funny detail is that you see the central character - the girl's mother - at the end of the stage and in the next scene, which takes place over 20 years later, looks exactly the same! She is still young and beautiful, and now the same age as her daughter! <br /> <br /> I almost turned off the movie because the direction and writing were obviously awful - but I tried to eliminate it because I wanted to see the Louisiana settings and I like all the actors. I do not know what these wonderful actors thought when they accepted these roles! <br /> <br /> Who was the audience targeted? <br /> <br /> Excessive Blood and Misbehaved Violence The opening scene is strangely out of place with the story of the soap opera story that follows. There is also a strange way to start a film that for the rest of the time seems to be targeted at women reading Romance novels. Strange inconsistency in tone!
