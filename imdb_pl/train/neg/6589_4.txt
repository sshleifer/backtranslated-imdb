I'm afraid I did not like this movie. In addition to several saving graces, there is nothing to write about. <br /> <br /> J-horror has flourished over the last five or six years, but the films themselves have repeated and replicated previous successes on several accounts. This is one of them. <br /> <br /> Essentially, it is a supernatural movie. The beginning is promising due to chilling scenes from the morgue, where the dead girl has stitched her eyes graphically, but soon after they open. However, after this it quickly falls on this move. <br /> <br /> To be good, I will start with the things that I like in "Gawi". On the other hand, visual effects are flashy, and the movie looks great for this type. For those who like their horror movies, there are a few nicely made (without words) scenes of murders. We also get some good voltage / set-pieces. <br /> <br /> However, there are also a few drawbacks ... <br /> <br /> First of all, and my main complaint regarding this movie is that the story jumps and jumps forward and back in time with alarming intensity. Usually this is not a problem for me, but here, where students look exactly the same regardless of age, I was confused more than once. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that the performances are fairly difficult to say when you do not know the language), but it seems a bit stiff. And when it comes to horror, I do not think it's terrifying enough. For a time I was really bored. <br /> <br /> Being a fan of giallo movies, I expected a lot from "Nightmare", but unfortunately I was very disappointed.
