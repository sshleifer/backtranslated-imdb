does anyone think that this program actually helps some people or is it just angry with people who watch it? when I flip through the channels and come to this program, I watch the morbid curiosity. I understand that Pat Roberson is not all together. I do not know if his viewers are like him, if they are good people and think they will have a better life if they listen to what he has to say. Pat Roberson has little meaning. he is an old man who thinks in an old way. the fear of condemnation no longer has the same effect as it used to be (thank God). Now, if someone wants to answer my question, I will avoid lightning for the rest of eternity.
