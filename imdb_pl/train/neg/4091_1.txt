Ah, Lucio Fulci, rest in peace. This infamous Italian is the most <br /> <br /> known from "Zombie" and absolutely not to watch "<br /> <br /> Mental" and "Manhattan Baby". Let's add it to the list of invisible <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> The story is about a nekkid that wears a gold mask <br /> <br /> and thongs. I want the power of a young dubbing stud <br /> <br />, which has a set of magical arrows and a bow. They are magical <br /> <br /> because they shine. The shots connect with a guy in a bad wig, <br /> <br /> and spend the majority of the movie by saving themselves from the flat <br /> <br /> action sequences. Finally, the nekkid chick is defeated, but not <br /> <br /> before removing the mask and reminding me why I broke up with my high school girlfriend <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> Fulci bathes every shot in an orange glow and fills the screen with smoke <br /> <br />. Nothing like a smoky orange action sequence that will make you <br /> <br /> want Sunny Delight and a cigarette. Special effects are <br /> <br /> funny. In one sequence our duo gejowski duet is <br /> <br /> attacked by dozens of arrows, which are clearly scratches on the movie itself. <br /> <br /> Most of the effects budget had to be <br /> <br /> released on the Fulci-licious gore, which consists only of gushing <br /> <br /> wounds. Hey, we can all use a good ritual wound once on <br /> <br />, but when you fall into a gushing wound, it becomes boring. <br /> <br /> I still had to play with the brightness setting on my TV <br /> <br /> just to see what happened. <br /> <br /> There are many conversations about fulfilling predictions and prophecies, so let me <br /> <br /> look into the future ... if you find this movie and watch it, <br /> <br /> You regret it. The scene in the video field (according to Media) does not appear in the movie in any context. "Conquest" is a task <br /> <br />. What MST3K could do about it! <br /> <br /> This is rated (R) for strong physical violence, strong gore, feminine <br /> <br /> nakedness, short male nudity and mild sexual content. <br /> <br />
