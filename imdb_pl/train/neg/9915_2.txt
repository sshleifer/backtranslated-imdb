I just finished "Dark Chamber" aka "Under Surveillance" and I'm stunned. Stunned, not by a movie, but by some enthusiastic reviews that I used to influence my viewing. The story was so ravaged by holes in the story, and most of the actors were so flat that it seemed appropriate to classify it as a comedy. Seriously, I found myself shaking my head and laughing at the bewilderment when I endured this movie. <br /> <br /> Justin leaves the boundaries of life at home with an addicted to pain killer mother, to live with the father of a policeman, even though mom warns that dad is not good. When a young woman is murdered, Justin becomes suspicious of tenants who live in neighboring flats. With the help of several colleagues, he installs hidden cameras to control these people. As the truth begins to unravel, Justin discovers an unexpected secret. <br /> <br /> The positive point is that Felissa Rose is HOT! I would be generous to hit an extra star or two here, if she would break away a little, but without such happiness. It would be a potential saving of the movie. Eric Conley played Justin very well, I thought, and I would not be surprised to see him again in the future. <br /> <br /> The general premise of the film, although it is plagued by stereotypes, could possibly work if not for the ridiculously empty "performances" of key cast members, especially Alexandra Eitel (Kayla) and David H Rigg (Justin's father). Horror! (sorry for the pun). <br /> <br /> I do not mind low-budget movies. Indeed, I believe that an independent film is our only hope for decent film making in the coming days. I will cut low-budget movies quite loosely when it comes to special effects, lighting, even music and general picture quality. However, I do not grant relief to actors with stick figures and a scenario of a lover of Swiss cheeses. There are many competent low-budget movies. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. I can not stop suspecting that at least a few reviewers who praised Dark Chamber here are somehow related to its production.
