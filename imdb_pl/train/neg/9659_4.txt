After watching this movie, I was genuinely disappointed - not because of actors, history or directing - I was disappointed with these movie commercials. <br /> <br /> Trailers suggested that the battalion "chose the third exit" beyond surrender or death (Polish information was even wrong, that they had the choice between killing by their own artillery or German guns, even translated the title as "wrong battalion" ). It tickled the right place and I bought a movie. <br /> <br /> Disappointment began when I realized that the third way is to just sit down and count the dead bodies, then sit down and count the corpse ... Then I started to think "hey, this story can not be like that simple ... I bet that this clever officer will find some clever way to save what's left of his forces. " Well, he did not do it, they just sat and waited for something to happen. And it was like that. <br /> <br /> This story was based on real World War I events, so the writers could not use their imagination, but even thought that this movie is really unquestionable, and even a bit boring. And as I wrote at the beginning - it's not the fault of actors, writers or director - their marketers have raised my expectations high above the level with which this film could handle.
