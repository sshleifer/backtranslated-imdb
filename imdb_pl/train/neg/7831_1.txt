Together with the accompanying song MASTERS OF HORROR, NIGHTMARES AND DREAMSCAPES can be seen only as an absolute nadir genre, which started so successfully thanks to the TWILIGHT ZONE and EXTERNAL LIMITS. <br /> <br /> Of course, part of the problem is that he is not interested in a relatively grown-up audience, instead he is aiming for a TEN-YEAR who can only count the body bags and barely do it. So the thickness is king, and the King is a shame. <br /> <br /> Stephen King is simply illiterate? generally has the ability to tell Bart Simpson. Because he can not read, his only inspiration is films. <br /> <br /> It is true that cinema is not such a bad place to start, because it generally escaped the attack of "realism". But these movies are just a rumor, not a thing, and if you want to WRITE you have to dig deeper. <br /> <br /> Of course, only PICKMAN had monsters as close friends. But even for every student it should be clear that vampires are not Dracula and Lugosi. <br /> <br /> At least the AUTOPSY ROOM FOUR is a clear indication of what is wrong. You can almost imagine this pitiful dolt sitting on the desk trying to think of something SCARY. <br /> <br /> No, remember, trying to accurately describe the horror of the system, which is an integral part, creating a stupid fool, but trying to come up with a horrible story for your little nephew. Suppose you were paralyzed and people thought you were dead and started to open you, as they do in these sections! Would not it be disgusting? And boys and girls are history. <br /> <br /> And what about the characteristics? Oh yeah, he's one of those suits that never appreciated life, you know, and now it's too late, right? And he screams? Well, they do not actually hear him, do you know? He says he's going to sue a hospital, but he's not so big anymore, you see, he's lying there (or lying, I never remember) and everything. And he thinks: Oh no, please, please, do not cut me off, and this is horrible, lies (or lies down) in this way? would not it be a great story? You know I read somewhere that a snake bite could do it, I think it was the great medical authority of Agatha Christie. What was the name of this snake, oh yeah, BOOMSLANG? he has a lot of ring in it, right. <br /> <br /> Let's make PERUWIA≈ÉSKI BOMBLANG! Sure, Steve, that's great? besides, BOOMSLANG is Afrikaans, you moron! But how can you really say that the target target group are children, not just mental defects? It's simple: there is no sex. <br /> <br /> Well, it is, but it is a kind of perceived by a break in the bedroom door of our parent. Contemporary filmmakers are really great in the erotic aspects of the genre, monster, female sacrifice, chase. <br /> <br /> But unlike UNIVERSAL and LEWTON they have no idea what's going on. All that really remains is a giggle outside the SM club and the fascist creed that people with sexual preferences are internally angry. <br /> <br /> Despite some discrepancy, King Kong knew exactly what to do with Fay Wray. Freddy Krueger can only kill her. <br /> <br /> And because there is no real excitement in it, he must first torture her? not in any way that would excite her, you understand, because that would disturb our puritanical feelings. So horror and romanticism are simply unpleasant and seducing psychopaths. <br /> <br /> You see, our hero is a rubber fetishist and can only reach someone who touches him, you know that downstairs know ?? rubber gloves (giggle). And that's what they use in the autopsy, and in this way they discover that you really know it. <br /> <br /> Of course, the author is at the peak of his inspirational powers. It is a pity they cut it out because it could upset the FIVE OLDS watching the show!
