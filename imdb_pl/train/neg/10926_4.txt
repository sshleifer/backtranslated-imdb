The idea is more original than most Sci-Fi films, but as usual there is no performance. While the practical effects of the mummy are not bad, and the "Gun Nut" character is above the peak chuckle, the only real attraction is to see Morena Baccarin and Adam Baldwin again connected on a small screen. I suspect it was the whole idea. They do what they can with what they have, but the "must see" moments were for me in the first 40 minutes when the character of Morena was wearing Tomb Raider shorts. I know it is not a high cinema, but you can not deny the real beauty when you see it !!! And Adam Baldwin once again identifies him with the guy you love to hate. If you just want to watch some of your favorite Firefly characters, have fun with some support material, it may be for you. If you want a good game and character development, we advise you to look elsewhere.
