This is a little bit for me, for the first time I was disappointed with Tim Burton's film. POTA is not a bad movie (great sets, costumes and a strange great performance), but could be made by any Hollywood director. The pace was very strange, the last third spent just waiting for the movie to end, alone and cast. Tim Roth was perfect, probably the only pleasure in the movie. Return Tim.
