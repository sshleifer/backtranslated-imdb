What begins as a delicate country yarn, a harmless and slightly pleasant romantic tale, changes the pace when initially charming Harlan Edward Norton gradually reveals more about himself and things change in sinister because the film gradually changes from southern romance to modern wild western. <br /> <br /> The friendly rancher (Norton) wanders into the city and charms the young girl (Evan Rachel Wood), seemingly saving her from the dead end with her evil father with a swirling romance, but it is gradually becoming obvious that this cowboy is more than at first glance. <br /> <br /> Edward Norton ?? a real chameleon actor (with a change of hair on the face), playing in a country style, an accent somewhat suspicious, but maybe because he only tries to play the role without worrying about the accent. Certainly, it seems that it is easy to make minor adjustments because we learn more about Harlan. However, with too many small changes, this means that we're never sure where Harlan comes from, and what seemed like Norton's good achievement is gradually mistaken. Evan Rachel Wood is nice, even if there really are not many opportunities to do other things than eyelids at Norton. <br /> <br /> Down in the Valley strikes as a slightly uneven tale due to the change of pace and never really making the hero's motifs explain the sympathy of the audience to characters remain uncertain. Should we like this vagabond or not? Even after the dramatic turn of events remains unclear. This ambiguity is to the detriment of the film, as if the writer could not decide what story to tell, and decided on a sort of sausage. If the film remained one or the other, it could be a solid movie, but from what we have left is a mess. Fans of an old-fashioned romance will enjoy part of the movie, but will be discouraged by the darkening tone. Play with Norton fans aside (or fans of the lush scenery of the San Fernando Valley), give longing.
