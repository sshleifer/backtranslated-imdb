This film tells the story of a very sexy Olympic star, which is employed to train the basketball team of high school boys. As in WILDCATS, Goldie Hawn, plays Cathy Lee Crosby in the title role, and does it as well as the script allows. I think Racquel Welch would be a better choice, but given the apparent budget of the TV movie, they probably could not let her. Cathy Lee looks great in every shot, but we never see her completely naked. The story is quite predictable, to put it mildly, without any surprises. Young and happy Michael Biehn has a major male role. He is the band's star and Cathy Lee's interest. Keenan Wynn has some fun scenes as a rich old man who runs a sports program and does not think that a woman should train sport. This point is moved throughout the film and, of course, is dated. Ironically, Cathy Lee does not put his team into any unconventional training sessions; he does nothing that the male coach would not do. There is a funny part-piece involving a tall and not very bright player who undergoes hypnosis to pass his classes and play like a professional Sydney Wicks basketball player. Everyone seems to have a good time creating this movie, but the only real reason to see him is Cathy Lee Crosby. She is not a great actress, but she has a dazzling smile, beautiful hair and a very brown body.
