In the afternoon I watched a hut by the lake in the USA. Given that this movie was filmed for television, it was interesting enough to watch the sequel. So, I set myself to weather this evening and I was very disappointed. I knew I would not like this movie, but I did not expect to be embarrassed by the use of DV (digital video). The film would be livable if it were not for those digital photographs that appeared out of nowhere. I expected the plot line to be related to these arrows, but there seemed to be no logical explanation. (WARNING: THE FOLLOWING MAY BE A SPOILER) The open ending in Cabin by the Lake was acceptable, but the open end of the sequel is ridiculous. I can only predict that the film's return to the cabin through the lake will be watched if the film was screened without anything but advertising at four in the morning.
