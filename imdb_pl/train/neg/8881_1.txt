The actress is a bit stiff, as if for the first time a man from the actors appeared on the screen. Unfortunately, one of the better actresses, Jean Simmons (she played many roles on television, such as W Star Trek TNG and In the Heat of the Night), dies quickly, and then her acting can be clearly omitted. <br /> <br /> The main role is Mr. Ballard, presented by Cliff Robertson. Cliff is forced to wear this movie with his body language most of the time. He does not do bad work, but it's a bit too much to ask the actor to plug the oceans of the empty screen time, during which the characters spend their time NOT speaking and NOT acting. The most memorable role of Robertson can be Ben Parker in the last 3 films of Spider Man (with Tobey Maguire). <br /> <br /> The plot is predictable. The husband murders his rich wife for money. then the wife seems to come back and haunt her husband, who drives him mad until he pops out of the high window (fearing the ghost of his late wife who is approaching him) on the day when he is expected to die no less. The second chauffeur worker, Mr. Ballard, looks like the English character of Hamill. Amazing really! The only thing that stands out is the total disregard for dialogue. Many minutes pass in silence, no one speaks and nothing much happens. It is a pity that the guys from MST3K have never won this film. It could be much better, if not so predictable, with more dialogue or shorter scenes of "nothingness". <br /> <br /> I still expected G'Mork's red eyes to emerge from the shadows and announce that he is acting on the "nothing" that lives in this movie.
