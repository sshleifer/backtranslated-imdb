"Shinobi" is one of those movies in which it is believed that the act of killing a character automatically brings a sense of heaviness or emotion to a story. Unfortunately, for the audience to really care for dying people, you have to develop characters, otherwise you only have a few random acts of violence. The problem is particularly severe when you have TONS characters, all of whom die. <br /> <br /> OK, so if you can not worry about making characters in any way memorable or sympathetic, you can at least make REASONS why they die believable, right? No. We have a war between two ninja clans here, and neither side knows why they are fighting each other. They kill each other because that's what the emperor says. However, even after it becomes obvious that the emperor wants ALL of them to die, they still refuse to leave their senseless missions. This is not stubbornness ... it's just stupid. <br /> <br /> Well, good! There is no character development, and the plot does not give legitimate reasons to fight. At least they die fighting in cool action scenes, right? Once again NO! In fact, many fights are not fought at all: the super ninja, whose film has devoted so much time and effort to the game, suddenly dies (and, in my opinion, lamely). I am talking about things like: "Lalala, I'm going, and I * the neck is cut up." END for this character. Even in the middle of the movie, I stretched my hands up in frustration because of his ridiculousness.
