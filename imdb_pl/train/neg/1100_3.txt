Since most reviews of this film come from shows from ten years ago, I would like to add a new movie with film footage from the German B-17 bombardment, film cuts for Hauptmann (captain) Oskar Werner Wust and his hero helper escaping to the hideout while traveling to Hitler's Bunker, when in the middle, he is interrogated by the staff staff, the movie is cut off on one of the many conference scenes with Albin Skoda giving a decent impression that Adolf Hitler mobilized his officer to "Ultimate Victory" while Werner's character is shown as slowly coming to consciousness that the inhabitants of the bunker are entangled in the world of fantasy - some events unrelated to the bunker are presented, and the most noteworthy is the flooding of the metro system to prevent the Russian progress through them and the small thread involving the young Flak survivor and his family in survival - this the film suffers from many detailed inaccuracies that the German film did only 10 years after the Second World War should not have included; the actor portraying Goebbels (Willy Krause) is in the same uniform as Hitler, including the eagle in his hand - Goebbels wearing the brown uniform of the Nazi party with the swastika armband - an SS soldier in the camouflage of the German army, a well-documented Hitler scene awarding an iron cross for Hitlerjugend boys, it was shown that the bunker was inside (done outside in the courtyard), and finally Hitler's suicide weapon is clearly shown as the Belgian model of bronzing from 1922 - most accounts agree that it was Walther PPK-some bit of acting also seems completely inaccurate, because the scene of drunken dance at the end of the film is noteworthy, this piece is shown as a cabaret sketch, with a drunken injured soldier (his hand on the rail) manically enters the music while the nurse performs a combination striptizu / belly dance, all by candlelight ... watching them st embarrassing - the most amazing is that Captain Werner Wust wins the audience alone with Hitler Skoda, Hitler is shown as slumped, dazed and delirious when Werner's character begins to question him, Hitler's cries, which cause the SS-man who is deadly he wounded Werner in the back with a shot - this fabricated scene, not based on any real historical description - Werner's figure is then pulled away to die in the hall, while Hitler prepares his own ending, showing Hitler's farewell to his staff, but suicide is out screen, the last second of the film shows Hitler's funerary smoke slowly forming a ghostly image of the face of the late Oskar Werner / Hauptmann. Wust-this film is more allegorical than historic, and anyone interested in this period would better check the latest films such as the remake of 1973. "Hitler : last 10 days "or German movie Fall "(Der Untergang), if you want a more genuine recognition of this dramatic story, the latter two films are based on the eyewitness testimony of" Hitler: the last 10 days. " compiled on the basis of Gerhard Boldt's autobiography as a staff officer in the Fuehrer's bunker and the "Fall" made from Hitler's secretary, the screenplay "Der Letzte Akte" comes from the book of American War Crimes Nuremberg Michael Musmanno "Ten Days to Die", which is more of a compilation the history of events (many of course fanciful) than the stories of eyewitnesses - it is surprising that Hugh Trevor Roper's account "The Last Day of Hitler" has never been performed in the film.
