If Alien, Jurassic Park and countless other sci fi horrors are your cup of tea, add a lot of sugar and you'll get it. The film begins in merry, old England around 1100, and then jumps to today's California. Our hero Carver (Dean Cain) is the new head of security and adviser to the military science laboratory 400 meters underground. He arrives (Carver is also a helicopter pilot) with a leading scientist and soon we will find out that this is a cloning lab and have something that can be found for cloning. Is this a dinosaur or something? As in the case of the above films, hell broke loose, and our heroes began to gather. The special effects in Monster are pretty good for the movie "directly to the video", and Dean Cain does what he pays for. But forget about the rest of the group when we find out why we've never seen them before. Again, do not enter high expectations and you will be fine.
