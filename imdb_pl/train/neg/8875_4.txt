If it's a "favorite" movie of someone else, it needs serious help. There is nothing funny or smart about it. I have not seen the original film, which is a remake (some movie from the 1950s), but it just has to be better than the newest bastardism. <br /> <br /> Major is thrown out of the army for being an element of the periphery and finishing teaching children at the ROTC school. Unfortunately, the main one is Daman Wayans ... so children are in the world of annoying, humorless asinism. Can Wayans make these losers better? Can they make him become a little more human? Film bombs like most of Wayans' films, with just a few brilliant moments. William Hickey gets about a minute of time on the screen, not enough. This charming old man (known to me best as the actor "Tales from the Crypt", best known as Uncle Louis from "Christmas Vacation") shines anytime he is on screen, and that's not much. <br /> <br /> Bam Bam Bigelow also looks like a motorcyclist who fits him perfectly. I would not mind Bam Bam, but I think he had the role of a "cyclist" to the extent that he could be transferred to a military film. <br /> <br /> And then there is an attractive teacher who falls in love with Major Payne, although he treats children badly, has no social skills and is simply impossible to transform into someone with whom you would like to spend time. It must be either incredibly stupid or incredibly desperate. I'm not sure which (though it would seem "stupid" because the movie clearly shows that it often leaves the house). <br /> <br /> Wayans had one brilliant moment: a dance sequence with a series of moves (including a very nice "robot") and with the help of 2 Live Crew music. This scene was nice, but it did not make up for anything that made the movie slippery. <br /> <br /> Seriously, avoid this movie. If you want to see a movie about a loser who helps lost children to become heroes, rent or buy "Ernest Goes to Camp". At least he is a beloved loser, and even funny. Maybe if Major Payne was fighting a badger, I would feel better, but he did not. Forget about Payne, forget Wayana ... you can do a lot better.
