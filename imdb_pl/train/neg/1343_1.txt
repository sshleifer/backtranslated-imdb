We bought this movie in a store called Poundland. We were looking for more inspiration because we had previously bought the "No Big Deal" movie. <br /> <br /> We expected that this film will be very inspiring so that we can make it and put it on the tube. However, it was shocking. BORING is the main word that comes to mind. Bad effects and scripts are not enough for you to watch them. The body of the main woman seems to be thrown at the right moments in a pitiful attempt to get the viewer interested. However, you are just wondering if they blew up the budget, forcing her to take off her clothes? If so, I would ask for a refund! It looks like a home movie, the pictures do not even match, and the camera's work is so amateurish that it makes our modifications of the bad movies look professional. I can not believe that it is sold as a product suitable for sale. <br /> <br /> IS BORING and UGLY to watch. The actors are bad and there is no professionalism. There are no words to describe how terrible it is.
