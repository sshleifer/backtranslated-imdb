The idea with the potential and it was great to see these two icons together, but ... Rudolph's glowing nose did not require the "explanation" offered in this film - just like The Force in, Star Wars movies did not need explanation "Medichlorians in the bloodstream". But mainly the film left me cold because of the overly complicated plot of Winterbolt, which was to destroy Santa Claus. It has the power to add suggestions to people's minds, so why does it do things in such a roundabout way? Breaking the magic of Rudolf's nose, framing Rudolf, threatening to melt the Frosty family ... Comedy exaggerated threads Pinky and the Brain and "Phineas and Ferb" Dr. It seems simple and straightforward compared to Winterbolt, which is expected to be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> It is especially (and funny) a strange moment when the character throws two pistols at the wrong guy, like boomerangs. I understand if they do not want to shoot a gun in a family movie, but why a weapon?
