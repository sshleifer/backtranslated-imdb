"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" (an unbelievably thankless title) is just a bad movie; there is no heart, no deep ideas, nothing special about it. Yes, CGI backgrounds look interesting, but the effect is that the whole is shot in an annoying soft focus. In addition, the film uses music in the same way as, say, "Gilligan Island" or Scooby-Doo fairy tale - NEVER BREAK. Awful, just terrible. There are also no new ideas, only gobos, gobos and gobos ... etc., Bits downloaded from older movies and series. There's no guard here, the movie just exists because it can. Save your money and your time. It is not funny at all.
