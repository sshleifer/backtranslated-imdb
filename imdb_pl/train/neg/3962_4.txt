I really could not wait to meet Nana after watching Renoir's amazing debut, Whirlpool of Fate. I read that Nana was generally considered his best mute movie, so I had high hopes. Unfortunately, I felt like a huge step back. <br /> <br /> Catherine Hessling is the main problem of this film. Her acting is the best, even for a silent movie. Her acting is more akin to what one would expect from a film from early teens to the late 1920s. He usually has the same face that reminds me (I'm sorry to say) about a person with constipation pain. It was very difficult to believe that any man would fall for this femme fatale. There was nothing charming about her at all. <br /> <br /> The film was also quite long, the work with the camera was uninteresting (except for the horse race), and the assembly was boring. The story reminded me of Pandora's Pandora's Box. It's interesting to compare these two, because there are only three years between these films. The Pandora's box simply earns points on every level on which Nana fails. <br /> <br /> This movie is only intended for compliments of Renoir or very serious lovers of silent movies.
