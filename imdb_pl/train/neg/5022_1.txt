Oh dear, this movie was bad for various reasons. I was expecting to see a very low score for this movie and was a bit surprised by the overall rating. Unfortunately, but to judge a lot, it's a joke! After passing one shot / black and white film, which was a nice idea, the film stretches even in just 66 minutes. The sequence of loans at the start was so annoying! In the van, the boys suffer a flat tire and change the wheel, wow, it was needed in history! How free were the guys chasing and actually going to hurt Campbell? It seemed that they did not care about constantly chasing him ... sigh ... I'm glad I got it for free thanks to the special edition of Evil Dead !!
