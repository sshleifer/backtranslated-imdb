It's probably the worst rehearsal of the Zombie movie I've ever had the misfortune to see. Horrible, horrible, terrible. Every review found on this site is of course the work of a filmmaker, a family of filmmakers or a friend of a filmmaker. How is this movie sucked? Let's count the ways ... <br /> <br /> Plot? Incoherent. Dialogue? Cruel. I will not dump effects / gore, because I understand that this is a low budget. But was there even one zombie who was not obese? Come on! And as for the movie on Rhode Island, why is this truck on the Massachusetts plate? Continuity, find some. <br /> <br /> The girl dances, and the soldier "stands at attention." Please, do not put your ex-girlfriend or sister friend in your nude movie. It was an ugly film full of ugly people and it makes no sense to even mention Romero on the cover. The next time you decide to make a movie, no.
