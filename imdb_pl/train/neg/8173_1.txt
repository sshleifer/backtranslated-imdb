One of the most boring slashers in history. If you can call it that. I would not watch it even if it ended up in a porn movie that totally resembles. The fact that you are watching a small group of middle-aged people in the woods is really unbearable. They made these kinds of teen films, so who did they really aim for when they did this sleepy fest? My favorite part of this movie is the cover and this is the only reason why I decided to look for this movie, which by chance was part of the 50 movie pack in Suspense Classics 50. and after watching other films in this 50-pack I realize that nowhere else it should not be. So if you're in the mood for a decent slass in the woods, I recommend Just Before Dawn and The Final Terror.
