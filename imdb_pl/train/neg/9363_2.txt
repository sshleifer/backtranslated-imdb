This film has some disastrous flaws in it, it's unbelievable how someone can go through the open back door of a highly secure medical facility. Then the same person walks around the object and enters the doctor's office, he just writes badly or edits poorly. <br /> <br /> Very highly predictable movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how the movie was made, except that it was filmed in Canada and probably received a government subsidy. <br /> <br /> I must say that the person playing Aaron, Cory Monteith, did a good job. <br /> <br /> Unless you are really bored and there is nothing else to watch on TV, I would say it will kill some time, but otherwise it's a movie that no actor would like in his CV.
