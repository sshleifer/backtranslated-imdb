Tourists go to Ireland on a school trip to learn about the Druids. What they encounter is a terrifying tale of cannibal killers. <br /> <br /> If I had to sum up Bad Breeds, it would be a poor quality fest. The movie mixes Dead Alive, Evil Dead, Wrong Turn in one. It is a pity that the film has so many inconsistencies to follow that it loses any "fun" that could be watched. The film has many random nudity "horrors" ... although the movie also has four porn stars, four quarters, so there could be more. The breed also presents a large amount of blood. <br /> <br /> The bad race has a terrible beginning, with a funny dialogue and terrible acting. This is given in horror straight to the video, but it takes away the cake. I really do not know who the main character is, because one woman who "lives" at the end is not really in the movie. Speaking of completion, it must be one of the most accidental and false endings in film history. It makes no sense to the rest of the movie and completely changes views on the film. <br /> <br /> You must see this movie to believe it, because there are some really great death scenes. There are two scenes of death that come to my mind, one in which an innocent killer breaks the intestines of a naked woman through her chest ... yes her breast, do not ask me. The second ID, when the guy gets his intestines, once again, escaped his asshole. Does it kill a guy? No, the killer still suffocates the guy with his guts. These scenes remind me of Dead-Alive, with the right amount of humor in everyone. I also have a sense of Evil Dead, with meaningless horror stories and Samie Raimi. Along with Halloween, when a female character is in the closet shouting for his life with a killer trying desperately; y to enter. <br /> <br /> Although gore and nudity are not enough for poor sound and picture quality of the movie. When the teacher wakes up from the bed and walks down the stairs, her steps are so loud and hard that it seems she was wearing shoes. It actually distracts. As well as continuity in the film, with only one inbred killer? As well as which character dies at any given time. I could not tell if the stick with a breast implant is Jenny or Gary's sister / cousin ... I do not remember. Just like a random naked chick with a dead child hanging from her body, still attached to the umbilical cord. <br /> <br /> The horrible edition is also distracting, the initial loans are too fast and confusing. It had a bad start and improved, but the ending brings the movie back to a terrible level. If there were better production values ​​and more faith in this film, it would not be massacred to death. Stay away from this movie, unless you're happy with this awful, bad movie with a lower budget with a decent gore.
