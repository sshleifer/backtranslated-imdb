The Blair Witch-War movie, which is just as disappointed as Bwitch! The title says it all, save money and your time and spend it on a good movie like "Long ago in America", "The Shawshank Redemption" or "Enemy at the Gates" (if you want to watch a GREAT war movie, etc.) /> <br /> This movie, if it was a baseball team and major leagues were the top, and single A was debutant, then this movie was a ball in high school. It was filmed as if it was a school movie in a drama club with Sure, they went into a hostile area (to shoot a movie), but I do not call it brave, here we call it a simple fool! This is a pass! Go and look at it and then tell me what you think.
