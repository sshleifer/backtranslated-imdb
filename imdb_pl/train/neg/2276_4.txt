CLASS '61 <br /> <br /> Image format: 1.33: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: Stereo <br /> <br /> In 1861, class members from West Point Academy are torn apart the outbreak of the Civil War. <br /> <br /> OK Gregory Hoblit's historical drama is an obvious point - virtuous people are becoming blind because of the conflict - although production seems a bit stiff, despite the authentic details of the period and the cast of talented novices (Clive Owen, Christien Anholt, Josh Lucas, Andre Braugher, Laura Linney, etc.), emphasized by Dan Futterman as a conscientious Southerner who defends slavery, attacking him in direct conflict with his former northern friends. The emphasis of the film on such a faulty - though sympathetic - character is especially bold, but the drama is differently flat and superficial, and the direction of the Hoblit is rather effective than inspired.
