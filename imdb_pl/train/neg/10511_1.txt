Note for Horror fans: The only horror is here, when you realized that you wasted 95 minutes of your life on a movie that is so worthless that it is offensive. <br /> <br /> I watched this because: <br /> <br /> The premise sounded a bit promising: no. It's just an excuse to use the same lame songs from other low-budget movies that were not good either. <br /> <br /> The promise of the naked forest nymphs sounded nice, even if the movie turned out to be awful: no. It is not like that. Amateur cinematography ensures that "fallen angels" are as sexy as the average homeless. <br /> <br /> The name Tom Savini has a long history in the genre of horrors: he is the king of low-budget special effects and lower budget. Think about it, Savini should have been the reason not to watch this movie. It's not that it's bad, but it's almost always in bad movies. His only good role is From From Dusk Till Dawn, and since then he has been milking the convention of horrors. <br /> <br /> But let's focus on the positives: Forest of the Damned is a great example of how NOT to make a movie. <br /> <br /> Everything else is negative. Of course, the writer is allergic to originality. The script is terrible. This is all given after the first 10 minutes. But unconscious stimulation; the way the director treats the "plot" and "characteristics" as a nuisance, about which he thinks he does not care; and the terribly long and boring sequences of driving, walking and nature (undoubtedly added to extend the time for the film to be eligible for distribution) show a complete lack of skills for film and storytelling in general. <br /> <br /> This is another good example of the numbering method, which you can tell if the movie will be bad: if it is written and directed by the same person, expect trash.
