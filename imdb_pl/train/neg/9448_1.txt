No buy-back function, this movie is junk. His jokes do not start to be funny. Humor for children is pathetic, and attempts to appeal to adults simply add cheesy disgust to the whole miserable package. Sitting beside him with my children only made me feel uncomfortable about what might come. I could not enjoy the movie at all. Although my child, for whom the DVD was purchased, was happy to be the owner of the new DVD, neither she nor her sister expressed much interest in seeing them again, unlike Monsters inc, Finding Nemo, Jungle Book, Lion King, etc. receive frequent requests for repetitions.
