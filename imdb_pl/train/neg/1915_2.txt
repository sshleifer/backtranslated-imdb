This is a pretty good cast, but the movie has nothing to do with the original Italian comedy "Big Deal on Madonna Street." Anyone looking for a fun caper movie should visit the original. William Macy may be one of our biggest living actors, but here is not very useful. His role in the original was played by Marcello Mastroianni, so I feel sorry for him, trying to fill these shoes. You might as well try to imitate Bogart or the young De Niro. The direction of art is rich and textured, but it adds nothing to history, additional fragments that add to the story are completely unnecessary, and the things they take away are skipped. Even starting the way they do it seems strangely unjust and deviates from the surprise of the original. Rockwell himself has a strange and brilliant charm, and Luis Guzman has this strange charisma, but part of the love film seems clumsy and flat. It is a pity that no one realized how to make this film as good as it was first made, but again it is too bad that we live in a culture where we feel that we have to do amazing things instead of just learning savoring the originals.
