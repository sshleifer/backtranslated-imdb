Oh, dear sir ... They exchanged what was quite a provocative movie in the stunning fest of testosterone. <br /> <br /> The original version of this movie from 1971 was beautifully unclear about our hero Kowalski. He was a man trying to leave Denver for San Francisco to win a bet. Why was he willing to risk his life at the price of a handful of people? We are not entirely sure. <br /> <br /> We had some flashbacks that gave us the picture that he was an adrenalin junkie, and probably led his whole life trying to reach the point of vanishing. This point can be seen in the distance, where the left and right arms of the road merge, and the road itself disappears. He lives only to be free and not to be sick. We saw several times when there were accidents, stopped to make sure that the other driver was okay before moving on, even the cops who were pursuing him. <br /> <br /> When he saw the futility of his mission, he took his own life instead of being arrested and living in captivity. He died as he lived, he ran wide. <br /> <br /> In the remake Kowalski has the whole story (including even the first name.) He tries to get to the hospital where his wife suffers from complications of her pregnancy. She is a devoted husband and an excited future father. He makes the decision to take his own life after he heard that his wife died during childbirth, but even leave it in doubt when they suggest that he could jump out of the car before falling into the bulldozers. They even gave part of the "super soul", a blind DJ (greatly portrayed by Clevon Little in the original) on JASON PRIESTLY?!?!?!?!?!? Give me a break.
