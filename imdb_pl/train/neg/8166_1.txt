I was looking for a copy of The Forest because I watched a special VH1, I think "Where Are They Now" and saw a video box flash on the screen during an episode on Corky Pigeon's actress. He played in the male spirit of the child in this horror B horrible, but I remember him with his character Freddy in the television program Silver Spoons. This move is a big disappointment. There is nothing here. It took me four months to see him from beginning to end. I stopped him from boredom, putting aside and forgetting about it, and then stumbling and trying to go through it again. Of course, the angle of this film, which was to distinguish it from its counterparts, was a supernatural element, revelations. And, of course, it does not work here. I can not bear the male tracks. I expected them to look down at their hands during longer dialogues to read poems. The situation at the beginning, where couples decide to camp separately, is uncomfortable and stupid. I think the only positive thing about this is the scene where the guy falls and breaks his leg, you can see the bone protruding from his body. There's quite a good gore makeup there. Man, I'm really reaching for positive now, huh. The only other uneconomical horror on a level as bad as this would be Home Sweet Home.
