I do not know what kind of Brady children are. First, Barry Williams publicly boasts sex with his television sister, Maureen McCormick, and then on a date with her television mom Florence Hederson. Then, Susan (Cindy) Olsen makes music for several porn movies. Then Mike (Bobby) Lookinland gets into trouble for drunk driving. Finally, Maureen (Marcia) McCormick and Eve (Jan) Plum could have a little same-sex throwing aside. Now Christopher (Peter) Knight is chased by a beautiful young model at the age of twenty-several during his stay in "The Surreal Life", which at first was fun to watch, and now they are married and in a very unstable and hostile relationship. The last episode in which she posed for nude pictures with another naked girl for the album that Christopher gave to her birthday was not a good move on her part. And he dealt with it in a very mature way, simply getting up and going to clean his head. I think he always bowed to her every need, and now he finally takes a stand. And I hate to say it, but I think that he abuses it verbally. The way she tortured him for the engagement ring and the way he deserves it for every little thing. He also speaks openly about affairs with other women and it is obvious that he is still sleeping on him with men and women, which is not something that a self-respecting person should do when he is married to someone. If he was a man talking to such a wife and going out every evening for a party and having sex with other people, they would all gather for his wife to leave him. Why would it be different. What started out as a cute little affection in another reality show turned into a huge disaster. Adrianne, as beautiful as she is, is like another Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan, clearly in need of some therapy, because she is crying like a child over so many stupid things. I feel sorry for her, but Chris needs to get rid of her because she is a good man who can not afford to humiliate her in this way.
