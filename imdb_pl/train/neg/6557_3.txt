Really, they wrote in the subtitles BRAIN. No, BRIAN. <br /> <br /> OK, they did not have a spell check budget. All the money from production went to great old cars. At least two packages are visible here. One is a Darina convertible. Nice yellow Packard convertible. <br /> <br /> The scenes of the film studio show that some money was spent on costumes and decorations. There were old cameras, the outside part of Ciro, road signs and everything that was needed to create a visually appealing image. Poorly written and directed. <br /> <br /> My DVD says it works for about 104 minutes. It was more than 85 minutes. It ended without drawing conclusions. There was a collision, but no conclusion. The film simply crashed into loans. 99 cents for it. I paid 99 cents for it. I could buy 3 cans of cat food and watch the face of my cat when it caused more excitement. <br /> <br /> For a few seconds on the Ciro stage, after Darren McGavin got a phone call, it looked like he could. .. this movie would have a surprise that would be an interesting movie. Then he just sat there. <br /> <br /> A young Latin actor played by Steven Bauer (Tony Montoya) could have a much larger share of everything that was happening here. This cast could make a good movie. <br /> <br /> I think if they cut off Brian's role and use Steven Bauer in his place and change the script and keep the Packards and lose the band and add the sound of Johnny Otis, the band also got something. <br /> <br /> Here, Kitty, Kitty ... <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
