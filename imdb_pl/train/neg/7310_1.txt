** SPOILERS BELOW !!! ** <br /> <br /> The Fever cabin has a nod to the WORST movie of the year ... which I saw. This movie is a simple GARBAGE! The film is so wrong that you can not resist amazement how bad it really is. This movie had so much potential to be good, but eventually it did not do anything about it. The figures were as stupid as they could be; throughout the film you only ask "why would you do it?" or "what is your purpose in it?" ... this is how illogical and stupid characters are. We do not get any background in them, so naturally you really do not give rats money about their fate ... you could only laugh at their stupidity. <br /> <br /> - For example, "slut" (Marcy) ... was she so horny that she had to sleep with Paul (Rider Strong)? There was no point in ... it was almost as if the filmmakers needed an excuse to give her a virus, so voila! UGH. <br /> <br /> - Does anyone really go to the forest and drink tap water in the cabin WITHOUT looking at it first? <br /> <br /> - Why Bert did not shoot a sick guy from the beginning? The film would be in that sense ... besides, they killed him anyway. <br /> <br /> - Why did it take them so much time to finally decide to leave the cabin, even if they had to walk? - No, I will wait until two of my friends are infected (one blink from death) and finally decide to go out. <br /> <br /> - What exactly was the justification for Pawe≈Ç's attempt to get out of the Hermit's body to get into the contaminated tank and get infected with the virus? Pure stupidity! <br /> <br /> I swear, common sense was not a friend, let alone a friend of these idiots. I do not think there has ever been a worse end to the movie. At first, the kids ask the shop cashier what the rifle is for, and he replied that "for the niggers." At the end of the film, three young blacks (dressed in loose clothes, one of them in a rag no less) go to the store .... come to find out that the cashier cleaned them so that they could be used for hunting. THEN, he gives them all the pounds and handshakes and jokes with them as if they were his home boys. <br /> <br /> OK, WHAT IT WAS A POINT? How tasteless can you be, what did the filmmakers think THAT put it in the film? As a Black man, I was obviously offended by the initial commentary of the "Nobleman". It was tasteless, pointless attention. My question to the creators of the film: what was the point of ending with black children? Was this supposed to force me to forget about the initial racist earlier commentary? To smooth things out with black viewers, joking about it? Well, first of all, I did not consider this pathetic attempt at humor funny. The whole movie was a joke ... A PATETIC rehearsal of filming, which should not be given at this time of the day. Peter Jackson really thought that this movie is so good? What movie did he look at? <br /> <br /> ZERO * with **** stars .... if I could give him a lower rating, I would like to. Please, colleagues of IMDb'ers, do not waste 1 1/2 hour of your precious life watching this abomination of the "movie". This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
