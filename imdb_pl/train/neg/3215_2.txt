The film has one naked scene: a man sitting on the edge of the bed, with exposed genitals hitting the center of the screen. It's quite a long scene. What is going on? I almost think it was supposed to be fun, but we watched it with my mother and it was not fun to have him who stared at us for what seemed like a full minute. <br /> <br /> The movie is cold. None of the characters is even nice. Audrey Tatou is obviously cute, but her character is an unhappy girl. <br /> <br /> I really do not recommend this movie. I expected it to be charming and fresh, but it was depressing. I wondered if the director came from a very corrupt, educated French family and looks at these characters. <br /> <br />
