.... because if I was, perhaps I would like to be crucified on a wooden cross! I'm still trying to determine the story of this movie - and I'm "generous" that there was even a thread at the beginning. As mentioned before, the cover of the DVD is misleading that Richard Dreyfuss is actually a star. He was barely in the movie. And if it was really "frustrated" as the back cover indicates, it's probably because he said YES to be in this movie crash and he could not get out of it! The film really focused on Jared Martin, and his role in the movie was supposed to be different than extreme close-ups, it was not as great as Gene Barry's mysterious role - was not it. And speaking of the "big" ... someone who came up with the idea to fit Gene Barry in the outfit of Humpty Dumpty, who showed his pants literally pulled up under his chin, should be doomed to a hard time watching this movie stoned . I could continue to talk about how frightening this movie was, from a dialogue that does not match the mouth of the "actors" (I think Clutch Cargo), to inconsistently jump from stage to stage (again, being generous even in the creation of shots) scene ") , no plot ... But if you're in a bad genre in the early 70s and if you're in a Michigan home with this movie and a box of photos of kids and cats, I recommend having a good bottle of wine before starting this weird movie ride, because you'll be grateful you do not remember the next day!
