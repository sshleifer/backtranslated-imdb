Silly, simplified and short GUN CRAZY (VOLUME 1: A WOMAN FROM NOWHERE) is not going anywhere. <br /> <br /> This short (just over sixty minutes) story is not so much inspired by the classic Western spaghetti as it is the rip off of the FAST and FAST Sam Raimi (his tribute to spaghetti-westerns) brought to the modern surroundings. In QUICK & DEAD, Sharon Stone seeks revenge on the vile sheriff (played by Gene Hackman) who, when she was just a rascal, placed her father's fate in her hands (a short episode of Gary Sinise); she accidentally shot him in the head. In GUN CRAZY, Saki (played by agile Ryoko Yonekura) seeks revenge on the vile Mr. Tojo (played with minimalist applause by Shingo Tsurumi) who, when she was just a rascal, placed his father's fate in her hands; she let the foot slip off the clutch, and Dad's daddy was pulled out and accommodated by a pickup truck. The only important difference, despite the settings, is the fact that Tojo sadly maims Saki? Well, I will not ruin it for you in case you decide to watch it. <br /> <br /> In brief, Saki ?? Pale imitation of Clint Eastwood's "Man With No Name"? goes into the city? basically there is an auto shop and a tavern next to the US military base, so I think it's enough for the city? corrupted by Tojo, a local criminal with an absurdly high price on his head for reasons never explained or investigated. Confessing her true self as an award hunter, Saki acquires local shooters in shootings whose choreography turns out to be more than a passing similarity to the works of Johnny Toh and John Woo. Of course, at the end of the movie, Saki suffered quite a lot of torture from the hands of the bad guys, but she gets up for the occasion? on my knees, in a funny attempt to end the surprise? and defeats all of his enemies with a rocket launcher. <br /> <br /> Do not ask where the rocket launcher comes from. Just watch it for yourself. Try not to laugh. <br /> <br /> The picture quality is average for the DVD edition. There are several grainy qualities, but all in all this is not a bad transfer. Sound quality sometimes leaves some imagination, but again it is not a bad transfer. <br /> <br /> It's probably a bad movie.
