I did not think it was possible, but I found a movie worse than "Body Melt". This movie is really very bad! What's worse, this is another Australian movie ... <br /> <br /> Filmed for something that looks like VHS, and with the scary rock path of the 80s, it just gets worse and worse, which is hard to believe when seeing how bad is the beginning (skinned man dangling upside down in a white tomato sauce sprayed in the room?). <br /> <br /> And why do their accents change? From the bad New York draw, to prissy in English, and then pure Aussie! And so it happens with the entire cast! <br /> <br /> This movie also claims to have won a film festival on the cover (I believe it was the Utah Film Festival). It must be a lie, because no one in their right mind would nominate it for anything (maybe Golden Rasberries, but I think it's bad too). <br /> <br /> Come on, guys! This movie must be number 1 at the bottom 100 !!! It must be ten times worse than the films that are already there. <br /> <br /> Well done for the creators of this movie, for proving that there is no reason not to watch movies ..... 0/10
