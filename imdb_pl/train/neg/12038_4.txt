Is anything going on in this movie? There are only bizarre short scenes in which I did not know what the hell is going on, so it does not count. This movie is so boring that it hurts, and it comes from a person who likes when movies are about making movies. Confused? Well, after seeing this shit. What Donald Sutherland was about, because he completely missed it. And what about the scene of "pedophiles" at the beginning of the film. He can sleep to everyone! 4/10
