After watching the remake from 1996, I thought it was the funniest way to see Cruella De Vil, who was punished for torturing animals only by the skin. The whole movie was quite funny and, in my opinion, better than the animated one. But in reality there was no need for another. First of all, if Cruela comes back, do not heal her and make her crazy again. Just tear her away from prison and this is rap. I thought it was not very funny. Only one original puppy is to return. I expected that it should be Lucky, because he was the most attractive, and besides, he had Roger and Anita. They decided, however, to completely transform and add less than a hundred, even one hundred and two, but only THREE puppies and a parrot who thinks he is a dog (clever). Part of Gerard Depardieu was useless. At the end, Cruella is suffering too much, too humiliating and too exaggerated to be true. She gets baked in a big batter. It was a desperate attempt at physical humor, trying to mimic the same effect from the first one. It just does not work. It was too much, not too funny. I was really sorry about Cruella.
