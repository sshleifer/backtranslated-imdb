Why was this movie made? Even remembering the generous tax reliefs that Australian film investors received, there is no reasonable explanation that this film will have a green light. For God's sake, the actors cast in this film are Australian b-class stars (not actors, people like John Michael "Hollywood" Howson, original drummer from the band in Hey Hey Its Saturday and guy in voice at Countdown). But in saying that, it's still very possible to watch, if you just give him the attention he deserves: none. The script is bad (even for the self-proclaimed horror of class B), and the quality of the game and the movie is worse. often it looks like it is a home movie, but even a home movie has "realism" Anyone who is interested in Australian cinema, please, out of love for God, pretend that this movie has NEVER been made.
