After many years of listening to this film, I decided to rent it and watch it. Let me start by saying that I am happy that the rental was free in the local library. This movement was slow, boring, unrealistic, and the conspiracy did not make sense. After 2 hours, I was ready to bomb this town in Texas and bring these figures out of poverty. I realize that the taste is subjective, but believe me, I just do not understand all the noise I've heard about this film. Dallas gave as good a detail of life in Texas as this movie. Rent it only when you want to understand how film studios can pay reviewers enough money to convince the public that a bad movie is good.
