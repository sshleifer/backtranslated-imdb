... for one of the worst Swedish films ... excuse me for being boring. <br /> <br /> First of all, I did not see the first one (I got bored with watching the second one before the first one), well, I hope the first one is better than this one, it was full of strange scenes and very strange plot changes, For people who have seen this and think that 4/10 is tall (believe me, I do), but I was made to laugh a few times because it was so weirdly wrong and I still laugh about thinking about the punk who came up with this idea, what's next " Det sjunde inseglet II ". Sequences not based on a novel or book are not very frequent, and this is a perfect example. <br /> <br /> OK, I'll be honest with you: I was laughing a bit, I got some decent jokes and slapstick humor. But do not buy it, rent it. Let some other idiot do it or download it. <br /> <br /> 4/10 This movie will be remembered, and the director probably will have already laughed ...
