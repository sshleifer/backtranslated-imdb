Quentin Crisp once said that when things are shown too beautifully, one is a romantic. When things are unbearably bleak, they are realistic. And when something becomes ironic, they are there. Unfortunately for Leon de Aranoa he falls into the second category. This director apparently tried hard to create a movie like "Ken Loach" in Spanish, unable to capture the comedy and warmth between the characters that would raise Loach's movie of "depression." Los Lunes al Sol is just depressing. Things are unrealistically grim. The heroes of the final moments of unhappiness reach a climax at the same point, and if the grim history is not enough, Aranoa removes the story with a gray and dirty palette of colors. The films were ridiculously exaggerated at Goyas. A film that shows empathy for weaker citizens in society, in this case unemployed port workers, does not automatically mean a good movie, even though I would be the first to sympathize with the fate of these people. This movie only makes me interested in their fate. In Spain of the 21st century unemployed people do not live like beggars, and public transport ferries have decent toilets and it is hard to come across a bar with so few players and so little luck. Leon de Aranoa apparently has no idea about the working class in Spain and does not do favors. Pretentious is the only conclusion I can draw. The scene in which men watch a football match for free, was directly copied from a film that deals with a more "realistically" theme of the "poverty" trap, namely "Purely Belter", which is much more addictive, humorous and yet sad.
