Justin goes home to live with his harsh, hard police father, Detective, but it looks like Dad has turned the floor into three makeshift apartments that have strange tenants. A straightforward idealist Justin is pushed into the world of occultism, murder, drinking in the old age and other vile things. Ho-hum <br /> <br /> Wow, did I see the same movie that almost all the other reviewers have seen here? Clever, convincing, original, intense, clever, genius ???? !! I have not witnessed any of these things. What I saw was an uninteresting, bland, banal, unusually trivial low-budget thriller that was mature with incredible and no tensions in the slightest, because the killer is telegramsed right after the movie, when he gives his monologue / debate / discussion. Where are the humorous moments of laughter? I never choked like that, maybe because I was too busy struggling to stay awake by the movie. <br /> <br /> My class: D <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: audio commentary from director Dave Campfield; Second commentary with various authors, as well as individual music pieces; 4 descriptions (creating, on the set, rotating 1 room in 4 and inside a black circle); Interviews with Felissa Rose, Desiree Gould and Raine Brown; Alternative scenes; pipes; music video for "Addiction"; Trailer of this movie; And trailers for "Shock-o-rama", "Chainsaw Sally", "Skin Crawl", "Sinful", "Bacterium", "Creature from the Hillbilly Lagoon" and "Millennium Crises"
