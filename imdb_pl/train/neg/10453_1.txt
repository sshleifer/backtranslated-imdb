This movie deserves more than 1. But I give him this movie because so many guys with fans gave him 10, which gives him a rating that will take him to the list of 100 best. Seriously, it's not so great that it's not that bad. It's a stupid classic classic with a lot of fanatical fans that's funny. These are the types that probably still laugh at Chuck Norris joking and they keep saying, "I'm Rick James! Ch! "No matter how old he is annoying. I'm afraid I have to hear: "I have enough of MFn snakes on this MFn plane" in a few months from idiots trying to be funny. His bad role-playing game, etc. His good love for a bad movie, but you still have to admit that it's a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Wait for the Marine with John Cena, if you want to see the real movie
