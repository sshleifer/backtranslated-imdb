Quoting the film: "It's better not to know. It's better to forget. Oh, irony. <br /> <br /> A ghost story with all the technical improvements of the Hollywood horror, but a terrifyingly bad dialogue after the first quarter of the movie, and you feel that you are beginning to be preached. <br /> <br /> It's as if the cumulative dialogue of writers could be summed up by bad police TV and Jerry Springer's show. Maybe it suits a movie like The Hitcher, not a Russian-style horror movie. As a result, a potentially great setting and some potentially great gore scenes lose their meaning and become simply stupid, not scary or meaningful.
