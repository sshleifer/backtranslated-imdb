This movie was made by a group of white guys who went to school together. Well, there's nothing wrong with that, unless it looks like it was created by a group of white guys who went to school together. 90 percent of the cast are white men of the same age. It's almost like watching a group of boys in a boys' camp who turned their backs on themselves. The film has no plot. It repeats the same effect of a blood bath after a blood bath. There are a few funny scenes and comedy bits. But they do not buy flat monotony. <br /> <br /> Scenes from graphic cartoons are used to cover things that naturally exceed their budget or resources, and were not well made. Everything that can not be done with white men running on a beach covered in blood is done with cheap animations. <br /> <br /> After watching the trailer, I went to see this movie, which makes it look like a piece Tarrentino. Well, the harbinger scenes are as good as ever. The rest simply repeats the same kind of mundane comedy. It works sometimes, but it gets boring when the same things appear over and over again. It's more like Satuday Night Live sketches than film. It's a kind of comedy hit-you-over-the-head-to-it. I can see where the idea for the story is intriguing. But in this film post-apocalyptic America is very similar to Medevil England. In fact, Wheatlry says that ideas from history come from that era. He plans to do part 2. I think he thinks he is Tarrentino, and maybe he is doing a parody. <br /> <br /> At the opening in LA Wheatley mentioned that he would return to the same cast in Part 2. He was asked if he could consider a more diverse cast in the next, to which he replied, yes, of course.
