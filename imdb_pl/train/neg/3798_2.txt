And that's the only reason I have this DVD. Now I have not seen the first Nemesis movie, but I checked the information from it and say: What? Why? Because in the first movie Alex was a man. But then again, the first one was set in the future, so maybe this Alex is completely new and the scientist did Alex this time. Who knows, at least he has not been touched in the film in any way. <br /> <br /> Here is a short summary of the plot: Alex, even then the child (or how you want it, is in the future escapes with her mother using a special time ship and goes to Africa in the 80's. killed and Alex (Sue Price) grows up in an African tribe, then the tribe is killed by a future cyborg, and Alex runs and hides, and finally kills the cyborg, so there. Does it sound familiar, right? <br /> <br / > Terminator is not the only movie that is played here, Predator also has its share and I think the first Fly movie, Vincent Price, is a unique nomination for a solid foundation to build a cyborg head. <br /> <br /> Let's see what Ok, the movie was quite standard, small, but it had bad special effects in the movie from the mid-90s It looked like everything would be fine for 80. The biggest problem is the plot. Things just happen, and the viewer is barely interested Nemesis 2 is not the worst piece of cinema I've had the pleasure of (?) Watch, but it's damn near. <br /> <br /> I will not say anything about acting, let's be honest: was anyone expecting performances deserving of an Oscar here? Well ... at least I thought Sue Price was a hot warrior in this Amazonian style. <br /> <br /> "Real" movie rating: 2/10 There are not many professionals about quality. And despite the very basic story, the film itself does not make much sense. <br /> <br /> Rating camp film: 4/10 From time to time he laughs at the pure evil of the movie, so he has a small deserves it.
