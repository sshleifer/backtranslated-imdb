I do not know what would be so great about this movie. What's worse, why would anyone see it? First of all, there is no history. You could say that even without a story, a movie can be worth seeing because it evokes a strong feeling (laughter, crying, fear ...), but in my opinion this film does not do it either. <br /> <br /> You just view photos for +/- 2 hours. There are more useful things to do. <br /> <br /> I think you can say that the movie is an experiment and is bold because it lacks everything above. But is it worth 2 hours of your valuable time and 7 EUR of your money? For me, the answer is no.
