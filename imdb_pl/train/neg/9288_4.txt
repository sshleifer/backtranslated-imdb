Half Past Dead, in which the main role was played by Steven Seagal, was the main hit of B. Half Past Dead 2 is just a sequel to the movie, an action movie in which nothing is lost, but there is no possibility of winning something. It's less entertaining than the first: in every way. But this is worthy of looking. If you like action movies or just something to watch during a popcorn session; if you like watching WWE old stars on the screen, or even if you like watching sequels, even if they're direct or not. <br /> <br /> I think it is not made for work. Kurupt is a good comedian, I say. The rest did their job, but nothing extraordinary, nothing else but alright. <br /> <br /> Technical details, well, Sony production can not be great. Cinematography was a disaster, but the general direction was acceptable. Whatever, just look if you want. If you look, you will lose nothing. But if you do not ... well, you will not lose either.
