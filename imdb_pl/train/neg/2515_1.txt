This film is an abomination, and its creation should be considered a great crime. <br /> <br /> One of the great secrets of filmmaking is why nobody has ever made a faithful film adaptation of this wonderful mystery. It is a story about a really immersive mystery, nice old-fashioned romance and dry English humor. Why did the creators have to change Richard Gordon from a Scotland Yard police officer into an amateur detective, introduce the idiotic role and caricature of his English servant, change part of the main thread about the murder charge and circumstances of Gordon's fight to save the accused, etc., etc.? These producers and directors, who always think that they can create a better story than the one in the book, should write the original script by themselves, not violate the product of another person.
