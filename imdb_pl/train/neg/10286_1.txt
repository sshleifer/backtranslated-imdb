Roommates Sugar and Bobby Lee are kidnapped by dangerous guys who one day shop and return to a secluded island where girls are reluctant to tell the bandits they recently visited when they were 10 years old and have their property. All this simply glues the film, which is one long retrospection of the girl's first visit to the island and the subsequent fight against the cannibalistic family. <br /> <br /> This game is extremely terribly kept by everyone involved in I emphasize that I started to feel bad for poor Hank Worden, who really deserved a lot MUCH. Although I did not like "Barracuda" (it is on the same DVD), I must admit that this movie makes it look like Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: one pair of boobs (they can belong to Kirsten Baker) <br /> <br /> My Grade: F <br /> <br /> Dark Sky DVD Extras: Vintage ads of different fog; and Trailers for "Bonnie's Kids" (nudity features), "The Centerfold Girls", "Part-time Wife" (feature nudity), "Psychic Killer" and "Eaten Alive".
