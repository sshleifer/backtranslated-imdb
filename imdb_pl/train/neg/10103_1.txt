This movie told me to go. The title was probably the biggest idea I heard. I thought it was an independent movie about the zombie outbreak and their quest to take over the United States and a group of lonely survivors, fuse and plan to remove zombies. COMPLETELY INCORRECT! It's about a psychic cop with a weakness to kill his arrests, which gets to him when a pack of zombies rises from graves to get the right revenge. As you can see, there is nothing related to the nation or the district. Where to start with austerity, this cinema disaster has caused our nation. <br /> <br /> First of all, zombie women look like Victoria Secret models with dark eyeliner and pale face. What are zombies, but thoughtless, controversial intelligent, cannibalistic killing machines that they eat as a result of their most basic needs? These zombie women walk like streetwalkers and models of runways, they talk as if they were in a bad noir movie and they do not behave like real zombies. Sure, there is food and killing, but where is the carelessness and terrible disfigurement? Although it is a very interesting concept and perhaps a great satire on the zombie genre, it ridicules this genre and asks the question: "why can not zombies be beautiful machines to kill foxes?". I would say that this movie would be considered a really bad indie movie that was produced and made by garage junkies. I would not recommend this movie to anyone who loves zombies too much, it is insulting and frightening, not even.
