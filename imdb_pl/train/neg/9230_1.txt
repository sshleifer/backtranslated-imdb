I should qualify this title, now I think about it. The order is not completely worthless. I had the opportunity to see it twice, and the second time I had a great time because of the cost of the film. so I think it's worth something. and it is worth the sunset for the excruciating pain that caused me to first watch. as another reviewer has pointed out, this film is trumped in every sense of the word. not one original idea came to this film (which makes the comment below the originality of the premise completely surprising to me). the film is nothing but a long line of film that is connected and paraded as a film. it's definitely not the next Clerks, it's definitely not original, and it's absolutely not "good, pure fun". the film is an absolute agony for the uninitiated (after watching it for the first time, the second time can be quite funny, in an offensive way). when I was looking around the theater, it was obvious that almost everyone, maybe even older, was completely bored or hurt by this movie. during some particularly emotional scenes, such as the place where Nick chews his mother, the audience really flinched because it was so badly made. I even heard someone * groaning * in the theater, which I had never seen before. I do not care where you have the chance to see this movie, whether at a film festival or in an indie theater or anywhere. do yourself a favor, skip this video with a vengeance. unless you're like me and you can not resist the opportunity to see what really could be the worst movie ever made.
