A scary movie with Frank Sinatra as Tony Rome. Here he engages in a dead woman under the sea. <br /> <br /> Rome was soon hired to find out what happened to the woman. Of course, this is a woman under the sea. Her friend from the room, Laina Kazan, is soon finishing her life on the floor. <br /> <br /> An aging Richard Conte plays a policeman and friend of Rome. When the local club owner is killed, the wine falls on Rome and becomes an interesting pursuit scene. This is a bad picture, if you have to rely on the pursuit scene to deliver the action. <br /> <br /> Raquel Welch intrigues beauty around the neck. Her acting leads a lot to be desired. <br /> <br /> Martin Gabel is a retired hooligan whose son tries to outdo him. <br /> <br /> You do not know why the girl was murdered until the end of the movie. Do not even bother.
