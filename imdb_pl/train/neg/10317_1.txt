For this new season I was a big fan of the "Little Mosque". However, the new season completely ruined it. <br /> <br /> The new Christian vicar destroyed the intentions of the series. It was always about living together to overcome prejudices. The new vicar destroys this assumption and shows Christians in a very bad light. <br /> <br /> I am neither a Christian nor a Muslim, but I loved watching the show and seeing the camaraderie between Amar and the Reverend. Not any more. <br /> <br /> Just cancel and do it. It's not worth watching anymore. <br /> <br /> It may still be saved, but you have to change a lot. <br /> <br /> Restore the old format.
