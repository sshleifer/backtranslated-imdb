Alfred Hitchcok is not my favorite director, but imagine what he could do about it! The plot has a lot of potential to hang. John Garfield is almost always perfect, and Raymond Massey is frighteningly against the type. Nancy Coleman is not an impressive leading lady, but the supporting staff is large and very capable. <br /> <br /> Yes, it starts quite early. There are too many coincidences. An important topic is trivialized by the fact that it eventually becomes something more than a love story. <br /> <br /> It's great to watch Garfield, Massey and the character performers. But this is not terribly good.
