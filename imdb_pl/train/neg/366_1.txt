Bad Actors, bad filming, uncertain dialogue, shallow characters, but in the end it was a bad premise. Essentially, an eleven-year-old who is bullied because he has very little money receives a blank check. Of course, an eleven-year-old has enough technology and intelligence to buy a home, cash a check for $ 1,000,000, and even foil three clumsy idiots, reminiscent of three puppets. <br /> <br /> Preston Blake is an annoying, unbearable boy who decides that after writing a blank check by a stranger, he will use the situation as best he can. In other words, he goes to the bank, <br /> <br /> hands the cashier a check that he does in the printer and miraculously goes out with a million dollars in cash. Preston is also capable of achieving incredible speeds on his bike, because a man driving a Jaguar after Preston and his 10-speed speed can not catch him, even when Preston has jumped out of a series of cars. <br /> <br /> Of course, there must be a hot heroine with every adventure hokey movie. In this case, our hot heroine is the molesting child of an FBI agent who is dating an eleven-year-old Preston and promises another date when she turns 17. <br /> <br /> However, the absolute worst aspect of this movie was not his casting, nor his sloppy dialogue, such as: "The only other way I could think about skinning a cat is by slipping the snake in the butt and then raising the fur ". It was rather the fact that no one in the whole film realized that the FBI did not care about random people. I have not explained that Preston uses the "Macintosh" alias to mask himself as an entrepreneur. Of course, the FBI considers it intriguing and sends our young heroine after Preston, who uses his 11-year-old joke to scream first when the lobsters fall on his face and then treat it to burgers, ending with a funny piercing through the parched area, where jettison water from the ground. Our heroine does not realize, during this whole adventure, which an FBI criminal pursues, sliding and sliding just behind them when they go to the Preston limousine, together with a one-dimensional driver who never fails, offering cheap, third rate laughs, that the whole family can choke. <br /> <br /> Generally: 1/10 is incredibly gracious for this movie. I do not see it as it has only 4.4 / 10.
