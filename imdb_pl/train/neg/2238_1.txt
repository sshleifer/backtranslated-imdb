The quality of the video is terrible. The sound quality is pathetic. Acting is terrifying. Dialogue is painful. The lighting is bleak. Editing is funny. I can go on, but it would be pointless. Snitch'd is a tertiary amateur film transmitted as a feature film. This is best left to collect dust in the container for video deals.
