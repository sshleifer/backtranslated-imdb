Leave it to geniuses like Ventura Pons, a Spanish director, to persuade senior politicians in their country to subsidize this misguided movie. The sad state of the film industry in this country is the result of an attempt to make a film from such a thin material. Most of the photos taken in Spain fall into two categories: Spanish Civil War, which love to present the past, writers believe. Another type of video shows the viewer a lot of free sex, because "creators" have nothing to say. <br /> <br /> When the movie opens, we watch Pere's penis, who tries to cut him off and put him on one of the dishes at the party. Later, Sandra will show everything that was given to the public to admire. The story of the attractiveness of Pere for Sandra, a married woman who seems to be a happy wife, is false from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Our only interest in watching the film concentrates on an earlier, better-done photo of Mr. Pons, "Amic / Amat", but unfortunately, it has nothing to do with the mess for which we are punished in this undertaking. Regarding the comments made in IMDb, all negative voices come from Spanish viewers, which shows their origin!
