this movie really tries. if you're going to make a horror movie, at least give him a reason to believe in hooking the viewer. <br /> <br /> you wait and wait in the movie expecting a great explanation, but it is not. instead, he tries to be too clever and not reveal anything. <br /> <br /> what was the meaning of the movie? where does it actually go? And more importantly, what the hell was going on. . . <br /> <br /> Why were they there and how is something related? just another weak science-fiction horror. I love fake reviews on IMDb that say how great related press releases are to get a movie (either it or people have low horizons). it's not worth your 2 hours at all. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying that the movie is better than fragile, but at least it gave you reason and why things happened and it has a final result. it is not and only waffles with tons of padding to make everything terrifying. this film is as low as when a stranger rings. God was lame too. <br /> <br /> Tip if you're going to make a horror movie, make it credible with reasoning and explain to the viewer what's going on so that they have a catch in their history. because if there is no justification or credibility, then nothing stands in the way and can not be frightening. disrespect for the cast or crew because they did a good job. it's just a bad magazine.
