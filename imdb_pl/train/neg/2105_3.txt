Bela Lugosi as a terrifying mad scientist who uses orchids to invoke brides to steal the essence of life for an older wife. Dwarf in this movie is funny !! Many freaks, a lot of padding and no plot makes watching this movie a nightmare. I loved how in the end all songs merged in a typical Hollywood way. History never becomes interesting, and you feel helpless when you look. <br /> <br /> I would usually shoot boring movies like this one, but the dwarf only added so much horror and entertainment to get some points.
