I rented this movie based on the advantages of this trailer and of course Sir Anthony Hopkins. <br /> <br /> If Jackson Pollack joined forces with David Lynch and Timothy Leary to make a movie, that would end the result. I do not think I would see a movie that would make the LSD journey look like an episode of Sesame Street. <br /> <br /> This is a set of sets in which characters are flashing from reality, or different realities, and the movie does not end with anything until the last 5 minutes, where it suddenly makes sense. I wrote a virulent review on my blog with film reviews, which basically everything captures and I will not do it here. It's a well-played piece of cinema, and the soundtrack was written by Sir Anthony Hopkins, and let me say it, if there's one saving function in the movie, it's music. Fits perfectly. Some dialogs are unbelievably good and incredibly bad at the same time. <br /> <br /> I liked the part of the movie, I really did it, and when you get to the end, you'll actually find out what's really going on. It's unfortunate that you have to wade through two hours of madness to reach an important point that minimizes the effect of the entire movie. <br /> <br /> I give him 3 in 10 for the simple fact that the real problem with this movie is not acting, that's all.
