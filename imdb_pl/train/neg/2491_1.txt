Maiden Voyage is just that. I would like to say right away that I watched it for 5 minutes before I could stand it anymore. As has been said in another commentary, this movie does not get into the whole "so bad, that it's good", it's just bad. Acting is terrible, sfx is weak, and the story is bland and stupid. Even the extras suck, the "bag guards" and those seem to hold guns like water guns. <br /> <br /> Do not even bother watching this movie, the only thing that is unique is that no matter how low your expectations are, you will still be disappointed.
