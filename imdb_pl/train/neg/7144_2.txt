It was almost worth sitting in this whole awful "movie" just to know that I would never be able to experience something so bad. Acting - 0, scenario - 0, fighting scenes - 0, running men - 0 (cheddar bob for eight miles as a kind war hero who gets a girlfriend), Nadia Bjorlin - 10 (She is a great and not a scary actress). These are the criteria that I used to average to two. I lost my count, but I believe that the film stereotype always appears in this film. When a driver who allegedly killed her father marvelously comes to the end to race with her, out of nowhere has corrupted the previous statement. Plus it just appears for a reason. They have never even been mentioned before. I do not know what to say. Just watch it when it appears on TV in a few years. At least in this way, some of them will be edited for the purpose of advertising.
