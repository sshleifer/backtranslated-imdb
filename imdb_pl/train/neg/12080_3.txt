I'm a fan of Shakespeare and MST3K, so I was eagerly waiting for this episode. First, I will comment on the film, and then the MST3K episode. Recipe for this movie: take talented actors, rich and beautiful Shakespeare material and a budget of $ 1.25. Mix well, then dry all your life and movement until it becomes dull and lifeless. Serve cold in a large, regular stone pot. The movie, I give 3 out of 10, because the actors at least deserve a bit of credit. Okay, now the MST3K episode. I admit that the first time I saw it, I fell asleep halfway. I understand that this was also the reaction of several other veiwers. However, when I watched it a second time, I realized that there was a whole range of intelligent references and good lines that I missed the first time. The trick with this episode is: listen carefully! To catch each line, you need several views. Give him a second chance and you'll see what I mean. Episode MST3K: 7 1/2 out of 10.
