what is just below the surface? just a horrible movie is something. <br /> <br /> As other viewers rightly commented, storm sequences are simply ridiculous. to chop the already soaked firewood in heavy rain? he's smart now. threat? foreboding? sexual tension? for those who read boring and elaborate, boring and elaborate and boring and over-invented. <br /> <br /> I want to thank God for the shower scene, but in retrospect I think the filmmakers, seeing the finished mess, realized that they had to put something in, that it would be halfway worth it at all. so it just becomes another idea. do yourself a favor and let it pass.
