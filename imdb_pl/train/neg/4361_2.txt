The use of film material from the Planet of Dinosaurs is a video on video (with the exception of stolen material) concerns a group of people shot in space who land on the planet of dinosaurs, which ... do not wait for it, it's really land. His five-minute sketch extended to 90 minutes. Somewhat better than the Chickboxer (another of the Bad Movie Police series) - having a nostalgic home movie combined with good stolen effects, this movie is still an impossible to overcome slogan. I was left to think about the question: are we becoming so creative that we are now prowling old movies not only for the story, but also for the unmatched materials? Apparently, low-budget producers are becoming so desperate that they really will give us everything to take our money
