I am the owner of this movie. I bought it for $ 3.99 in a fairly large movie store to do research on an indie movie since I finished my own story and edited it. Now, when I feel weak as the first director and just sit with a plate of cookies and Severed In a few minutes I feel great !!! <br /> <br /> I hate to tell other filmmakers, so I will use constructive criticism 1. Find good actors. It really helps 2. When filming, light up your scenes and darken your computer later on post 3. Close-ups are better for video 4. When the actor enters the stage, wait a moment before <br /> <br /> telling them to say they knew what was going on and who says 5. Never show the back door when we wait for someone to open it. Damn worth 3.99 $ <br /> <br /> A real horror movie would get Severed reviews on IMDb and you have to give these guys credit ... they gave away.
