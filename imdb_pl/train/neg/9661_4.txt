I want to say that acting is bad, but I think that's what made it happen. I never thought about Highlander (the same director), but you could have blamed him for the 80s. <br /> <br /> This one, however, has no excuses. People are shot when they leave the trenches with the man in front of him !? Such errors, along with the unclear timeline, strange battle tactics, sub-cuts and weak visual effects, make it a sub-pairs movie over all. commented on all these American nonsense. The German general was practically frightened by his captured private American. Be prepared to swallow a lot, although in small doses. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, not a terrible, but definitely a smaller war movie in all aspects.
