"Jealousy" is bad for many reasons. Yes, there are characters you can not like. It's not a problem. The point is that they are unacceptable and we do not care about them at all. In "War of the Roses" characters appeared unlike each other, but thanks to appropriate introductions we began to be interested in at least their fate, while in "Envy" the introduction is thin, characters are never credible, and the plot only makes the situation worse. <br /> <br /> Ben Stiller is simply repulsive in his role and most of the time I am a fan of his work. Stiller ran a campaign to release it directly on video, and now I see why. The film suggests that he is Jack Black's "best friend", but from the first five minutes we get material that indicates Stiller hates Black. I thought it would turn into a one-sided relationship (la "The Cable Guy"), but it never is, instead Stiller insists he is his "best friend" and I felt lost when he seemed to treat Black like, well, "kupa" The plot of the film is ridiculous, but it does not matter, because it is supposed to be an exaggerated tale of morality. Unfortunately, the message is lost in the mess. Walken gives good results, but Black is obscene and annoying (and I usually find it very funny). No, this is not a terrible movie, but I still can not believe that Barry Levinson ("Rain Man", "Sleepers") is responsible for it - this is not one of the worst films of all time, but it can certainly be much better . I would like Va-Poo-Rize to exist - so that we can make this movie disappear forever ....
