MY EYES! IN THE NAME OF GOD AND EVERYTHING WHAT IS SACRED, I WILL BE BORN THIS FILM! on what drugs you are people! This could be the worst movie ever! I felt that I was on a bad acid trip all the time, I have to call the therapist to help me cope with the trauma of this epic catastrophe. From the beginning to the end, the fluorescent lines are an unholy masterpiece of satanic cinema. When I thought I would watch this movie with my best Jewish friend and his family, we thought "oh, hey, it can be fun! It will probably be bad, but still a bit funny ", how wrong we were. the movie can be. All my friends lined up for a lobotomy as soon as the movie ended, and during the movie one of my friends tried to hang himself by the belt while another tried to cut his wrists with a wooden spoon. I regret that instead of watching the movie from The Ring, pain and suffering will disappear in just seven short days. For all who want to see this movie, YOU ARE NOT PREPARED! You may think that you are a "hard guy" by renting it, but this movie will break you, push you to the ground and give you urine.
