... not to live in Montana, and especially not to live there at the end of the 19th century. <br /> <br /> "The river flows through it" is certainly a well-made film from the point of view of cinematography. Great scenery, working well in Redford. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the story is bad (if there is a story at all). <br /> <br /> I was sorry about the narrator / author who is as a dry, narrow character as his father, preacher. Being driven, not directing his own life, he remains to look at his brother, who is also locked in a cage in a small town environment, losing his life. The author never even approaches to disregard his brother's motivation, but at least he realizes that he lacks a bit of homour / fun. All that is is fly fishing, where he even follows as an old man in the style of his father. <br /> <br /> The end is not surprising, it can be predicted from the very beginning. <br /> <br /> Definitely NOT obligatory (3/10) <br /> <br />
