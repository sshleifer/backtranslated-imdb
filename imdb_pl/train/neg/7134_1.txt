So it happened. Fast, expensive cars that only the top 1% will ever pass. Girls who pose side by side in transmission warehouses. Actors of the second level and name. Cheap promotional performances of people from a niche culture. <br /> <br /> This is the trash that Hollywood has to offer. Do not get me wrong; I love mindless action with hot chicks just like the next guy. But please, does the collective Braintrust, which emphasizes this material, cease, counts to ten, breathes, has a hearty "Woooooosaaaaaah", and then scrolls twenty-five years and remembers what made movies one day enjoyed? In that case, make those movies again? <br /> <br /> I do not mind poker, but the whole explosion of pop culture that has been enjoyed for the last five years is ridiculous. Everyone and their mother are now thinking about their Maverick (not even half of them will get this reference). Some director said, "Hey, what demographics do you want to rinse $ 9.50?" "I know, sir. Rynek 18-35 ". "Ok, let's give them poker, girls and fast cars." "A brilliant idea, sir." Result? A movie that I saw hundreds of times late at night on Spike TV, and more often than Dolph Lundgren. <br /> <br /> Now do not get me wrong, I'm not a movie snob. Unusual artistic cinema, such as The English Patient, does not lift my boat, but generic movies that should not have even been recorded on DVD also bother me. Only growing gears will have lively engines and I imagine that those in the upper part of the IQ range will see what it is: a scrap yard.
