Everyone in this film seems to be channeling Woody Allen. They moan, stop and stutter even more. Only for REALLY die-hard DeNero fans! He tries to look artistically irritated and artistic - but it looks like he looks like a very, very low budget movie created by students. The most commonly used word in the whole movie is "noise." The film, however, creates the atmosphere of the late sixties / early seventies. If you like movies where people constantly talk to each other, terrible lighting (even when it comes to "art") and make you feel like you are sitting on a lousy political meeting, you might like it - but you have to really get bored. I found this record in the basket for dollars and now I know why.
