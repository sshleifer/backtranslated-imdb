I admit that the majority of the film was not inspired, but I still played. He has a wonderful sense of crazy energy, above-average music, and women in the film fiercely defend themselves, there are no prissies. I can think of dozens of other films that were much worse, at least this one had an intriguing theme along with social commentary. They refer to how the army deals with viral epidemics, destroy everything that you see, even if it means people you should be saving. How dangerous the martial law may be when at this point democracy ceases to exist. Fulci seemed to try to connect his earlier work (zombies, beyond, gates of hell), trying to somehow improve them. He failed, but certainly not pitifully, as many people would think. for zombie movies, so I admit I'm a bit biased when it comes to browsing. I'm just saying that this movie is good for a while, if there were not so many descents in creating this movie (fulci quit and bruno (I can break into the best of them) mattei took control) could have been much better and more focused. It will remain in my collection as the song fulci zombie swan. zombie scene 3, that this cemetery, which man really broke up, I could not believe it, check it, you will be surprised.
