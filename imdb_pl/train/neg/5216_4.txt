"Metamoprhis" is a story of a mad young scientist, venerated at a local college, subjected to investigation by financial institutions for the university. This forces him to cut corners in a typically bad Hollywood melodramatic style. <br /> <br /> My first thought after the end of this movie was this. "Not good, but not bad, from the beginning until the mid-eighties." Of course, I realized that it was produced in 1990, which almost led him to "4", but I decided to keep it in the average "5". <br /> <br /> "Metamorphis" does it on several occasions, it seems like a good movie desperately trying to get out. Acting, though not a star, is mostly competent. You can even see an occasional glow of modest quality. Stimulation is a big problem with the movie. After I thought I looked for ninety minutes, I realized that I was watching only an hour. Special effects are not stellar, but the director seems to be competent enough to overcome this weakness. <br /> <br /> The main character, a slightly charismatic man who seems to be trying to connect Tom Cruise and Christopher Reeves reminded me above all of Matt Dillon's character from "Wild Things". The heroine does a good job, but it does not stand out anyway. Here is the role of a "naughty girl", and the actress does what she can, but it does not seem like much. He is a child actor whose director can not decide if he is gloomy, happy or just weird. <br /> <br /> Stimulation, as I said, is the worst problem in this movie, until the final battle with the bad guy who will make the Power Ranger blush. It is bizarre and inexplicable, up to the last scene, which is supposed to be dramatic, but simply funny, saturated with every bad camera trick and abuse that can be compressed in about thirty seconds. <br /> <br /> A decent one-off watch "Mill Creek 50 Chilling Movie Pack". Nothing that will come back and nothing you can buy yourself.
