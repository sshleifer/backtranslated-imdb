It must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This film has nothing positive about it. Some of you really like this movie! I've seen a lot of Dracula films and I liked everyone I saw, but when I saw this movie, I said to myself, "What the hell is this?" What a stupid movie. Now Dracula becomes who he is because he is Judas. For those who do not know who Judas is, he betrayed Jesus Christ, and then he felt guilty that he had hanged himself. You must be kidding yourself. That's the stupidest reason I ever heard why Dracula became angry. Who asked for the reason anyway? What a piece of this movie. Whoever ever came up with this apologetic excuse for a movie should be beaten. Even Dracula is terrible. If you've ever seen this movie, you would not even think it was Dracula. Wow, Dracula 2000! Is this title to impress me? Do not waste time or money on this basket.
