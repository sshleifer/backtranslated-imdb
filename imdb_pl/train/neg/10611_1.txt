Potter's horrible action and flat plot with no tension what ever. And when it comes to feminist polemics, it's ridiculous. I saw this trash when it was first released and though I thought it boring, unbelievable, I'm glad I went to see. That's because I have an immediate answer to the question "what's the worst movie you've ever seen?" Plus, I have comfort knowing that every movie I see for the rest of my life will be better than a Tango Lesson. I must admit, however, that I was impressed by the way in which Potter wrote a script that would collect the maximum number of art board grants from around the world (as shown by the end credits). <br /> <br /> I only saw Orlando very recently and see how Potter drew the wrong conclusions from this movie. Just a few pleated costumes, a few hard glances to the camera led by a lady and a loose conspiracy to seduce the audience of the cinema. Why, then, would not she think that she could run away with the complacency of the Tango Lesson?
