Who was George C. Scott? George C. Scott was a famous actor. Virtually every movie he was in is better for him. Now George had absolutely nothing to do with this movie ... but he once said something that describes the movie for T. <br/> <br /> I do not recall his exact words, but he basically said that Great Writing can save bad performance, but great acting CAN NOT save bad writing. Never this little observation was more real than in "The All New Adventures of Laurel & Hardy: For Love or Mummy." <br /> <br /> The cast of two leads was absolutely perfect. Bronson Pinchot (Laurel) and Gailard Sartain (Hardy) not only look like a part but they do an extraordinarily good job imitating the real offer (manners and everything). This film should be a permanent testimony of their talents. That said, this movie falls flat on your face when it comes to (you guessed it) WRITING. <br /> <br /> In addition to the opening dialogue between Pinchot and Sartain (who was very "character") and a brief description of a taxi engaging gag, this movie is an absolute duty to sit down. <br /> <br /> PROBLEM # 1: Too much time and effort has gone into the story. <br /> <br /> I do not want to know why the mummy wants to kidnap a pretty Briton. I want to see Stan and Ollie (or at least their replacements). Too much time on the screen was devoted to explaining the plot or not too funny secondary characters mentioned in this story. <br /> <br /> However, even if this movie was a joke, we still ... <br /> <br /> ... PROBLEM # 2: I call most of the jokes a slapstick "diluted". <br /> <br /> What do I mean by "watered down"? <br /> <br /> In the slapstick, the character gets hurt exaggeratedly for the comedic effect (ala Looney Tunes, 3 Stooges ... or maybe laurel and hardy?). <br /> <br /> In the "diluted" slapstick (as I described it) the character becomes slightly wounded or inconvenient, and the filmmakers play it in a comedy effect. <br /> <br /> Maybe the illustration will help: <br /> <br /> In Looney Tunes, Daffy Duck is shot by Elmer Fudd. His bill falls and he puts it back. It's a classic slapstick. <br /> <br /> In this "jewel" Ollie accidentally falls on some people. They turn around, tell him to be careful and continue his happy path. This is not a slapstick. It's not even fun. It's just ... boring ... and this movie is full of such jokes. It's like the bread and butter of this movie. Writers and directors just take these boring moments and behave as if they were to be fun. I admit that the example I just gave is the most extreme case, but I can only reduce it. <br /> <br /> In short: the movie simply does not work because the script does not use Captain Pinchot and Sartain's ability to impersonate Stan and Ollie. Instead, the script uses a storyline and bad jokes. Watching this movie basically involves watching two great podówwających who were not given real material for work. <br /> <br /> This is not a good movie, but an amazing sleeping aid. <br /> <br /> I'm saying give this one miss and stick to the real offer (as long as you miss "Atoll K" and "Be Big").
