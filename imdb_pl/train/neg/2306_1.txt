I wonder what people saw in him who gave it to 10 and what not. This movie has a VERY hard time after and / or remain on the story. If someone tells you that it's a comedy, do not be fooled, it's about 98% of the strange drama and 2% of the comedy. All actors pay attention to a great performance that can not be denied, but it seems that something has really lost somewhere. I do not know if the original script was good and had to be edited down or what. It had potential, and instead it was really a flop. I would really like to spend an hour and a half that I've invested in this movie, but the movie rental site does not pay back on time. Save money and see something else.
