As I suspect, as the viewer reacts to this new "adaptation" of Shirley Jackson's book, which was promoted as NOT being a remake of the original 1963 film (Which is true), it will be based on: those who were big fans or a book or the original movie do not intend to think too much about it ... and those who have never been exposed to any of them, and who are big fans of the current trend in Hollywood towards "special effects" being the first and last word in how " good 'the movie is, love it. <br /> <br /> Things that I did not like about this adaptation: <br /> <br /> 1. It was not a real adaptation of the book. From the articles I read, this movie was supposed to cover other aspects of the book that the first never reached. And, what seemed reasonable, no film can cover the book with a word, unless it is the length of STOJAKA! (And even then) But in this movie there were things that were never mentioned or even suggested in the movie. He reminded me of the way they decided to kill a black man in the original version of the film GLORING. I did not like it either. What SHOULD you say in the film press is ... "We got a basic, very basic idea from the book by Shirley Jackson, we kept the same house names and some (though not all) names of the main characters, but then we decided to write our own story and, hell, we watched THE CHANGELING and THE SHINING and GHOST first, and decided to throw some of them. <br /> <br /> 2. They completely lost the motif of a parapyschologist inviting a carefully selected guest who in the past searched the paranormal to examine a home that really seemed to be "bad born". No, instead, this "doctor" led everyone home under the false pretext of studying their "insomnia" (he really invited them there to scare them to death and then they saw how they reacted to their fear ... like lab rats, about which he mentioned he was never told that they are part of an experiment ... a nice guy). Incidentally, this doctor, who did not have the same name, was just as different from the devoted professional of the original movie as the night of day. <br /> <br /> 3. In contrast to the statement that was used to promote both films "some homes are just badly born", this house was not born badly, but it became bad because of what was there it happened ... and this time Nel is breaking the secret (shades of CHANGES). The only problem was that the so-called mystery was so incoherently told that I'm sure that it remained a secret to most recipients ... but then there was no secret in the first place (not in the book) because the house was bad, START. This is the first "victim" who died before she saw her. <br /> <br /> 4. The way in which Luke's character was introduced was absolutely ridiculous. He was supposed to be a playboy who once inherited the house (and he was a real skeptic of his "history") ... in this he was just a guilty, loud fool who could not sleep (I remember insomnia) and was a compulsive liar. <br /> <br /> 5. I was also irritated by how the movie jumped from the attempt to recreate the original scenes word for word (a scene with the family of Nela's sister, and a speech opening Mrs. Dudley ...) to embark on a fancy flight, which made me think more of these other films than THE HAUNTING. It's like he can not decide what he wants to do. <br /> <br /> 6. I missed the narration of Nell throughout the movie. The original was like a gothic novel in such a way that the story was told mainly in the first person, in the eyes of Nell, and we were always privy to her thoughts. This completely unique touch has been completely lost in the new version. They also tried to make Nell much more heroic. The original Nell was not a bad person, but she was a bitter person (could she be different after dedicating 11 years of her selfish life to an elderly and malicious sister?) And she liked to moan and she lost her temper. .. This one was almost too good to be true. It was never more visible than at the climax of the movie, in which the writer apparently watched GHOST too many times. <br /> <br /> 7. They have changed the history of the house and its inhabitants too much. There was no Abigail Crain (daughter of Hugo, whose legend loomed in large original versions), there was no "companion" and there was no nursery. There was also "Grace" (wife of the original doctor), and Hugh Craine's wife died in completely different ways. These changes have changed the WAY story too much. I do not know if the producers of this movie should be happy that Shirley Jackson is not walking this earth anymore or should they ... BE SORRY (if you get my drift !!! Hauntings, which she could imagine, are not something to be underestimated with !!!). <br /> <br /> In conclusion, let me leave you a few words from the original Luke (appropriate replacement of the word "house" for "movie"!): "This" movie "should be burnt to the ground, and the earth sprinkle sole! "My favorite movie of all time remains so. No competition from this.
