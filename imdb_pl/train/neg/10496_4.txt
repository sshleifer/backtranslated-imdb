Gday Mates! I just watched the Croc Hunter movie. it was fine, but the performance seems more real. it seemed to be a longer episode of AnimalPlanet with more fun lines and more characters. A few things: Steve described the snakes Fangs like hypodermic needles. yeeeowch! for realities it hurts. and can not jump high? he catches everything by the tail and stuff. In this movie there were two MAIN shots of fission. When Terry discovers that this is a child joey, he says, "We must cultivate them, just like a child." Woah! I thought she would walk and breastfeed this child. it would, however, make him PG-13. Whether on Terry, someone noticed a film and many Terry shows about ritual mating. she knows her sexual things. the film takes place in Queensland, Austrailia. I want koala, dingo and joey! <br /> <br /> Steve Sui's dog really has a purpose in this movie. though small, which turns out to be useless in relation to the hottie wielding dynamite. <br /> <br /> Oh, and if someone else looks at it, try to agree with me, saying that the domestic, fat lady with the pack of dogs was in shooting the crocodile. he ate her sheep !! I would be angry too!
