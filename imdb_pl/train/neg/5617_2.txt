This documentary is based on incomplete considerations about evidence in which Brian Flemming, perhaps deliberately, does not mention important evidence against him. Perhaps his most important mistake is one of the earliest: his claims about the voidness of Paul's testimony of Jesus Christ disregard key facts such as: ** The existence of certain formulated confessions in Paul's letters. These denominations suggest that most of the central claims about Jesus have already been formulated in the expression of faith, probably within a few years of the death and resurrection of Christ. ** The testimonies of the first Christians can not simply be expelled as mere fantasy. During this period, indeed, many people claimed to be the Messiah, but only ONE remained: Jesus. Why? Because it would be ridiculous if anyone would believe that Christ is the messiah and die for these beliefs if he knew he was not resurrected. ** Even if the Gospels are dated more liberally, we are still talking about the accounts of Jesus written during the lives of other eyewitnesses that would point to inaccuracies in these Gospels. There is evidence that the Gospels were written much earlier. <br /> <br /> What I am saying is that Flemming's documentary is an incredibly biased and selfish work that collects various arguments and evidence to serve its anti-Christian view. Do not be fooled by bad investigations.
