Opening scenes move smoothly like a frozen velveeta. Trying a dramatic dialogue just makes me want to have better control over fast forward control. Vampires are usually portrayed as sexy and intelligent or disgusting creatures. This vampire tries to seduce his victim by imitating a lost puppy. I usually count the bodies, so there was a cat (who does not count) a hobo, a girl who fell from the sky with a sword in it (whatever it was), and then the plot. Foley artists are respected for using celery to create the sounds of a broken arm, but using the sound of biting an apple for a vampire biting a victim is simply stupid. I liked Warlock, but this movie just stank so much that we turned it off, and it was so forgetting that we rented it a year later just to turn it off.
