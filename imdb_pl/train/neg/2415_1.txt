... you know the rest. If you want a good zombie movie, DO NOT DO THIS FILM. If you want to look at a documentary about "life with a hood", you're in the wrong place. If you're looking for a funny piece of film, it's a real winner! Acting is flat like a sheet of paper. The best example of this is definitely an officer examining the passage. I can say that he made a voice for the 911 operator and a flat tone of his voice. If I could hear a cardboard conversation, it would probably sound like this guy. Oh, yeah, and the "zombies" did their best snake impression, which is in line with their overall performance FANTASTIC (note sarcasm ... HOW THE WINNER WAS NOT WINS FOR THE BEST MAKE-UP) Quiroz ...... do not do any kind of targeting. I felt like I was watching an improvised piece from the era (the period is more like LA from the 90's). The direction is, however, strengthened by the worst-case scenario, which I think may ever reward the film. I have not heard such beautiful lines as the one-word epic beginning of the film "F ** k!", From Ice Grill, which was another "urban" thriller. This, of course, only works in conjunction with the epic hip-hop soundtrack! All 3 or more songs! All in all, what the hell you expected from the movie "Hood of the Living Dead"? I rented this movie with the intention to laugh at each of his scenes, and the boy provided and MORE! I definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to meet a group of boys and laugh at a low-budget horror movie (yes, yes ...) for the night. An unforgettable experience for sure!
