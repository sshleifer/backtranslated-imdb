Generally, I do not worry too much about violence in films or a huge amount of philosophy, symbolism or psychology. All this is very good for me, and the film brings us many of the above. There are beautiful pictures, especially lakes and nature, good surroundings, good directions. This film can be voted as a good movie. However, it is broken for two reasons and both reasons therefore make this movie simply disgusting. <br /> <br /> First of all, there is violence against living creatures to make this film. Not film violence, I am talking about REAL violence. This violence alone can be justified, if not, and that is the reason number two; the message of the film was not a simple introspection about the twisted relationship of directors towards women. Not that everyone had real turns with women (men, respectively). But the end of the movie ruins everything. <br /> <br /> * spoiler * Our "heroine" finally dies (here my own, if I remember correctly, I saw this movie years ago and it made me mad, now the guy is with a new movie, which I'm certainly will not be watch) and is now more clearly portrayed as some kind of natural demon, nature growing above her, especially her sex. Of course, the director "kills" a woman-heroine. Women must die, especially if men are attracted to their sexuality. This seems to be the final conclusion. ** Final Spoiler * <br /> <br /> Well, everything would be fine for me if the director kept his view of himself. But the use of large images, artistic directions of cruelty towards living creatures, simply saying that men can be afraid of women, and men are cruel towards women. It's not enough. I knew that when I saw this film, they achieved good critics of "philosophical, eastern and artistic" and regardless of the approach. But for me this movie is just totally distorted.
