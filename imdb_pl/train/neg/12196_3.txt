The actors did a really good job playing their roles - especially mom. However, as the film progressed, I discovered that I was watching it more because of their playing, not because I cared about people. Sometimes I felt irritated by an irresponsible and thoughtless approach to parenthood. Daughter is a 17-year-old shallow skank whose main ambition is to sprinkle famous men and become a dancing nepple (with lots of "shaking booty"). Son is a guy with a low self-esteem who seems very desperate in relationship and friends - so much so that he throws a drug party late in the movie. Husband and wife are bored, but instead of putting energy into their bad relationship, they are looking for new partners (although the wife chooses poorly, as happens with the man she "throws"). I just felt that ALL characters had to grow up and it was hard to care for such shallow tugs. I think that the author's attempt was to demonstrate the total banality and emptiness of the capitalist system. However, given that these characters are NOT typical of the average Western family, this seems insincere.
