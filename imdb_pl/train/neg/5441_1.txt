Of all the movies I've seen, this "The Rage" must be one of the worst. Direction, logic, continuity, changes in the storyline and dialogue made me scream in pain. "How EVERYONE could think of something so bad"? Gary Busey is known for his "B" movies, but this is a certain "W" movie. (W = waste). <br /> <br /> Take, for example: about two dozen FBI officers and local lawyers surround the trailer house with a wagone jeep. Inside the Jeep is MA and is "confused" why all the cops are around. In a few seconds, there is a great battle with the weapon, which is killed immediately. The cops jump back in the Jeep, and the gars and companies repulse them. The policemen fall like dominoes, and the jeep with Gary rides in a circle and is not hit by one ball / ball. MA is killed, and Gary does not seem to notice - damn, this guy is tough. It's really a miracle, since the six-time shooter held 300 balls, there was such a miracle.
