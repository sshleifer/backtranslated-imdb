What a bad movie. I'm really surprised that DeNiro, and even Snipes, will be associated with something like that. If you're going to make a movie that includes baseball and shows scenes from baseball, at least make the action look realistic. Why did the crowd always get up for a reason during the game? *** POSSIBLE SPOILER *** And the last scene in the movie ... what was it? Somehow, we have led to the belief that DeNiro was on the pitch in the referee's uniform, and the game takes place even in a torrential downpour ... one of the worst scenes in a sports movie. 3 stars out of 10.
