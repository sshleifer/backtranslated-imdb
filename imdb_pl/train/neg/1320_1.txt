This movie was exactly what I expected when I read the casting for the first time. Probably I could write a more exciting story, it's a shame they left her a packet of howling monkeys. Alberto Tomba was certainly a good skier, but he must thank God (and we too) that he does not have to rely on the actor's skills to earn a living. He can not play, can not talk, can not even move very well on the continent without ski ... Michelle Hunziker is a beautiful blonde and that's all. Apparently she was not chosen because of her amazing skills in dramatic roles, but probably for her pretty legs. Nevertheless, I must admit that she could be an acting teacher of Tomby, because she is even a worse actor than she is, and it's funny, especially considering she is not Italian. I was laughing all the time watching this movie. I found it so absurd and meaningless that it really made me laugh, loud, very loud.
