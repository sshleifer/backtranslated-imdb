I watched the movie because I like Nicolas Cage, and well, I found it strange and completely useless ... so I decided to interrupt and get a copy of it from the 70's. Wow. what a difference. The original was much better. I want you all to know that it really made a statement that its existence had a purpose. It was really the Christian audience who expressed their fear of paganism. If you go deeper into it, it also comments on life, but I do not want to delve into details, simply saying, if you were disappointed and would like to know what it should look like, feel free to watch the version from the 70s, a bit outdated, but much better .
