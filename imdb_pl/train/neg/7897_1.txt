This movie was made for people who thought Gremlin was too serious and Critters hardcore. As in many films from the 80's / creature / trolls / gremlins, this movie is bad. The sad thing is that there is no line for this comment. It's just bad and not in a fun way. <br /> <br /> The problem with this miniature monster movie is that it actually tries to be funny and ends up being successful in how Howie Mandell was in Walk Like A Man. What made other horror movies from the 1980s a classics was that they really tried to be frightening, but they were fun because they failed so miserably. Someone had to tell Bettina Hirsch (yes Bettina Hirsch) that she had a talent for comedy before she began directing this film. Unfortunately, they were wrong. <br /> <br /> Seeing a strange, small, mutated cross of a ferret and a tumor in a brown trench coat and throwing balls at the outcast from Lost Boys is fun, but not enough to save a movie. <br /> <br /> By far the most annoying part of the movie is Paul. His Paul Reiser wants to be schtick enough to start scrolling fast from the first scene to the final credits, stopping only once to see the scene in which munchie throws the ball at the guy ... not that I would do it. br /> <br /> So the bottom line is running, do not go to the nearest Blanka and shake the manager's hand and thank him for the fact that there are no grapes that would sprinkle this pile of trash on the shelves.
