I'm glad that some people liked it, but I hated the movie. He had a very good idea for the story, but it ended there. It was badly written, badly preserved and poorly done. <br /> <br /> He had some interesting plot points, but they were just jumped too fast, the writers had to realize what to keep and develop on those bits, I like to lie, why she was kidnapped, and quit slag. Instead of "what's going on?" 5 seconds later they tell you. <br /> <br /> This movie did not have any tension, and I was bored from beginning to end. I just wanted it to end. <br /> <br /> Go and rent misery, or the best planned plans, if you want tensions or twists, which they guess until the end.
