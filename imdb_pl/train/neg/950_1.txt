I caught this movie on AZN on the cable. It sounded like a good movie, the Japanese "green card". I can not say that I never liked the Asian movie, quite the opposite. Some of the most amazing horrors of all time are Japanese and Korean, and I'm a huge fan of Hong Kong movies by John Woo. I am not against light-hearted films such as Tampopo or Chung King Express (two of my favorites), so I thought I would like it. Well, I'd rather cut my wrists and drink my own blood than watch this tedious, badly played movie. <br /> <br /> I think that director Steven Okazaki had to put Quaalude in the water because no one had a personality. And when any of the characters tried to act, unlike mumbling a line or two, their performance turned out to be forced and incredibly false. Honestly, I did not think anyone had ever played before ... The only person who sounded authentic was Brenda Aoki. It's amazing that it is promoted as a comedy because I have not even laughed at once. Even more surprising is that morning messages from CBS call it "a refreshing breath of comedy." It was neither a refreshing nor a breath of comedy. And the ending was very predictable, the previous reviewer had to be an idiot to think about such things. <br /> <br /> AVOID this movie, unless you want to see a boring, predictable storyline and a wooden acting act. I think "Spike of Bensonhurst" is a movie with a better form than this ... and I came out in the middle of this movie!
