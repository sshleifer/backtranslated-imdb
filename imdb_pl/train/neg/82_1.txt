This movie sucked. It really was a waste of my life. Acting was terrible, the plot was completely unbelievable. In short, these people "terrorize" this pathetic "crazy killer", but they can not fight in any way. And that's after they take the raft on a camping trip, without the equipment, and they will appear on the campsite, which is already assembled and completely stocked with the food, clothes and headphones of the daughters. In addition, after their boat is lost, they panic that they are stuck in the woods, but then the boy with daughters just appears and they never seem to think that they could just leave the forest, just like he did to reach them . As I said, this movie sucks. A complete joke. Do not let your girlfriend guide you to watch.
