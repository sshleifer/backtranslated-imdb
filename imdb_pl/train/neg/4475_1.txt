awful, just awful! my old friend from the room used to watch this rubbish and drive me crazy. the book is one of my favorites and it's a pity that some people will never know how it really is because their first impressions come from dribbling in this way. they have changed so much that it is difficult to recognize them. which surprises me because the book reads like a soap opera anyway, providing enough feed for modern entertainment. it's like one of those Lifetime movies that say "based on real history," but they're completely fictional. there is no emotion or depth of the book, just a thoughtless melodrama. If you're a high school student looking for a way to get out of reading, I suggest trying a different version.
