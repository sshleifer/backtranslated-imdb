I rented this movie because I was hoping it would be one of the movies for the whole family. Although the film is family-friendly, my family did not enjoy it because it gives a false image of God. If you obey God and follow Him, you have no guarantee of success. Your football team will not always win. You will not get better grades in a magical way. Infertility is not always cured. You will not always get a raise. Sometimes you get stuck in an old car. <br /> <br /> God does not exist to fulfill all our whims. Rather, we were created to praise him. Sometimes we worship Him the most when it seems to us that things are going wrong. Live is Christ; to die is profit.
