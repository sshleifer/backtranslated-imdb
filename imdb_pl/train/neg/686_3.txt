In his first scenario, based on his own short story, "Turn About", William Faulkner presents a bizarre story of loyalty, dedication and truly strange relationships. The plot originally only concerned the characters Tone, Young and Cooper, but MGM had to put Joan Crawford on a different photo to fill the contract, and Faulkner committed to creating a female role. Crawford insisted that her lines were written in the same cut-off style as her "Young and Tone" stars, which lead to unintentional merriment, because these three communicate in a telegraphic short, which sounds like a sketch by Monty Python ("Wichrowe hill" performed in the semaphore). Seriously, almost completely nameless sentences, make Ernest Hemingway read like Henry James. <br /> <br /> The film also reflects some of Faulkner's well-known themes, with an almost unnaturally close relationship between brother and sister (as you can find in his "Sanctuary" and elsewhere). When Young offers Crawford, in the presence of Tone, instead of an engagement ring, ALL THREE exchange their engraved childhood rings with each other. The proximity of Tone and Young is also noticeable, especially as they go to the fate of Thelma and Louise. Honestly, it's terrifying. <br /> <br /> This is not as scary for this New Yorker as the recurring theme of the massive Wellington cockroach, which Crawford happily catches (and which is shown on her hands - I had to turn away!), and Young turns in a gladiator. Blech. <br /> <br /> Having in mind the above, there are some good performances. Young is particularly involved in the scene in which he deals with Cooper's fighter aircraft, and Roscoe Karns is as delightful as Cooper's flying colleague. The tone, despite the inability to express itself through a realistic dialogue, has a nice moment, rejecting its furtive tears over the fate of his buddy Young. Crawford, also devoid of meaningful dialogue, mostly performs as a wooden or melodramatic one, which is quite balanced for one role. <br /> <br /> Battle scenes - no wonder how for Haward's movie - is the most exciting part of the whole picture. But not enough. As for me, 75 minutes of my life I will never come back.
