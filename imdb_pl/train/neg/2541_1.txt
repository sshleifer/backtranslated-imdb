I've never seen the original movie in the series ... I just hope it was a much better movie than the one or the sequel of the 80s, as if it was not like the two horrible sequels were even justified. This movie had a really good advantage when they advertised it to be shown on one of those old, independent stations that now belong to the past. In any case, it looked like it would be a pretty good movie. But it was a movie that would make some of Walt Disney's films look dark. Really, this movie was just a piece of light fluff, practically without any visible swampy monster. The only real observation is near the end, when you see its shape during a very heavy downpour, except that there is practically no sign of creation that was really disappointing as a child. The story is that the old hunters must kill everything they see and follow a swampy creature from the stream, and the children are outside to help him, or just a random hairy guy in the woods who likes to pull random boats through the water . I really do not want to watch, but I would like to see the original, which assured the creator that he will also be a bad boggy creature of the 80s, but he also made a very good slass movie in the '70s. The Town the Dreaded Sundown.
