The only way in which this is a family drama is to explain everything wrong to his parents with his message. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: they feed a deer for a year and then kill him for eating after killing his mother and in the beginning urging him to take responsibility for his actions. They blame the bears and deer for "bad behavior" while eating, while they do not take responsibility for the use of appropriate locks and fences, and even learn to shoot instead of double-mutilating the animals and letting them stay.
