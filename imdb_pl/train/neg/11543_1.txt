Although I use this site quite often to see how others judge what I find difficult or just nice movies, after watching this "movie" in the fourth movie yesterday evening I felt compelled to write something, even if it only helps me clean up again. <br /> <br /> The movie was probably the toughest experience I've ever had - the main characters played by Danny Dyer (23? Are you sure?) and Gillian Anderson (who will always be Scully as Leonard Nimoy will always be Spock) did not have about them, no real content - I'm not sure if the first half hour of the movie did not make the final cut, but certainly in the movie of revenge you would like to have some empathy with the victims ... here I did not care. In fact, the only character I cared about was a dog whose deer was approaching the second. And both animals behaved like Dire (sic) and Scully, who were sincerely horrible. I believe that although you are as good as the script you received, I would like to warmly thank the writers, producers, director and the whole cast for wasting 90 minutes of my life and some perfect electricity.
