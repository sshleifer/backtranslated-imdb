What a long, drawn-out, meaningless movie. I'm sure historically this movie is delightful, but when it comes to entertainment, it just does not make an assessment. Ralph Fiennes played in fantastic movies, English Patient, Schindler's List, but this was such a disappointment. It seemed that he was not going anywhere, his figure at the beginning was so shallow and tense that it amazes me that his "sister" would ever be interested. Do not hesitate to pay for renting this movie, instead buy yourself a copy of the English patient.
