When I went and saw this movie, I had great expectations. But I was wrong. This movie was just like any other horror movie. It's a virus, zombie etc. Exactly like Resident Evil and many, many other movies. But the difference with this and other movies is that history is very week. They are bad actors and boring music. The picture is fine, but the rest is complete. Do not watch this "horror movie", watch Ring 2 or any other movie that is more of a story. I hope they will stop making horror movies that have a virus and the virus spread and make people become zombies. We've seen enough of this. The only good thing about the movie is that they are standing on the roof and shooting at the famous, infected stars.
