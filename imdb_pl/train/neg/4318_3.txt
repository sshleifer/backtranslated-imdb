I thought it was one of the most depressing holiday films I've ever seen - the other ones are WIFI IN AGE and JACK FROST. All three films are about death. If LIKE is deeply depressed, watch this movie or other. In this film, acting is good, and some of the scenery (except dying people) is beautiful. But I'm afraid that a person with clinical depression can accidentally see a movie and do it alone! Despite the ending "happily and eternally", the main part of this movie is one terrible disaster following the other. And, for some crazy reason, I DO NOT WANT to BE EXPRESSED when I watch a Christmas movie (I know it sounds crazy - after all, it's not a sight and a feeling of unhappiness, what's the holiday going on at all?
