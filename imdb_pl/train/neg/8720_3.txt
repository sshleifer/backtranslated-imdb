Put aside the repetition of Dr. House, which I missed, and Desperate Housewives (new) to watch this. I do not know exactly what was plaguing this movie. I never thought I would say it, but I want my 15 minutes of fame. <br /> <br /> Script, director, I can not say. I recognized the stable of actors (ordinary suspects), but I thought that Herbert Marshall was an addition to the class and sat on a good, bad move. Boy, I was wrong. Dullsville. <br /> <br /> My favorite parts: where the "office girl" makes the 029 key press and inserts the card into the 087 sorter. LOL @ "computer". I would like someone to identify the next device - 477? It is before the time of this dinosaur. <br /> <br /> And we, dinosaurs, do not have much time to lose.
