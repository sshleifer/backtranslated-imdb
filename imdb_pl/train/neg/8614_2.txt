I must admit I have never been a fan of Rodney Dangerfield. Indeed, he has "no respect" from me. I just watched it because my wife wanted to see it and found exactly what I was expecting: a stupid story without real humor. It is full of bad, primitive jokes and a completely absurd plot that revolves around a developer (Dangerfield) who plans to build a ski resort in Utah that has not attracted my attention at all. <br /> <br /> In addition to Dangerfield, there was a poor cast in the film, including Andrew Dice Clay and completely on the hill John Byner (I did not even know he was still around until I saw his name in the subtitles for that.) <br /> <br /> This is really a disaster at Dangerfield. <br /> <br /> 2/10
