The novelty of the purely cut four-letter words of Jay Leno is the only unforgettable aspect of this formal mismatched whim of the police-partner. In COLLISION COURSE, the comedian with the face of pelicans meets with the late Pat Morita, to track down the stolen prototype of the turbocharger (I think the car enthusiast Leno played in this action?). Both lead really, but Leno is not an actor, and the routine of Morita in fish from the water ages in a hurry. The film carries a bit of poor attractiveness from the 80's, but its valuable moments are becoming rarer because they fill over 100-minute working time. Fans of Leno's great comedy talent will feel disappointed; everyone else will be bored.
