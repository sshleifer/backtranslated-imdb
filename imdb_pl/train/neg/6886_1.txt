John Heder was absolutely terrifying in this movie. I felt like I was watching a bad boy from college for the first time in a student movie. Anna Farris was decent on the course, not very good but not terrible (plus she is adorable). Dianne Keaton should know better. Jeff Daniels was the only surviving grace in this movie (though he was also a weak judgment on his part). <br /> <br /> In total, I would avoid it at all costs. I'm glad I did not pay to see it! <br /> <br /> John Heder will forever get stuck in the typical role of "dorky kid", unless he does SERIOUS work on chops.
