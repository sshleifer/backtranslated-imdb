RATING STAR: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> Ray (Ray Winstone) has a criminal past, had problems with alcohol and now he creates a drug habit that makes him paranoid and vulnerable to domestic violence to his wife Valerie (Kathy Burke), who tries to keep her family together but ends up more like a doormat. Meanwhile, her mother Janet (Laila Morse) is aware of Ray's son, Billy (Charlie Creed-Miles) and his growing drug habit, who sends him off the rails. The film follows those desperate characters who struggle with their lives. <br /> <br /> It is said that the British like to be unhappy, and it would include watching movies that entertain them so much. Films like Nil by Mouth emphasize this. It is a story of a broken family torn apart by crime, poverty, alcohol and drugs, such as Jeremy Kyle would have baked like a three-course meal. It is also a story of self-destructive people, three generations apart, each copying the other, tearing the family apart, and women trying to keep it together, even though they are not strong enough. If you choose a bit of what is off-screen, you can see that it does not promise to be happy watching from the beginning and it certainly does not disappoint in it. <br /> <br /> It is true what everyone said about performances, and the leading stars, Winstone and Burke, provide great actors. We see Winstone losing her with his wife, beating her senselessly after the coke paranoia, falling apart during a telephone conversation with her and unleashing the typical arsenal of words f and c when he refuses to let him see his child. Similarly, at a private moment, we see Burke deftly mastering the stairs, the full impact of the night before it starts. <br /> <br /> This is another of those movies in which there is no "plot" to follow, as such, simply the real life of these hopeless lives lasting day by day. It has been appreciated by many (including Baftami!), But for me it was just too gloomy and gloomy. I have no right to criticize it, knowing what I know about it from the off-set, but unfortunately I found it that way. **
