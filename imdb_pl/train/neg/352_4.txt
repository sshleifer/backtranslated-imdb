It seems that the cast should provide at least an average movie. And so I sat down for 102 minutes of disbelief. Aside from Ed Harris, no one seems to have the skill of acting. Even Sean Connery, whom I usually worship, had to have a day off during the entire filming of Just Case. Not once during the entire movie, one actor could convince me. <br /> <br /> It made this movie look cheap and unreal. <br /> <br /> This story is a bit complementary. This is exciting, and the plot is unexpected. <br /> <br /> Applications only watch this video if you really have nothing more to do.
