As a real fan of Elvis, this movie is a total shame, and the script is a disaster. The film opens with a beautiful son, Stay Away, and the scenery of the Grand Canyon gives the viewer hope for something special. Elvis appears in the picture, and his talent is wasted for a long time, especially for the rest of the presented pieces. Twice I was in this movie to make sure it was a piece of rubbish! 1 in 10 !!!
