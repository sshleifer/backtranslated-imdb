I sat for almost one episode of this series and could not take it anymore. It seemed to me that I had already watched dozens of episodes, and then it struck me ..... There is nothing new here! I heard this joke about Seinfeld, I saw someone fall on friends, the Happy Days episode had almost the same story, etc. None of the actors is interesting either! Some of them were good at other exhibitions (not here), and others are new in the profession in which they should never enter. Avoid this smelly!
