Every year I watch hundreds of movies, including many low-budget amateur abominations on DVDs that no one in his right mind would ever want to see. I have seen thousands of films in my time, many perfect, many forgetful. Zombie Nation Remember forever as one of the most hopelessly funny horror movies I've ever seen? in fact, I still have not recovered from the experience of watching him. <br /> <br /> The next day it seems to be a strange dream. Did I really see what I thought I saw? Why does the police work in the warehouse? Do voodoo priestesses really recommend that "zombies" eat cheeseburgers? Is it safe? Is it safe? Is it safe? <br /> <br /> I would not recommend Zombie Nation if you want to see a "good" movie, and I would not recommend it "as bad as well". However, if you enjoy the prospect of watching probably the most unbridled movie in history? this is for you. Now, when someone asks me what the worst movie I've ever seen, I will say Zombie Nation. <br /> <br /> Seriously? I think that committing a boring movie is a greater crime than a bad one, and Ulli Lommel deserves credit for producing a movie that stuns its ineptitude. He really is Ed Wood Jr. from the digital age, and I, on the one hand, can not wait to make the next movie as funny as this one.
