I support the films that fill the thematic gaps in the world cinema. So after watching the trailer "Water Lilies" I expected that this movie will appeal, because I thought that I came across something special: a movie that honestly depicts teenage lesbian love - a kind of female version of "Beautiful Thing". <br /> <br /> The main characters are young French women aged 15. Marie is slim, reserved and pretty in a grave style; Floriane is sociable, athletic and beautiful; And Anne is loyal, plump and immature in her behavior. In this video, the erotic ties between Marie and Floriane are always boiling, if not on the surface, just below. <br /> <br /> "Water Lilies", however, it is not about dawn of lesbian love for two teenagers; it's about sexual frustration, suffering, boredom, teenagers working in the cells and - in at least two cases - joyful, mechanical sex. This also demonstrates that screenwriters and filmmakers create their own creations when they become too manipulative. <br /> <br /> In additional features on the album "Lord of the Flies", director Peter Brook says: "French cynicism begins with the excitement of sex", which means that the French see children as angels, while they perceive youth and adults with all-embracing cynicism. Part of the fall of the film is director Celine Sciamma, who swallowed a powerful dose of this cynicism. <br /> <br /> "Where's the joy?" I asked myself while watching this movie. Yes, the first love can be painful and frustrating, but it can also be joyful and triumphantly erotic in a fresh, life-affirming way. These positive aspects are missing in this film; there is no balance. <br /> <br /> Organically, this movie wants to be a moving holiday of first love. But Sciamma is too impressed by his own cynicism and cunning and is ruining the film. First of all, why show only a plump naked girl? I know that there is an established tradition of tasteful teenage nudity in European cinema, as evidenced by films such as "The Slingshot; The Rascals; Devil, probably; The Little Thief; Murmur of the Heart; Friends; Beau Pere "and" Europe, Europe "; but this case is a slight interference of the author - "You see, viewers, I can make a movie in which I show only an unattractive naked person". Either nudity or evenly distributed nakedness would not be an honest way. <br /> <br /> There is a scene in the club where Floriane and Marie dance. Next comes not only the cynical manipulation of Marie by Floriane; this film producer Sciamma cynically manipulates his audience. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the biggest betrayal of authenticity and organic integrity is when Floriane warns Marie that she is going to ask for something "non-normal". Marie asks: "Who cares how to be normal?" Sciamma then misrepresents his audience and the rush of the film because Floriane's request is a false, derivative and surrogate question - not the genuine, honest question the film deserves, Marie's character and viewers, who have devoted their time. <br /> <br /> Here are also two moments that lie on the viewer's nerves: 1) Since when did the French - from all people - take baths in bathing suits and a turtle to shoes? 2) What teenager - of any nationality - crushes the apple core which has been thrown into the trash to taste the lips of your beloved one? <br /> <br /> The three main actresses are promising, and if they find better vehicles for their talents, they can become great actors. Louise Blachere (Anne) is the best actress in terms of technique and can be successful in the supporting role. Adele Haenel (Floriane) could become a leading lady, or a bomb, or both. Pauline Acquart (Marie) has intensity and magnetism that are infallible. In the future, she could play everything, from an emotionally crippled librarian, to a mysteriously sensual seducer and a reluctant politician who rides in with instant admiration. <br /> <br /> In total, "Water Lilies" were very disappointing. Will an honest filmmaker make an authentic film about two lovers of young women! No - not necessarily because of this middle-aged guy - but so young lesbians can have something to observe and identify with. And so to fill the material gap in the world cinema.
