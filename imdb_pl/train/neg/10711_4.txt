The minion is about ... well, minion. Satan's servant, whose goal is to get a key that will open the door in which his master is imprisoned. Is a demon that has human beings and when the body dies, it will have another. Everyone who gets possessed will fall into a Berserker berserk. Dolph Lundgren plays Lukas, a member of the Templars' secret order, whose task is to keep the key away from the servant. The film begins a thousand years ago, in the Middle East, where several knights knights flee from the servant. Then jump to 1999, where the key ends somewhere underground in New York. The archaeologist is tasked to examine / dig the place where the key was found. Needless to say, the minion is by key, and the film becomes a long, lengthy scene of pursuit between the servant and Lukas and the archaeologist. <br /> <br /> The movie is just a low budget for the B movie. The film lacks energy and simply stumbles. You will follow the pursuit, but you will never feel involved in a story that consciously takes ideas from previous movies (especially from Terminator films). The scenes of fighting with the servant are troublesome because you never know how good or bad this demon is. "Skilfully" becomes a single-person army when he fights with the Templars, but sucks when it comes to duels. And it should be nearby for a long time. All this proves that all sense of logic is simply thrown away for convenience. The whole idea of ​​the secret Knights Templar, the door to hell and the key is not well explained. We simply accept that they simply exist. It seems that the movie was made with the idea that history does not have too much potential, but enough to earn a few bucks. Dolph Lundgren sure looks like he wants him to be somewhere else. <br /> <br /> Verdict: 2 out of 5 stars.
