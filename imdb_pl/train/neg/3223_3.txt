LOL! This is not a bad way to start. I thought it was the original, but then I discovered that it was a clone of the 1976 remake of the KING KONG. I never saw KING KONG until I turned 15. I saw this movie when I was 9 years old. Funky disco music gets stuck in your head! Not to mention the Yeti movie theme song. It's the worst effects I've ever seen. At the same time, this film remains a holy Grail of B films. Memorable quotes: "Take a sedative and go to sleep." "Put the Yeti in your tank and you have the power of the Yeti." I remember seeing this movie on MOVIE MACRABE led by Elvira. There is one scene in which it was like KING KONG in reverse order! In KING KONG, he grabs a girl and climbs the building, but in this movie he descends the building and catches the girl (who was falling)! In the same year, another clone KONG MIGHTY PEKING MAN (1977) came from Hong Kong. There are many traveling matt scenes and motorized parts of the body. This movie will make you laugh. It's just like I said, just another clone of KING KONG. Rated PG on violence, language, thematic elements and some scary scenes.
