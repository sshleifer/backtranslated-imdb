I watched the movie last night with expectation, but I was not really impressed. <br /> <br /> With the exception of "Combo", I thought acting was weak and the narrative was limited. It turned out to be a drama "made for television". <br /> <br /> I felt that the movie is very sophisticated. The whole hammering system in the context at the beginning (yes, we have that it is Britain in the 80's - you can stop now) was tiring and gave a very one-sided view of what life in the 1980s looked like Great Britain - poverty, war put together with royalty, Margaret Thatcher, but nothing between them? In reality, there were then middle classes - ordinary working people, with decent pay and mortgage. Falklands clips also seemed to be added randomly at the end, I suppose, a "dramatic effect". <br /> <br /> The sequence of events was a bit chaotic, because the characters moved one action to the next without us seeing how their thinking could change so quickly. <br /> <br /> The relationship between "Shaun" and "Smell" was twisting the legs. I could not even look at the snogging scene. It is very difficult for me to believe that a boy would have been attracted to her, who was not only much younger, but also looked much younger. I know they only shared four years, but four years is nothing when you reach your 20s, but that's a big difference for teenagers! In my experience, such a teenage age difference only occurs when the girl is younger because the girls mature much faster and are more dependent on the wavelength of the boys by a few years older. I'm sorry, but I did not buy it - an unnecessary feature point created for a shock value. <br /> <br /> The ending was a bit violent and again invented. If the incident with throwing the flag was to be iconic, it shrunk in my eyes. <br /> <br /> I was worried about the fact that British films deal only with the higher classes or the poor. Do not get me wrong, I love Trainspotting, and Four Weddings has its charm, but are we British, we can not think of anything else? Why are our videos always suspended on the class system? I was born in 1973, So the age of "Shaun" did not differ much from my age in 1983. I grew up in a single parenting family on a rather rundown estate in a city in England. However, my childhood experiences were very different from those shown in the movie - I do not even remember that racism is a problem (although I do not claim it did not exist). 'This is England'? Not in my experience. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that I felt there was a lack of content in this movie, and I was completely bored and I was not impressed.
