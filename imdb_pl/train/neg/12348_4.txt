This movie is very similar to "Flashdance", you know this dance with Jennifer Beals. This movie is probably the most boring movie I've ever seen, because it's not even bad enough to be funny. "Gl Jane "is much better than this movie, but it does not say much. Here, Demi Moore sweats very much, and the music is high and we can see her fight and everything, but it is certainly not too addictive. I really think the idea of ​​the movie is quite interesting, but the scenario is too stereotypical and Ridley Scott can not help it. Well, like I said ... It's better than "Flashdance" ... (4/10)
