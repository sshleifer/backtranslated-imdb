Extremely strange, though a nasty comedy drama about a strange young man who hopes to fly like a bird through the Houston Astrodome. Quasi-comedy, directed by Robert Altman with eccentric characters, is so overloaded with quirks that it starts creaking from weight early. Some photos are suggestive, Shelley Duvall is the stitch of the debut as a guide, and Sally Kellerman looks every bit like the vision of Bud Cort "bird-mother" (imagine that Altman and producer Lou Adler explain her role!). At the head of Bud Cort is once again after "Harold & Maude" - a real original; Without being discouraged, let's say, Michael J. Pollard, Cort manages to be geeky, crazy and harmless. Unfortunately, this is one of Altman's misfires. He can collect the cast and show like no other, but let him fire with some wrong inspiration and go down. ** with ****
