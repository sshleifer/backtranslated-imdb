This movie showed more racial hatred for Jews than David Mamet than I ever met in an American movie. The pilots are so high that my ability to continue watching has died. I was so disappointed with Joe '<br /> <br /> Mantegna calling a group of men, sitting in a New York Jewish center, cleaning up weapons, heroes, that common sense won and stopped. I am deeply <br /> <br /> worried about the concept that Jews are not Americans and "others". I suggest that Mr Mamet is one of the causes of hatred, he is not a healer.
