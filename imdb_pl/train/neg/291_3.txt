The film version of one woman Sandra Bernhard on off-Broadway is boldly pretentious. Sandra parades in salons and superstars, but her irony is just curiously interesting and ridiculously funny. Her fans will say that she is very honest and that may be true. But it is also penetrating, with no approval, in your bravado, which is not well suited to the film in this genre. She does not want to be more pleasant - and she definitely does not want to be friends - and it will always spoil many people in the wrong way. But even if you meet her halfway, her material here is seriously lacking. Filmmaker Nicolas Roeg served as executive producer and although he was not directed by him, his film has a cool, detached style. Bernhard was the co-author of the play with director John Boskovich; their most bizarre accent was that Sandra's entire audience looked completely bored - a feeling that many real viewers would most likely share. * 1/2 of ****
