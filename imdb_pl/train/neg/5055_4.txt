Two years ago at Sundance, I loved the directorial debut of Josh Kornbluth - Haiku Tunnel. So I could not wait for his brother (and frequent collaborator) Jacob, The Best Thief in the World. This is a drama about a seemingly good child growing up in a lower class in New York. The film is not devoid of poignant moments. But sometimes it's as if Kornbluth was working too hard to make it obvious: life can be very difficult for some people. And life is not just. <br /> <br /> Our understanding is more subtle and more important that despite all the abhorrent cultural and antisocial behaviors that can occur, these heroes do not lack goodness and humanity. We can go back in their language and living conditions, but we can not reject their intentions. In fact, their struggles to keep the family in such adversities have a certain nobility, which most of us can barely appreciate. Kornbluth grew up in this area, and his compassion for people is visible throughout. <br /> <br /> Having said all this, The Best Thief in the World suffers from many painful defects (including the title). Characters are not very reliable. The writing is uneven. And the plot is barely perceptible. And for many, the most disturbing is that Kornbluth uses two young black boys imitating gangsta rap between scenes. To myself: But although I do not question the potential realism of this phenomenon, it hurts me to see five-year-old children talking about sex with a group of women. This is an unnecessary amount of shock and a forced part of borrowed interest.
