This can be one of the most enjoyable movies if you do not take it seriously. It's a bit outdated and the effects are poor, but it's so nice. There are gigantic crabs that attack a girl. oh, crabs are singing in Japanese. This is incredibly bad. And the ending that has been telegraphy throughout the movie is terribly amazing. Predictable, but seeing the final fight will make you roll in place. Do not even give this film a chance, and you'll love it. Susan George is having fun and yes, he looks naked. Her daughter is not worth bearing, but she is attacked by giant crabs. They are the size of big cats. This is 2, but I love it. As a movie, my God, but for entertainment, I give it to him 7. Did I mention that there are gigantic crabs?
