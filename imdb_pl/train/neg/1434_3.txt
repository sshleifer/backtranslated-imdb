James Bond in the desert? That's how it looks: Pierce Brosnan is best known as Bond in "Tommorrow Never Dies" (1997) and "Golden Eye" (1995) - both shot before this release. To be honest, the two main roles in the film are both poorly manned and Brosnan in a somewhat more convincing performance, and Annie Galipeau (as Pony, the love of Gray Owl) has to fight with a carelessly written dialogue. > Two aunts, on the other hand, are perfect. But the film does not apply to aunts. It's about the wilderness of the Canadian wilderness. And while photography can be nice, there is no gravel for the harsh reality of life in the wild. Annie Galipeau, as Pony, unfortunately is not convincing because I really wanted to believe her. She was a relatively inexperienced 20-year-old in this film and could work, but Richard Attenborough may not have been hard enough on her. It makes her seem vulnerable, which of course is ... but in the wrong way. <br /> <br /> But one thing is for sure, it looks perfect. But mascara and eyebrow thickener in the desert? It just does not fit, especially since it seems that it goes with forest trials with Bond (sorry, Gray Owl) and uses photos to kiss close-ups. <br /> <br /> I've lived with forestry people in the Pacific Northwest and they just do not look so pretty and stay so sweet fighting for survival. Which brings me to a different point: the film does not mention the period in which it is set: the thirties. I blame here mainly on the scenario of lack of glare, which is eager to preach at the expense of a dramatic arc, story points and small details that can trigger a period through action. <br /> <br /> William Nicholson wrote the script and his last offer, "Elizabeth, the Golden Age" was opened three days ago, so I hope that there has been an improvement. <br /> <br /> Yes, I have read the comments others have published, but I'm not convinced. Big potential, but wrong and maybe even ill-conceived. If he had a religious film, it would be a movie, but because he preaches ecology, the film remains slightly above criticism because it is "politically correct." Unfortunately, I do not buy it. Amen.
