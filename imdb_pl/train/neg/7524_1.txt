A handful of critics rewarded the film with positive comments. I do not want to argue with their opinion, but I strongly disagree. When I saw this movie for the first time, I was impressed. But after comparing it with other films, especially with the late master Bruce Lee, I quickly changed my mind. In fact, if it was not for the title of the film, I would never buy it. Game of Death 2 does not refer to the original Death Game (except that divides one character, Billy Lo.) <br /> <br /> I was stunned when I saw a similar Death 2 game compared to Podaje Smok. The plot has striking similarities: both Bruce Lee and Bobby Lo have a mission to avenge their relative. These two locations are similar, in which both are very isolated and are surrounded by thousands of black belts. In both films there is an element of prostitution (women are sent to two guest rooms in both films). Both Han (Enter the Dragon) and Lewis' henchman have no hands. This is an underground drug operation in Enter the Dragon, believe it or not, there is one in Game of Death 2. Han has a cat in Enter the Dragon, the director used his imagination and awarded Lewis a monkey! The list is continued. <br /> <br /> As for other aspects of the movie, such as the script and acting, I felt that it was very weak. It seemed to me that the director was looking for a group of martial artists who could play in the film and pray that they could act. <br /> <br /> On a positive scale I can not deny that the choreography is impressive. Although combat sequences have strong elements of acrobatics, they are no less skillfully performed. However, because the plot is insufficient, I could not refer to the character, which is why the combat sequences were more exhibitions than they were of relevance to the film. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I would say that this movie is worth recommending to all fans of martial arts, but for those who like a solid action movie with a good story and strong characters, I would not seriously recommend this movie. My opinions on this film may seem very biased and one-sided, but when Bruce Lee set a new standard in the martial arts cinema, especially after his masterpieces: Enter the Dragon, this film did not meet these standards. They imitated a truly brilliant martial arts film, hoping to achieve the same level of fame. <br /> <br /> Regarding my assessment, giving this film a very rough 1 in 10, the film is viewed in barley and must be grateful that he had the combat sequences he did.
