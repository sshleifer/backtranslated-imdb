It would be a sort of clich√© if I start with what is on the title, so I will wait for it. First of all, this movie made me wonder why children are doing stupid things, such as wandering the labs and breaking bottles. Then I realized that it is a movie with the news that the message is overcome by children and such things will not happen. Things like what you're asking about? Things like the giant insect-monster growing up and causing the chaos before death in a typical way, "kill the monster indirectly." Now, as promised ... Blue Monkey ... there is nothing blue or Simian in it. Now it's like being cheated or something. The photo on the cover had a gigantic robak / krab / idiot / thing on the front of the screaming nurses. That's what happened, but I wanted monkeys! after a few days spent in front of us THE MOST EXTREME PRIMATER (half-drunk in Cask and Creame brandy) I was in the mood for more monkey hijackers of the 80's. Not so much. If you like snow monkeys or blue things, this movie is not for you. If you like mistakes and reasons to hit children, rent it.
