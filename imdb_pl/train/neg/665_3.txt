In Bridgeport, a mad high school teacher Richard Fenton (Johnathon Schaech) is obsessed with a teenager, Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow); He is a witness that he murdered her family to stay with her, but Richard is arrested and sent to prison for life. Three years later, the traumatic Donna feels better, but is still undergoing psychological treatment and is taking pills. On the night of the ball she goes with her boyfriend Bobby (Scott Porter) and two pairs of friends to the Pacific Grad hotel for a party. But the psychopath Richard escaped from prison and was placed on the same floor of the hotel chasing Donna, stabbing friends and hotel staff who crossed his path. a set of stereotypes with complete lack of originality. The stupid story is shallow and stupid, with Johnathon Schaech's evil acting as a crazy killer. The predictable scenario is amazing because you can predict what will happen in the next scenes. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Morte Convida Para Dan√ßar" ("Death invites you to dance")
