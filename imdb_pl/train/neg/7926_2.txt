Original classical exploitation, though far from pleasure at almost any level, for some guys who turn cats into human monsters who eat meat, because the cat food they do is made with people, processed with added sci-fi elements. Cats do not have enough, and when the body is stained, the food ends, the cats turn to their owners. Poorly juxtaposed on almost every level, it is an example of the absolute bottom of barrel material that once played in cinemas in the early 1970s, enriched with foreign breeds of dogs and cats fighting for supremacy. Director Ted Mikel is a hack, but he is so nice to someone (generally, I like this guy thanks to interviews that bring a smile and songs with comments) that you can almost justify the garbage, which in most cases turned out to be. Mikels wanted to make movies and did not care about it, as it turned out, until he produced something. More power for him, but I would like him not to give up his home movies
