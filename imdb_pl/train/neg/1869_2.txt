Veteran sleazeball Bruno Mattei is again in this erotic thriller, which clearly reflects the 8MM Joel Schumacher. But, as expected, Mattei makes his movie on a small budget - so that after the release it seems unclear. <br /> <br /> After the daughter's abduction, her mother enters the dark world of underground pornography, the hijackers belong to an international organization that runs snuff films as long as high-end clients pay well. The search for her daughter leads not only her mother in Europe, but also to prostitution. She goes to sleep with several boys to get her directions. When it finally comes into contact with the snuff organization run by the mysterious Dr. Hades, she herself becomes very dangerous. <br /> <br /> There is not much to say about it, although it starts promising. The problem is that the film is not as dingy or clear as one would expect from a director who created films such as BLADE VIOLENT. SNUFF TRAP (released for the first time in Russia!) It is not bloody enough, nor does it contain nakedness and sex to really draw the viewer's attention. The plot is not so unique, except maybe surprisingly many different locations throughout Europe. The ending is very disappointing. Acting is also not unusual, except for Anita Auer, who plays Doctor Hades: It looks and behaves extremely terrifying. You do not want to meet her in a dark alley (or in your bedroom). <br /> <br /> In general, SNUFF TRAP refers only to Bruno Mattei film collectors. But it's good to see the man back again: it was his first thriller since 1994 giallo GLI OCCHI DENTRO.
