"Horrible people" should be a subtitle of this horrible movie. If you want to see ordinary people doing ordinary things, look through the window for real life. But if you want to see unpleasant people doing boring things, you have to watch this terrible movie by Mike Leigh. Characters talk for a long time, but they can never communicate with each other. Why not? Presumably because Leigh's things are just as ineffective and pathetic to us as his actors, and he wants to shoot real life. But we are not, and he is not.
