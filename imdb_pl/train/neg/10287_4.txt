It's available on the "Drive In Double Feature" from Dark Sky Films, and because I just finished "Barracuda", I watched it too. It is a film that turns out to be extremely ambitious and at the same time inept. <br /> <br /> We start with two young women wandering through the streets of some strange city, but where exactly are they? They stop to look at the necklaces of some Chinese seller and try on Chinese-style clothes in the store, but then we see a few Aztec dancers? And all the time these girls are being tracked by two guys who finally drop the sneaking, which they do not have to chase girls in the wild run through the city, and finally catch them. <br /> <br /> It looks like one of the girls has a coin on a string around his neck, and these guys want to find loot, and where did they get it? In the flashback, we return to find out. And how did they know he had this coin? It's hard to say, really. <br /> <br /> And now, when the two women were 10 years old, they were together with the sister and sister of his sister on the boat, and after stopping to get air in their tanks, they tow this young boy back to his home, just to let his grandfather go out and invite "young" owls for herbal tea with his grandmother. But not everyone has tea, Todd went back to the boat to check the young girls, and when they are away from her, the boat breaks down, and when they return home, their friends mysteriously disappeared. It seems that these "polite people" raise their own vegetables, but wait for the meat to fall into a spell and give herbal tea. <br /> <br /> But girls and Todd have left the island, but now they are coming back, escorted by the hijackers, and are there to find the treasure, although no one has ever shown the girls where it was BEFORE. It also seems that there is someone else on the island, and bandits mysteriously begin to die one by one, and because there are only three of them, it does not last long. There is even a kind of happy ending that will leave the viewer as surprised as the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Two bandits seem to be freaks with anger problems and combined without acting ability are borderline fun. The hillbilly family is also deprived of acting abilities, although the grandfather is Hank Worden, who has appeared in many films and TV shows. The action is misleading, the locations are even more confusing, and the island looks like Southern California. <br /> <br /> So what the hell is this? I'm not sure, but it's definitely worth seeing once so you can think (or say) what? 4 out of 10, very strange.
