"The Rainmaker" released in 1956 - has one of the best actors of its time. Katharine Hepburn, Lloyd Bridges and Burt Lancaster are the main players. Even they can not completely save this over the acting melodrama. First of all, Hepburn is horribly poorly manned as a shy spinster - despite her brilliance as an actress, even she can not do it. She is too strong to be credible as such a simpleton and she was simply too old for this part. Lancaster works extremely well, and Earl Holliman is too greedy and more like Jethro Clampett. Only Bridges and the ever-reliable Wendell Corey seem to be a bit above the cast - but even they can do just that. It looks like the 1950s are the time when Katharine Hepburn wanted to spread her wings a bit as an actress, and good. Here she made the wrong choice. Fortunately for her fans (I'm among them) she did not do them much. Despite the stocking of list A and good production values, it does not work.
