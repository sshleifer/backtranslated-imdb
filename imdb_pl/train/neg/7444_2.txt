If you are not petrified on Russians or boars, this movie is harsh. Actually, I fell asleep about 40 minutes and had to fight the urge to leave the theater. I would like to have. The loss of a perfectly lovely Saturday evening. <br /> <br /> Even "Silent Hill" was more frightening. Heck, even "Pan's Labyrinth" was scarier. I'm still not sure what was going to be terrifying in this movie. <br /> <br /> At the beginning I am very suspicious of films that use "pidgin Russian", as in the opening movies. This is embarrassing to me since I brought a group of my Russian friends and we all cringed. Oh my God. <br /> <br /> Hmm. Well, fortunately for me (and probably also for you) this movie has already slipped out of my brain and I just left it an hour ago. So I do not have any details, only dark visualizations that do not appear anywhere, and some miserable, now dead hopes that anything will happen. <br /> <br /> I may have seen a completely mutilated version of this movie, because I can not believe it I got great reviews here (and that's why I saw it) and it ended so that I was completely devoid of not only horror, but also valuable entertainment . <br /> <br /> I gave him 2, because yes, I fell asleep and wanted to leave after 40 minutes, but I woke up and did not leave.
