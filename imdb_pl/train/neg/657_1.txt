PROM NIGHT (2008) <br /> <br /> direction: Nelson McCormick <br /> <br /> role: Brittany Snow, Scott Porter, Jessica Stroup and Dana Davis <br /> <br /> storyline: Three years ago Donna (Brittany Snow) witnessed the death of her entire family from the hands of her teacher (Jonathan Schaech), who is a little in love with her. Now he is preparing for the ball with his stupid irritating friends. There they start dying one by one because the killer escaped from prison and no one bothered to warn Donna, because apparently her ball is too important to interrupt. <br /> <br /> pros: I got some good laughs from the movie because of the terrible dialogue and stupid movements of the character. <br /> <br /> Example: <br /> <br /> Everyone decides not to tell Donnie that a man who has a strange obsession with her (does not seem to be so great), escaped from prison. Reason: they do not want to embarrass her with all her friends. LOL <br /> <br /> cons: I'll start by saying that I'm a huge slass fan. I can usually play with the bad ones. I even like some of the PG-13 horror movies. TOURIST TRAP (1979), one of my favorites, was originally rated as PG. I also like POLTERGEIST (1982) and THE GRUDGE (2004). So the fact that this is a stupid movie, which is rated PG-13, has nothing to do with me, that I'm not enjoying the movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, I had a big problem with history. I like movies that do not even have a story. At least they can be fun. It's about a teacher who falls in love with his student, so he kills his whole family. A few years later, he tries to reward her, destroying the ball and killing all friends ...? Then there were threads that I doubt that anyone would care about. Claire (Jessica Stroup) is fighting with her boyfriend, she has cramps, and I did not care. This should be a Lifetime function, not a PROM NIGHT remake. <br /> <br /> And then ... this is a slasher movie with scenes of horrible death. I do not even care if it's not so bloody, some of my beloved favorites (HALLOWEEN, CURTAIN, original PROM night) were not so bloody, but still had effective murders. Here we have half heroes dying in the same hotel room off the screen, a woman stabbed several times with no piercing wounds and a close-up on the actor's bad face when he screams in agony. I'm sure the 10-year-old girls were terrified, but not me. <br /> <br /> I also hated the character. He was an unrealistically sensitive Donna boy, Bobby (Scott Porter) and I can almost guarantee you'll never meet a boy so sensitive in your life unless you're gay. Then we had annoying friends Donna, Claire (Stroup) and Lisa (Dana Davis), and the playful girlfriend Chrissy (Brianne Davis). If you think characters from DEATH PROOF were annoying, try to watch this movie. And do not start me from Ronnie (Collins Pennie) and DJ (Jay Phillips) who told me about Usher's performance in SHE'S ALL THAT. <br /> <br /> Add to this all predictable twists, a horrible soundtrack and a great disrespect for the original material, and you have a pretty stinky one.
