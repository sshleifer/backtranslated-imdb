Thank God, I watched this with my friend and I did not pay for it. The plot is very clear, and the whole movie resembles an episode of a television series. If you have any knowledge about computers or electronics, be careful. You will feel that the film is an insult to your intelligence. <br /> <br /> Also an actress turned to Much Music VJ Amanda Walsh shows the worst acting I've ever seen, except for porn. He is lucky that Matt Lanter is really decent. He wears this movie. <br /> <br /> I hate that I've wasted almost two hours of my life watching this movie! It is a pity they called it a sequel, because I was a fan of the original, which was quite good.
