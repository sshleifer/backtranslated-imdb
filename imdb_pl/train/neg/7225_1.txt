I was sitting in this movie and I have to say that I only managed to keep my attention. The movie would be more bearable if I did not have to watch a terrible CGI to be able to refer to the industry in the future, if you intend to use CGI, to know what to avoid. <br /> <br /> Apparently it's supposed to be a graphic novel on the screen, but all I've seen is a bad movie that's nothing like a graphic novel. <br /> <br /> In all, the story was not as bad as CGI, I was impressed by the acting and I thought the casting was good and little more information about the character would be nice, because sometimes it was a bit confusing for me, but it's not surprising because, as I said, it only focused my attention, but to be honest, I would like to miss it.
