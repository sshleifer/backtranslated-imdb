So this guy named George is sitting at home on his birthday when two women appear. George's wife is in the hospital, taking care of her son, so when the wife is absent, George enters the bath and loves with both girls. This is not great from the stage because it does not really show anything. After this boy's birthday, he wakes up the next morning and the girls are still at his home. They make him a good breakfast, but George is not hungry. George is not very happy and tries to get rid of them, but when he comes back home, the girls are still in his house. The girls are tired of old George and they do not want to cook for them anymore. They both turn out to be the main psychopaths and use George in their little crazy game. I liked the fact that the girls just did what they wanted and stirred George's house. George was not so great for his two guests. When George said he was a married man, he really did not mean that. George looked like Tom Tucker in Family Guy. I was for two girls all the time.
