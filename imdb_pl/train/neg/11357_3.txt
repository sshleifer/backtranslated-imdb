1. good news. 3-D is spectacularly well done, and they do not go for tricks. The film is based on the true story of the highest point in the history of mankind, and even depicts one of the real participants in this story: Buzz Aldrin. <br /> <br /> And now the matter is: it's FLIES, for krissakes! Fly with large, googgy human eyes, true, but still flies. Do you remember how I compared the Underworld movies to rats and cockroaches? It was not meant for praise and I never dreamed that whoever would take it literally. This one has even less empathy. Baby worms? Ugh. In one of those strange fugitives of the Hollywood pseudonym, this flick was clearly on the drawing boards at the same time as "cosmic chimps", also about creatures in space. <br /> <br /> Go hire "Apollo 13" and see a 9-movie film about the space program REAL (RIP).
