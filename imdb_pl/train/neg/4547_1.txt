The movie was terrible !!! Easily the worst movie I've seen in the last few years. One of those movies I can tell people for the next three years is the worst movie I can come up with. Thank you for answering this burning question "What's the worst movie you've seen?" Answer: Celestine Prophecy. Trust me ... I read the book, I liked the message and I was excited to see this movie, but then they treated the audience as if we were r *. There is no history, and the story that is there is paralyzed by too much magic and coincidence. It is a pity that they have to spell nine prophecies and can not simply entangle them into a story that is fun to follow. They did not spend any time developing the character, and it was easy not to worry if any character died. Embarrassing to be one of the few people who stayed to the end of this incredibly boring movie. The book is also quite boring, but I liked the analogies that you could see in everyday life while reading the book. The film does not offer the same opportunity and I would suggest that you do not see it if you want to keep the words of the book close to your heart. YOU DO NOT SEE THIS FILM. Trust me.
