Although I saw "Gymkata" in the theater in '85, I did not remember anything about the story, except for the unclear images of Kurt Thomas running and fighting against the stone walls and disappointment at the end. <Br /> <br /> After reading some of the other reviews, I raised a copy of the newly released DVD to re-enter the world of Gymkata. <br /> <br /> It turns out that this is one of the films produced during the 80's, which would go directly to the video today. The star of the film is gymnastics champion Kurt Thomas, as Jonathan Cabot, recruiting blue to infiltrate the nation of "Parmistan" to enter and hope to win "The Game", a suicidal blood sport sponsored by Khan, who encourages his people by shouting, which sounds like "What power". The mission objective includes the Star Wars defense system. Jonathan is trained in the martial arts of Princess Rubali, who never speaks or leaves her home. Once trained, they try to blend in with the residents, wearing a bright red sweater with blue and white dots. Needless to say, Cabot considers himself running and fighting for his life along the stone streets of Parmistan, on his way to a destination and a game. <br /> <br /> The star, Kurt Thomas, was badly supported by director Robert Clouse, who looks like he has never been on set. The so-called script is simply an incompetent website. See other reviews for many howls throughout the text. The city of madmen has a few good moments, but ultimately it is ruined by a bad edition. End ... meh. There is still a germ of a good action adventure. The Hong Kong version with more shares and faster pace may be quite good.
