I will start with what I liked. <br /> <br /> I really liked the songs, everything was great in them, costumes, music, lyrics (if the translation was good :)), choreography, everything. <br /> <br /> I loved the crab scene and the culinary scene. <br /> <br /> But that's it. <br /> <br /> I understand art cinema, blablabla, but too much is too much. Too much silence (it was interesting for an hour, but two hours of hearing steps and moans from time to time, really ...), too much boredom (no movie should be boring, no matter how deep it was! ), too many pornographic scenes (I really understand it, I see that they filmed a porn movie there, but really, REALLY, it's really too much) I really think that cinema should be to watch, and it's definitely not to be seen in any way . <br /> <br /> 3 stars for the song.
