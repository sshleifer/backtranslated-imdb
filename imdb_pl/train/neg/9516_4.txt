Frank Sinatra plays a former soldier and frustrated writer, no-goodnik, hard-living and drinking, who returns to his hometown and meets his distant brother (Arthur Kennedy), now a great shooter with a selfless wife and a stubborn daughter. Frank is involved in the game with the gambler Dean Martin, the uneducated floozy Shirley MacLaine, and has some connections with the law, but he really wants to write and settle down with a good woman. Too simplified drama bordering the soap opera, with the role for MacLaine, who in turn is too "colorful" and embarrassingly sentimental (her drunken stripes on "After You've Gone" are, however, the main attraction of the film and are professionally supported). Director Vincente Minnelli supervises this in a simple way, but it is in a surprisingly gloomy mood and most of the big scenes are flat or dense. The picture looks incredibly handsome on a panoramic screen, with a nice eye on details and composition, but the story and these figures are in the dregs. ** with ****
