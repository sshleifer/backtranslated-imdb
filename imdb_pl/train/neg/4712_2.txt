This program is probably the biggest, ugliest, most general steam stack I've ever seen in children's programming that has actually been successful. The main character, Johnny, although I understand that he has to represent an ordinary kid, is not sympathetic or even tolerated. The jokes are bad, exaggerated (ie "Whoa!" And in the end ... it's just ugly to look at. While children are not particularly critical about artistic talent, they still prefer sweets. I can not stand watching the program because in a way, the artistic style it's just ... disgusting, really disgusting, just bad. <br /> <br /> I just can not stand that it's getting so much airtime. I understand that nostalgia can be a bit irrational and I should not have to hope in her return ... I miss old fairy tales bring Dexter's Laboratory, Powerpuff Girls ... everything except that shit I think it's just wishful thinking. <br /> <br /> Speaking directly, I advise you not to waste time on This concert I believe that really good tales can be enjoyed by big children too, which does not mean that.
