I really could not wait for this program for two reasons; I really liked Jan Michael Vincent and I am an air nut and I have a serious affair with helicopters. I do not like this program because it moves fantasy to an unbelievable level. The world speed record for helicopters was set at 249 miles per hour by Westland Lynx a few years ago. The only helicopter that was even faster was the Lockheed AH56A experimental in the 1960s. He hit over 300 and was a compound helicopter, which means he had a propeller pushing at the end of the hull, providing a thrust. <br /> <br /> In short, no helicopter can fly significantly over 275 due to the principle of rotation of the wing flight. And Bell 222, the "actor" who played the role of Airwolf, was not very fast, even with the standards of helicopters. And it did not last long in production. <br /> <br /> In this period, a movie called "Blue Thunder" appeared, which was much more realistic.
