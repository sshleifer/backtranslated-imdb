*** SPOILER *** Do not read this if you think about watching this movie, although it would be a waste of time. (By the way: the plot is so predictable that it does not matter if you read it or not) <br /> <br /> If you're wondering whether to see "Coyote Ugly" or not: no! It is not worth the money for a ticket, nor for VHS / DVD. A typical "Chick-Feel-Good-Flick", you can say. The plot itself is as shallow as possible, a funny and uncritical version of the American dream. A young, handsome girl from a small town was very successful in New York. A few desperate attempts to give the film any depth of failure, such as the "tragic" case of the father, the "difficulty" of Violet's relationship with her boyfriend and so on. McNally (director) tries to arouse the pity and sadness of the audience, who has no chance of success in this rehearsal because of the bad script and shallow acting. Especially Piper Perabo does not convince one of the "fear of Jersey" before singing in front of the audience. The only good (and quite funny) theme of "Coyote Ugly" is John Goodman, who represents a small ray of hope for this film. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised that Jerry Bruckheimer produced this movie. First, "Gone In 60 Seconds" and now ... what happened to the great movies, such as "The Rock" and "Con Air"? That was the real Bruckheimer thing. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a superficial movie with good-looking women to relax, you should better see "Charlie's Angels" (it's much more fun, funny and self-ironic) instead of that flip. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down (3 in 10).
