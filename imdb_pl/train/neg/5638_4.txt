Only one thing could use this sketch. A healthy shootout between a happy couple, an exotic model at the delicatessen and an old motel man who (as it turned out) secretly watched from the forest and aged with boys when they shared a rubber house. <br /> <br /> In this process, they could smash the ice-hut into small pieces, solve most of the problems; such as the "whore slut" on the windshield, the reason why the hero "had no friends", as well as the explanation of his cold under the pressure of a bloody tampon, incessant telephone conversations. . . and this chic cosmic formation, green thumb and his train for a simpler life. However, quite a technician with a human body. Former abortionist? Mortuary guardian? A little heartbeat would be nice. <br /> <br /> It was funny to watch how these people move, I think, but the stupid Eleanora Italian games were stifling stupid, while the caretaker had too many Dick yoga classes, the mind and the pick-up summed it up. I would also like them to have some more luggage: Eleanora is ready to work after putting the black underwear into his nice red suitcase, and the caretaker needs a cardboard box in the motel. <br /> <br /> Small things, you can say. I agree, although the tormenting bits simply do not add up in this hurry. Good quarrels with owls, but I really felt cold all the way.
