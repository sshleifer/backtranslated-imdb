As someone who was stunned by the amazing visuals of "Hero", I wanted to see this movie, which was considered similar but better. Also actress, which I like: Ziyi Zhang. Well, I was disappointed in both cases. I bought a DVD of this invisible movie, and that was a mistake. It was not better. <br /> <br /> I realize that these martial arts movies are pure fantasy, but this story is stretched as far as everything that I believed, only made me shake my head in disappointment. A blind woman defeating hundreds of opponents? I'm sorry, it's a bit too far. In addition, the main male character "Jin" (Takeshi Kaneshiro) was so irritating with his dialogue, stupid expression and stupid laughter that he also ruined the film. <br /> <br /> Despite the wonderful colors and amazing action scenes, this story - for me - just did not have the appeal to make it a movie that is worth having. This movie is not my "hero"!
