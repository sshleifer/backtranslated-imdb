A collection of deleted scenes and alternative shots, edited with added lector, to give the impression that it took place after the events of the first. Quite a nice idea, but the deleted scenes remain for no reason on the cutting room floor and this is another proof. Because it's not as fun as "Anchorman" and really let's face it, THIS movie was not exactly comedic gold, so you have a movie "worse" than the one that was moderately funny. In my eyes STILL places it one or two notches above "Kicking and Screaming" or "Bewitched". Chross your fingers, "The Wedding Crashers" is a return to the old school form (no word games) <br /> <br /> My class: D
