I really could not wait to see it because I love Danny Dyer and I think that Gillian Anderson is a talented actress. The beginning was interesting. I liked the relationship between the two stars. Then he quickly jumps on the main plot, which is attacked by a group of strangers, and Dyer gets beaten up while Anderson is raped. Then they decide to take revenge. Sounds good, right? Well, it is not. History becomes boring and followed, and some things become really strange. I will not reveal any details, but it happens that I do not want to see it, for example. I like giving all movies the benefits of doubts and I really wanted to like this movie. It just did not work out. I give him 3 out of 10, mainly for actors.
