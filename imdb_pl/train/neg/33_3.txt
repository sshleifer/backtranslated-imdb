This is the worst thing that TMNT franchise has ever created. I was a child when it happened and I still thought it was two, although I liked the original drawing. <br /> <br /> There is one scene I remember when a mafia monkey explains to his servants what rhetorical questions are horrible. Many fans hate this series for including the female turtle, but it did not bother me. So much that I did not even remember her until I last read about the program. Generally speaking, it is pathetic forgetfulness. <br /> <br /> The only good thing was the cover song. Guilty pleasure, they call it ... Ninja Nananana ...
