This is absolutely the worst performance of Robert Duval, who throughout the film sounds like William Buckley. His hammy of melodramatic acting takes away any dramatic interest. I'm not sure if it was a deliberate theft of the scene or unintentional, but it's the only thing I can remember from a really forgotten movie. This picture should be shown in every amateur acting class an example of what not to do. Thank God, Duvall went to bigger and better things and stopped trying to exert a cultural accent. He is a good actor, but that's all. Klaus is much better. His performance is muted and noteworthy.
