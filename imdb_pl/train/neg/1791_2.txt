What about this dark movie at the beginning and sporadically throughout the movie? It's as if someone has put muddy water into the camera's lens. <br /> <br /> Violence and nudity may discourage some people, but this, along with mostly bad acting, makes me think that this is a good cult movie. /> <br /> My favorite line is Tarquin the Vampire, "Unfortunately, your race is stupid." All right, no one should ever say "unfortunately" on the film line, unless he is an Englishman and lives in the eighteenth century. <br /> <br /> The action of Van Helsing and the bad girl "Rally" is not bad. I also liked Master Little played by Ron Little. Bad martial arts! Do not take it too seriously and you'll like it.
