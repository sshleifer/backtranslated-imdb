I usually come to this site before going to the cinema, because I like to see what others think about the movie. I have read many reviews that said "horror thriller". This prompted me to try this movie. I really have to consider these "thriller / horror" statements because they were not! I almost went and asked for a refund, and if many reviewers were happy about this trash ... well, you must be easily satisfied! At the end of the film, people spoke to me loudly "what a waste of time" and I turned to them and replied "I could not sum it up better." I waited for something to happen ... but it was not. There was potential for many good fears (or emotions if you want), but nothing happened. Williams acted quite well in this role, but I felt that he was changed by a bad script that revolved around and disappeared. Save money for people, this is a turkey that will appear in your nearest DVD store in the near future!
