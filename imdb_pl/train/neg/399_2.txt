This image began with good intentions, Bacon, a scientist who tested the theory of invisibility, and Shue is sweet as usual in his role. Everything is falling apart, it's your typical Hollywood thriller, filmed on a sound stage with lots of special effects, devoid of any humor, wit and soul. In other words, do not waste time watching this. Get a cassette of audio cassettes with John DeLanta as Invisible Man, and with Leonard Nimoy. That was good, and HG Wells is well served, in contrast to this mess.
