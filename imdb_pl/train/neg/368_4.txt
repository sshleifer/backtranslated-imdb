This movie is really stupid! I saw it as an 11-year-old and even then I thought it was ridiculous! I recommend this movie only to children under 12 years old. I really did not care, but I think she answers some very good questions that children need to be aware of, such as: 1) Do money buy happiness? 2) Should I lie (my parents) about things that they will not approve of? 3) Do money buy friendships? 4) Is money everything? 5) Should I not tell my parents when someone is trying to hurt me? Of course, these are very unrealistic situations, but I think that if parents were discussing these problems with their children, maybe they should also watch this movie to show / scare their children that lies can hurt you.
