While surfing the channels, we found this video with a promising summary. We were terrified because of flat acting and a formal plot. We've found fun exploding car scenes, incredible shootings and break up with the weight of tyro-foam and cardboard. It was even more fun to watch all the converted scenes from the "Dante's Summit", where the front of the church falls on the school bus, the shop fronts break away from the main street, the viaduct collapses, and the red truck rushing down the alley like bricks are falling on it. It was a good laugh, though unintentional, and leaves the viewer asking if he was originally supposed to be a low-budget false disaster movie.
