Before I start, let me say that my experience with this movie could have been influenced by dubbing, which, as seen in other comments, was original, considered by some to be inferior. So it's quite possible that the subtitles or the supposedly new version of the DVD will matter. I did not read the relevant book; I'm only familiar with one other Japanese manga and may lack its cultural context. <br /> <br /> Potential minor spoilers ahead of us. <br /> <br /> I usually like dark colored science fiction stories (such as Blade Runner, 12 Monkeys, etc.), but I did not like this movie at all. Though it started out slightly intriguing, it became boring when it was only half finished. There are different types of problems; let's start with what is probably the sharpest: dialogue. Characters seem unable to formulate full sentences; if they do not shout each other's names for the nth time, they usually murmur monosyllables ("Kanedaaa!", "Tetsuoooo!", "Huh?", "Grrr", etc.). This leaves most of the completely underdeveloped and two-dimensional forms. It does not help in the least, because many of them have only a few minutes of time on the screen without anything interesting to say, which could detract from the stereotypes suggested by visualizations. <br /> <br /> The grunting is enriched with random pseudo-philosophical technique that sounds vague and does not inspire even Star Trek standards. There is nothing deep and meaningful here - everything seems accidental, thrown randomly from various pieces of sci-fi ideas without any consistency. <br /> <br /> What is not easily understood is no more than an excuse to start a long final sequence that consists of escalating scenes of chaos and destruction. Of course there is nothing wrong with the nice chaos and destruction; but in this case you will find yourself in the question "why all this is and how long it will end". Character development over the last 30 minutes consists of little more than Tetsuo turning into Pizza the Hutt for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> The ending resembles the one from 2001 - a bizarre sequence of images that, far from solving or explaining anything, leave the viewer feeling that he is looking at a kaleidoscope for two hours. I am sure that some say that this kind of thing is art; but for me it was just a lot of fancy use of colors and shapes. (Part of the music was also quite interesting). Unfortunately, it is a style and no substance. <br /> <br /> Tired of Disney? Do you want to watch animated films that intelligently address "adult" themes? It is sad to say that you are more likely to find such things in "South Park".
