He still goes to school and works for a malicious criminal, Akai, who sleeps with her. One day, Sawa learns that he killed her parents ... <br /> <br /> ------- <br /> <br /> Even the biggest anime fans will have to admit that this malicious action thriller is disappointing fest gore. "Kite" has a style, but it is still rubbish. A strange story about a teenager who kills people as a killer, she tried to be both frightening and moving, causing history to fall on her face. One of the most important events is the sequence of actions in which the good / evil heroine Sawa falls with the bodyguard from the building, however, the dramatic structure is not so well arranged, and the bizarre and grotesque face animation of the hero Yasoumi Umetsu is terrible. What's more, the sequences of intercourse are simply frightening. <br /> <br /> Level: 3/10
