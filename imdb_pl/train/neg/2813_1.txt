Normally, I would never rent a movie like that because you know it will be bad looking at the box. At the same time I rented seven films, including Nightmare on Elm Street 5 and 6, and New Nightmare by Wes Craven. Unfortunately, when I got home, I found out that the guy from the cinema gave me the wrong tape. I found this bad movie in Wes Craven's New Nightmare box. <br /> <br /> This movie is incredibly boring, acting is bad, and the plot does not make sense. It's difficult to write a good review because I have no idea what a movie really was. At the end of the movie, you have more questions and then answers. <br /> <br /> In the "Maximum Power Scale from 1 to 10" I rate this movie: 1 <br /> <br /> PS I would like to correct the Corinthian review (just below the mine). He says that Robert Englund breaks his underwear, rides naked on horseback, etc. The guy who did it was Mahmoud, played by Juliano Mera, not Robert Englund.
