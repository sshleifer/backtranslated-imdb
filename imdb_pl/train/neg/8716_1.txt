I do not know where to start; acting, special effects and writing are just as bad as you can imagine. I can not believe that the production workers have reached the point where they said: "Our work is over, it's time to release it". I am glad that the first two series have never made it to Great Britain. Actually, I recommend watching this movie so that you can appreciate how well the majority of movies have done. <br /> <br /> I do not know how any of the other IMDb users could find it terrifying when the "terrifying" dinosaurs hang down the corridors with their swinging rubber arms.
