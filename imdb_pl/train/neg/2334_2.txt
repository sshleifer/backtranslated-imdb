It had a big intellectual grudge. The main role is to give a "deep" "meaningful" rendering (with a natural reading for its minds) and was certainly influenced by the "method" of the fifties / sixties, which, when the script and direction was valuable, gave stunning results (see Clift, Newman, Winters).

The interesting side is only reviewed: the relationship of a young boy / hero - if we admit that the hero is the same kind of child - When he tells the young child that he will not let anyone hurt, there is a welcome tenderness.

Here my hitchcockometer is pointing sullenly at zero throughout.
