I am forced to write a review of this IMAX feature as a means of alerting others to SAVE YOUR MONEY. Almost every episode of Desmond Morris' Human Animal or David Suzuki's' Nature of Things' could have been better than the material presented. The director not only does not use the amazing IMAX film size from 65 to 70 mm and the giant presentation screen, but everything on the screen is extremely impressive, given the availability of the aforementioned programming. Viewers meet pregnant Heather, her husband Buster and niece and nephew. We follow them through endless forty minutes when they eat, sweat, listen to music, etc. Although we have access to scenes inside the human digestive tract and get to know the natural reflexes of children, are we really learning something more of the majority of primary school leavers? Are we even torn apart by transatlantic Heather? Does it matter to us? Avoid this movie at all costs. If you want to see the IMAX function, I suggest beautifully photographed "India: Kingdom of the Tiger" or technically exciting "Space Station 3D". Trust me.
