Thanks to the boring, dimensionless script of Neil Simon and the nondirecting director Robert Moore, the second chapter becomes a terrifying showcase for Marsha Mason, who received the third of four Oscar awards for the second chapter, giving the same performance she gave at Cinnderella Liberty (73), The Goodbye Girl (77), Audrey Rose (78) and Only When I Laugh (81), but this time there are no children to drag. The second chapter is the third and final feature film by Moore, who previously directed Neil Simon The Cheap Detective (78) and Murder By Death (76). Caan is unsuccessful, the characters are one-dimensional, the dialog box is too analytical and there are practically no details to set. The first half is less than captivating, fulfills the sweet, unfettered romance between the blinking Caan and the shredder Mason, and the grim second half makes you miss the first half. Locations in New York, as well as Joe Bologna, and painfully thin Valerie Harper are irrelevant, but at least they provide some distraction. And finally, during the subtitles, a horrible song was played.
