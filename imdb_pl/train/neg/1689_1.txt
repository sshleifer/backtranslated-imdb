Wow, what a total failure! The fact that people think this movie is frightening is ridiculous. Special effects were a direct rip off of The Ring. History? Was there one? Not in my opinion .. Just some brilliant pictures. The whole movie was boring, stupid, messy. I think there is always a market for bad movies with good marketing campaigns. However, this is the worst horror I have seen for years. And this Buffy chick? Well, she is a bad actress! As vivid as Barbie and equally talented ... No, wait, that would be an insult to Barbie's talents! I suppose many kids helped this movie at the box office, because it was PG-13, and if it was rated R, it would bomb IMO! Stupid movie!
