Omen IV (1991) was a bad creature for T.V. movie. Since the 80's, I think the directors were experimenting with the finish line (the medicine of choice in the 90's), because there is no other reason to explain this travesty. Why did they even bother? A t.v. movie? What were they thinking about when he appeared on the ideas board? Have they even wondered for a moment how this film could be captured. Maybe they thought he could do it as a series? We'll never find out. But I know one thing. This movie was the main reason why I never bought the Omen trilogy. They should knock out a few bucks instead of spending this "extra" CD. <br /> <br /> Omen IV is basically the average American remake of the first movie. Instead of a sweet punk kid, we get a terrible girl who is a total brat to everyone around. If the family had stronger parenting skills, none of the demonic events that took place in previous movies would ever have happened. These parents must put their feet up and do real discipline! <br /> <br /> Not recommended, it's best to avoid at all costs!
