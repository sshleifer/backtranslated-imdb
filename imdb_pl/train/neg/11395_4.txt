Not quite a new story, but this romantic comedy makes the concept work. A young man (John Cusack) and a dead, wonderful woman (Kate Beckinsale) meet by chance and wonder if they are destined for each other. Although both are promised to others ... oddly enough, they still feel that their soul mate is out there somewhere. A bit unhappy in some places, but viva la love. Being a romantic, I am almost obliged to rivet. My favorite scene is that Cusack is on the ground and the snow is starting to fall. The finale is almost too sweet, but it deserves the most. This is not one of Cusack's deepest roles, but Beckinsale could not hit him in hell. Jeremy Piven and Molly Shannon provide significant support. John Corbett plays the worst role I've ever seen. On the other hand, Eugene Levy is quirky and funny. Observe this with your soul mate.
