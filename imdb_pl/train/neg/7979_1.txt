This movie was slow, but boring, and acting often drifted into the land of ham. Redgrave's character was uninteresting like a 60-year-old woman trying to compete with Thurman's character for the love of Fox's character (why he's outside of me). The title of the film should be "Shallow people on the lake". The actors were playing like on a rehearsal. A frighteningly predictable end to startup. I can not believe that comedy is on this site!
