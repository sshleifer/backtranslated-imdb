First of all, so that I am white, so I try to lightly tread the delicate theme of the race ... in any case ... White people hate Black people = BAD, but Black people hate White people = OK (because we clearly deserved it !!) . where do I start? I would like to have something good to say about this movie except unintentional comedy scenes: the infamous scene is Ice Cube and co. fight with really big, really strong, really bad and terrifying neo-Nazis and win !!! neo-Nazis, where twice as big :), and chase! the pursuit is priceless ... This is not a movie about race, tolerance and understanding, it does not bring ... it's a racist movie that confirms all stereotypes of stereotypes, a white sly guy who is kidnapped by his black roommate automatically transforms into skinhead. .. cmon, I just terribly regret having seen him. <br /> <br /> Save your time and the horrible experience of a badly written, badly preserved, boring and clearly biased image, if you're on the subject, go to Rent American History X, now it's a movie
