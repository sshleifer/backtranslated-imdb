The premise was intriguing, but unfortunately this movie just does not affect it. Casting was pretty good and it was beautifully shot - but stylistically a large part of the direction was incoherent (too fast editing was so effective that it did not work ... I waited for Steven Bochco in the subtitles and then the ad), characters were identified only on the basis of coke on the screen (and almost everything left to Boogie Nights to develop the character), and no characters that would attract the viewer to history. A very forgotten movie.
