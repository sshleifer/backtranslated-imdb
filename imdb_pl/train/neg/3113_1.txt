This movie is a mess. I'm surprised he even has a movie release. Without Robin Williams, he would go straight to the video. It's badly written. It's poorly targeted. The worse crime is that he took on an interesting topic and reduced it to a ridiculous and BORING thriller that has no emotion, no tension and no inner or emotional logic. Especially after the first half hour, the film merges into a series of funny sets so that the audience with whom I saw it laughed at it. Save money. The trailer is completely misleading - it is not tight and there are no emotions - in fact, the really worst picture of the movie is that it is simply boring.
