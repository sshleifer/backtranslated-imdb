"National Lampoon Goes to the Movies" (1981) is the absolute worst film ever made, surpassing even the futile "Plan 9 from outer space." Film Lampoon revives in three separate and unrelated vignettes, each of which has different performers. The only common thread is the complete absence of any redemption traits. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe it is. Another reviewer on this site said that fleeting nude shots are pretty and right. Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry beautifully flash their assets, in the first and second parts, respectively. But their wonderful exhibitions are unfortunately wasted. It seems that the directors have forgotten that even T & A needs a credible history to surround it, and it is not in sight. <br /> <br /> The third segment in which Robby Benson and Richard Widmark will perform is the most disgusting of the three, and an unfortunate choice as the ending of the movie. Benson plays a young policeman with a fervent beaver who clearly informs about his first day of service, ready to free the streets from evil. It is connected to an old, cynical policeman played by Widmark, and when those partners of kerosene and waters set out together in their first patrol, we sense the possible redemption of previous film failures. Maybe, just maybe, the cynical old man will be reformed thanks to the strong sense of duty and loyalty of his new partner. Maybe everything will end happily. But unfortunately this movie is going straight to the toilet, without redemption, without a happy ending, without a consistent story of any kind. <br /> <br /> In front of "The National Pamphlet Goes to the Movies", I thought I had already seen the worst schlock Hollywood could have done. Unfortunately, I did not see half of it. <br /> <br />
