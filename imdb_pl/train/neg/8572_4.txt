A thin story concerns two small towns and their struggles for family honor. David Morse is a responsible, straightforward policeman and "good" brother; Viggo Mortensen, "bad boy", is an ex-soldier and ex-convict. As an actor (especially in the earliest years) Sean Penn seems to be modulating his performances as part of the method. By turning the screenwriter and director for the first time in this artistic, blunt drama, he works on his script and characters in the same methodical process, slowing down the pace for crawling (allegedly to catch every nuance and inflection). This approach can be fascinating if we care for three-dimensional characters, but photogenic Morse and Mortensen are not as convincing as siblings. What's worse, we expect more from promising veterans, Charles Bronson and Sandy Dennis, who almost have no chance to get anything interesting. The picture is rough, with tumultuous sequences, unstable narrative and confusing assembly (always skewed to indicate artistic excesses). Penna's tricks with the camera show the talented eye, but they are mainly annoying. * 1/2 of ****
