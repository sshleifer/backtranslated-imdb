A boring movie about a boring city in the 1950s. How can anyone think that this is a classic? The producer almost finished his career, pushing his girlfriend, Cybil Shepard, to several films that far exceeded her acting abilities. I think this film gives an insight into how bad the future films of Peter Bogdonovitch will be. Career Cybil Shepard dived after several films produced by Peter Bogdonovich. It was only in "Moonlighting" that her career began to return. I thought acting was a poor performance of "Graduate". I noticed that this movie was not shown in the USA. The only place I watched was abroad in Europe late at night.
