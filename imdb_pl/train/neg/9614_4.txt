I would not recommend it unless you care for David Copperfield and want to "complete the set." There are some good performances (eg Uriah Heep) and well-directed moments (eg Beating), but all in all really fade compared to the BBC version of 1999, as well as earlier versions. <br /> <br /> There are incomprehensible changes in history that really do not serve any great purpose, except, perhaps, nonsense (stolen jewels are an example of this). The American cast was poorly chosen: Sally Field is a good actress, but she is mistaken as Betsy Trotwood, and her English accent is only a little better than Dick Van Dyke's cockick. I can see why Michael Richards was chosen to play Mr Micawber; he, however, puts it too hard and becomes irritating. He also speaks with his lines with an accent that goes beyond eccentricity and becomes simply ridiculous. Anthony Andrews is as dangerous as Mr. Murdstone, but he is almost expected to give him a black cloak and tie David's mother to the railroad (though it may partly be Dickens' fault). <br /> <br /> I got it for free with a newspaper. It helped to pass Sunday afternoon, but I felt more disappointed than I was charmed at the end
