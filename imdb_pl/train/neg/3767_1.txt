Budget, decent actors ... who knew these things were important. Do not waste your time on this piece of rubbish. The effects are nonsense. Acting is nonsense. The only thing that could make it even bearable was a bit cheaper T & A, which would squander in the first 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> The only remote feature of this movie is very awkward vulgarity. It was as if they found only seven people on the planet who had never cursed before. Hats off! <br /> <br /> If you want to see a guy in a bad suit, come back and look at the old ferry pictures. The only way to make Bigfoot good is to have a big budget and some actors who were not from the Frogballs Community Theater.
