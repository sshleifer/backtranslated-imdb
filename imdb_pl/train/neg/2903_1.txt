About her. This film could be titled "When the writers are on strike!" What a stinker. I had high hopes for this, mainly after reading the IMDb review, which makes me think about the whole IMDb evaluation system, but it's a separate matter. I loved Steve Carrell in Anchorman, Bruce Almighty, The Office, etc., So I was expecting great things. To say that I was disappointed is the understatement of the year. There are so many mistakes with this movie, but I will limit myself to the (a) improbability of ANY family behaving as people do (mass aerobic training? What planet is THAT real life?), Awkward script (love killer? Please, a the fact that Dan's character is so unbelievable that you wonder what this girl saw in him, that she would fall in love with him? This movie was full of explosive dialogue, creaking direction, funny scenes and slow, slow, slow. half an hour if we were not with my parents who do not go out too much and they do not like to waste money. Unlike the creators of this movie, it would be better to throw all the money for this bonfire movie - it would be more entertaining. like blight.
