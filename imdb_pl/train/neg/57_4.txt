What the "executive producer" does in the film. If I remember correctly, it is the person who raised financial support to make a movie. You can see that in many movies with Sean Connery he is also an executive producer, which meant that Connery alone raised the money because he is the main player. Unfortunately, it should also be noted that many of the films "with Sean Connery were made solely because he managed to raise money because he is the main Hollywood player, usually shows that when the subtitles read that the executive producer and movie star is one and thus the film itself is nothing more than a stellar vehicle with a story / scenario unbearable <br /> <br /> PROTOCOL follows the saga of one Sunny Davis, a kooky bimboesque waitress who rescues a visiting dignitary, and as a reward becomes a recognized diplomat. Probably? As Mrs. Davis progresses (who has problems connecting two sentences together) she finds herself in more bizarre and less likely situations. Hawn, who is also the executive producer of the film, do you understand what I am saying about the story / scenario is not up to zero?
