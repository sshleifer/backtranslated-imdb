This movie lost me with a crossbow RPG (a rocket-propelled grenade). It was as if someone was cutting and pasting the scene with Robocop. I was expecting Beowulf to say, "I LIKE IT!" <br /> <br /> I watched this because I like Chris Bruno from the TV series "The Dead Zone" and he did his part. He chose a strange accent, but at least he remained coherent for the whole movie - unlike any of his costumes. They kept coming in all kinds of speech from old English to modern English, sometimes in the same sentence. <br /> <br /> There are already many comments about how this movie differs from the source material. However, even the story itself is not good. It's just boring, what even a low budget does not justify. A low budget means you must have at least a good story, dialogue and decent acting. These things cost little. Instead, they spent their money on semi-professional CGI and some decent costumes and sets. <br /> <br /> Life is too short to watch this movie.
