All of the ridiculous things in this series are based on the fact that the main character Jim is either a bad father, a bad husband, or generally just extremely selfish. How can it be fun? Of course, the sitcom character must be defective, but Jim's character is faulty in an extremely unpleasant way. <br /> <br /> And why is it? My guess is that it's because "it should be better now". Jim is not a fool, he can take care of things and he has the opportunity. But he does not want to. It's a conscious choice that you take when you do not want to play with your kids, do not go shopping because you do not want to buy "women's products" and this is the choice you make when you put relatives. <br /> The other heroes appear to be only in the series, so Jim can have someone who can be a jerk. If Cheryl were a real person, she would have left him many years ago and would not have been dead for eight years. But, unfortunately, it is only a catalyst for Jim's eccentric egoism from the middle class.
