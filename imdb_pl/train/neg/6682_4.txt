This comedy is not really funny. It's an affair that plays so much about stereotypes that it has no effect. It's a caper movie, so the derivative - yes, even then - does not have a side dish. <br /> <br /> The cast is right. More than hard to say. However, it is nice that players are unknown. Robert Montgomery would appear in MGM. The wife of a businessman who had no time for anything but work could be any number of actresses. <br /> <br /> We may be grateful that this little-known film is populated by performers unknown today. And the production value is not terrible. But that does not make a real impression. <br /> <br /> This is a general knock down. Who wants it?
