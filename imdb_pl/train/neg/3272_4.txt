I will say one thing about this film: there is no silence. You can not get bored watching this. The problem is that it is too intense. There are too many actions and NEED MONEY! It's the risk you're taking in modern action movies. You want it to be interesting, but not exaggerated. This is exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Although the game is fine and contains a few "names" in Gary Busey and Roy Scheider, it still has the impression of film "B". The best part of this is the Scheidera dialogue: the only "A" part of the movie "B". <br /> <br /> The rest of the story is strictly Rambo's mentality, but it had some special scenes. In particular, it was a very innovative scene with landmines. It was unforgettable. Few other scenes were to make it a long-time guardian.
