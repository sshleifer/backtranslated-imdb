I try to be very objective when I watch a low-budget movie. I also use lower weight for independent and low-budget productions in comparison with productions with large budgets. I expect almost flawlessness from large budget productions and their studies. That's why I use more stringent criteria for major studio publishing houses. But this movie was just a dud. Dot. The assumption was terrible. The main character, Mary Gordano (Alicia Silverstone), was unbelievable as a high school student with a relentless desire to solve crimes. In her character or her acting there was not enough depth to draw you into her world. In addition, to make the film more mysterious, lighting in some scenes has not set the mood, especially in the magazine. <br /> <br /> Once again, another disappointing movie in which I could give only three points.
