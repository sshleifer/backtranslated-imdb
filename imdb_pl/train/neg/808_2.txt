Extremely disappointing film based on the novel by James Michenera. <br /> <br /> Marlon Brando's performance was even worse. His southern thrust was ridiculous. I realized that I was laughing when he spoke, as if he sounded like an elderly southern lady returning home to take shelter. Brando, great in previous films, has been reduced to laughter. Tyrone Power in "Witness for the Prosecution" should be nominated for the best actor instead of Brando here. <br /> <br /> The film, which deals with racism, dealt with the US government's attempt to avoid marriages between American soldiers and Japanese women. <br /> <br /> Brando was stony in the whole movie. His transition from anti-relationships to pro occurs when he finds love with an Asian woman. His emotions and conversations made it difficult to understand how he could support such new views. <br /> <br /> Only you know why Red Buttons and Miyoshi Umeki received supportive Oscars for their performances. Nothing about any of the performances was equally impressive. The appearance of Umeki on the screen was short and it did not represent anything. Miiko Taka made a better performance in this film, which presented itself well as Brando's love interest. She showed great emotions as anti-American, who found love for Brando. Her face was engraved with the unhappiness she had for losing her father and brother during the 11th World War. She realized that her dance was not her way out of this existence that she lived. <br /> <br /> Martha Scott went with Hebrew mother Yochobel in the "Ten Commandments" for a great mother with Brando's amorous interest at the beginning. Her performance together with the performance of Ricardo Montalban was wasted. Patricia Owens, as Brando's first love, showed the depth and conviction in her performance.
