I recently watched the first movie The Guinea pig, The Devil's Experiment, and I have to admit that I'm disappointed. <br /> <br /> This movie is consistently put on every list of "worst" movies and maybe I expected more because it's buzzing. The truth is, I do not judge it. <br /> <br /> If I were to see that the believer's opening text is real ("I found this tape ..."), I could be a little worried about it, thinking it was real. Even without the benefits of knowing that it is not real, I think I would make sure that it really is not. <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie, the girl's reactions to what she's doing is simply not what they should be. She should scream in pain like a banshee. The fact that she is not means that this is obviously not true. I would not like to see it if it was real, but if it was more convincing in its operation, the film would be more disturbing. <br /> <br /> And then there are known scenes: nothing touches me at all until the scalpel in my hand. Hot oil, worms and guts did not bother me. I'm not saying that I'm "hard"; only that I was unable to suspend my disbelief, partly because of the girl's inaction. <br /> <br /> The scalpel forced me to bend slightly, but the hammer in my hand only made my hand look like rubber. And the last scene with the eye again was a little flashy, but nothing more. I did not want to look away and I felt nauseous. <br /> <br /> Maybe because the movie is twenty-something years old, or maybe I'm just tired. The truth is, I did not find this film disturbing at all. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of thing you can expect, playing the loop as an installation of modern art and as an exercise in removing characters, history, etc. and simply leaving torture, works on some levels. As a disturbing piece of film, it did not work for me. <br /> <br /> I watched a guinea pig with my wife who is "just bent with a movie" and wondered what all the fuss was about. We talked about why I watch these movies, and I have many reasons, but I want to be touched by a movie. She said she did not think any movie would be so persuasive as to interfere with her and challenge her to do just that. I played in the scene of an extinguisher from Irreversible and was actually disturbed. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if I'm right, except that we were both more concerned about the scene in a non-horror movie genre than any movie that has been disturbing so far.
