It's a terrible movie. All three stories are surrounded by a psychiatrist hypnotist who is unnecessary and all stories are bad. The first concerns wild wolves and a certain lady, there are some things that do not make sense, but hypnotism rewards. The second, with the bad Bill Paxton as a manic roommate, should not be watched by anyone. Last, unfortunately, the best is almost incomprehensible, which probably makes it better than other garbage.
