I gave him 2 just because Natassia Malthe (as vampire Quintan) looks sooooo sexy in this movie. <br /> <br /> There is certainly very little logic in this movie, but most of the vampire sci-fi movie. The film probably tried too much to break away from traditional vampire stories. Unfortunately, this has gone too far and made the whole story not only unreasonable, but also absurd. <br /> <br /> There are too many gore and too many scenes of rupture from the body that made me feel sick. A good movie about vampires should be more sensible, because you do not have to see a lot of blood - we all know when a vampire jumps on a man who will do what a vampire does. Just a few moans or screams to describe the scene (like the one at the end, when Quintana tries to excite Rosa, just a few moans, the rest is your imagination). In any case, it's just my personal taste.
