If I knew John Wayne was in this movie, I would not see him. It's humiliating for the Japanese, unfortunate for Hollywood and embarrassing for every thinking person. But then, most of John Wayne's movies are like that. Hollywood in the fifties still believed that everyone in the world loves Americans when the truth is (and still is) a bit different. The film concerns the nineteenth century isolationism of Japan. Maybe Hollywood should be isolated. To put it as succinctly as possible, this movie is frightening, chauvinistic.
