I remember when I saw this movie for the first time, when it happened, I was in the sixth grade. Before I saw it, I listened to the original Broadway recording and I really liked it! But when I saw it, I was like, what the hell ?! This movie lacks many songs from the musical for loud crying! Who decided to do it?! <br /> <br /> I'm really a big fan of Gene Kelly, but this movie is probably the worst of the musical he's ever done! The film was more like a Hollywood set than the beautiful Highlands of Scotland. Who the hell decided to cut out all the Meg songs from the movie ?! <br /> <br /> I am willing to bet that when they saw this movie, Lerner and Lowe probably wondered: "Who in the world decided to do it in our masterpiece?" Well, they had the right to say that if it did, they were probably angry at the fact that Hollywood turned their big musical into a rather empty movie. <br /> <br /> The song and playing smartly Kelly, you passed the audition in the colors of the flying, but you're in a movie that lacks a lot of text. <br /> <br /> In short, if you want a good movie based on the musical of Frederick Lowe and Alan Jay Lerner, this is not it! <br /> <br /> 3/10
