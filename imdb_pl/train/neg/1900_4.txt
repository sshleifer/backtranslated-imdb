Randall "Memphis" Raines is a retired car thief who is forced to return to the "game" when his younger brother faces death for failing to follow the orders of the British head of crime Raymond Calitri. The task is to "raise" 50 cars within 24 hours or Calitri will perform a penalty. So Raines quickly gathers a crew he can trust and sets a task to do. But the police are with him, and some cars on the list are not easy. It seems almost impossible to do. <br /> <br /> He has enough cast, Gone In 60 Seconds, Nicolas Cage, Angelina Jolie, Robert Duvall, Will Patton, Delroy Lindo, Vinnie Jones, Giovanni Ribisi, Christopher Ecclestone, Scott Caan and Timothy Olyphant. Everyone who deserves better. Sufficient power to propel the Porsche 998 Turbo. The problem is that it is to a large extent the case of too many cars overloaded in the parking lot, to a large extent, signs, insufficient joy. From the very beginning, we have no doubt that it is a production of Bruckheimer / Simpson, a scandalous scenario interspersed with loud noises and the sounds of cheese, a scattergun editor and a guided hammer subtly by Dominik Sena. It's basically a big remake of the H.B. budget. Halicki's independent film from 1974 with the same name, with the premise of offering the potential for an adrenaline powered car-based movie. Potential that, unfortunately, never happens. There are one or two moments of impact, certainly stupid, but pleasant. But if you forgive the pun, the movie will never come out of first gear, it's more content to work with your character's characters who are trying to make this rude scenario {Scott Rosenberg} work. <br /> <br /> The car fans will get something from this {cars are an ace in the eye}, just like fans of unintentional comedy movies {see the moment of Ecclestone's mourning}. But no, everything is very weak. 4/10
