This is one of the two post-apocalyptic fantasy films that Albert Pyun made in 1993 - and this is a bad movie. Apparently all his energy went to "Nemesis", which was a fun non-stop action movie and had a much more expensive look. "Knights" are clumsy and cheesy, a sci-fi from the bottom, which too often resembles a video game (new opponents appear all the time and have to be exterminated as soon as possible). The only thing that saves this movie from the basket is Kathy Long; not a very attractive woman, but undeniably a brutally effective fighting machine. As for Kris Kristofferson, considering his age at that time (58), I hope his stunt double was well paid. (* 1/2)
