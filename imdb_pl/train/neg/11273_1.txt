How can you collect a respectable cast of young British actors and come up with a stack of film fertilizer? A horrible scenario, an annoyingly hectic camera, horribly edited, terribly badly preserved. Only Rhys Ifans tries to fulfill his role with life. Another painful proof that "other" sometimes means "dreck". Why money, which people do not read before? Do yourself a favor: save and do something else - like hammering on your knees. It's less painful and more enjoyable than this movie!
