I watched the movie and hoped that things would improve all the time. What's so great about a guy without emotions? * ziewanie * <br /> <br /> You never see that Alex shows emotions to anyone other than his son. Yes, I know that's why his son is the only one who makes him lose his temper (if you can call it that), I understand. <br /> <br /> Characters are undeveloped, relationships are not given enough time to understand. In one scene, Sarah says they will not fall in love, and the next time we see her, he talks about how his death really shook her because they were so close? This film is full of logical synapses. <br /> <br /> It's like someone watching Boogie Nights and writing this part by imitating Little Bill. Even the scene in which "losing self-control" is the same as when Small Bill shoots a wife, up to the facial expressions (or lack thereof). Yes, William H. Macy is good at presenting a man without emotions - he was there, he did it - can you say Magnolia? <br /> <br /> In this movie there was no shortage of emotions, lack of content, good script, well-developed characters and plot. And I definitely miss my recommendation. :) <br /> <br /> ~ A ~
