I have never seen an older, highly-rated version from 1973. I'm a fan of Nicholas Cage (by the way, it works fine as usual). This movie probably took five minutes to create the entire story (I see it happens on a cocktail napkin at the party) if you can not finish this salivation in the first thirty minutes. probably this movie is funny. This is a terrible routine recently, which Hollywood seems to dig for itself in the genre of horrors / secrets / thrillers, unable to provide the audience enough recognition and write a fresh, wise and tempting scenario, give away some terrible music and throw a few things to jump a little, and then send the final print to the local theater. At least he did not have this manual camera syndrome.
