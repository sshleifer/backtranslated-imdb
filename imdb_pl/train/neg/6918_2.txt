I went to this movie believing that it has good grades. First of all, it's ridiculous that they release a movie made in 2001, seven years later in 2008 in India. Everything in the film looks outdated. Even in 2001, the film looks like it was made on the budget of the shoe string. There is a scene in which a taxi hits a man to work out how low a budget can be obtained. Anthony Hopkins does not seem to know what he's doing in the movie. It ends with a long monologue. If the movie had bright sparks during this scene, I missed it when I slept in its place. Nothing about Jennifer Love Hewitt looks like a devil. He wears badly-fitting tritium clothes and grimaces at random children. When it comes to Alec Baldwin, you can not miss the scene where he meets Webster for the first time. What a waste of money! As Anthony Hopkins rightly put it: "Go back home and write better!"
