It is important not to be offended by a lack of logic or common sense, and those who have "gray issues" will agree that this movie simply does not work. <br /> <br /> Problems lie in the direction, throw selections and lack of depth in the character building. The word comedy was very difficult to say when I expect to laugh when these words are used. Let's look at problems in the direction / script. <br /> <br /> A brother and sister aged 30 appear to be well-adjusted. In the park they meet a stranger, and the figure of Heather Graham approaches her and asks the most intimate questions that even a half-healthy person runs the other way or at least yells at the policeman. Then she awkwardly walks up and makes some silly statements, and she falls on him. Then, after ONE date, when they all leave together, he falls in love with her and decides to get married in Vegas in a week? Hey, does anyone else feel stupid? He goes out with thousands of women and meets that one person who speaks about 10 words that we see on the screen and wants to marry her. Not only was there no chemistry, but it makes no sense. Sure, it's a romantic comedy and I want to believe it, but the direction made it completely flat. <br /> <br /> Now Heather also falls with her and when Heather Graham and Bridget Moynahan (very shallow figure) kiss, or more, to the point that it was the worst kiss chemistry could have. I considered it unromantic and indecent, and while many say that Heather can not act, I think the reality is obvious that Heather was the wrong person for this role. <br /> <br /> It was Sue Kramer's debut as a director and it was too much for me to chew. Making this movie would take a lot of craft, and IMHO would do it with the help of better writers and casters.
