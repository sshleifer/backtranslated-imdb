I really felt cheated after seeing this photo. I felt like sitting watching 101 minutes for nothing. I do not understand what they were thinking about when they did it. Jeffrey Dahmer's murder is almost out of the question and there is no end. I felt almost as if they had left this movie open to the sequel. It was like watching a TV episode of Sopranos. It ends abruptly and you know that next week will be the next episode. I also felt that I was just watching part 1 of the two-part movie. There are many possibilities for what went wrong here; they got lazy, they ran out of money, they did not know the rest of the story, they wanted to create Dahmer 2. After watching this movie they all sound very accurate. I watched Jeffrey Dahmer walking through the woods. Suddenly, I hear this music, and then the screen appears and says how Dahmer served his 2-year sentence and was attacked by a fellow prisoner and killed at the age of 34. forests until death in prison. What do you say about how he got there. What do you say to show the Dahmer process. What do you say to show a few details? I can not even explain what happened in this movie because it was jumping all over the place. In fact, I said that I was saying in disbelief: "That's all, is it the end?" I would like to end this review, saying that there is still a good Dahmer movie. For filmmakers, I'd like to say, if you're going to do it, do it right.
