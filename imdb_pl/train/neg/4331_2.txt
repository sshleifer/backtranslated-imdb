Soon after watching this movie, you'll realize why he did not even reach theaters! This movie does not deserve the "prequel" tag. Instead, this is a common topic in Hollywood, strip away previous good movies with catastrophic prequels, sequels, etc. <br /> <br /> The story of this movie has been reflected in every place like a ping-pong ball, and the development of the character was non-existent. I really felt that I was watching a comedy at some moments of the movie because acting was so bad. P Diddy must stop harassing movies with his horrible action, he really made me laugh every time. <br /> <br /> The only good thing that comes out of this movie is Jaclyn DeSantis, who looks great in this movie, it brought some pleasure from watching this movie. <br /> <br /> If you're a big fan of Carlito's Way, I do not recommend watching it. If you decide to watch this movie anyway, treat it as if it were tearing the original off because it did exactly that.
