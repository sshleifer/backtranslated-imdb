This is probably the worst movie ever made, only the bad one that has the name Roger Corman. I could understand it in his early years when he had lower budgets, but nowadays there are no excuses to give birth! I am a pervert from the movie "B", and from the point of view of some people, all the films I love are put aside by "ordinary viewers", but accept my word on the subject, the Vampire club is at the top of my list of the best of the worst. It's hard to imagine, vampires without fangs, the music is completely out of place, the sound effects are simply ineffective and finally Mr.Savage does not seem to know that he is in the vampire movie at all, and the witch is too angry because he had " nice "career over everything. Let me know that I am difficult because when I do not like the movie, I forget about its good side.
