If you want to watch a movie that is strangely filmed, strangely lit, strange stories of these men (and one woman) who like to beat each other, if you want to enjoy a story that never goes out of these two guys, one boxer and the other a gay so you should watch this movie. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, I almost felt as bruised and cut as the director (film) itself, to break free from me. <br /> <br /> This is a movie in which you do not have to watch the plot or the great acting, it is a movie in which you can stare with horror and astonishment. Like watching a plane crash or a train wreck. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a great movie, a good movie, a movie "B" or even an average movie, this movie is not it. <br /> <br /> Warning for all who watch this movie, please do not eat earlier. You may want to puke at the end of the movie.
