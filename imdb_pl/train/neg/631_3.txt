Amazing. That's what you would say if you were in this movie. Simply, amazingly, amazingly. It's really amazing that everyone was stupid enough to make money so that this monstrosity would simply not believe what you see. This, my friends, is really scary in this movie. Someone thought it was a good idea. <br /> <br /> Well, here's another amazingly original story: a high school student (sometimes he seemed to be a student) has a slut for his mother, he lives in a trailer park and is an "artist" who is ridiculed for his "being different" . Well, of course, this poor, mocked boy is finally killed, and here is his original part, his soul is inhabited by a scarecrow (under which he is killed by his newest John from the slutty mom). Then he goes with the standard killing of all the people who hurt him. Awww. <br /> <br /> Here is the division: <br /> <br /> Good: <br /> <br /> - An extremely funny movie, even if the filmmakers did not want it clearly. <br /> <br /> - This and continuation on one disk in the Wal-Mart basket $ 5.00, so it is only a bit too expensive. <br /> <br /> Does not hurt him, Didn 't Help: <br /> <br /> - Violence and gore are a kind of sub-standard. One person is stabbed with corncob. <br /> <br /> - Sounds like they put a little effort into the music? But it does not really match the movie? And it's not that good. /> <br /> Bad: <br /> <br /> - Horrible, horrible acting. <br /> <br /> - Another weaker disappointment with sexy women, none of them removes clothes. When did it stop being the basis of cut eyebrows? <br /> <br /> - A disturbing story. <br /> <br /> - Scarecrow vomits a one-liners that would make Freddy Krueger and Arnold Swartzenegger blush. <br /> <br /> - A standard love story does not go anywhere and is badly done. <br /> <br /> - Some of the dead seem to be randomly selected? you never really know who is someone and then they are killed. And you only assume they had to do it. <br /> <br /> Brzydcy: <br /> <br /> - Extremely average fare, only a murderous scarecrow instead of ?? Well, all other nonsense. <br /> <br /> - Somewhere interesting, like Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, Pinhead, Chucky, and even Angela from the "Sleepaway Camp" series, all of which are better than cruelty. <br /> <br /> - Absolutely the worst dialogue I have ever heard in my LIFE. The scenario is burdened with a level of delay that I never imagined could exist. I'm serious, this is a full step beyond terrible. Do not get me wrong, but it's fun how the hell? But I've never heard more jokes, even in the Slumber Party Massacre III. This movie makes "Jason X" look like Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> - A man who kills a boy who becomes a scarecrow: the worst wig ever. Dialogue for the match. <br /> <br /> Niezapomnia scena: <br /> <br /> - The one in which primary school youth spits out their witty dialogue: "Hey, let's go find small animals for torture. Huh huh. "<br /> <br /> Acting: 3/10 History: 3/10 Atmosphere: 2/10 Photos: 1/10 Character development: 2/10 Special effects / makeup: 5/10 Nudity / Sexuality: 1/10 (No nudity, Mama is a slut, girls do not wear bras) Violence / Gore: 5/10 (Poor quality, average amount) Dialogue: 0/10 (Extremely absurd, glaring, exaggerated and painfully funny, so bad, that's good. the first rating for the dialogue in each film!) Music: 5/10 Director: 2/10 <br /> <br /> Tastefulness: 10/10 Happiness: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Generally: 3/10 <br /> <br /> Another for people like me who like to watch pure nonsense, or full-length filmmakers, this is not a good movie at all. A humorous dialogue and characters make it impossible for him to get bored. <br /> <br /> www .ResidentHazard.com
