I just saw a movie in the theater. The film has few good points to discuss. It can be the beauty of Kareena and a few songs. This is it. The film is a complete disappointment in all areas. Anyone associated with the film will be disappointed, even Mumbai Indians (right now Chennai has reached the semi-finals). <br /> <br /> But the worst thing about the movie I have is action scenes. Now Bollywood is trying to copy scenes from Hollywood. They forget, however, that Hollywood directors make a big impact to make it look real. But unfortunately, Bollywood directors do not have much time. They spend time on the songs and advertising of the film. Now such too stupid action scenes can work in the south, because the audience simply pays for watching their favorite actor killing a group of people. But in Bollywood it certainly will not work. All action scenes that I would like to convey. In the end, even some of the Chinese appear out of nowhere to defeat Akshay Kumar. This is the peak of stupidity. The audience does not pay for watching such stupidity. I think Bollywood should now forget about action movies. They can not do this. The last good action I saw was from "Ghatak" and "Khiladiyon ka Khialdi". The current scene in Bollywood is really sad for fans of action movies like me. Do these people see their movie after finishing? Can not they understand that slow-motion action (which is done with ropes) is too unrealistic and childish? It is better not to have action scenes if you can not deal with them. I just want to go back to the era of Amitabh, where a movie like Zanjeer and Deewar had exciting action scenes. The sound effect was not very effective in those days, but visually it is much better than the current scenes from the era. <br /> <br /> This movie should now open the eyes of the Bollywood directors. Do not do more action movies until you've mastered realistic art.
