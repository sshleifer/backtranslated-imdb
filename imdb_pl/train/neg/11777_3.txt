Many years ago I saw the Godfather and it made a lasting impression on me, the atmosphere of the film was first class, unforgettable acting and the classic plot. I recently bought Trilogy and after watching Part 1 I looked back to watch Part 2 again ...... I was so happy that I understood part 2 early on, that it's a matching continuation of the great Godfather movie, everything was almost perfect again I was looking forward to seeing Godfather III ........ WRONG! The plot was not good, it seemed to me that history consists only of history, the characters were weak, especially the daughter. Pacino's charge was a weak hero who would be eaten alive in Godfather 1 or 2. Then scenes like Corleone were invested in all the Catholic Church traps with a full choir, a horse-riding killer in the direction of sunset, an invisible helicopter shooter meeting (where "treats" they run away and everyone else is shot), the daughter and the first cousin are rolling pieces of pasta on the board, pathetic shooting on the stairs ... Corleone pushes him with orange juice for diabetes (a man with intelligence and deception is not ready for an emergency? ) ... NO, it was not good and with the best will in the world I will not be able to watch it again. But I will watch 1 and 2 times over the years.
