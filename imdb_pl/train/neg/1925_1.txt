Ron Howard directed it? Cartoon from 1966. Is adorable, teaching children a simple lesson, using a simple storyline. In this movie, Howard gives us Whoville filled with greedy, manipulative, egocentric people. Jim Carrey is terrible, but I'm sure it's not his fault; I imagine that the scenario required the most disgusting person you can imagine, so Carrey gave Tom Green the effect, and the effect is the magic of the movie. Like Danny Devito's Penguin in Batman's Returns, Carrey's Grinch is so unlike himself that any comedy that can be extracted from his character simply evaporates. Where in the cartoon from 1966 Grinch appeared, with whom we could all be identified, Carrey's Grinch is a furious, heartless old man whom we all saw at one time or another, sitting in a parked car, muttering to something or stumbling children in the supermarket his chick. This Grinch is completely devoid of any degree of humanity, humor or insight, and his redemption at the end of the film is false. The whole movie sounds false: there is some stupid Christmas lighting competition, an unsuccessful attempt to explain why Grinch is such a jerk, delving into his childhood, and an unidentifiable mystery, why some of them have this strange extension of their lips, and some of them do not . In contrast to the cartoon from 1966, I imagine that children would find the film tiresome, irritating and full of conflicting messages. Did we really need to see Slutty Smurf, also known as Christine Baranski as Martha May Whovier? In addition, Ron Howard filled the cast with his unarmed relatives. Put the required jokes on the ass, farts jokes, sex jokes and other carreyesque's obligatory moods, and you have a movie that is so far from the 1966 cartoon (or the book that inspired it) from which George W. Bush comes from, rational, conscious thought. Thumb down on this big fat turkey.
