When the film begins, the narrator warns us that the SKULL OF BACKGROUND is so frightening that you can die of fear - and if that happens, a free funeral is guaranteed. Well, I do not think anyone would die for fear of watching the movie, but a few could die of boredom. THE SCREAMING SKULL is a kind of movie that makes Ed Wood look good. <br /> <br /> Very loosely based on the famous Francis Marion Crawford story, SKULL is about a rich but nervous woman who marries an ominous man whose first wife died in mysterious circumstances. After being installed in her home, she is tormented by a gardener's half-naked, poorly made portrait, peacocks and finally a skull that rolls around the room and causes it to scream a lot. And on her account, actress Peggy Webber screams quite well. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, her ability to do this is the most important thing in the movie. The plot is quite clear, to put it mildly, and although the cast is fine, the script is awful, and the movie is so boring that you'll be ready to shout yourself. It's true that this thing only lasts about sixty-eight minutes, but everything seems a lot longer. Add really awful print quality to it, and here you are. <br /> <br /> There are films that are so bad that they are fun to watch. It is true that THE SCREAMING SKULL has a few hoes - but the movie drags so much that I could not work more than chuckle from time to time, and by the time the whole thing is over, your head will bounce off boredom. If it was not for Peggy Webber to scream, it would be a reliable remedy for insomnia. Let him miss him. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
