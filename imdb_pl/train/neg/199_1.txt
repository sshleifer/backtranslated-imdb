It's a scary movie, a terrible script, a bad direction and a meaningless ending. Also bad performances, except for Clancy Brown, who is not allowed here, and Michael Pollard. Watching this movie was a Purgatory - you do it to unload enough of the karma from the movie to actually see a good bit further. <br /> <br /> The movie presents a father and son who look like they could not each have probably been connected. Part of the male advantage is not well written and in this role it seems not very charismatic. You can see that the plot is a mile away. The actions of female lead and the actions of her brother, the cop, do not make sense either. Thus, a large action from her side at the end of the film does not make sense in the scriptural sense.
