I liked the graphic novel of Bilal very much when it appeared, and I was amazed when I saw the trailer of the movie, and even more when I discovered that Bilal himself directed it. The film was a big disappointment though. Visualizations are not close to the rich and rough text of original works of art, and history is poorly told. It seems that Bilal decided to focus on the more esoteric aspects of the graphic novel, and he does not do too well. <br /> <br /> The most pleasant part of the original graphic novel was the relationship of friendship with the hatred between Nikopol and Horus. They were both outside of their proper time and place, forced by circumstances. First of all, they were fun and nice. Not so here. Nikopol has no discernible personality, and Horus is a pompous asshole who wants to lie down. Even though the movie is French, Horus does not have to be! <br /> <br /> We've all seen movies that we liked, but for some reason we would not recommend it to everyone. I would not recommend an Immortel to anyone, except as a warning not to overdo it with talent and resources. Bilal is a master of storytelling, but of course he is not the master of any visual medium.
