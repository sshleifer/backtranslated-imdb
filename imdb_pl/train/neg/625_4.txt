With all the excessive violence in this film it could have been NC-17. But gore could be pg-13 and there were a lot of curses when my mother had an original boy with bad hair. There was a lot of character development that made the movie better for watching, and then when the kid came back to life as a scarecrow, there was a mindless hour and ten minutes of killing people. Violence was too high and I think the bodycount was higher than twelve, which is a large number for such films. Almost every character in the movie is stabbed or chopped off the head, but the teacher who called him "white garbage" and "hooligan" (though the character Lester is something other than hooligan, not even close, I know the hoods and I am part of the hood, do not draw in classroom, sit and throw things at the teacher). The teacher deserved more macabre death than any of the characters, but he was simply stabbed in the back. There were two taut scenes in the movie, but they did not last long enough to be terrifying at all. As I said, the killings were excessive and sometimes people who have nothing to do with the plot cut off their heads. If it was really fun, it would be nc-17. Two children describe the body found on cornfields, describe them as much worse than it actually was, explained to the police that worms crawl in the guts of boys. His stomach was not even cut, so there was no way the worms would be in his stomach, although I'd like to see it. Acting was pathetic, the characters were lost, and the scarecrow could perform a lot of aerobatics. I suggest you rent this movie on death scenes, I will not see it again in the near future, but I liked excessive violence. Also, do not worry about continuing, I watched it for five minutes and I was bored to death, it sounds good, but it's not. The original scarecrow really interested me.
