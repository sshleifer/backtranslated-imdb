Julia (Kristina Copeland) travels with her husband Steven Harris (Steven Man) and their small son Alex to spend a few days with her family on her own island, Savage Island. The couple expects to solve their problems over the weekend on a distant island. While waiting for the boat, Julia and Steven meet two strange men in the port, and when her brother Peter arrives (Brendan Beiser), he explains that the island has a family of squatters from the hills. Reckless Peter smokes a pot while driving a truck at night and turns off the headlamp to show off; however, he accidentally bumps into the young son of Savage's family, but in the dark he believes he has an animal. Later, the Savage family claims that Alex receives compensation for his lost son. The young family does not accept trade, and they initiate a deadly war between families. <br /> <br /> "Savage Island" is a movie with a very low budget, with a stupid script, amateur photos, but a surprisingly good acting. This erroneous story is completely absurd and there are many incredible situations. For example, how can two men leave two women with a child alone on the road at night with the threat of a mad family? The logical procedure would be to immediately go to the mainland and bring the police to rescue Peter. Then the young family disappears; Julia and Steven leave their car on the continent and their home and friends, and no one is chasing them? Peter summons his sister Julia with Alex when he arrives with the boat at the beginning. There are so many mistakes in this movie that I can devote many poems about it. I believe that this movie was filmed using a home video camera, so horrible that the pictures are. A good cast deserved better material for work. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Ilha de Sangue" ("Blood Island")
