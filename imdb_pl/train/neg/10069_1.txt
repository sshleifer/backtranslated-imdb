It's a terrible movie. Yes, the girls are nice, but they are not very good. A conspiracy about a cowboy involved in an Indian girl would be interesting if sex did not interrupt. Well, it may be interesting, but it is not because it is so badly controlled and only partially works. I can only imagine what the close-ups of dancing knocks on the big screen looked like, probably more ridiculous than on television. (I will not even mention the fight on a topless knife between two women who are tied together and spend a whole chest on their chests, never read about it in the old west.) This is a film that requires liberal use of fast scrolling. <Br> <br /> I like Schlock's movies, but it's funny. There is a reason why I do not go for this kind of film and they are not very good, because the plot is on the back of my chest. The original nudie cuties, as they were called, were originally nudist films or films in which there were no emotions, but as the adult industry developed, either the filmmakers either tried to be clever or tried to use something else to put butts in the seats. Very few were very clever who left hacks with limited talent. Comedies often performed best with humor approaching the first degree, infantile, but harmless. Something that can rarely be said of any other species cross disguised as boredom. <br /> <br /> Ramrodder looks good and has some nice songs, but it's made because he's neither a western nor a sex movie. <Br> <br /> I do not have to watch it anymore. <br /> <br /> Bobby Beausoleil, a member of the Manson family, who has been arrested for murdering a school teacher shortly after watching the film, has probably played an interesting role in the film. <br /> <br /> Of course, these kinds of things will ruin the lives of some people.
