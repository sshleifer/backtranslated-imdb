SHALLOW GRAVE begins with a tribute or shower break in PSYCHO. (I'm leaning towards tearing.) Then it gets worse and then surprisingly better and better, almost to be original. Bad acting and amateur directing is quite an interesting story, but the movie already exceeds many in the genre "Yankee comes from the south to die because of many rednecks" because it is actually shot in the south. <br /> <br /> A group of college girls goes to Ft. Lauderdale for summer holidays and are planted in Georgia by a flat tire after descending from the main road. (Note to the Yankees: stay on the highway when you go to Florida.) Sue Ellen (Lisa Stahl) has to pee, so she goes to the forest. When he finally finds a good place to do business, he testifies that the local sheriff (Tony March) strangled his lover (Merry Rozelle) to death. (Note to Yankees: do not go to the woods when you are in the South, not because you can be a murder, but you can come across a marijuana plantation.) This is a point where history, not a movie, really comes close to being good. <br /> <br /> While Tony March will never have to practice his Oscar speech, his sheriff Dean becomes a frightening facsimile of a normal guy torn apart by what he did and what he must do. Tom Law is sympathetic as Scott's deputy and is an equally authentic southern deputy I've seen since Walton Goggins (deputy Steve Naish) at HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES. <br /> <br /> Several scenes in the movie are worth mentioning. Girls stop at a barbecue in South Carolina and show their racism when a big black guy checks them out. Sue Ellen enters the barn to hide behind hay bales and in a shockingly realistic moment, a huge snake hides with her in the hay. <br /> <br /> And on the strangest scene, Sheriff Dean wants to rape Patty (Carol Cadby) and tells her to take off her clothes. Dean turned on the radio to drown out the noise of what he was about to do. Preacher on the radio must go back and read his Bible. His sermon speaks of how Jezebel is saved by the blood of Jesus Christ. I feel sorry for the preacher's flock. Jezebel was in the Old Testament several thousand years before the birth of Christ and she is not one of the five people you will meet in Heaven.
