A difficult to categorize movie. I never gave him a 110% concentration, so it was as easy as it seemed I could not say for sure who exactly did what the American FBI heroes were and what their roles were. I could not take Irwins seriously as film heroes when their lines and scenes were in the style of one of his programs, not played. <br /> <br /> This is nothing more than the glorified episode of Discovery TV show, with an insignificant sub department that seemed to bother. Although Irwin's show is always worth watching, this movie is also worth watching, but not on Christmas. Speaking of this, I have better things to do than being here. <br /> <br /> High 4/10
