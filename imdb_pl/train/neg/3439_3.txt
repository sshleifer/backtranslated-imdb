***** probably smaller spoilery ****** <br /> <br /> I can not say I liked it, but I can not say that it is not ... it's very strange. It has bad things in it, like a shark that appears out of nowhere with the worst CGI imaginable. If I was a director, I would certainly cut out that part, give me the urge to stop watching the rest of the movie. .. For some people it will be boring, because he lacks action, sometimes he feels at home ... Let's take, for example, the scene in which one of the friends died and what they do, what is it? nop, do not cry ... their stories of horrors to each other .. * Sighs * (just after weeping went missing) <br /> <br /> Another foolish thing was that they talked in a boat, which they had hundreds of candles on the table in front of them. .. the boat is surrounded by some rags (old rags covering the windows) and sofas / couches ... I thought it was stupid, using candles, but not thinking about the surroundings, apart from loneliness in the sea ... <br /> <br / > Good, scary scenes that are nicely done. Sometimes the horror works better when it's hidden when it's behind something instead of showing it, so this movie does it well, maybe because it's not low budget but works well for me! You will feel the tension if you forget about some holes, such as the ones I mentioned above. <br /> <br /> Do not expect too much! but if you like any movies, watch it, be patient, try to enjoy .. lol <br /> <br /> (sorry for my raw English) =) <br /> <br /> Best Regards
