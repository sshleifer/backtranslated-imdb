Before, I did not realize that in the early 90s Devry University (or maybe ITT Tech?) Added the film to its repertoire of technical programs. Well, this movie had to be a valedictorian product. My friend and I rented the original Boogeyman from 1980 on my Netflix and this movie was on the other side of the DVD. Do not waste time on this movie. Terrible horrible. <br /> <br /> The filmmaker adds 2 main characters, a woman and her therapist. The woman dreams about Boogeyman and his sacrifice from the first film. Over 50% of this film comes from the original movie. The rest of the movie is the main character with bad dreams, while her therapist is beating the narrator. These scenes are filmed through a filter, thanks to which characters are prowling. They will make Angela Lansbury look 25 years old. In summary, terrible. Do not watch this movie.
