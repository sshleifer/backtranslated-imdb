This film received the Academy Award in 1990 for the best animated film. In the last few weeks I have seen dozens of nominees and winners of this award from the last 30 years and I really think that this movie may just be the worst of all - but it was not just nominated, but it won !! I assume that 1989 must have been just a terrible year for the genre. <br /> <br /> The film shows a group of characters who look a bit like super-skinny Uncle Festers. It seems that these are simple articulated figures that are transferred by means of stop motion animation. They are all identical - with the same faces, bodies and clothes. The only difference is that each has a different number drawn on the back. Everyone stands on a large platform, which is suspended, as if by magic, in space. Everyone has a pole, and there is a box on the box. The platform begins to tilt slightly and in response, the men move, trying to balance the platform. It lasts and lasts and turns on and off the longest. The only relief from this boredom is that one of them at the end seems quite nasty, but it is not enough to make the game as visible as possible. In addition to passive stop motion animation, this short offer is not interesting ... NOTHING. <br /> <br /> By the way, the wonderful short KNICK KNACK also appeared in 1989 and I have no idea why it was not among the nominees. It was GREAT short and it was much better than any of the nominees this year or the previous year. Perhaps the success of Pixar in previous years has led to prejudices against them, but KNICK KNACK is so clever and funny that ignoring it seems almost criminal. Could Pixar not enter it? This seems unlikely.
