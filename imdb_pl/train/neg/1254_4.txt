I saw the original movie and liked it and expected more from the remake than this. <br /> <br /> GOOD: the effects and makeup are good. No complaints about the result and visual effects, are appropriate, and the performances were fine (Tim Roth was excellent, the other directors were doing well, and a handful of "supporting actors" coped very well with very limited roles). The action scenes were exciting and fun. <br /> <br /> BAD: The escape from the city of monkeys was terrible. The heroes are going over and over again, and then suddenly there are tunnels to escape somewhere in the city. In addition, which escape route leads through the bedroom of everyone? <br /> <br /> The story has been compiled to contain as many actions as possible. I like action scenes, but the original movie had more meat in itself and deserved more respect. <br /> <br /> Finally, the ending was completely pointless, as shown. Without seeing the inevitable continuation, there is no justification for it. <br /> <br />
