Why have I never seen or even heard about this junk movie before? It is in my alley with a bloody teenager, funny plotting and the irresistible atmosphere of the 80's cheese. For some reason no one really is interested, the staff and students of the elite Catholic university are being destroyed by an unknown psychopath. A freshly recruited teacher Julie Parker becomes involved when all the people she has contact with either become dead or behave strangely. This movie is fun bad! There is absolutely no logic or consistency, and each character is equally irrelevant to others. For example, a girl was killed and her body thrown into a container. And then, for no reason, history suddenly moves forward three weeks, but the murdered girl is never remembered or even missed. Even her boyfriend! Acting is pathetic and there is not even a bit of nudity. The apparition of the killer is quite funny, because the creators really seemed convinced that it was an original twist ... It's not, guys! "Splatter University" is one of the worst horror movies.
