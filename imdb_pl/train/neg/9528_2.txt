Nowadays, much is said about torture. It's all this movie. It's about a good person who makes a bad decision. Because of his goodness, he becomes vulnerable to two psychotic women. From that moment, he attacks him on the principle of "kicking for everything". I do not know at what point you will do something about it. Somewhere there is a wife and child; he has a great sense of guilt and fear. But it should be several times when it could work. The movie seems to be someone's joke. I suppose that following Manon's murders we had some fixation about the two. Nevertheless, why would anyone make such a movie? What are the appeals besides sadism? The conclusion is completely unsatisfactory, but it could be remedied by the obvious turn of the action. Well. One and a half hours of my life.
