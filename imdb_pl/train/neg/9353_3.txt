The title lured me ... I was expecting a penetrating and intriguing journey to alcoholism, instead I got a fairly boring and uninspiring story about a noisy Scotsman. <br /> <br /> The main character does not have much psychological depth unless you are willing to classify cheesy teen poetry as a psychology. <br /> <br /> It was a shame because the core of the story could have been good, with a better effort to show inner feelings about a man who had to live with alcohol and violence from his youth. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it seems that the general idea sounds more "I am the way I am because that's how I am." And the laughter of an evil attempt to give a kind of poetic character to a lower class man makes things even worse. Using the overused stereotype of "po√®te maudit" revisions from quick repair, the cheap way to boring movie seems wise, artificial and meaningful. <br /> <br /> But "16 years of alcohol" is not much wise, artificial or significant ... The leading character does not develop at all, and a weak attempt to change will fail without a good explanation. Just as the initial attempt occurred rather unexpectedly. <br /> <br /> The movie borrows from classics such as A Clockwork Orange and Trainspotting, but ultimately does not recover their size, even for a few seconds. <br /> <br /> Jobson put too much emphasis on the artistic side of the story and neglected the rest, giving us a film that is pleasing to the eye, but bland to the brain.
