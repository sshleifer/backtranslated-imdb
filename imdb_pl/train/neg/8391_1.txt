Well ... now that I know where Rob Zombie stole the title for his mushy "House of 1000 corpses", now I can rest in peace. In "House of the Seven Corpses", nothing about the bizarre performances or trivial scenario did not arouse the dead, but also from his story (ha!) Going out groovie ghoulie to kill the bloodied amateurs making horrors of low rent were home! In the Hell House (sorry, I do not remember the real name of the residence), many mysterious, unexplained deaths took place a long time ago; some, like the artful Lurch, John Carradine (whose small role is the only valuable moment of the film), attribute it to the supernatural; the roar of the movie director John Ireland rejects this as a superstitious hokum. The result is "Satan's School for Girls" (catchy title, TV production value, intriguing story) from "Children should not play with dead things" (a movie about low rents about film makers with a low rent level who wake up the dead); The problem is that it is not so much fun or entertaining. "The House of Seven Corpses" is dead in the foreground and spends the rest of 89 minutes going through rigorous mortis, pulling us for every sore second ...
