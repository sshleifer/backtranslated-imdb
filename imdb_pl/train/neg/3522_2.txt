If you like the standard Sly cinema, which includes over the top action, incredible stunts (unbelievable are not supposed to be complementary here) and delayed dialogue; You will love this steaming pile of dung goat. I had high hopes for the trailer. I thought Stalone would be forced in his "old days" to surrender to smarter people and make an action movie that would put a credible hero in a credible situation in which history, surroundings and (credible) action would win. I want an action that is at least close enough to reality, that you can imagine the fear and excitement that arise from such an event. My limited knowledge of hypothermia and its effects meant that at least one scene was ridiculously funny. Judge Dredd is only better because you know that when you enter the theater you will see a comic made in the movie. The figure, the surroundings and everything else is incomparable to anything we could encounter. Cliffhanger, in turn, turns the climbing guide into Rambo before you can say "yo, Adrian!".
