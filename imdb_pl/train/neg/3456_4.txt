Everyone in this movie tells Raffy Carruthers how talented he is, what a great director he will be one day, etc. I think they are just nice. Even Kimble Rendall, who directed the movie, shows more talent than she does. "Next Jane Campion", they call her; and even though they are both overestimated, they both have so much in common. Both are directing films. They are both women. They are both Australians. (Well, give or take.) <br /> <br /> Yes: it's one of those movies where the character is considered to be a genius and we just have to swallow and accept it. But I will say this to Carruthers: he is adorable. - And fascinating. Not really. Here are some comments about her lack of talent: <br /> <br /> (1) Part of the director's talent is based on contacts with people. Why is Carruthers so phenomenally angry to force his team to even notice her? I expect that to make it easier for everyone to leave the set and die. <br /> <br /> (2) Why is this one of the most unconvincing performances on the movie set I've ever seen? After all, it had to be shot on a REAL movie set. How could they do it wrong? If the Rendalla set was half the size of the assault, it's strange that he even finished his film. <br /> <br /> (3) Carruthers - fictional director - set himself the task of creating a completely new horror of the 80s. Big chance. I doubt if it can be done these days. I suspect that Rendall - a real and more talented director - set himself the same task, he realized that it can not be done, and decided instead (sigh) to learn the parody. Of course, the parody is not enough for a parody. As soon as the cast and the crew set foot in an isolated mansion, the film spends most of its time doing badly, what horror movies from the 80s did ... well, less bad. <br /> <br /> (4) And yet, yet ... the film begins not with parody, but with the honest pastiche of the 1980s horror story (it's too good to be true) Molly Ringwald. This pastiche is much better than everything that follows. (It's a bad sign when you want to watch a movie in a movie, not a movie.) But it was also filmed in the late 90's. Perhaps it is still possible to make a horror movie from the 80's. You just have to get rid of these parody things and MENT it. <br /> <br /> (5) I never wondered what teen teenage horror would be if all characters had Australian accents, but now I know. And strangely, I'm glad I know. The need I never knew was satisfied.
