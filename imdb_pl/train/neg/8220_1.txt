Less than 10 minutes in this movie, I wanted it to end because it was painful. All this "horror" is a group of weird bitches doing stupid things for 90 minutes, arguing, crying and screaming. Do not be fooled by positive reviews because it's really a terrible movie and you should not really watch it. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film had the potential to be something wonderful, but it just does not happen. A group of five "teenage" girls goes home one night when they are hunted by crazed women who want to kill them. Two minutes to the movie, and the characters are already arguing, and it does not end. For 90 minutes, we have only a handful of girls who are whining, crying, shouting, "acting" and arguing. None of the dialogues is so interesting, so you can not really get to know these characters or enjoy them. <br /> <br /> Acting was terrible and I was shocked when I learned that these characters were meant to be teenagers. None of these women looked a day below 20 years old, and one of them looked almost 30 years old. At least give people who look old. None of them even gave decent performances and it seemed that they were chosen from the street or were friends of the director without any acting skills. The actress who played the killer exaggerated, but at least she showed something other girls did not do - a bit of talent. <br /> <br /> The heroes are not helping, because these girls are a bunch of stupid, stupid bitches. That's all I can really say about them, and it did not help that EVERYTHING survived. If I have to look in detail, in one scene girls are chased by a killer and their car knocked a lot. One girl is hurt and cries about it ... four of them do not have seat belts ... what do you expect? One of your friends was brutally attacked by a killer ... and you all just happened to be "too hurt" to help? Anything. <br /> <br /> Pictures for the movie are absolutely horrible. I do not care if this movie had a peanut-sized budget, filming was terrible and it was like watching a pirated version of the movie. The cameraman was clearly in the car with the girls, he pushed himself somewhere near the window, and the number of times the camera had blurred, shook and rubbed against the "actress." He was also grainy, and sometimes you did not hear what the characters say (not that it was worth listening). <br /> <br /> Apparently the car of the killers in the film (which apparently was hit, even though we heard only the accident, it's actually a car of directors in real life .No wonder they did not show that the car was hit! This movie is like this cheap, they can not even show a car that scratched a bit Oh, I must also mention the soundtrack ... if that's the way it was ... It was horrible ... sad, then hard rock. <br /> <br / > At the end of the day Five Across The Eyes just feels like a horrible homemade movie filmed at night in the middle of the road with a bunch of stupid girls shouting and arguing for 90 minutes This does not help when the scenario is horrible, fear / tension / tension and ( there is almost nothing to compensate for) are absent, the acting is terrible, and the picture quality and filming are terrifying. br /> It was a terrible low-budget movie, avoid it at all costs. <br /> <b r /> 1/10
