A cowboy sympathetic to the fate of a nearby Indian tribe is wrongly accused of rape and murder of the chief's daughter, which leads to a lot of hatred and violence. completely impossible to defend at any artistic level. Horrible costumes and the fact that all Indians are, of course, white, make them look more like animated live movies than the serious production that press materials pretend to be. <br /> <br /> In short, a lot of nudity (the real reason for watching this) is good. Everything else is not. There are definitely better examples of both species. <br /> <br /> The more interesting thing is that The Ramrodder was filmed at the infamous Spahn Movie Ranch and has not one but two members of the Manson family, Catherine Share and Bobby Beausoleil, who was probably already in a can for a murder that struck in the stained glass screens of the Pussycat Theater!
