When you get a British film, you expect something of a quality. And when it comes to acting, working with a camera, lighting, etc.; this movie is doing business. High-skilled craftsmen do it. Only this can provide you with an enjoyable one and a half hours. But if you look under the layers of professionalism, you will not find anything. In addition to the fact that you feel good and support a liberal view about drugs, there really is nothing there. The scenario is average, the plot is predictable, and the ending must be one of the worst east of Hollywood. In all of its English coziness, it is only a shameful and cynical attempt to make another "Full Monty". Why did they make this movie? I have no idea, apart from making money.
