After Chaplin made one of his best films: Dough and Dynamite, he made one of his worst: Gentlemen Of Nerve. During the first year of films, Chaplin made about one-third of all his films. Many of them were experimental in ad libbing, editing, gags, shooting places, etc. This takes place on the racetrack where Chaplin and his friend try to enter without paying. Mabel Normand is also there with her friend, and Chaplin manages to get rid of both his friends and Mabel. Then, Mabel, in the tribune, has no visible repercussions for his behavior. A lot of slapstick here, but there is very little to recommend this movie to others, and then watch Chaplin. The print I saw was very damaged, which could have influenced his pleasure. Charley Chase can be seen. * 4 stars.
