Many fans of Kinga hate this because they have left the book, but the movie is a different medium, and books should change when they jump. Regardless, the movie fails completely, but fails completely on film. I'd like to hit people who tell me it's the scariest movie ever made. I always follow the question "Really ... exactly what scene scared you?" Every fan I have asked is silent. Sometimes someone, with a loss for decent fear (There is no ...), calls "Mushroom-juice-shooting from the elevators". If you're afraid of it, I do not know what to say to you, except you're easily scared. I just rolled my eyes watching those Z-class horrors play in this jerky, incoherent movie. <br /> <br /> One place that turns away from the book and is really bland is the laborious work that Halloran's film does to overlook it just to kill him; with the stupidest member of the audience, knowing that Jack is waiting behind one of the columns in the hallway that Halloran has to BEGIN. Really one of the stupidest sequences ever made on film. <br /> <br /> Oh, and a nice choice for Mr. Halloran Stanley's work! The black light of afro-nymphomaniacs really add to the mood and character development in horror. Have you ever done more "off" scenes in the movie? <br /> <br /> I think it's a miracle that I finally managed to get around this turd and agree that Kubricks 2001 is really an important movie, given the huge "bad will" generated by this stupid stupid movie as well as the worship of Kubicki's hooligan but inarticulate fanatics, who could not describe the idea of ​​working with any film material in front of them Library of Congress. <br /> <br /> Put on a grotesque takeover of Jack Nicholson, introduce stupid singles in tense moments, and Shelly Duvall nominated for Razzie, and you have a very bad movie.
