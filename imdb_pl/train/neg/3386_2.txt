Yes, I was lucky to see the long-lasting production of Michael Bennett's musical. It was an amazing experience and I paid to watch the movie when it hit the cinemas in 1985. It's terrible. Almost everything fails. First of all, Attenborough (a great actor, a good director with the right material) is an unpleasant choice - almost as bad as when John Huston was employed to maneuver ANNIE. The camera is always in the wrong place - shred songs and CASTING !!! They are horrible - the power of this game is these dancers - these hungry, talented performers just wanted to show what they can do, and when they have a chance - you can not take your eyes off them. But this cast just dances, does a "nice" job, but none of them stimulates a bit. In fact, take a look at the IMDb cast - none of them did much. (OK, OK, Janet Jones married Gretzky - sheesh). So this wreck of the cinema did not capture the magic, desperation or passion of the stage musical. Total strike-out! (But even though they try to suppress music - great music keeps growing and reminds people how great the result was).
