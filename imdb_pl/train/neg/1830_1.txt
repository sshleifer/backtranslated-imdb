It's the worst movie I've ever seen. I am not joking. the next time it appears, I'll just keep digging my head into the wall. it would be nicer for me to sit in the emergency room, trying to explain to my doctor why my brain is swollen, rather than trying to repeat the movie again. <br /> <br /> the project is so bad again. they're both good comedians, so I was shocked that it was so awkward. <br /> <br /> if they had to do it anew, I'm sure they would not do it. the people who stood before the money had to lose a ton. not really - because the special effects (all 2) were terrible.
