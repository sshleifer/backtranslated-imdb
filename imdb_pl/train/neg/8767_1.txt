Is this the movie ??? Is this what the Indians are trying to show? I think that this is yet another effort of a sick director who will reject Pakistani soldiers, or rather a country .... but what we Pakistani people know that we always overtake India in every part of our lives ... not just in armed meters. <br /> <br /> Well ... it's badly filmed as "Border" at the beginning of 1997, movies like these ... <br /> <br /> One thing is very clear ... Whenever it's a meeting between Pakistan and India .... we will win .... !!! So Mr. Dutta is trying to make good films instead of such films
