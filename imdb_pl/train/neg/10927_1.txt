Reviews of this movie were lukewarm at best, and expectations were high: a big budget, lots of popular faces, a fairly fun idea and a main actress that everyone loves. The end result is a catastrophe. Apparently, the funny journey of Alice Tremblay in the fantasy world fails in every respect to entertain the audience (throughout the presentation I have not heard a single laugh), going through a thin line of the page and one-dimensional characters without one spark, not the magic that he wanted to have. 90 minutes of film here is sterile with an awkward direction and a few good actors doing everything in their power to become professionals in a function that certainly would not seem like such a great idea on the set, let alone on paper. "L'Odyss√©e d'Alice Tremblay" is a collage of comic sketches connected (very) with a thin layer of good ideas. Avoid or boredom will haunt you.
