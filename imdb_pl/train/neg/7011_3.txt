If you do not understand that the unfortunate excess, this movie really will not mean to you. It has been tried to interject some humanity into a cold and grim period consumed by alcohol and drugs - it does not work. <br /> <br /> When Salma Hayak performs her big disco number, her voice is so obviously baptized as pathetic - the producers could at least have someone who would sound like her. <br /> <br /> The document that has recently been played on television is much better and gives a much more real picture of this period to our history. <br /> <br /> No one, except Mikey Myers, could be accused of acting; however, he does an amazing job.
