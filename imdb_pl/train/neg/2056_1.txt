Anyone who loved the two classic novels of Edward Ormondroyd will be disappointed with this film. All the magic and romance have been upgraded from his original story about a girl who does a good deed for a mysterious old woman and receives "three" instead. Three what? Not three wishes, but three rides until the 19th century on a wobbly elevator ... <br /> <br /> The first novel is Time at the Top. The second is All in Good Time.
