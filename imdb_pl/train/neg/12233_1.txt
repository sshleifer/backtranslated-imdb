I just can not see how the movie Concorde-New Horizons directed by Jim Wynorski and presenting the talent of actor Andrew Stevens and the puppet may be bad. It just amazes the mind, right? <br /> <br /> Well, let's not have any doubts about it. "Munchie Strikes Back" is a really bad movie. Munchie is a puppet that has been around for many centuries. For reasons not fully explained by the end of the movie, he is sent to Earth to help his single mother and her son. The problem we have (at least its main problem) lies in the fact that within two weeks has a balloon payment for a mortgage ... to not very small amount of 20,000 USD. Oh. She can not think of money because she just got fired. OK ... ONLY is the key word in this sentence. What...? Was she planning to repay her with one payment? Maybe it would be a good idea to spend the last few years saving money ... do you think? <br /> <br /> Munchie has magical powers similar to those with a genie ... but there is no limit to the number of wishes you can make! Munchie gets a lot of fancy things for one night to the boy, but then the kid asks you to send him back to the mall where Munchie "borrowed" him. The annoying furball also uses its unearthly skills to help the boy win a baseball game by cheating. Baseball strikes so hard that it circles the Earth several times. Unfortunately, those stupid parents who watch the game do not think it's weird. Hmm. <br /> <br /> In any case, I would like to wrap it up because it has already exhausted my life force. You will be really moved by the scene in which Leslie-Anne Down, playing her mother, kicks the dog who screams at her. Your heart will melt in her charm when she notices dollar bills fluttering in her yard and wonders how it can snow in the summer. Munchie Strikes Back credits promised another movie that I think "Munchie hangs up ten". Until now, the audience watching the films was robbed of what would certainly be a cinematic tour de force. Heh. 1/10
