I've heard about this little movie for months, and now I've seen it. I consider it sweet and sweet, as many young directors create films in which they combine creative ideas of other people to create their own humorous premise. Branches, Swingblade, every one of the million witches of Blair comes to mind. If all the directors want is the foot in Hollywood's door, they are doing well and should keep up because combining the story is the way Hollywood films. How many times have you heard the phrase "It's Animal House meets Back to the Future"; "It's Wall Street meets the company of the Dead Poet's Society"; or "Shakespeare in Love meets Star Wars"? I remember when independent films meant original and bold, not safe and predictable.
