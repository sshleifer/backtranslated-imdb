I caught this movie at a small show at the gaming club in my college. We have been warned that it will be a "cool madness" of games, and this movie more than provided. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks plays Robbie, a young man who begins his career after "rest" for the semester. What we, the viewers, learn as the film progresses, is that Robbie was hopelessly addicted to a role-playing game called "Mazes and Monsters", a game he reads again after a group of players recruited him to the campaign . <br /> <br /> This movie is funny on many, many levels. One of the scenes contains a group of "candlelit games", which is probably the best way I can describe it. Although I am sure it was supposed to be "cultivated" in some way, as most players know, it is terribly inaccurate. Most role-playing sessions take place in well-lit rooms, usually over several cheeses and a can of carbonated drink. <br /> <br /> Acting, though not an Oscar caliber, is not terribly horrible. . This is one of the first roles of Tom Hanks, and the Bosom Buddies and Bachelor Party were one or two years above the horizon. Supporting cast, though not very memorable, still gives decent performances. <br /> <br /> Mainly the evil is that it was a TV movie that shows "the dangers of games". see if you and your friends are planning a bad movie night.
