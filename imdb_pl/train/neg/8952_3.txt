After listening to George Orwell's prophetic masterpiece all my life, I'm now 37, but never reading a book, I'm totally confused about what I just saw. <br /> <br /> I am very familiar with the concepts contained in the novel, as I am sure most are, but only thanks to rumors and quotations. Without this limited knowledge, this film would be a complete mystery, and even with this I am not even more educated in the history of 1984, than before I watched it. <br /> <br /> On the plus side. .. <br /> <br /> The pictures are amazing, Hurt & Burton provides great performances, and the overall atmosphere of the film is wonderfully grim and deserted. The prostitute scene was a fantastically dark piece of filming. <br /> <br /> Now at the bottom, and there are plenty of them ... <br /> <br /> There is a war going on (at least when it comes to propaganda), but why and with whom? Nothing is explained. There are several bandied names (Eurasia, etc.), but they do not mean anything without explanation. <br /> <br /> Who is Winston? what he is doing? Where is he from? where does he work? why changes messages? Why is not it on the first line? Why do not you eat food in the cafeteria? What is this drink that drinks throughout the entire movie? Why is he so weak and ill? Why is not brain washing like the rest? What is the deal with his mother and sister? What happened to his father? A small story back would be nice, without scrubbing, necessary for people like me who did not read the book. Without it, it is simply a tangled and difficult to trace house-house movie, which constantly lets you guess what is actually happening. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack has been disconnected and poorly edited, and constant talk from the Big Brother screen floods the dialogue in places, making it even harder to understand what is happening. I agree that it could have been an artistic choice, but it is very annoying. <br /> <br /> I also know that it has already been mentioned, but why the whole nudity? It seemed to me that it was completely unselfish and seemed to have been thrown there to compensate for the lack of any plot coverage. <br /> <br /> Personally, I can not stand the way Hollywood must translate history into words these days. We are not all brainwashing, but it is a few steps too far in the other direction. I can only imagine that it is completely based on the fact that you have read the book, because if this movie really is a literal translation that I have seen many people, it would be difficult for me to understand why 1984 is hailed as it is classical. <br /> <br /> It is impossible to hide that it was light years before your time and almost predicted every change in our society so far (maybe it was a kind of bible for the powers that are?), but many novelists science-fiction did the same, leaving no holes in the story. <br /> <br /> I think I have to do what I should have done from the beginning and buy a copy of the book if I make any sense of it. <br /> <br /> All in all, very disappointed with something I have been waiting for years.
