Wow. Just awful. I was a fan of the original film and reluctantly sat in part 2, 3 and corrected. 4,5, and Freddy's Dead were quite bad. But NOTHING is not as bad as Freddy's nightmares. Freddy acts as the host of this series of anthologies Rod Serlingesq. <br /> <br /> I can accept how Freddy became one punch line after another, but at least the films attracted Freddy's films, but here they were so badly made, they looked like high school productions of a horror series. Poor actors, if you really want to be called, that after doing the show they were, of course, exactly what they paid for. I'm pretty sure it was a stopping point for two types of actors. Some are just starting from the Hollywood ladder, completely new to taking any part that would discourage them from accepting the pornographic work they were offered last week, or the dry actors on the way up the Hollywood ladder, ready to take any role they did not have to deal with this pornographic the job they were offered last week. <br /> <br /> Halfway I expected Dana Plato to play a star, but she was already dead before production. <br /> <br /> To paraphrase the Nancy line in the original Elm St, "What ever you do, try not to fall asleep while watching."
