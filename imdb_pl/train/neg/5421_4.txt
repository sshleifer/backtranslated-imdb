This is one of those topics that I can relate to a bit more than most people, because I hate noise and I have no idea how to live in big cities, in New York, especially how people slept at all! I am surprised that people can endure all the noise today. The basic theme of the film is an interesting topic. It is a pity that this is the point. Tim Robbbins is decent, although apart from a few scenes (especially with an absolute supermodel that looks like Margarita Leiveva), it seems that it really is not there at all. My biggest hope in this film is that the casting agents will see absolutely stunning and talented actress who is about to start, Margarita Leviev. There is not much to do but there is a beautiful supermodel. Even when they try to look at more girls from the neighborhood. I am sad that in the world there may be people like Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian without the skills or talent that have greater fame and success than this talented beauty. I was not interested in much of this movie because the script is not very good, but I'm glad that I could see some new talent. I hope producers and directors will think about Margarita when they need a beautiful new actress who will be in a big budget. If they can make Megan Fox a star (come on, it's not that hot, and her "acting talent" is worse than on Disney's TV channel) from one movie, it should be easy for her because she's great and she has talent ! I recommend her to change her name so that we can pronounce it and make it more marketable. We hope that it will do her career, and if there is any justice, she may appear on a big summer movie or two in the next few years.
