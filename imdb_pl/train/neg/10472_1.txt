I should have known that I had trouble with Casper Van Diem as the main character. Words can not describe, nor do justice, how terrible this film was. But please, let me try to describe it: horrible acting, horrible dialogue, dingy situations and all you feel that you are heavily fed with Trinity Broadcasting Network beliefs and propandandes. It is a weak attempt to show Hollywood that the movie can be funny and have a deep religious message to it. They failed miserably. It was the worst movie I've seen in a long time.
