Bad. <br /> <br /> Oh, my ... is one of the movies that does not have a single positive effect. Everything, from actors to history, stinks to heaven. I'm just wondering how low I.Q. You should watch this type of filming and even enjoy yourself. <br /> <br /> Is there anything to watch for? Well, it's a lot of nudity, but it's nothing special. And when you think it can not be worse, you realize that all the naked ladies looked like they were forty years old. Come on, guys, where you've been looking for these actresses. Maybe in an older home. <br /> <br /> In any case, the main actresses have sex appeal and know how to show it. Again, I wish it was too thin and old. In total, skip these. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
