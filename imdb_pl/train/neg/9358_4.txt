Since the beginning of the film, there is already a discrepancy. Since the film is set on the border between Normandy and the Middle East, and is also an international film, one could expect to present the right accents. This is not happening because most of the cast is American. In addition, I think that acting should be practiced at best, and history is a bit difficult to reproduce from the very beginning. Who is who? Otherwise, the film is very accurate in the costume and scenery. If you want to see a movie to feel how it was in the past (though no accents), this movie is worth renting. If you're looking for a movie as epic as the Kingdom of Heaven, look somewhere else.
