Spoilers? Maybe a few details, but nothing is related to the plot. It does not matter to this movie. <br /> <br /> Air Rage grossly removes the premise of infiltration in the air from the execution decision. Ice-T manages a team of four "elite" commandos, who wear baggy black shirts that we can only imagine, they must hide invisible armor, because their idiotic tactics (similar to the one used by the 3rd class, playing Star Wars on the playground ) leads them to absorb a hail of shots. <br /> <br /> What made me the most entertaining in this film was the use of actors similar to myself. You will immediately recognize Cyril O'Reily as someone who once played in a movie that you really liked, although it was so long ago that you probably will not be able to put it (it was Porky's). Here, Cyril plays the decent character of Bill Paxton. The most fun is the pig Gil Gerard, who is so fat that you will never recognize him as a television player, Buck Rogers. Instead of invoking his gentle heroic past, Gerard gives us a good performance of a crispy, thick, hard figure that John Goodman imagined. Finally, Alex Cord gives us a pretty hybrid character resembling the type of Chuck Connors / Kirk Douglas. Within 10 years of New Jack City, the effect of Ice-T significantly deteriorated. It does not work the same way as the retreat of a line that he could remember. <br /> <br /> One of the elements of this video is a CD with classified information. It is hand-carried and apparently is not encrypted, despite the aura of security of Gerard NSA. What a joke. I seriously doubt whether the information to be saved on the CD will even be assembled in a portable format. <br /> <br /> Despite being in a closed plane without silencers, the fire is as loud as canned air, and makes no one flinch, so obviously there is no budget. The assortment of selected weapons is quite funny. Using the coffee pot by the stewardess is the most realistic picture of violence in the film. When he intuitively takes a mini-Uzi pistol, which must be one of the worst pistol designs in history, it is simply too stupid. A real elite team would wear MP-5 for this type of thing, maybe SOCOMM .45s, and even customize H-Powers if they were really old school, maybe something like FN 5.7, if a new school ... Lame-o for standard number 92Fs are totally unbelievable because they lost most of their magnificence after Lethal Weapon I. Bad guys, supposedly experienced soldiers of types of fortune, have a mix of absurdities, like the previously mentioned mini-Uzi and Tec-9 pistol with the infamous non-functional barrel extender, which is not a silencer. <br /> <br /> There was one touch of realism that I would like to correct for other reviewers: Stewardess and Ice-T lowered the unit to 10,000 feet to get "breathing air" before they opened the door. And I got the impression that the stewardess was NOT able to close the door, that she basically just gave up this point. As for the landing, there was no mention of flaps up to about 2 seconds before landing. Sigh. <br /> <br /> Only Dukes of Hazard escaping Roscoe P. Coltrane in the "pass" could shame this movie for the use of footage. Apparently they chose the awesome (and retired) SR-71, because they could not get the F-117. Apart from the fact that they were halted already in 2001, let's forget for a moment that the SR-71 is not a pure stealth aircraft in the B-2 sense, and that in the point range ... Well, I'm not an expert, but I have doubts whether it will be invisible on the radar. <br /> <br /> As others have noted, the repeated references to "F-15" when they showed the F-16 were funny. Details about 747 were quite stupid. No airline would introduce these few passengers to 747, not to mention everything else, which was ridiculous. Pay attention to the use of exposed electrical wires. <br /> <br /> Wow. What a performance. Catch him on Christmas or something. Do not pay for renting, but watch it for laughter. In competition for the worst film in history, with No Holds Barred, who at least had originality.
