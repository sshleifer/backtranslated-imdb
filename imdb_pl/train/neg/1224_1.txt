Who in their right mind does something as stupid as this movie? <br /> <br /> Accidental killing of the bodyguard ... characters that are so two-dimensional that a two-year-old child could paint them ... and better ... <br /> <br /> A red death tools set? Please .... <br /> <br /> Hipotermiczne słabe zbiry ... <br /> <br /> Acting with piekła ... <br /> <br /> Stylistically, this film changes between teen comedy, thriller , voyeurism and ... woman ... (uhm) Rambo? <br /> <br /> Incredible and an offense to every thinking person. Do not look, go away, it's scarier than you can imagine ... <br /> <br /> And all this is trying to be fashionable, being too graphic in its violence ... <br /> <br /> Montford: Shoot 'Em Up was fun and fun, it's just pathetic and terrible. Good luck next time. :-(
