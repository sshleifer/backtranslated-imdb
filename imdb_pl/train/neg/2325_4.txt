first Scanners may not have been a great movie, but at least they were original. There is no such thing. The action is worse, in my opinion, and the story is slower and nothing special. just like dialogue. and special effects are not better than in the original. The film is lower than the first in every respect. The only difference is that it is sometimes loud and chaotic. t make a good movie. If they did something better with this story and made it interesting, it could have been a decent movie. Actually, I could not go through all of this without getting forward quickly. film and not much more, in spite of all there are worse films. Being in a generous mood, I will give Skaners 2 and 4/10.
