The documentary entitled Fast, Cheap and Out of Control was quite an interesting document. The document contained four "mini" documents about four interesting men. Each of these men was very involved in his work, showing pure love and joy at work. <br /> <br /> The sad part, I must say, would have to be the topics in which these people worked. They were interesting for about five minutes, then they became boring and lasted for too long. <br /> <br /> The film was shot in a very creative way. I really liked the film of one thing with voice over another. She played great and played well with music.
