This movie could be a lot better by rewriting the script. Not that I expected a lot of credibility in the movies, but you would think that even a homeless man living in the city would wonder why a group of experienced hunters would like to hire him as a hunting guide. And when it reaches the hunting grounds, the poor Ice-T plays its role as if it were to lead these people through forests that he had never seen before. <br /> <br /> And how does Jack Mason find Thomas Burns in Seattle? <br /> <br /> I assume that this movie was based on a story by Richard Connell "The most dangerous game". A few years ago, I showed this film to class 9 students after reading the story. I rewrote the movie, cutting out all senseless scenes and all vulgarisms. It ended at 43 minutes.
