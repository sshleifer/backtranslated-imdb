Anyone who knows my reviews on the Internet Movie Database will know that from time to time I can be a grouchy bastard. There are many films I do not like, and which for some unfathomable reason I felt the need to review. However, if someone is curious about the name of the worst movie I've ever seen, look no further than Transylvania in Transylvania. No doubt this is the title of all time. 1 horrible movie. I can not believe that I managed to go from the beginning of this contraction to the finish line! <br /> <br /> It certainly aims to capture the taste of the young Frankenstein, Mel Brooks, but where this movie was funny in the horror tradition, this is a desperately strained and mistaken attempt to laugh out of embarrassingly weak material. Jeff Goldblum and Ed Begley Jr. look embarrassed that they are present as a couple of journalists in modern Transylvania (perhaps they realized they were doomed to this mistake). During their research, they meet with all the main monsters from previous favorite horror movies, such as vampires, werewolves and mummies. <br /> <br /> Anyone who manages to weigh this movie to the end can pray for a rate to be guided by their hearts to free them from the agony of boredom. This sets Nadir careers for everyone involved and proves that when comedy fails in a big way, it results in incredibly terrible entertainment.
