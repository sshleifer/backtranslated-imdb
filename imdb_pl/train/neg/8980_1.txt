I will never forget the night in which I saw this movie. We were on a submarine patrol in the North Atlantic and this was a planned movie of the evening. EVERYONE gave up after the second drum. They did not even try to show it in the middle of the night. Deciding to restart ...... That's all I really have to say, but they have this stupid rule that my comment must contain ten lines. I should not add commentary by accidental words, so I will continue my journey until I get ten BS lines. I could not find George Goble on the list, but I remember him in the movie. The heat was terrible, and the songs were even worse.
