"Succubus", the assembled version of "Necronomicon Geträumte Sünden", it's hard to sit down, even at 76 minutes lean; more of this horribly boring and pretentious euro horror flute and I could get myself into a coma. <br /> <br /> Jess Franco once again delivers a really awful piece of garbage from the 1960s, which seems to have been made by the cast of a head crew on class A hallucinogenicity, because not one second of this mess made any sense. Apparently this is one of the better of over 180 movies? It's hard to believe that there are worse efforts there. <br /> <br /> An unfathomable plot is about Franco's usual themes of sex, violence and lesbianism, and he throws S & M a bit for good, and yet he still manages to remain a depressing mind. <br /> <br /> Can I leave him for a moment before I enter the world of suspicious Euro Horror again? life is too short to spend on watching bilges.
