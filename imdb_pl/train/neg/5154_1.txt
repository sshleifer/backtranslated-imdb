It's the only movie I ever went to. bad acting - bad conspiracy - bad casting - bad directing - bad cinematography - if they set off to make a bad picture, they could not do a better job. I hope they are proud of their turkey. I am surprised that someone associated with this movie has ever been re-employed in Hollywood. do not waste time!
