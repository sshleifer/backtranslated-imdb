Hawked as THE MOST DISTINGUISHED EVERY MOVIE, GUARANTEED TO SEND EVERYONE - Guess what? It worked, I'm offended that we spent the rental money. Two friends and I were bored and decided to check if this bull about the movie we saw on TV was real. Curse Comedy Central and all other networks that have pushed this garbage on us! It was by far the worst movie I've seen since Hollow Man. I usually avoid this nonsense, but I fell into it. Since then, we have beaten a dick that suggests that we rent it, and its privileges to download movies have been revoked. There is nothing strange about this movie ... even the "dickman adventures" scene was extravagant at best. I thought the value of the production was nonsense for some important reason ... no ... it just sucked. NEVER EVER WATCH THIS! for any reason. Even with abundant amounts of illegal substances, this movie would be fun. It means ALOT. I am asking for the love of all that is holy, if you cherish your sanity - never watch this movie. Many things are stupid, pointless and worthless, just to name a few. But the most important thing he wanted: offensive funny - she let down miserably. Crush and burn ....
