At FAN Robert De Niro plays Gil Renard. Or is it Travis Bickle? or Rupert Pupkin? Or Max Cady? The problem with this type of role lies in the fact that De Niro played very similar characters in TAXI DRIVER, THE KING OF COMEDY and CAPE FEAR, and unfortunately the characters were better developed and had better scripts. It was hard for me to believe that Renard started as a frustrated obsessive sports fan to become a psycho. <br /> <br /> The character arc is not the only problem in this script - he lacks the focus of the character (problem I had with THE UNTOUCHABLES, where De Niro should be wonderful, but it ended up somewhat flat), for several episodes of the movie I thought that the main character is Bobby Rayburn, and then the story returns to Renard. It also seems to have disappointed many sports fans who seem to think that it should be more focused on baseball. I'm not sure if it was aimed at appealing to baseball fans, but again there are elements that suggest that it may have if the manufacturers decided to decide who and what story should focus on <br /> <br /> admit that I was entertained by THE FAN (especially through the soundtrack), but it is a very flawed movie and it should be remembered that in the mid-90s heroes were persecuted by madmen, as in SINGLE WHITE FEMALE, UNLAWFUL ENTRY etc. a couple of a long time ago
