The author of the songs, Robert Taylor (as Terry) is "stunned, slim" and can not see Norma Shearer straight from another world (as Consuelo). "She makes the sun shine, even when it's raining," Taylor explains. But Mr. Taylor gets a lump in his throat every time he comes near Mrs. Shearer. Finally, at the Palm Beach Shearer Casino, Taylor proclaims "I love you!". Shearer pulls him away when he is engaged to George Sanders (as Tony). However, to regulate gambling debt, Shearer employs Taylor to pose as "her cart lover" to make Mr. Sanders jealous. <br /> <br /> The title of this movie invites you to the obvious and appropriate three word review: "Her Film Carton." This is most noticeable as the last feature film by Shearer, one of the biggest stars in the world from "He Who Gets Slapped" (1924, playing the next Consuelo) to "The Women" (1939). To be honest, it was probably the kind of film Shearer, which the viewers of MGM wanted to see. However, this part is unflattering. <br /> <br /> Plucked and fed, Taylor and Shearer were better at The Escape (1940). If Shearer continued, she could become a better actress than a "leading lady"; apparently she was no longer interested and certainly did not need money. Taylor has a great scene, reciting Christina Rossetti "When I am Dead, My Dearest", threatening to jump out of the balcony of Shearer, directed by George Cukor. <br /> <br /> **** Her Cardboard Lover (6 42) George Cukor ~ Norma Shearer, Robert Taylor, George Sanders
