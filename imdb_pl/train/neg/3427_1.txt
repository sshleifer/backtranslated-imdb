It must have been embarrassing for every member of a completely African-American cast. Any derogatory, disrespectful stereotype of the Black Americans' community is clearly visible. I will not strengthen these insults by exchanging them here, except for mentioning chickens, watermelons and cubes. <br /> <br /> One good song by Ethel Waters (and a few bad guys) and fantastic singing and dancing talents of 8-year-old Sammy Davis contribute to something below 1 on the IMDB scale.
