This movie is horrible. At the end, you realize that several hours have been stolen from your life that you can not recover. The ending of the "twist" is very sophisticated. Character development leading to this end is not consistent with their final actions at the end. Ninety minutes of preparation - with the idea that Rob Lowe's character will die on Christmas Eve - was explained literally in ninety seconds "No, we only cheated you". In that case, the figure of Rob Lowe does not even get angry! "I forgive you if you can forgive me," is as nervous as he is. If someone needed weeks to convince me, I was about to die, and then I said, "No, I'm sorry, I'm just fooling you." I do not feel bad about giving away the spoiler, because I can save some of you from watching. Please save yourself and DO NOT SEE THIS FILM.
