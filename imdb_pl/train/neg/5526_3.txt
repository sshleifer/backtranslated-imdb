Knowing how old the movie is, should prepare the viewer for a few things, and with these things in mind, maybe the movie will be more bearable. That was when I watched Revolt of the Zombies. One should expect a strong dependence on tedious dialogue and courageous movements, as well as the primitiveness (or lack) of special effects in those times. From the imagination of the viewer, many people ask - maybe in this case too much. And the plot is not easy to follow: some of the zombies from south-east Asia in the First World War behaved very well. Although he is skeptical about why, if this is true, the explanation should remain in the wrong hands, so he excludes himself to explore the group archaeologically. The key to long-distance hypnosis has been learned by a member of the expedition, who uses it, among other things, to temporarily give up the beau of the gal, for which he has the heat. To prove his love for her, he gives up everything he should not have done, because when everyone is unzombiefied, many want to kill him so that he never controls them again. Below average, even with cautious foresight. Recommended only for extremely patient people.
