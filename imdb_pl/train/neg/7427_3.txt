When a friend gave me a box set of "12 amazing Scifi / Horror movies!" I was understandable a little cautious. But because the object was a gift, I really did not pay attention to common sense. After all ... movies for free! So what if they are a little better? After many reflections, Alien Intruder was the first of these films. Ironically, it was the first choice because it looked best. I can only say that if it is the best of them, I shudder at the idea of ​​what the rest looks like. <br /> <br /> At first glance, it had something good. Four actors (count them!), Which I knew. Billy Dee Williams, Tracy Scoggins, Maxwell Caulfield and Jeff Conaway. I told myself ... "Billy and Tracy were in good scifi (Star Wars and Babylon 5 respectively), so they did not sign up for a turkey. Max is a soap veteran who never managed to break into the movie ... but not for a shoddy actor. Jeff ... well ... he did well and badly when it comes to movies and television. Soon I discovered that Jeff decided to add "ugly" to his movie repertoire. <br /> <br /> The first tip was in the opening scenes. Jeff moves enthusiastically through the scene "I'm crazy" before he finally kills himself. A funny performance in the camera, really. Unfortunately, this is, without exaggeration, the most important part of the film. From there it goes down. <br /> <br /> Then we have the mission commander (Williams), who is sent to see what happened to Jeff and his crew engaged in choosing new shipmates from among the ranks of the criminal element. But this assortment is not just Dirty Dozen - more like Unconvincing foursome. Plus, one of the nonsense, a computer hacker, is shown in his cell running on a laptop. Is not it like letting the killer run a gun shop in a slammer? Pretty bad prison, if you ask me about it. <br /> <br /> When you finally take off, the effects are really terrible. It seems that the spacecraft model was knocked out by the bored 8-year-old who had leftovers from his Airfix sets. <br /> <br /> But the horror does not end there. While traveling to the place where Jeff's ship disappeared, the criminal team is rewarded for good behavior, receiving virtual reality weekends in which they indulge in male fantasies. Everything is good and good, and the use of scenes from their fantasies serves as an introduction to "Alien Menace", which begins to appear there. But did they have to pull him out quite a bit, so long? A foreign intruder? Alien Boring, more like. <br /> <br /> In the end, they manage to reach G-Sector, and the presence of strangers makes them fight with each other for their feelings, until only the good old Max remains. The ending, in a really optimistic style, suggests a continuation - as if! The appearance in this movie is also a character that I will call "Sweatdroid". He was supposed to be an android, but apparently this was lost by the make-up crew, who provided him with sweaty functions at every opportunity. But do not worry, he is just to make up the number of bodies at the end. <br /> <br /> Williams and Scoggins, to be truthful, they do very little in the film. They just barely sleep, let alone acting. And, as I mentioned earlier, Jeff gets an early trip to the showers, so his maniacality can not enlighten a large part of the movie. Max is doing his best, just like a few other cast members, but the movie is just awful horrible, to be honest. <br /> <br /> The only and half-ingenious idea of ​​this film is the ship naming convention. All come from musicians - Holly, Presley, Joplin. The rest of the movie is bland and boring. <br /> <br /> Made in 1992, I thought, after the first look, it was one of those 80's simple films. It seems that in the 90s they were still making silly films. <br /> <br /> This is best avoided. Even as a movie with beer fries, this movie is smelly, but I suppose that at least you can quickly rewind it.
