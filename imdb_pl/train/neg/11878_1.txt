Really, when it comes to it, this movie is not just fun. Josh Kornbluth is the antithesis of fun, and yet he thinks he is funny. The plot on sending 17 letters was initially fine, until Josh's "look at me, I'm crazy" approach did not attack every scene. Judas Priest's joke could have been the least funny thing I've ever been privy to, and that says quite a bit, because it has strong competition from all the other jokes in the movie. And as for the amazing abuse of the "Debaser" The Pixies, I have only one thing to say: what have the Pixies ever done to deserve such a fate? What did someone do with Josh Kornbluth to force him to write / direct / produce / play in such a terrible movie?
