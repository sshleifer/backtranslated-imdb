Edison's story was decent, but one of the actors ruined the whole movie. Justin Timberlake ruined the film with every line he made during the film. He is definitely one of the worst actors I have ever seen and should face the same fate as the entire F.R.A.T. Team. <br /> <br /> Regardless of whether it was an emotional scene, an action scene or even a silent scene, Justin Timberlake managed to destroy it. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time watching this movie. Do not worry about even downloading, the dwarf dwarf would be a much better choice. <br /> <br /> And Justin, if you read this, stick to the music. Even if you're not good at it, you've done a great job, forcing people to think that you can sing.
