I am a big fan of Batman comics and I was disappointed when I could not find Batman: The Animated Series on TV. I was excited when I learned that there would be a new Batman cartoon on TV. I watched the first episode on the day of the premiere and was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> First of all, the animation is very poor. It looks like cheap, crappy Japanese anime. On the other hand, almost every contemporary cartoon is like that. <br /> <br /> Character designs are even worse. Batman looks more like Birdman, Catwoman looks more like a Chihuahuawoman, Bane looks more like a red version of Hulk, Penguin is a Kung-Fu master, Mr Freeze is some undead thing with an iceberg on his head, and Riddler is a gothic look by Marilyn Manson (which is fun, because I do not expect people who are obsessed with puzzles and puzzles to be gothic). <br /> <br /> The worst character design is the Joker. They turned him into a Bob Marley / Kung-Fu fighter with a monkey / mad! The Joker is supposed to be Batman's most dangerous enemy, but in this show he is almost no threat, because his crimes are so stupid and pointless. In one episode, his plan was to put the Joker venom in dog food! Oh, how bad! Batman is a fascinating and complex character, because he is haunted by the death of his parents, that's why he fights crime. This version of Batman does not seem to be haunted by the death of parents and is not at all interesting. He is not a detective but a warrior. If there is an enemy he can not defeat, he will not investigate the enemy to find his weaknesses, just as a detective will do, he will simply build a giant war robot to defeat them. Many times this show does not even seem like a Batman show, it's another mindless anime, which is nothing but a senseless fight. <br /> <br /> What I dislike most about this series is what they did to villains. They took everything that makes them nice and tolerable and transformed them into stereotypical bad villains. Man-Bat is the greatest example. In comics, he is a tragic scientist who studies bats to find a cure for his deafness. Experimenting on himself, he accidentally transforms into a gigantic bat creature. In this performance, he is a mad scientist who wants to deliberately turn into a gigantic bat creature for no apparent reason. Almost all villains are like this; none of them, except one or two, have a real motive to commit a crime. <br /> <br /> The worst feature is Mr. Freeze. In the comics, Freeze was just a crazy scientist until the brilliant writer Paul Dini wrote the episode BTAS "Heart of Ice", which gave Freeze a new origin, which made him a tragic, three-dimensional and nice villain. The episode was so popular that the fans accepted it as their real origin and was even used in comics as its origin. Even this bad movie Batman and Robin used it as their origin. In this program, he is a tiny gem thief before Mr Freeze stays. After becoming Mr Freeze, guess what? He is still a thief of tiny jewels! Great origin. No wonder they used it to create what Dini created. <br /> <br /> As a fan of Batman, I do not like this series just because it is not similar to the comic because I liked BTAS, Batman cartoons that came with Batman Tim Burton and of course, great films by Christopher Nolan Batman . None of them was 100% loyal to the comic, but he was still very good. The problem with this show is not that it is not exactly like comics or BTAS, but that it lacks some depth that makes other Batman media so popular. <br /> <br /> I gave this program so many opportunities, but the more I watch, the more disappointing it is. I miss the good old days when Batman's fairy tales were something everyone could enjoy.
