It must be one of the worst 35mm movie film waste ever to be unleashed by the public, a continuation of at least a funny pseudo-documentary original movie, The Legend of Boggy Creek. Bad scenario, worse acting, etc., Dawn Wells had to hope that Gilligan would come to save her and take her back to the island to escape this trap.
