What did the producer / director Stanley Kramer see in the novel by Adam Kennedy and the very mysterious scenario of Kennedy? Have you intentionally omitted several elements? And what about Gene Hackman, Richard Widmark, Edward Albert, Eli Wallach and Mickey Rooney? What did they see in this very confused story? <br /> <br /> And why did Candice Bergen, who gave a terrible performance, take such a thankless role? on the same level as The Parallax View or The Manchurian Candidate and misses the mark with a very wide margin. Serious interruption of ignition by Stanley Kramer.
