Wanda Nevada is a mature fantasy film using around 1979. Ideas for what constitutes an illegal affair for 13-year-old girls. The script, tempo and direction are equally horrible. The action sequences are contradictory. Characters talk with a simplified diction, which can usually be found in movies directed at people under 10, but also contain many sexual references regarding Shields, as well as graphic death. <br /> <br /> The movie wants to be a comedy on a certain level, but it is never a fun, adventure image, but the plot and action are bland and the movie for children, but introduces pedophilia and child rape as real possibilities. He also wants to be a picture of a buddy, a picture of his maturity, a film of ghosts, an Indian spiritual film, a travel diary and a western. The general effect is huge stupidity with a nasty turn of action. Wanda Nevada is a complete waste of time, unless you want to see many great pictures of the Grand Canyon. It works.
