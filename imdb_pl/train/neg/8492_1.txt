If you go through the starting credits, it could be your type of movie. From the first screen image of a woman holding her hands to her face with white sheets blown in the background, she resembles a pretentious perfume advertisement. From there everything goes down. <br /> <br /> The main actress is basically a block of wood that uses her computer to reach back and reconstruct memories of photos to talk about the overlooked genius of history, Ada, who conceived the first computer language in the nineteenth century. <br /> <br /> Low-cost graphics would be excusable if it was interesting or even integral with the script. <br /> <br /> Poor Tilda Swinton is wasted.
