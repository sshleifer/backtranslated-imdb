I can not believe that this movie was made in 1984. He has some funny acting, not to mention one of the stupidest threads in history. Who would ever ask the fat Texan sheriff Joe Don Baker to escort an Italian who was illegally arrested in Mexico back to Italy? Not to mention the fact that the title of the movie does not tell you anything about it - in fact, it is such a general title for a movie with a would-be campaign / policeman, I think. <br /> <br /> I am glad that I saw it only on MST3K with Mike and bots as a shield. They draw attention to the similarity of women to Elaine from Seinfeld ("None of them is spongy") and a non-stop riff for Baker's weight. This film is probably no worse than "Mitchell", but Baker's reputation definitely precedes it: when his title appears at the beginning of the movie, Tom says: "I would like to be illiterate, so I would not have to read it. "
