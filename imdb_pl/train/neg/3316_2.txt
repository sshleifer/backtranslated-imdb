This was the first movie of Ewan McGregor, which I saw outside of Star Wars. Since then, I have become a huge fan of Ewan McGregor, but I still can not force myself to forgive the existence of this film. <br /> <br /> My sister has always been a big fan of Jane Austen and therefore I have undergone various classics, Emma is one of them. I've always found them annoying, stupid and boring. However, after seeing this horrible issue, I had to admit that the original Emma was lovely and charming. Ewan McGregor rarely serves the purpose of this movie after they broke into and mutilated part of Frank Churchill. Gweneth Paltrow is funny in an already funny character, and the rest of the movie is uninteresting and stupid. <br /> <br /> My recommendation to anyone who is interested in remote English drama from the age ... see the originals. If you're a fan of Ewan McGregor ... believe me, apart from this movie, you did not miss anything but a five-minute collective performance in a stupid hat and bad haircut.
