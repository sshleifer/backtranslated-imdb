It was not one of Keaton's best efforts, perhaps it was a hidden attempt to take revenge on the family he was married to - Talmadges. The Polish / English language barrier and a series of coincidences leads Buster to a marriage with a large Irish woman who (together with his father and brothers) treats him miserably until he acknowledges that he can be the heir to the fortune. There is abundant identity here - the gags are set, but it is not profitable for the main ones. <br /> <br /> This shortcut Metro has at least two real laughs - Buster cleverly turns his lack of dinner, using the calendar on the wall and the basic ignorance of his adopted family to literally bring meat to his plate. The second is a family photo in which the whole group slowly falls to the floor, because the camera's tripod loses stability. <br /> <br /> Transfer of yeast beer could be a catalyst for a huge series of gags built on gags, but it retains short (for all accumulations) development. <br /> <br /> The cinema is clear and clear, and the result is one for the piano, drums and sound effects. This is not one of Buster's best efforts, but it is worth a few laughter.
