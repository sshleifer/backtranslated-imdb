I love watching early colored movies - do you mean that those 40's clothes were not all gray? <br /> <br /> Margaret Rutherford dominates in this film. Her "eccentric" outfit is rather attractive and yes, she has an amazing hourglass figure. But I feel that she got too much headache. She probably developed this characteristic in many performances and nobody said "If he laughs, leave it." He's doing too much mad deception when he's going to be surprisingly on the ground. Joke Madame Arcati says that the media was usually portrayed as delicate women in long draperies. Arcati behaves like a retired director (we'll really get involved!). The contrast between its airy, everyday style and its crazy beliefs is not really revealed. <br /> <br /> Just because all the actors are English (except Cummings), the Americans think they have to use the words Brit "," stiff "," lip "and" top ". Oh, give me a break! The three main characters are constantly losing their temper and making attention risquery (Did he make love to you? Yes, but very discreetly - he was in the cavalry!).
