How can the movie with Amy, Posey and Raechel be not funny? Believe it or not, "House Bunny" did it better and more fun. I hope the directors had a good holiday and they got some money - this film is embarrassing to them all. It's a cliché from beginning to end. Cliches can work well with the script, or at least an idea. This film does not do anything, but uses the cliché after the stereotype, not ideas or scenario. He uses the earlier form of actresses, not characters. Bad, sad and mushy. Now I have to have ten lines of text to comment. Really? Why? As an IT manager, this is another example of sloppy coding.
