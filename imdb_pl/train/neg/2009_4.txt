This is not a completely bad movie. The plot (the new house built next to it seems to be haunted) is not bad, the mood is quite scary, and acting is fine. The big problem was that being familiar with Lara Flynn Boyle (from Twin Peaks and other programs), I could not resist the way she looks with her seemingly new big mouths. I kept looking at them. They look so out of place on her face! They make it look completely different (and not better). <br /> <br /> Mark-Paul Gosselaar, an actor who plays Kim architect who designs and pours heart and soul home, does a great job. And Lara (as Col) is also pretty good (but those lips!) As the owner of the house next door. Her husband Walker (Colin Ferguson) is suitably wooden. Different characters living in the house were also fine. I particularly liked Pie (Charlotte Sullivan) and her husband Buddy (Stephen Amell), the first people who moved into the house. Attempts to include us in the general climate of the neighborhood are unfortunately unsuccessful, because other neighbors are not particularly nice. <br /> <br /> For some reason, the director was unable to make the "haunted" house particularly sinister. Other films (such as Amityville Horror, The Legend of Hell House) manage to achieve this terrible mood, but it just does not happen here. The closest is when Col paints the picture of the house. <br /> <br /> Another thing that did not work for me is the turn of the action that occurs with Kim, the architect. Initially, he seems to be a victim of the house like the others (he sucked him out of inspiration), but later he seems to have joined forces with him in evil. <br /> <br /> In general, it's not a bad movie for horror fans if you can tear your eyes off those big lips!
