I can not believe that so many compare this film to the Argento movie. His work is much more ingenious and malicious - and much more fun. <br /> <br /> The director simply lacks the ability to build real tension. Scenes of murder - and let's face it, that's what this genre is all about - are not interesting. It was not difficult to guess who the murderer was and really did not care when it was revealed. Pictures are not memorable, and the praised nineteenth-century Gothic atmosphere just did not draw me in. Some actors are quite good (especially the director and sadistic girl who has younger students), but there is not much to do. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are overtones of incest, sadomasochism and lesbianism, but surprisingly, they add very little spice and tension. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a good horror movie, look somewhere else.
