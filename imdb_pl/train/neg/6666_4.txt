I really wanted to like this movie, but the story is funny. I do not want to ruin this movie - do not worry, you know from the beginning that something bad will happen - but here's an example of how sloppy this movie was. Cowboy and "Gałązka" are riding on the ridge. The cowboy has a mustache with a handle. Cowboy and "Gałązka" hit the shot and race in the middle of the ridge. The cowboy is shaved cleanly for the rest of the movie. Some time between the fight with the gun and the ride to the mountains, the cowboy had time to shave, in the dark, on the horse's back. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the acting of the four main characters is permanent.
