This is probably the first entry in the detective series "Lance O'Leary / Nurse Keat"; in the subsequent O'Leary movies, he played a much younger actor than Guy Kibbee. <br /> <br /> A group of relatives (all played by famous character actors) are gathered in the old house of course! br /> <br /> The frightening movie; worth seeing!
