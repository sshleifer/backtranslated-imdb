Well, no, not exactly. This is not a good movie, but it's not as bad as I thought. I really did not feel cheated out of my borrowed money, and sometimes it's all you can ask for. The plot is OK, nothing brilliant or new, the acting is pretty bad, but the cast is pretty. The director is passable, but the effects are terrible, especially the werewolf's effects, which in the film of werewolves are quite a big problem. Nudity was pretty decent, which is pretty good for me, but it was not so hot. In conclusion, it's a pretty average movie directly on the movie, not the worst movie I've ever seen, and if you're bored with a genre fan, check it out sometime. I would watch it again. <br /> <br /> Bonus for horror freaks, Kane Hodder (in a few of them Jason Vorhees) plays the werewolf.
