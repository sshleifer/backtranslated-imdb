this movie is just an excuse for the writer to make a movie of 2 unsuccessful scripts. <br /> <br /> his characters are just a collection of characters with stereotypical, comic attributes, the sum of which is a neurotic dialogue only Woody Allen could write. woman loves it because it looks as if she was looking in the mirror to enjoy this movie, probably I did not like these films because there was no car chase, and the movie did not have any fights. there were also no drug lords or gangsters. Not to mention the lack of snakes. This movie did not have snakes. Not my cup of tea, maybe not your ether, so think about what I said before you see this movie. <br /> <br /> Unless of course you do not remember women, weight problems. Man's affairs like sex and city and mcbeal ally, it matters to you.
