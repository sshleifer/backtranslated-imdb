This film has little to say, although it is not breathtaking scenery, photos and the direction of wild nature, but it is difficult to bring out its weaknesses in the company of such enthusiastic reviews. However, it is these things that make the lack of a satisfactory conspiracy and its execution so disappointing. <br /> <br /> I watched this with my children and none of us was impressed with the end. Yes, the pictures were great, great scenery in the forest and great mountains, but what was going on in the foreground? A rather boring narrative about the stupidity of a bland girl who is too slow to learn a very basic lesson about making friends with wild nature - and quite easily goes out because of this type of story. Surely this is not a new story, in fact there is nothing distant in saying how it is told, and we have all seen it before, and even more eloquently, Antoine de Saint-ExupÃ©ry. /> The only thing you can really get from this movie is the sense of how to work with these fantastic lenses and forest lighting; the rest is a waste of time.
