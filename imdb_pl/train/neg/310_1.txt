I never heard about this film by Adam Sandler until I saw him on the wall in Blockbuster. Being a fan of Adam Sandler at the time, I rented it. HONESTY I could only watch about 30 minutes. this. It was scary. Do everything to keep it out of the audience's hands. I sincerely hope that this film will soon go to the OOP and I hope that REMAINS THIS WAY!
