Russell Hopton played in many films until his death in 1945. He only directed 2, and "Black Gold" was one (the second was also from 1936). Frankie Darro sometimes had a rough presence on the screen, but in that he was a good kid. He was of course very popular in "quickie" - he made so many films. In this role, he plays the son of an old oil rigger, who is convinced that he will soon hit oil. <br /> <br /> J.C. Anderson (Berton Churchill) tries to convince the old man to sell himself because he knows he will be hit by oil at any moment. Geologist Henry comes to the scene and helps his father "Fishtail". He also convinces the "Fishtail" to go to school regularly. Henry has an eye on Cynthia, a beautiful teacher. This was Gloria Shea's last film - she began her career as Olive Shea in "Glorifying the American Girl" (1929). "Fishtail" dad is killed when the platform is sabotaged, and Henry is determined to put Anderson and his pals in the face of justice. When Henry is kidnapped, Anderson tries to convince the Fishtail to sell his oil lease. Everything ends with a blow to the oil and "Fishtail" going to military school. <br /> <br /> It's okay rainy day.
