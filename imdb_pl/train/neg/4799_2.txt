I am a big fan of low-budget horror movies from the 80's. This is not the worst, but it is still not spectacular. The plot line is decent, but too long. You are in the middle of the movie before you see any zombie action. Kills are not very creative, and zombies are not very clever. I really think that this movie would be better if they skipped the zombie and simply entered a mafia movie. It's possible to watch, but I feel that this movie stole at least an hour of my life. I will give a movie credit for being somewhat original. If you're really interested in B horror movies, you should watch them, but if you are not, do not worry. But you do not have to take this word for it.
