It was supposed to be Freddy's last film (and he was for over 10 years) - one would think that they would try to make a good movie. But they turned out to be the worst of the series (and that says a lot). The story did not make sense (I do not remember it seriously), all the main characters were idiots (you REALLY wanted them to die), and Freddy's jokes were even worse than usual. The only good song was the short (and fun) work of Johnny Depp (the first movie "Nightmare" was his first). <br /> <br /> Initially I saw him in the theater as the last section (repeating Freddy's childhood) was in 3-D. Well - three-dimensionality was poor - faded colors and the image going in and out of focus. Also three flying skulls, which were to be frightening (I think), had a reverse reaction from my audience. EVERYONE burst out laughing. It looks even worse on TV in 2-D. Pointless and stupid - also very boring. Skip this and see again "Freddy vs. Jason ".
