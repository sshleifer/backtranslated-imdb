I saw it in 1994, when it was finally released. Apparently because the pictures of Orion were in bankruptcy, I think that the film was not released a few years earlier. <br /> <br /> I have a problem remembering details, partly because I have not seen it for a long time, but I remember it as a very boring movie. I was still wondering whether to get out of this. The store was not interesting or engaging at all. It was the third class of imitation Graffiti of America. <br /> <br /> None of the performances is worth watching. One of the biggest disappointments, because the reviewer of the local newspaper awarded him a high mark.
