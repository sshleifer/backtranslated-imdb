I am a huge fan of Martin Amis, whose book is based on this film. Unfortunately, the director was not able to translate the book to the screen. The novel is fully postmodern and highly artificial in its wildly exaggerated characters and the breakup of the traditional story line and character development. It is a funny study of human greed, excess and emptiness by one of the most moral contemporary British writers. The director of the film completely overlooked the meaning of the novel. In his hands, the movie screams with dizzying speed, allowing every known trick shot and possible "strange" camera angle. He is like Ken Russel on acid and suffers from indulgence by an older director to a hundred. Even a short look at the penis of the wonderful actor Christian Solimeno was not enough to save this unfortunate movie for me. Bottomless!
