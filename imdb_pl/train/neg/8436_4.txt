David Mamet is a very interesting and very uneven director. His first movie, "House of Games", was the one I liked best, and set up a series of movies with characters whose life perspective changes when they enter complex situations, as does the perspective of the viewer. <br /> <br /> Meaning "homicide" which attempts to set the viewer's mind in the ordinary crime drama. The main characters are two cops, one Jew and one Irishman who deal with a racially charged area. The murder of an old Jewish store owner, who turns out to be an ancient veteran of the Israelist war, releases Jewish identity in the mind and heart of the Jewish detective. <br /> <br /> The former defects of the film are more obvious. The awakening process is theatrical and difficult to believe, the group of Jewish fighters is operatic, and the way the detective ultimately approaches the final brutal confrontation is pathetic. The very end of the movie is clever like Mamet, but it disappoints with the human emotional perspective. <br /> <br /> Joe Mantegna and William Macy are giving strong performances, but the disadvantages of this story are too obvious to be easily compensated.
