This film is not devoid of charm and shows some warmth, but ultimately this effort is too vain and too focused on the tracks. There is no doubt that Mary Tyler Moore knows what to do with all her screen, but it takes too much light from the rest of the cast. <br /> <br /> Another problem is overloading the clich√© script. A daughter who secretly leaves her studies, an older woman has difficulty finding a good job (and ends up with a somewhat degrading job), a poor headmistress with his toy toys that goes over the substance, the journalist has nothing wrong with any of them , i.e. all are firmly rooted in reality, but in combination they are just too much and leave us too much deja-vu and too few surprises.
