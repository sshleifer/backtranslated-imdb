THE SCREAMING SKULL (1 out of 5 stars) This movie can boast pretty cool initials (a narrator outside the screen, warning that the movie will be offered a free burial if they die of fear watching this movie, a scary shot of the skull emerging from the gentle pool and ubiquitous frightening music), but unfortunately, the movie is down from there. A widowed man takes his new bride to a secluded court ... admonishing his servants and friends that the new lady has a very delicate disposition because of the tragedy in her past. Well, in the blink of an eye, he starts to see and hear mysterious things that no one else can do. Her husband assures her that it's all in her mind and ... well, you probably can see where it's all going. You'll find out what happens long before our unfortunate heroine ... because you've probably seen exactly the same story in hundreds of other movies and TV shows (and also better). To add to the multitude of offenses, most of the film (in many cheap DVD compilations) seems to lack a few key scenes. You see the heroine walking slowly towards the window ... she opens it ... you know she'll see something terrifying ... and then ... suddenly the scene cuts her sob in her husband's arms. What did she see? I do not think we'll ever know.
