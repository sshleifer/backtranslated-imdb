No wonder that the historian Ian Kershaw, the author of Hitler's landmark biography, who was initially a scientific consultant of this television film, cut himself off from him. The film is historically too incorrect. The mistakes start right away when Hitler's father dies at home, when in reality he died in a pub. In the film Hitler moves from Vienna to Munich in 1914, While in reality he moved to Munich in 1913. I could continue without end. Hitler's childhood and youth are portrayed too briefly, which makes it difficult for historically ill-informed people to understand the character of this frustrated neurotic man. Important persons from the early period of the party, such as Hitler's father's friend Dietrich Eckart or the party "philosopher" Alfred Rosenberg, are completely lost. The characteristics of Ernst Hanfstaengl are very problematic. The film is portrayed as a noble character that almost despises Hitler. The screenplay, of course, follows Hanfstaengl's own gaze at the sight of himself that he gave in his biography after the war. In fact, Hanfstaengl was an anti-Semite and was mad about his Fuehrer. The biggest problem of the film, however, is the presentation of Hitler himself. He is described as someone who is constantly unfriendly, has neither charisma nor charm and constantly orders everyone around. After watching the movie you may wonder how such a disgusting person has ever managed to gain followers. Since we all know what the evil criminal Hitler was, naturally, every screenwriter is tempted to portray Hitler as completely disgusting and non-charismatic. But the facts are that privately it can be charming and funny. His companions did not follow him because he kept shouting at them, but because they liked this strange man. In addition to all these historical mistakes, the film is well made, the actors are first class, the photos from the place and the production project give a credible impression of the era.
