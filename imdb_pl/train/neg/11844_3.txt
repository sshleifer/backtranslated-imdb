Anyone who is a jazz sucker from the 1920s, 20s, Charleston and ultra-elegant yachts (eg, I, in all respects) will want to like this movie. But sad is the fact that this is all. The story is banal and obvious, the acting is either horrible or it is playing on the far right side of the events, and when the whole thing is over, the only thing left is the impression of mirrors and smoke. It's a beautifully made bad movie.
