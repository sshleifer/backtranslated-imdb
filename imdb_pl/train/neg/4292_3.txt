In general, I like watching Burt Lancaster movies - especially when he is forced to go crazy with his impressive presence on the screen, like in Elmer Gantry. However, his greatest strength, his magnetism, occasionally was also his greatest weakness, because he rarely, if at all, played anything. And it is this lack of subtlety that really bothers the Rainmaker. Now I understand that his character was supposed to be a kind of showman, but how Katherine Hepburn could fall under his spell is completely inexplicable. She's supposed to be smart, but it does not seem like Lancaster's scar was thrown onto the screen! Besides, history is probably one of the most stunning movies I've ever seen and it's too obvious that it's a movie based on art. It seems that the film was mostly recorded on the sound stage, not on the wide open West, how it was supposed to be. <br /> <br /> In general, a very overrated movie.
