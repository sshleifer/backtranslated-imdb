[I saw the movie late on the public TV station, so I do not know if it's on video or not.] <br /> <br /> This is one of the "Baby Burlesks" (sic) that Shirley Temple did in the early 1930s year. It's hard to believe that anyone would allow their daughter to be in this small, racist movie that today could be considered a "kiddie porn" website. <br /> <br /> Shirley Temple appears in the cast, which probably has an average age of 5 years. They are all in diapers and are located in the salon, which serves milk instead of alcohol. "Cash" has the form of lollipops. <br /> <br /> Shirley plays "femme fatale" sashays at the bar and talks to the soldiers who make suggestive comments about it (!). But Shirley does not really need her lollipops / cash, because her bag is full of bags from other "men". <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the little black boy makes a suggestive dance on a nearby table (!). br /> <br /> What a strange movie. . . babies using racist dialogue playing adult roles in the salon. Who somehow invented these things?
