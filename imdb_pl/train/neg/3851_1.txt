I never thought that I would see a movie worse than "Lisa Picard Is Famous", but it was quite close. As was often repeated in the comments, it was predictable; five minutes after the movie you know it will be a song due to a change. This movie is painfully related to everything from "Something about Maria" to "The revenge of a pink panther." Writer Greg Glienna (Meet the Parents) needs new material. <br /> <br /> The only turn of the action is a mad boy / policeman led by internal affairs, but even this chance is wasted. Many shots from the Space Space Needle series from Seattle needed to hide the obvious Canadian shooting site. Some of the worst scenes in cars, almost effortlessly to hide the fact that the car is pulled by the city on the trailer. Shit, at least turn the wheel or apply the brakes once in a while. Selma Blair is indifferent, and a short haircut is a crime. 3M $ for Jason Lee, for what? Guess he beats a skateboard! <br /> <br /> So here's who should see this movie: fans of Bee Gees, who want to hear the two actors singing "Islands in the Stream" badly; People who do not have enough Julia Stiles. 1/10
