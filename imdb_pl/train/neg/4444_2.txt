Dr. K (David H Hickey) is trying to master the formula that will put an end to all diseases and disabilities, but he needs live donors to finish his job. His brother, Dr. Richard (Dennis O'Neill), has a son, Eddie (Derek Philips), who is admitted to a medical school. Eddie has a girl named Sarah (Lizabeth Cardenas) who is pre-law and plans to attend the law school for the upcoming fall. She and Eddie are resuming their relationship when Sarah recalls things with her current boyfriend who is also in Walt's (Bill Sebastian, Eddie's best friend who recently paid for his boob). Eddie accidentally gets hit by a car and appears in the heat of death when Dr. K. suggests to Richard ... "recover" Eddie using his secret, illegal methods. When Dr. K applies his serum to Eddie, scary results appear. Eddie's face grows out of massive warts when it takes on the taste of human meat. Many will die that Eddie can satisfy this uncontrolled appetite that he can not quench. Soon he may even threaten his father and girlfriend ... Eddie Monster must be stopped. <br /> <br /> Usually, a horrible movie with a horror movie directly suffers from a serious lack of budget, acting and general talent. The premise, which seems to be an interesting terrifying festival, can not be delivered even in the form of zombies. Gore is limited by several crunching scenes, but most of the violence occurs outside of the camera. Using time to transfer history can really be annoying.
