My friends and I saw the movie based on the title itself. It's cute, though obvious, in plot and direction - you know where the movie is going in the first five minutes. My main argument with the story is that although it remains fairly consistent, it never explains the many things behind the heroes. The father of an alcoholic, overworked mother, stressed sister ... is a bad family, but apart from the occasional mention from her sister, there is no resolution. I was also confused about the scene with bottles ... it seemed quite accidental. <br /> <br /> Writing is a secondary problem ... children were not bad actors, but their scenario left a lot to be desired. Unfortunately, what could have been a lovely niche movie has been pushed aside for a single, special blah effect, modest scripts and a blatantly obvious plot.
