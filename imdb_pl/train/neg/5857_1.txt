WWF Survivor Series 2001 <br /> <br /> It was one of the worst events in 2001. Perhaps his biggest disadvantage was the fact that he did not follow most of the previous Survivor series. There was only one match from a series of survivors. And this Survivor Series match lasted 45 minutes. What's more, everyone with a working brain would know that it would end up with The Rock versus Austin and The Rock overwhelmingly for his team. And do not start me from previewing before the event. No matter who won, it was obvious that no one would want to die. There was no need for all this senseless noise. Regardless of the plot, it was just a wrestling event. <br /> <br /> And for the rest of the games: the first match was Christian defending his European title against Al Snow. It was a good match at a fast pace and it is good to see how the heel wins honestly. William Regal vs. Tajiri was boring and we saw him 2 or 3 times before. Edge versus The test was good, but not a big deal. The match with the steel cage with the tag titles was the best match of the evening. The Royal battle lasted 10 minutes and nobody worried about who wins in the first place. The women's title match was not great. No, not in the slightest. The main event must have been the most hypocritical in history. The Alliance has lost, but guess what, after every 5 months, every Alien superstar has returned. The match itself was weak. The rock eliminated 3 of them, and Jericho eliminated 2. The rock was too busy for him to be there when the invasion began. Jericho was the one who threatened the whole match. If I wanted any second to be eliminated at the beginning, it would be. Everyone knew that Kane, Big Show and Undertaker were just guys from the fall. 7 matches are not enough for the Survivor series. If the Survivor series ever appears as bad as this one, I will
