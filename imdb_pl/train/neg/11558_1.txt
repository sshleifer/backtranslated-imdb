An extremely horrible story, which I can barely express in words. The best part of the movie was that one of the victims of the murder appears at the end, alive and healthy, only to be murdered again. There is a chance that I missed a few important elements of the plot, because I could have been in a coma while the child was on his feet. The box in which the movie appears, shows scenes that are never even in the movie. I was lured by simple images of torture of captivity and the promises of "Euro-junk, sexy horror." I have the impression that it was a budget version and omitted about a quarter of the movie. All good things more than likely. I got PG-13, which was just as sensible as the end of the new movie Planet of the Apes. Watch this with a friend and a bottle of hard things. You need it.
