This is undoubtedly the worst film ever made. There is no argument here. This is it. The end of the story. The story is youthful and subtle, it looks like it was created by a three-year-old fascinated by dinosaurs. The whole concept is simply stupid. It's unthinkable how someone could come up with something so stupid and think it was fun. Jokes are also completely poor. If you have not seen this movie yet, consider yourself lucky. If your morbidly curious how bad this movie is, please do not make me describe it. Words can not express how awful this film is. It's not as bad as a bad movie. Even you have consistency, if not entertainment value. This. . . It is. . . Ugh! Think of the worst story ever told, and multiply its bad level by 5,000, and you still have not come close to how awful this movie is. After giving the Pokemon movie one point, giving this film a single point seems nothing but charity. That's wrong. Did the producers and directors even take film lessons? Because it is a perfect example of how not to make a movie. It seems that some amateurs imposed on the paint did this film. If you hired it, take it back and ask for a refund. And do not even think about borrowing it again.
