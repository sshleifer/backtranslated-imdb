Question: how does a bourgeois director treat a topic like immigration? Answer: transforming it into a parable of existential alienation. <br /> <br /> Yes, we returned in the early 1990s, just after the breakup of the Eastern bloc and the subsequent flooding of immigrants in the European Union, and what better way to deal with this topic than making a film about an existentially alienated middle-class journalist, an existentially alienated politician of the upper class, his existentially alienated rich wife, etc. <br /> <br />, immigrants ask for political asylum in an unnamed Greek village near the borders. I think Angelopoulos can show some social awareness in this way when dealing with existentially difficult higher classes. Honestly, a scene where some top army officer curses his destiny because he sent his daughter to study in London, just to throw up. <br /> <br /> In any case, it can not be that bad, but Angelopoulos is a master of film art, right? Wrong. At this point his manners are too artificial, like a filtered picture in Photoshop. His usual tricks appear: indistinct windows, blurred lights, strange wedding, walk on the banks of the river and people with yellow coats. Mastroianni also opens up new opportunities for the most lunatic achievements in history. Avoid really. Go to his early movies.
