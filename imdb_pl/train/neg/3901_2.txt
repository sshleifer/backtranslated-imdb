The script is cool. Although casting is absolutely unobtainable. No style. the costumes do not look like some of High Highbury's. Comparing Gwyneth Paltrow with Kate Beckinsale, I can only say that Mrs. Beckinsale speaks English better than Mrs. Paltrow, although Mrs. Paltrow's acting is in the very nature of Emma Woodhouse. Mr. Northam is without doubt the best Mr. Knightley from all versions, is romantic and is not at all sharp and insensitive as Mr. Knightley in the television version. P. Viewer does not see Mr. Elton-Ms at all. The development of Smith's account in the physical version, so you can not understand where the whole attempt was made by Emma to create the Elton-Smith match (except portrait).
