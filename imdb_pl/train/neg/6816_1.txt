I must say that there is nothing wrong with low-budget movies, so it was not my problem. My problem is that I felt like I was watching a neighbor's home movie. IMO everything about it seemed to be a guy who wrote a short story, grabbed the camera and started shooting. I understand how difficult it must be to effectively, but when I pay for a movie rental, I expect that I will watch a professionally made movie. <br /> <br /> John Schneider has a huge resume, he is a great actor and this movie was good. Other people were not in it. I understand how it must be fun and cheaper when it comes to using friends and relatives as a cast, but this is not a convincing action. It looked like the way he was filmed tried to give a lot of scenes a more interesting look, but when writing, plot and acting are in the beginning, this type of style is not necessary and it is a distraction. <br /> <br /> Also at the technical level, he had digital artifacts everywhere. In the first scene of all these great cars, when they made their slow scan, they seemed to pull back and forth just a little. The problem is not in my viewing equipment (diagonal Benq PE-8700 84), but somewhere in production. I've never seen this kind of artifact in a professionally made movie before. Then there was the sound. they did not make any voiceovers that might be okay, unless they sound like a song in this movie. It sounded like a built-in microphone in the camera.
