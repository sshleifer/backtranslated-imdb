There is much to like here. The actors are prime, and the script provides a good dialogue best reflecting the atmosphere of a closely related, nice family. However, for this reason the film is not real. We see Leo, who apparently just learned about his positive diagnosis of HIV, basically reacts in a way that is not adapted to the supporting atmosphere for which he is. The film also ends quite abruptly, avoiding what Leo, his brother and the rest of this close family had to deal with in the light of their love for him. The young actor who plays Leo's brother Marcel is impressive, because the rest of the cast is generally the same. Unfortunately, the screenwriters could not decide whether they want a thorough hearing about the impact of HIV on a functional, attractive family, or on HIV, which is devastating to the victim - so it only suggests both. While this film provides food for thought, it leaves the viewer much more than it provides.
