Let's see ... I try to practice finding positive in everything, so what can I say about Pallbearer? <br /> <br /> I know! The performances were - no, it will not work, because they managed to suck the entire personality with Gwyneth Paltrow, usually so lively, and ended up creating caricatures from Carol Kane and Barbara Hershey ... <br /> <br /> Oh - how you will tell - no. It will not fly, as it was in the case of a nap. What was the genre? It was not fun, it excludes the comedy. It was not interesting enough to be dramatic. Was it an affair between Schwimmer and Paltrow? I have to ask, because I can not be sure - let's call it simply "losers". I am sure that those who are behind this film started with a vision, that is, they had to have someone who could boast of costumes in the studio, but I need help finding it. <br /> <br /> Even if I was a patient who could forgive the pure stupidity of this story, I could not recommend a film with a clear conscience, which allows the guy to go to a professional conversation about a windbreaker job and sloppy, fluffy, stupid hair. Speaking of hair - should we be amused with the purposeful black roots and platinum zippers worn by Hershey? <br /> <br /> What am I doing? I've lost 97 irreversible minutes while actually watching the movie - I can not spend more time on the loser.
