A movie about Harlem Renaissance, in particular about one author. This contrasts with the modern story of a young, gay, black artist. <br /> <br /> If it sounds vaguely, it's because the movie itself is. It is well-targeted, well-written and (mostly) well-made. Scenes from the past are also shot in atmospheric black and white. It is also one of the few films dealing with gays who do NOT avoid sex scenes (not so clear and without frontals). I still hated it, though. <br /> <br /> The movie revolves around the whole place, full of unusual characters (including the main character) and (this is the killer) moves at the pace of snails. Three times I was thinking about leaving the theater because I was so bored. But the director WAS there, so I stayed. <br /> <br /> His speech after words shows that it was a work of love and lasted for 6 years. I really regret that I can not like it more (there are very few films honestly talking about black gays), but I can not. If you are not interested in Harlem Renaissance, there is no reason to see it.
