I read this movie somewhere, which was supposed to be a remake of the 1949 film Noir from 1949, "Criss Cross". I think that the latter is disappointing, but it was still better than this movie. <br /> <br /> This film is "neo-noir" because it is contemporary and has color, two things that Purities will disqualify for the status of film noir. <br /> <br /> The biggest downside was that there was no cinematography (it was okay), but a mixed up storyline. Hey, some of Dashiell Hammett's stories from the 1940s were similar, but some of them did not care. The creators of the film did not help this situation by posting flashbacks in history, which seemed every three minutes. No wonder he has followed this story. It was funny! What's happening is that, for a 45-minute sign, there's so much confusion that no one cares. I know not.
