I can not vote for it because I would not watch the trash from these people. They got my money with another film (Mr. Jingles) and I swore that it will never happen again. I feel that it is my civic duty to help people stay away from this trash. Go to the forums in this video and read where the cast members try to act as if they were watching the movie for the first time. One guy even responds to himself ... using the same name! There are shills on the forum that say it is as good as Shawshank Redemption and Citizen Kane ... Not even close (by no means). If this is the company's second film, it should be better than the first. This means that the third movie should be much better. No, I saw it. All I want to know is how you distribute that garbage, using the same names all the time. Playing with friends and making a movie on the weekend is okay ... but do not try to sell this trash!
