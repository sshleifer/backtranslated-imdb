John Wayne and Albert Dekker compete for oil rights on the territory of India, and for Martha Scott's attention in this republic film filmed in Utah, USA. <br /> <br /> An interesting western because of its characters its more modern setting in which Wayne and Dekker play old and new factions of the West. It is based on the story of Thomson Burtis, who co-wrote the script along with Eleanore Griffin and Ethel Hill. Albert Rogell is guided in a way that suits his career. Quite a mundane story is actually recorded in the last third, where, fortunately, the action rises and we are treated as something resembling a pulse. A light approach to the romantic range is not entirely right, and Rogell fights for a great fist fight between the two heroes, unable to hide the stuntmen doing the job. But hey, stuntmen always deserve a moment of glory. Solid support comes from George "Gabby" Hayes, and Wayne, as usual, has a large screen charisma, especially when rattling the pistol. But despite the Republic's better budget than usual, it remains an interesting film only for Wayne's enthusiasts of the 1940s. 4/10
