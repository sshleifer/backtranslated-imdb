William Cooke and Paul Talbot share the director's and writer's appreciation for this fun low-budget movie about three boys camping in the woods with their horror magazines. Feet supported by fire and student tease back and forth ... and a scroungy tramp from a city named Ralph (Gunnar Hansen ... from the fame of the Leatherface) wanders and turns four tales of gore in exchange for food and heat of fire. <br /> <br /> One of the stories is the old tread "The Hook", two teenagers on the belt of a lover attacked by a mad killer with a hook on the hand. Another story has several tokens that need to get some weeds. They bump into a guy who knows a guy who has great s # @ t. When they smoke a few bags, their skin starts gray-green before it blisters and falls off. One of the better stories tells of an unhappy man returning home for Christmas, who can not wait until his mother dies, and likes to tell his nephew and niece about Satan Nicholas. The fourth story about the bonfire is about a greedy sailor who rinses on the shore nervously with an empty treasure chest and ends with a zombie being driven out into the sea. <br /> <br /> Without a big budget for special effects, CAMPFIRE TALES is right and really could be much worse. A bit banal, but it's cool to watch, maybe with the exception of the sailor's story. Acting is not, understandably, worth rewarding. Among the cast members are: Tres Holton, Courtney Ballard, H. Ray York, Johnny Tamblyn, Walter Kaufmann, Kevin Draine, David Avin and Paul Kaufmann.
