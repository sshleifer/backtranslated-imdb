I love the bad movie of horror. I do not care if acting is sub-par or monstrous. I liked the movie with the exception of a stunned feeling from the beginning of the movie to the end. Listen, I do not need a 10-page dissertation or a character with large letters explaining the story to me. But Dark Floors takes "what is this movie about?" On a completely new (irritating) level. What's this movie about? <br /> <br /> It is not extremely scary or exciting, but if you have an hour and a half to kill and / or you want to end up with frustration and disorientation, hire this winner.
