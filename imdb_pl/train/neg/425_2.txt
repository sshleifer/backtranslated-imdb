I can not believe I'm so angry after seeing that I'm going to write my first review on IMDb. <br /> <br /> This Disney document is nothing more than a terrified Lite Planet Earth. Now I knew it was advertised as "from the people who brought you Planet Earth," but I had no idea that they would use bluntly the same cuts as the groundbreaking documentary mini-series. I just paid $ 8.75 to see what I already have on DVD. I am ashamed of Disney for not warning people that there is nothing absolutely original (except James Earl Jones' voice and 90 seconds of sailboats that I do not believe they were on planet Earth). <br /> <br /> But the biggest crime is that while the Earth uses the tragic story of a polar bear as proof that we're killing this planet and a catalyst for ecological change, Disney took over this story and turned it into a family friendly tripe. After the collapse of the polar bear, they show that his cubs grow a year later and throw out trash, that they are ready to continue his memory, and that the earth really is a beautiful place. No mention of adults who are approaching death because of the same difficult situation in which their father survived, without warning about troubles for future generations, if we do not act together, nothing. Only assembly of things that we've seen in the whole movie (and many times more if you're one of the billion people who have already seen Planet Earth). <br /> <br /> I never left the theater feeling so embarrassed and cheated in my life.
