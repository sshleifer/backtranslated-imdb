First seen 6/18/2009? 2 in 10 (Dir-Pete Riski): Strange psychotic film about a girl with autism, who is tested in the hospital, the power flickers, and then hell breaks loose. Honestly, I'm not sure what the intentions of the creators of this film were. What we get for the next hour and a half (at least it was not longer), is pokrÄ™cony horror / zmierzch / strefa zombiefest / duch, which really did not make sense even to the very end. Initially, after turning off the power, everyone is missing in the hospital, except for a small group of misfits, including the girl and his father. There is a typical annoying figure, a terrifying old man and a typical tough guy similar to many scary and, of course, a young girl who attracts the main character. Random things start to happen at different times, such as appearing ghosts and monsters, a hint that time has stopped, and dead people, like this small group, are trying to escape, regardless of where they are. Of course, the autistic girl is the center of everything and I really hate it, how they used the girl's nuisance and insinuated that it is the cause and puts it in the hospital where people care, it is really bad. We never really know what is going on, which is very strange, so avoid this dog. Unless you want to be scared and confused for an hour and a half, it's not for you or any film-maker. What a waste of time? Really !!
