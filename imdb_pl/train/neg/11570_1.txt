the directors' intentions towards these films are quite honorable, but its production history has made me realize that this may not be as important as other filmmakers do. having in mind their wonderful 30-day TV series, but also hoping for their MTV production, "I bet you will be," which opposes his seriousness in any matter he documents, and counting on his rather disappointing production of "supersize me" I did not have my hope. Unfortunately, this movie disappointed me. just like with "supersize me" after some time I asked myself what exactly it was about. the main statement becomes clear enough after half an hour, but the rest of the game's time is filled with rather pointless things and repetition of things that have already been shown in one way or another earlier in the movie, so they wear out and become extremely boring compared to the end.
