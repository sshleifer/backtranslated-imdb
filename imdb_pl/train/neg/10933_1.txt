Steal every stereotype and false statement you've heard about half-godly Mormons, and you'll see that everyone has performed in this ridiculous excuse for the movie. Finally, the fate of Kurt Hale has changed (thank God) and I hope it will take a long time before we see any of its functions in cinemas. <br /> <br /> The photos were amateur (I think they used the camera for some basketball scene). The plot was inert and very indecent. You really did not understand why someone did something. It was as if I had sand in my eyes, and a 300-pound lady was sitting on my face, it was so painful. <br /> <br /> The only reason why I did not give this film a negative rating was the scale will not let me.
