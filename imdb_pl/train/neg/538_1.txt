Wow, what a waste of acting talent. My husband and I were sitting there, both thinking that it must be better, these actresses are too good to waste time on this nonsense. Unattractive characters, broken script and meaningless stimulation last two hours. Actually, I could not hack him and leave him grocery shopping (cat litter is more attractive than this movie). Your husband has been confirmed that it is not better - before Buddy is killed, you regret that no one will be hit by the car and end their pathetic life. It would be infinitely more fun. Beautiful landscapes and costumes will not keep it alive.
