If I could, I would give ZERO to the stars for it, but unfortunately I have to give ... <br /> <br /> There is not one scene from which I could laugh ... but the game did not make me laugh. So if you're a poorly educated people, go to your local cinema, watch this movie and give it 10 stars, just like some people have already done. <br /> <br /> but for me ... in the movie, where children are shot to achieve humor ... good taste crosses the borders ... it was the third time that I was wasting time watching Bolla and it was definitely my last! <br /> <br /> 0/10 ... I am ashamed that I come from the same country as Uwe Boll! <br /> <br /> PLEASE SAVE IT MORE FILMS !!!!!
