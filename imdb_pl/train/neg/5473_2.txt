I've never seen any of these SciFi originals before, it was the first one. I think it's just to judge acting, direction / production, set design and even CGI effects in other SciFi movies. Comparing this with your typical Hollywood production is unfair. I will say, however, that in general Aztec Rex did not resemble the masterpiece of Werner Herzog Aguirre, Wrath of God. <br /> <br /> Let me begin by noticing that yes, I recognize the fact that this movie has more with the clash of culture than with dinosaurs. Despite the fact that it is a science-fiction movie created especially for television, there is a context for the story I will examine. The attached symbolic elements are obvious enough. <br /> <br /> As a consequence, as a student of history, theology, mythology and film: dialogue turned out to be outrageous, and the story's plot was somewhat offensive. I am not asking for any mea culpas on behalf of producers - as I said before the film. But what worries me is that most of the younger demographic group of this film probably relies on television to provide them with lessons in history and cultural diversity. <br /> <br /> The main problem manifests itself most visibly in the form of Ayacoatl (no comment for the show Dichen Lachman, but just the way her character was written, although I will say that is a bit of work before getting the nod emmy). It is thanks to its character that the actions of Spanish Europeans are justified. Her role in the film, as Rios' love interest, confirms that the European way is right, simply because they are Europeans. There really is no other reason. Really it left only the assumption that the viewer is to be associated with the Europeans over the Aztecs because of their dress, language, ideology, etc. They are the more well known than the Aztecs - because Azteki are portrayed as enemies and "back". And it's not just that the viewer has such an assumption because of ethnocentric perception of viewers, but it really seems that the story tries to convince the viewer - as if the Aztecs were unable to come up with a plan - if not better - to lure dinosaur death punji bed. <br /> <br /> There is a subgroup of Spaniards who are portrayed as looting of temples and intend simply to abuse their native MesoAmericans. There's also a scene in which a Christian holy notes achievements of the Aztecs: "They agriculture, medicine, calendar, etc." - But ultimately Aztec warrior is presented as the main antagonist of the film, even the "thunder lizards" (more on this later). He presented it as a treacherous, duplicitous, and attempting to send a romantic European, tricking him into eating hallucinogenic mushrooms changing the mind - an important spiritual component of certain aspects of religion and native Meso and North Americans (again, more on that later), so that it can stop the woman he feels it belongs to him and away from the Spaniard. <br /> <br /> Now, analyzing the true nature of the story (leaving the obvious topics of Christian and pagan off the table) from the symbolic point of view - the viewer can easily take these so-called representatives of the thunder lizards ideology / theology mesoameryka≈Ñskiej, which in this film presents as an intention: bloodthirsty, ruthlessness, cruelty, wickedness, and maybe even evil? In opposition we have this group of Christian wanderers, led by young Hernando Cortes, portrayed as naive but generally noble, lambs caught in the dark pagan world of the Aztecs. The name of the film is also Aztec Rex, which leads to the belief that it's about dinosaurs that eat people. However, what Aztec Rex translates is the Aztec king, the head of the Aztec state, or in this case the "present state". (Hence why the title of the movie was changed). So who finally sees as the new king of the Aztecs? This is the remaining Spaniard, Rios. Aztec Rex refers to a new European ideology that overcame Native Americans through illness, bloodshed, war and hunger. Rios symbolizes the ideal European - just as the presenters of the film would like them to be remembered (as opposed to Cortes, who represents "a practical but still noble European"). But when we look at the Holocaust of the Americas, let's be honest: are not the symbolic elements of the story of this film a retreat? <br /> <br /> I must say that Aztec Rex is a bit racist in the worst case, or to be nice to him, at best ignorant. <br /> <br /> And yes, I know it's just a movie, I understand that everything was supposed to be fun, but in the end we have the idea that Rios was the father of the last remaining Aztec lines? I wonder what the Native MesoAmericans would have to think about this ending ... as for me, I thought it was a bit too lax. <br /> <br /> The best supporting performance of the film goes to Ian Ziering's wig - although striking - he at least changed the look of Ziering so much that I did not think I was watching yuppie from 90210, leading a group of conquistadors into the heart of darkness. Ziering proved that he was more than a talented actor in this movie, I actually bought his performance, or at least I forgot it was Ian Ziering. I do not know who his agent is, but he should get more work. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I saw Jim McGee again. I am a fan since his too short theft of scenes in 1988 in Scrooged. <br /> <br /> Alexander Quaresma - DeusExMachina529@aol.com
