Unlike the other two current game shows in the US (Deal Or No Deal and 1 vs 100), the pace in this program is too slow for what is happening on the screen. <br /> <br /> DOND and 1 vs. 100 can escape because of slow pacing because games can change the tempo - or end - at any time. Each action taken by the player is associated with risk, the rewards are very variable and it is difficult for players to leave with a significant amount of money. The suspension is usually well used. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Show Me The Money is too slow. Once the question is revealed and it is obvious that the player knows the correct answer, you can be sure that nothing interesting will happen in the next few minutes. This would greatly help to show the correct answer FIRST first, and then the player should choose a dancer instead of wasting time talking about what will happen if the player receives an incorrect answer when we all know they are right. Random dance is a filler that really resembles a filler. Too much time is wasted when there is not enough ... and the fact that players can not give up playing at the beginning guarantees that a lot of time will be wasted. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I have NO Interest in watching Shata shaking his groove, especially after eating dinner. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of the game show, but even I had a lot of trouble with the hour. It requires big changes or early retirement.
