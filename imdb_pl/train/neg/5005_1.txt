Trashy, terribly horrible (and NOT in a funny way) C-class movie. Everything screams "amateur", from a contrite scenario (bizarre premises, limited coherence and predictable endings, turgid lighting, sound and camera angles held in hand, sex coy and passe inneundo and references, patchy and unbelievable dialgoue to Z I saw it on DVD and I hoped that Edward Wood would pop out ... Everything is forgiven - your worst movies are works of art, and more consistent than that chat. <br /> <br / > But still, better than warbling "Every night in my dreams I hear you" - are you sure that the Titanic crew were not involved in it?
