MYRA BRECKINRIDGE, known since the cinema release in 1970, has become synonymous with cinematic debuts with legendary proportions. Finally, on DVD in an unexpectedly handsome package, it is unlikely to win today a wide audience, just like the first release. <br /> <br /> Gore Vidala's bestseller from 1968 was a dark satirical statement. Most filmmakers believed that the story, structure and general tone of the novel did not translate into a film, and industry experts were surprised when 20th Century Fox not only acquired rights, but also hired Vidal to tailor his novel to the screen. Soon, however, the studio directors had cold legs: Vidal's adaptations were repeatedly rejected, and the novice writer-director Michael Sarne was introduced to bring the film to the screen. <br /> <br /> The studio managers hoped that Sarne would hit the youth market as the film's goal, but Sarne proved even more unsynchronized with the material than the managers themselves. Rewrite after rewriting. The cast, sensing the disaster, was becoming more and more militant. In the DVD commentary, star Raquel Welch says she rarely had any idea about Myra's motives from stage to scene, or even within a single scene, and each person involved seemed to make a completely different movie. In the accompanying documentary, "Back Story", Rex Reed says that MYRA BRECKINRIDGE is a film made by a group of people who have hidden in wardrobes, waiting for their lawyers to return their phones. <br /> <br /> The accuracy of these comments is shown by the film itself. The basics of Vidal's history are, but history has not only been stripped of all the broader implications, but it does not make sense in itself. Everything runs in many directions, nothing connects, and many scenes undercut all the logic that previous scenes could have. And while director Sarne repeated many times in his commentary that he wants to make the film a pure farce, the only laughter generated is accidental. <br /> <br /> The most important of these accidents is Mae West. It is true that the West is unexpectedly well preserved in appearance and that she has not lost her way with one liner - but you can not get around the fact that she is over seventy, and her conviction that she is calm the sexiest trick in the footwear is at least disturbing. But what is worse, the fact is that the West is beyond its era. Her efforts to transform into a fashionable and living personality result in one of the most embarrassing, self-preservation caricatures ever seen in the film. <br /> <br /> The remaining cast is largely wasted. Raquel Welch, a highly underrated actress, plays Myra's title role very much like Barbie's doll on steroids; non-actor Rex Reed is unexpectedly effective in the role of Myron, but the whole role is basically pointless. Only John Huston and the episodic players John Carradine, Jim Backus, William Hopper and Andy Devine leave relatively unscathed. Yes, it is really a disaster that everyone involved in the movie was afraid of: quickly, when it should be slow, slow when it should be fast, inexorably from beginning to end. It's true that director Sarne has an inspirational idea from time to time - just like using all the movie clips from Shirley Temple to Judy Garland to create a counterpoint for the action - but basically always when Sarne had a choice how to do something what seems to be bad. <br /> <br /> How and why this is explained in Sarne's audio commentary. Sarne did not like the novel or the topic at all. He did not want to write the script, but he needed money; he definitely did not want to direct the film, but he needs money. He clearly emphasizes that he did not like the author Gore Vidal and Rex Reed (at one point he firmly states that Reed "is not a nice man") and still thinks that Vidal and Reed worked together to sabotage the film because he refused to participate in their "homosexual agenda" - which, when you get to it, seems to be their desire that Sarne actually make Vidal's novel, and not his weirdly imagined start on it. <br /> <br /> Although he spends a lot of time commenting that the film is well liked by the gay community, Sarne never seems to understand that the film's appeal to the gay audience is due to his absurdly inaccurate representation of homosexual people. In connection with the film itself, Sarne emerges as something more than a little homophobic - and to be honest, the worst choice of writers and directors that could have been created for this project. <br /> <br /> In addition to Sarne and Welch's comments and creating a documentary, the DVD edition contains several trailers and two versions of the film: the "cinema version" and the "restored" version. The only difference between them is that the final scene in the "restored" version was printed in black and white. Changes made prior to the introduction of the film for general use have not been restored, but the document presents details. Both panoramic transitions are extremely good and the sound is fine. But at the end of what I started, it is actually a film that will be of interest to film historians, cinema lovers and cult cinema fans. I give her three out of five stars only for themselves, but everyone else should pass it on. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
