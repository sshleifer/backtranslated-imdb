Scary Movie. About an old, crunchy painter who revolves around a young girl. Boring. Tatum O Neil performs his tasks and has one of the worst lines in film history. Richard Burton is close to death in this movie and we should believe he looks like "good at sixty." Operation is bad, as is the story. The heroes are horrible, just like history. It's really hard to sense someone in this movie, with the exception of Larry Ewashen, who plays a guy in a porn theater that hits Tatum. This movie is really a waste of time. If you are a fan of Tatum, just like me - that's why I rented it - please do not watch this movie. It is really bad in it and you are wondering if maybe PAPER MOON was a fuch. It was not because of BAD NEWS BEARS and LITTLE DARLINGS that he knows how to work well, but he still does not rent this movie. And if you're a fan of Burton, rent something when he was handsome and not fossil.
