The truth is that its very poor story - for the movie Walt Disney is complete. When robins come in, movies in every place, I was shocked at how poor it was. It's like "Alice in Wonderland" went wrong! Looks like they missed ideas, and some gathered some crazy rubbish to try - and they do not. Then I sat down, longing for the end. My younger brother lost interest halfway and was confused by history. The characters are weak, and after the appearance of the robins you do not care about the ending, you just want the movie to end. It's a movie that you can forget and quickly forget. If you have some free time, do not waste it on it.
