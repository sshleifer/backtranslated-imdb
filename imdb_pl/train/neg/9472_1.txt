It is impossible to avoid a comparison between The Cat in the Hat and The Grinch Who Stole Christmas, so let's get rid of this part. First of all, let me start by saying that Grinch was an underestimated and underestimated film. Cat was ... well, just awful. <br /> <br /> Jim Carey has been cast because he is a brilliant physical comedian and fearlessly undertakes to surpass, outrageous characters. Mike Myers returned to his old trick. <br /> <br /> Why, why Mike Myers ?? Children do not care about it, and the demographics of Austin Powers will not be spying on this film. What was the thinking in the studio? <br /> <br /> The cat was also apparently associated with Linda Richmond. We can talk? Why an accent in New York? Not exactly compatible with anything Dr. Seuss ever wrote. Myers was even allowed to sneak into his Scottish bird. I wonder how many different voices the director and studio tried to edit before they just gave up and said "as long as you do not say fahklempt," you can keep accents. " Meyers never seemed to feel any comfort either in costume, makeup, or dialogue. <br /> <br /> The jokes that were few were primitive and inappropriate. When Myers picks up a garden hoe and delivers it to the camera: "dirty ho", everything was missing, except for the shot, and even that would not help. <br /> <br /> The same people who created "Whoville" clearly had their share in creating the city and houses in "Kocie". Sets and props were very attractive, giving the viewer much needed distraction from bad writing, direction and Myers. <br /> <br /> There was some fun with Alec Baldwin and Kelly Preston. Dakota Fanning was the only actor who seemed to be aware that she was in a movie based on the classic Dr. Seuss and remained faithful to the genre. <br /> <br /> Call SPCA. This cat should be neutered and never allowed to reproduce. Please, please, without continuation.
