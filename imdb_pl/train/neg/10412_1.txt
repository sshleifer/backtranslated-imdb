this film is in the type MANDINGO & DRUM <br /> <br /> both were awful, BUT they are 100% better than these flaki, <br /> <br /> Poorly played and made Oliver Reed is the main name of Eartha Kitt too there is. Detriment. The rating is 1/2 * roughly as much as you can get <br /> <br /> as always <br /> <br /> jay harris
