Zombie Review # 3 <br /> <br /> ** Spoilery ** <br /> <br /> Few movies are really "so bad that they're good", and Zombie 3 is not just bad, he's unhappy , inexcusably wrong in so many ways that you may need a completely new language to describe them all <br /> <br /> What's more, this is a film attributed to Lucio Fulci that even by his standards there is absolutely no cohesion, sense or reason. However, we can not blame Fulci, because he was not really directed by him, but by Bruno Mattei, who does not even feel like Fulci's style to help move the film. Mattei seems to have contributed little to the film, but a stunning ineptitude. <br /> <br /> So I am ashamed to say how much I liked every worthless minute Zombi 3. There is no redemption function - in the known genre for thin characters, poor history and lack of filmmaking skills Zombi 3 pushes the boat, but it's even funnier than Nightmare City. <br /> <br /> "Action" begins when "Death 1" gas is stolen from the military base and damaged while escaping. Who is the thief, why he stole it and why the American army thought that creating a cannibalistic legion of living dead would be a good idea? You will not be able to answer all these questions and more in Zombi 3 .... <br /> <br /> After hiding in the hotel, the infected thief will go crazy because of all the green plastecin growing on his face before he is tracked down by the army, who somehow stupidly decides that the best way to get rid of corpses is to burn him, sending "Death 1" to the atmosphere, and as a result ... zombie birds! Who then attacks people and turns them into zombie people !!! (If the zombies are cannibals, why do not the zombie birds just attack other birds?) <br /> <br /> Then we meet our "heroes", the three horny GIs and the girls' trainer. There are also some other guys with them, but they are not important - NOBODY is important here. You will hardly remember someone's face, let alone their name or find a reason to care for them. In the end, they are hiding in the same hotel as the thief ("a week ago this place was full of life, now flies with flies!"), But there is no escape from the undead. <br /> <br /> By this Indicate that you will either be sucked in completely or you will turn this damn thing. The script is so frightening that even the biggest players in the world could not save it, so they might as well have one of the worst - and not just human figures, the zombie running here is always low. It has nothing to do with how zombies behave - some feel self-conscious in time, others engage in fistfighting or charge with machetes, not to mention the zombies that are still able to talk (the trick that gives the movie is HORRIFYING TWIST ENDING). They die from the shot in the chest (and not in the head), and even get knocked out by a good left hook. How can you shoot down zombies? !!!!! In fact, the emphasis on badly performed action of the 80s often resembles an episode with V ... <br /> <br /> Zombies also spend a lot of time hiding, apparently waiting for hours in funny places, the case of poor juice will pass away and fear of their lives . They hide in bushes, in garages, in huts, on roofs, in water, and even under pregnant women. At some point, the zombies follow the woman up the stairs. To kill her and eat her? No! Push it into the water, these zombies and their crazy sense of humor! <br /> <br /> However, there is a lot of blood. Limbs are hacked, wounds emanate with green oil, and eating meat and people crush their faces. There is nothing that would match the original eyeball piercing, but if the bad makeup effects are your bag, you will not let it down. <br /> <br /> All this, and I did not even mention horrible music, inexplicable flying zombie head, a scientist whose acting really stands out as REALLY bad, or the ultimate chilling punch ... With an idea for the original a radio station that has been controlled by zombies, Zombi 3 gives us a real zombie DJ !! "Came over to their side!" Our cry of the fleeing hero before he swears to continue to fight the undead in the sequel, which unfortunately never came. <br /> <br /> Zombie 3 is rubbish - there would be no loss for the world if every single printout was destroyed and all records of its existence have been deleted, but somehow I feel that my life is richer because I saw it. <br /> <br /> Did I say richer? I meant 88 minutes shorter ...
