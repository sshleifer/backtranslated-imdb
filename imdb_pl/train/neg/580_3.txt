A really bad movie, the story is too simple and predictable, and poor acting is complementary. <br /> <br /> This story of the vampire hunter is the worst I have ever seen, Derek Bliss (Jon Bon Jovi), traveling to Mexico in search of some bloodsuckers!, using some interesting weapons (but nothing compared to the Blade) and is part of the Van Helsig vampire hunters' network? OK, but he works alone. He was assigned to pursue the mighty queen of vampires, who is looking for a black crucifix to perform a ritual that will let her be insensitive to sunlight (this is almost the sequel to Vampires (1998) directed by John Carpenter, starring James Woods) Derek begins the search in search of the queen with new friends: Sancho (Diego Luna, really bad actor) teenager without experience, father Rodrigo (Cristian De la Fuente) Catholic priest, Zoey (Natasha Wagner) special vampire and Ray Collins (Darius McCrary) another expert vampire hunter. Of course, he is not alone in this adventure. <br /> <br /> You can start to feel how this movie will look only on its main actor (Jon Bon Jovi); there is a huge difference in the quality of action compared to James Woods, and then, if you watch a movie (I do not recommend this part), you commit yourself to one of the simplest stories, completely predictable, with horrible performances, really bad special effects and inconsistent events !. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend not watching this movie!, rent a different movie, see another channel, go out with friends, etc. <br /> <br /> 3/10
