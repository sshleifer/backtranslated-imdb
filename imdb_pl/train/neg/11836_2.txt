Ultimately too stupid and senseless. Yes, there is a gilded cage metaphor, but most children probably miss it. Unforgettable. Immediately. <br /> <br /> Animation is, as we expected, very real. The plot line could best be described as thin but persistent. Although the ending seemed arbitrary to me. <br /> <br /> An underground sewer is a disgusting reflection of the world above, and in some way wealth and money count. Yes, and there is a romantic interest in a woman who is wiser, wiser and better - this in itself quickly becomes a tiring (anti) stereotype. Probably your children will love it.
