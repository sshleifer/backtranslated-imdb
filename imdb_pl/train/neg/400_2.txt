I rarely make such comments, but I felt compelled to save others the pain I endured while watching this movie. She is so stupid and unbelievable both in history and in details that simply can not be suspended in disbelief. The problem starts early when you see a government investigator who turns in a new Porsche and ate with his team in a restaurant that looks like a castle, overlooking the Capitol Building in Washington. Is it a kind of life on a government salary? Hah! Worse. At the end, when a bad guy starts killing good guys, the other group acts so stupid that you want them to die to clean up the gene pool. The special effects are pretty good - any producer can buy them - and the main actors did a great job in other movies, but the script and direction here are moronic. Many people have wondered if there was any thoughtful intelligence behind the earlier, stupid films of Paul Verhoeven (Showgirls, Starship Troopers), but this movie should stop thinking. It's just bad.
