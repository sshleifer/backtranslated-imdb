Will anyone tell Shaq to stick to what's good in basketball? This movie was not even funny on a stupid level. In this movie, shaq plays a genie who lives in a boom box that is not the original gin in a box instead of a lamp. He is to help the little boy played by the equally annoying francais cappra. This movie had the slimmest story from the water world, the acting was terrible and I think that anyone who likes this flim will be afraid to admit it.
