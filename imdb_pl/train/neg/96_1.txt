.. Wait, I can! This video is not intended for a typical movie snob, unless you want to refresh your typical movie definitions such as "continuity editing" and "geographical matching". I could not tell where I was in this movie. In one second they are in the present, in the next moment they are supposedly driving a modern SUV in the 1970s and wearing something that looked like me in the style of the 80's. I think. I could not give her enough time because acting was just awful. I think it attracted attention because it has a 3d that I did not watch. If you're a movie fan b, and by b-movie I mean BAD movie, then this movie is for you. It's a home movie, and the whole style makes no sense making you laugh as long as you do not sleep. If, however, your taste is more suited to Goddard and Antonioni, simply skip this one.
