One night I was able to sneak out and go to the cinema to see the movie, thinking that a feast awaits me. Boy, I was wrong. Given the talent involved, this must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Everyone in it was misunderstood and I think it's amazing to read on this site that there are people who really like it.
