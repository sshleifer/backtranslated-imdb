Here is an independent film that I really wanted, but ultimately could not. The lack of a script (boldly preached in the main titles) really shows and kills the picture. History is a nonsensical mess, which is not worth trying to figure out. I got bored quickly in 10 minutes, and then I suffered the rest of the first 40 minutes - hoping for the best - before I hit the chapter (luckily) came to an end ... even that was not worth the extra effort. OZARK SAVAGE is clearly trying to be clever, raising his best sequences from EVIL DEAD 2 and THE MATRIX. As a result, there is little in OZARK SAVAGE, which has not been done before, and better. This movie would be a lot more fun because it would be 10-20 minutes shorter, but as a function it feels padded and forced. Of course, there is no money in shorts, so I completely understand the financial reasons, which I think motivated it to over 75 minutes. Director Matt Steinauer shows a great promise and I wish him luck.
