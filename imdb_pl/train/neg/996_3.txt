Revenge is one of my favorite themes in the movie. Moreso, "futility of revenge" is one of my favorite themes in the film. After watching the Irreversible Gaspar Noe (2002) I expected an even more accurate expression of this topic. Instead, this movie is a weak half-hearted attempt that expressed nothing but a lack of conviction and focus in the film. <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS * The final scene, a free scene of rape / torture between men and men turned out to be nothing more than a fantasy of rape for the revenge of women. However, the movie does not even follow it. Instead, the pull-out scene (which FAR exceeds the brutality of the initial rape both to the extent it was graphic and to which it has been ritualized) is crowned with a shot in Dawson's face in regret or "It was not" fix anything "while rape at her rapist is heard in the background. <br /> <br /> My problem with the stage was not a shock, but a confusion as to what the scene was like trying to reach the audience. I mean, do we feel bad for the rapist? Are we happy for Dawson's revenge? Are we disgusted by the brutality of all this? Do we feel a moment of regret from Dawson? Apart from this failure, the movie is really awkwardly walked with more style than content. Characters are thin, dialogue is monotonous, etc. <br /> <br /> I usually try to make movies on my own terms, but Descent really did not know what it was. Thumbs down.
