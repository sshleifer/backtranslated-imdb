I read the story of John Everingham many years ago in Reader's Digest and remember how I thought it was a great movie. And it probably would be if Michael Landon never got it. As far as I am concerned, Landon was one of the worst actors on earth, and his artistic license has gone the way, as his massacre from the series "Little House" is proof. Acting, for lack of a better word, is a terrible, slovenly scenario and there are more close ups of Landon puss than it should be allowed. <br /> <br /> This movie reflects Everingham's story just like "Little House On The Prairie" reflects the book "was based". It's just another vehicle to show Landons's horrible hair.
