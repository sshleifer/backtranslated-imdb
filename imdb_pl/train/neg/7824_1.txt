I saw the movie last night and I really wanted to like it. My expectations in relation to the film have been rising and falling since I heard that it is being created. A few days I saw something spectacular, and a few days I would be disappointed. <br /> <br /> But being a fan I am, I had high hopes for this movie, but in the end I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Although I love Richard Donner's films, I did not like their sometimes camp nature or the changes that were introduced as Superman and his powers. <br /> <br /> The singer, however, decided on the worst elements of Donner's films and put them in his version. <br /> <br /> While his Lex Luthor is a bit darker, he is still nothing more than a shyster, a conman, and an ordinary criminal. He is no more intelligent than when Gene Hackman played it. Kevin Spacey makes every effort to play Luthor well, but ultimately falls victim to trashy writing and unusual dialogue. <br /> <br /> His followers are more two-dimensional than even comic supporters. Most of them literally have no dialogues in the film. <br /> <br /> **** AHEAD SPOILERS **** Kitty Kowalski is almost identical to Mrs. Tesmacher. It seems to be as bad and cold as Lex Luthor, but turns out to be just a subordinate who drowns after seeing Superman in trouble and tells Luthor quite predictably. <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointment in the film was Frank Langella as Perry White. In Donner's films, I was not a big fan of Perry White, but at least he had a soul. After all, an experienced reporter was told and done, who was concerned about truth and good history. Perry White Langelli is nothing but a corporate marionette. He wants everyone to focus on stories related to Superman because they sell papers, although every other paper does the same. He does not care about real stories, real secrets, such as darkness and what Lex Luthor is so far that he is out of prison. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about Langelli is that it's DULL! Some actors may be calm and sober, and yet have an upstream that allows them to know that motionless water is flowing deep. Frank Langella is a puddle. <br /> <br /> Brandon Routh is not a bad actor. It's okay, but again there is not a single memorable line in the whole movie. Not the fault of the actor. His movements are supposed to look grateful, as even the smallest movement of his fingers affects the way he flies. But it still looks choreographically and artificially. <br /> <br /> Lois Lane, although badly written, was surprisingly well played by Kate Bosworth. Unfortunately, for a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and writer, she is as eloquent as any teenager on Dawson's Creek. <br /> <br /> James Marsden was my favorite actor throughout the movie, mainly because it looks more like Superman than even Routh. Without any superpowers, he manages to find Lois Lane's message, flies into place, takes the Luthora boat and saves Lois and her son. <br /> <br /> The only moment in the movie is when there is a whole trapped pantry flooded with water and the ship is sinking. You see how they slowly immerse in water. You know that Superman will come at the last minute to save them, but you still can not feel sorry for them. <br /> <br /> As I said, the conspiracy is very random. Unlike Singer, this is not a movie about a superhero returning and trying to find his place in the world. As soon as he returns, the world greets him with open arms. Lois is the only person who is not happy with his return. Even Luthor is happy that he has Superman back, because he gives him a chance to regulate the result with a man of steel. <br /> <br /> Superman is probably one of the stupidest heroes in the universe. A big green piece of the meteorite is stolen from the museum, Lex Luthor has been released from prison, now has knowledge of Superman's powers and weaknesses, yet he is still unable to connect the dots enough to know that Luthor will use kryptonite against him. <br /> <br /> According to the film, the only thing that Superman is good at is really lifting really hard things. All action sequences are unbelievably predictable.
