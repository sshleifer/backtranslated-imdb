Two sisters, their perverted brother, and their cousin are in trouble with the car. Then they happen at the home of Dr. Hackenstein, who conveniently needs a part of the body of three young women to experiment to bring the deceased lover back to life. He tells them that he will help them return home in the morning, so they spend the night. Then a good doctor goes to work in this low-budget horror comedy. <br /> <br /> I found it a bit funny, nothing came of it at all (I came across this with Netflix instant view and streaming to Xbox 360), but better than I expected it to be a movie purchased by Troma. Most of the humor does not work, but there are still some elements that made me smile. Plus late, great Anne Ramsey has a small part and has always been a feast to watch. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Bambi Darro and Sylvia Lee Baker got topless <br /> <br /> My class: D +
