It is possible that A Man Called Sledge could be irreparably damaged on the floor of the cutting room. Maybe one day someone will demand a director's cut, but I seriously doubt it. <br /> <br /> James Garner decided to make spaghetti on the western spaghetti market and thus led many Americans to cast outside. People like Dennis Weaver, Claude Akins, John Marley. And of course we have Vic Morrow, who both wrote and directed this movie. <br /> <br /> Garner is always cast as nice rogues, because he plays so well. But he played seriously and did it well in films such as "Time for Children" and "Time of Guns". He can effectively break away from his usual stereotypical part. But Man Called Sledge can not be counted among his successes. <br /> <br /> He has the title role as the notorious outlaw of Luther Sledge with a big price on his head. After partner Tony Young dies in the living room, and Garner takes the Eastwood steps, he left John Marley's living room. <br /> <br /> Marley spent time in a nearby territorial prison and it seems that the gold shipments are put under the zip and the key there at a stop for people transporting things in regular run. Garner collects his gang for a robbery. <br /> <br /> Here is a movie that completely disappears from the wall. Usually, heist films show how the heroes plan a lot of methodical actions. Certainly it was the case in The War Wagon, about which another reviewer wrote. But in this case, Garner decides to break into prison as a prisoner of false US Marshal Dennis Weaver and cause the shooting, at which time gold will be robbed. <br /> <br /> It was just too much to swallow. If taking gold was so easy, it should happen a long time ago. But let me say that for those who like the blood and guts of the Italian westerns, there are enough of them for three films during this break in prison. <br /> <br /> That's not all, of course the outlaws are falling out and we have another fest before the end of the movie. But by then, the whole movie had lost a lot of consistency. <br /> <br /> A great filmmaker from the 1930s, Allan Jones is mentioned in the subtitles. But for me I can not find him in the movie. Maybe the refrain in Donkey Serenade can make it better. <br /> <br /> I could not hurt.
