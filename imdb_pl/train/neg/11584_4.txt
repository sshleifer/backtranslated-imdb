About twenty minutes after this movie I was bored. It's just that these characters were quite boring. From time to time, something pleasant happens, but then everything will be released again. Fortunately, my patience was finally rewarded, and the ending of the film was not bad at all. However, it was not good enough to justify sitting for the first ninety minutes. So I would say that the film was generally average, and given the entire talent in the cast, I would call it a disappointment.
