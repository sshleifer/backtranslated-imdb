I really have problems with the evaluation of this film. It's genially directed, of course there is a lot of money in it. Gere and the Danes are very intense (although her personality on the screen may be more specific and add), the editing and photos are excellent. On the other hand, this is one of those really really sick movies where you can not help wondering if the director himself likes to create specific scenes, and you can not help wondering how many followers will inspire such a film. /> <br /> In purely artistic terms, this is 9, but I really have to ask myself who these people give money to produce such a movie ....
