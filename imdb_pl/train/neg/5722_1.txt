First, I would like to forgive my bad English. <br /> <br /> I am not a hardcore HOSTEL fan, but nevertheless I liked this movie. Live channel, however, SUCKED BIG TIME! I've never seen a movie gore with a great game, but hey, who's surprised? Acting live was ... well, not there! I saw how some commented on it because it had to be a school project or something like that. Ok, but not by students in the media or acting school. It was NOT a class! And what about history? A really sad rip off at the Hostel. And what about gore? And what about the psychopathic scenes of torture to make your bowels turn and leave you sweaty in the cold? It was the most disappointing movie about holes! Short, fast and WITHOUT edge. More like an execution than torture. Okey, where there are buckets of blood, but they do not even look real. Slaughter and violence resembled more Braindead than Hostel or any of the Saw movies. And Braindead was fun! Okey, I used to laugh at Live Feed a few times, but it was more of a disappointment than pure fun! <br /> <br /> So instead of wasting 80 minutes watching Live Feed, watch ANYTHING!
