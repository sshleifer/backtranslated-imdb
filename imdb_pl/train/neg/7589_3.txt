What do you expect when there is no script at the beginning, and therefore nothing that the director can work with. Hayek and Farrell, Donaldson and Kirkin are good actors, they just have nothing to say or anything to react to. Even the earthquake was quite weak. And I do not know how much the film follows the novel, but two of the Jewish girls appear out of nowhere, so they show that Arturo has a nice, warm heart, but some stereotypes have nothing to do. And he even burys Camilla in the desert instead of bringing her back home for a nice Catholic burial, where she brings her flowers at least once in a while. Pathetic. L.A set was ridiculously created graphically. Anything good? The window to his apartment was real, curtains, noises, wind. And Donaldson is always great. Since the Body Snatchers or Night of the Living Dead, whatever it was.
