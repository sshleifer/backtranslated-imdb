The rich guy from Harvard falls in love with Radcliffe's poor grace, to the dismay of his stern father (Ray Milland). <br /> <br /> A syrupy, sweet, and above all juicy story about the battle of "classes" when rich Ryan O'Neal brings to the house of a librarian whose snobbish parents can ridicule him. Ali MacGraw is a social neglected with dirty mouth, while John Marley plays her pious Catholic father, but no one in the movie is more irritating than O'Neal himself with his whining portrait as a Harvard master yuppie. > After 8 (!) Years later by "Oliver's Story".
