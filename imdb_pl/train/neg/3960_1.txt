Hi, maybe because I'm not a theater director or a sophisticated movie watcher ... I think this movie is "Boring" and "Stupid". <br /> <br /> I rented this movie because of Charles Bronson and this is the title ... but boy what a waste of time ... just watching 2 guys sitting in the treasury and talking ... <br /> <br / > The movie on this DVD was so "dark" ... I had a hard time watching the movie darn ... I realize it's a 1968 movie ... but they put it on a DVD and then they should do digital remastering. <br /> <br /> I was also completely surprised to see these high ratings on IMDb for this movie ... as I said before, I'm not as sophisticated as other people who commented on this movie before.
