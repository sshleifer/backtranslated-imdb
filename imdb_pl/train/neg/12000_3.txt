The only possible way to enjoy this movement is by hitting your head against the wall, allowing internal hemorrhage to the brain, dying a few brain cells, and when you are officially mentally disabled, you can * LOVE * this movie. <br /> <br /> The only salutary grace was the story between Paradise and Stephanie. Govinda was perfect in the role of a taxi driver, just like the British. Perhaps, if they created the whole film about their escapades in India and how they finally fell in love, it would make the film much more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave him a grade 3 is that Govidy and his acting skills when it comes to comedy. <br /> <br /> Juhi Chawla and Anil Kapoor were unnecessarily squandered. Plus the re-unification scene at Heathrow was too difficult to digest. Being an international traveler in the post of September 11, Anil Kapoor would shoot a lot before he even reached the bridge to confess his true love :) But again the goal of the movie was to oppose logic, gravity, physics and throw an egg on the audience's face * GENERAL *. <br /> <br /> Watch this at your own risk. At least I know I've been crippled for my whole life :(
