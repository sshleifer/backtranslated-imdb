"Loonatics Unleashed" is the worst thing that can happen to the classic characters created by Chuck Jones. "Loony Tunes" have many spin-offs and different versions, some were good, others not really. But "Loonatics" is the worst. . There was no similarity with the original characters, and the stories are boring and badly made. New designs are ugly, and the animation is pathetic. This program simply does not work. This terrible waste of animation is a total failure and it should not be more than a bad joke. Lame! Zero stars
