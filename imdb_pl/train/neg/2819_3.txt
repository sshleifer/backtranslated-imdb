Marquis de Sade, Egypt, ancient Gnostic cults, Robert Englund in a double role, free sex and nudity, murder and chaos ... on paper Tobe Hopper's Night Terrors sounds like it was supposed to be a fun, funny movement of useful ingredients. This is not. It's a plot less, inconsistent clutter that brings little entertainment. Essentially, there is no plot going beyond the obscure matters of worship, which follows the work of De Sade, who for some vague reason feels the need to seduce the daughter of a local Christian archeologist and kill her. This is actually it - I think it has something to do with the Gnostics, but who knows what the writers thought. Most of the movie is a winding mess, because the heroine is exposed to various quirks, dream sequences and erotic meetings, interwoven with the scenes of Englund as a prisoner of Sade in the nineteenth century chewing the scenery. It seems that the creators tried something serious, but regardless of their grievances, they were buried in shoddiness, bad acting, flabby and false headless heads. <br /> <br /> There are not many good points. Robert Englund is enjoying himself as always, and the main actress, Zoe Trilling, though not very talented, is attractive and at various stages of undressing in the film, but watching Night Terrors is a chore. At least I saw the movie that comes from the "When You're as criminal as I" section from the Australian film-based guide, which was at the head of many VHS tapes from the nineties.
