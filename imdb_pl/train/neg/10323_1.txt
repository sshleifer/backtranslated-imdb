I was excited to see a sitcom who, I hope, represents Indian Candians, but I thought that this program was not funny at all. Producers and cast are probably happy that they have both bad and good feedback, because if it's about them, they're talking about them! I was ready for some stereotypes and I do not have a problem with it, because stereotypes exist for some reason, usually they are real. But in these stereotypical characters there was nothing funny. "Fresh from the boat" dad who does not understand his daughter. A Muslim daughter of a radical feminist (who is, by the way, a terrible actress) and a young modern Indian trying to run her mosque as politically correct as she can (she is quite a good actor, I see him only in a better condition) /> <br /> is very invented and the dialog box does not flow so well. there were so many possibilities for such a thing, but unfortunately I think it did not work and I do not care about watching the next episode. <br /> <br /> However, I liked watching the wonderful Canadian actress Sheila McCarthy, she's always a feast and naturalness in everything she does, it's a pity that her daughter in the series does not have the same acting abilities!
