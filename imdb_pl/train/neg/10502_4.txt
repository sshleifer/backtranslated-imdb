The film has several lines of stories that follow several different characters. Different feature lines do not seem to be one complete song that makes this comedy very inconsistent and sometimes annoying it. <br /> <br /> It may sound weak and banal, but it's true; You watch the Crocodile Hunter series on Discovery with Steve and Terri Irwin. It's more fun and even more fun than this movie. I'm sure that both the cast and crew had a great time creating this movie, but the film does not give the viewers much pleasure. For comedy, it just is not funny, and Steve and Terri Irwin are not just good actors, even when they play alone! Their antics are not simply good enough to make the whole movie around and their scene long, distracting and unnecessary, and sometimes even annoying. <br /> <br /> The movie had quite a lot of potential, I mean Steve Irwin is one character that is strange in both ways is intriguing and funny in watching, so when I heard for the first time that they are making a film about a "crocodile hunter" ", My first reaction was; excellent! The film, however, suffers severely due to its poor history and inconsistent plots with uninteresting and unhappy characters. The film has a certain entertainment value, at least enough to be watched at least once, but I would certainly not recommend the movie anyway. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie seemed a waste of time. This movie can be watched only once when it appears on TV on a rainy afternoon. He has a few good moments, but the plot really ruin the film and its potential. <br /> <br /> 4/10
