I sat down to watch this movie with my friends with very low expectations. My expectations were not low enough. Honestly, I could not say what genre the movie was watched, and if it was a comedy, humor was completely overlooked. The story did not exist, and the acting was frightening. Together with my friends, we were able to watch about 30 to 40 minutes of this movie before we turned it off and immediately asked the video store to pick it up. I DO NOT recommend this movie to anyone unless you deliberately try to watch the worst movies of all time. Honestly, I do not know how this movie lasted more than one day in cinemas, and I can not understand why anyone would like to see it, taking into account not only the very uninteresting title, but also the lack of famous actors / actresses in the cast. This review is not a joke and I honestly think that it could be the worst movie ever made. This is definitely the worst movie I have to sit in.
