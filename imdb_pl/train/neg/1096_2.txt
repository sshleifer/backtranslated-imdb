While some of the training scenes were realistic, too many of them represented military instructors as former Nazis. Of course, the people who wrote the game on the screen were either antiwar types or writing a movie for that audience. <br /> <br /> I'm a Vietnamese vet, and even during this period, military instructors who behaved in the way some of them do, will probably still serve in a military prison. <br /> <br /> And I really liked the scene where the "hero" and his buddy (both ranks) are sitting in the captain's office, smoking and talking and cursing the captain as if he were their friend. These kinds of things have never taken place during training or in a formal situation, as was the case on the stage. <br /> <br /> At the end I asked myself: "What was this movie about?" because it seemed to be wandering around the whole place without focus, except "I hate all power." Thank God I got it from the library and I did not pay for the rent.
