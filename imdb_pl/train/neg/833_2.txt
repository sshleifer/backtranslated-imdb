There was not much history in this film. This loosely based on the events of the first movie of the Lion King. It is supposed how Timon and Pumba met thanks to their loneliness. But there is nothing more. <br /> <br /> He mixes some of the scenes from the original, and then ab-libs about how this movie changed them a bit. But it still is like that? I counted on something more. Instead, all I have to show is an empty story with little explanation. <br /> <br /> I think if you want to see other meerkats in the Lion King universe, that's it. But besides, it does not provide justice for the animators. Disney really should stop these productions directly on the video. It was really boring and Jason Statham could have used it. "RE-"
