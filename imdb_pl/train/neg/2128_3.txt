An unnecessary remake and can not come close to capturing the charm of the original. Extreme length causes more than a few parts that cause yawning. This version is ridiculously politically correct. The film lacks style, and above all it lacks talent, not only to play, but direction, sets, costumes, etc. They are below par. It has a gross disregard for the details of the period. Vanessa Williams is the only cast who shows any talent, Tyne Daly is not so bad. They should have left well alone. Singing is good (Vanessa Williams) for the poor (everyone else). Watch the original version from 1963 and skip this one. There is not much to recommend here.
