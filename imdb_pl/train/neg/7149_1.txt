Whoever wrote "Redline" as a great car movie must be paid by Daniel Sadek to promote this shitty, burning, steaming pile of amateur nonsense. Easily the worst automotive movie or movie ever made. This makes Showgirls look like Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> Take every cheesy cliche from the 80's TV series, put on some really bad special effects and lame characters irrelevant and you have vivid proof that Daniel Sadek should not write scripts and do not produce movies, but stay in the real estate industry. <br /> <br /> It's such a lame movie with such a lame plot and the most fancy action sequences in history. What offends me is not that the creators of this movie are idiots, but they consider the film an idiotic audience enough to fall in love with this shit.
