This movie is the second worst movie I've ever seen (the first was Ghost Rider). Absolutely no plot, culmination, conflict or any other important details required to depict history. This "movie" is just another excuse for Toby Keith to show off his masculine side and "the tough guy he really is." I totally wasted my time watching this movie. End credits would be the best part. If I was Ebert or Roper, I would cut my fingers off and throw them to the producers. Whoever in his right mind gave Toby Keith the chance to act in a feature film is of course on the same mental level as he is. In conclusion, do not waste time watching this movie, it may be the only thing you regret.
