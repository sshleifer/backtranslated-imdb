Honestly, I knew what to expect before I watched the movie, and I must say that it has the worst act I've ever seen. He has his moments, and at the comedy level is very funny, but I'm afraid that it is not terrifying, and stupidity moves to a new level. There is a lot of unnecessary blood, and the plot is everywhere. I have no idea why the aliens were angry and why they even came to this distant part of Wales (I mean, who would go anyway?), But at the moment I did not care because I was amused by costumes and angry CGI. When it comes to B movies, it deserves the title "being so bad, its good" and right for filmmakers because they probably knew what they were doing. Long films can continue .....
