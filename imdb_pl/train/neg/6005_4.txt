It is a classic stench with a large cast of names, mainly of seniors, who at that time were much better than the previous ones. <br /> <br /> It's quite depressing when you think about it. Stay on earth and you will face illness and ultimately death. <br /> <br /> Gwen Verndon showed she can still dance. It is a pity that the film did not focus more on this. Maureen Stapleton, looking miserable, still showed these steps from the "Queen of the Star Dust Ballroom", much more mundane since 10 years ago. <br /> <br /> I just hope that this movie will not encourage seniors to commit mass suicide at the level of Jim Jones. How can anyone be idiotic enough to like it and say it makes you think? <br /> <br /> Why Don Ameche won the Oscar for this nonsense? <br /> <br /> If the seniors were doing such a wonderful thing at the end, why was this young man encouraged to leave the boat? Why did Steve Guttenberg also jump out? In the end, he found his love lady. <br /> <br /> It would be a nice movie if the seniors could find their fountain of youth on earth and stay there. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, with the exception of Wilford Brimley, in this letter Vernon, Gilford, Stapleton, Ameche, Tandy, Cronyn and the Lord know who else has gone. Writers should take the script and put it also in this group.
