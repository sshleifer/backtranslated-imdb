I had many expectations related to this film, and the more so because it was a Yashraj movie. <br /> <br /> Jimmy runs a call center and one day he is invited by Pooy Singh to teach his boss, Lakhan Singh, English. They both fall in love and decide to escape, but Pooja tells Jimmy that he can not do it because he owes debt to Lakhan Singh, who is also known as Bhaiyyaji. But they decide and steal money from him, and then Jimmy learns that Bhaiyyaji / Lakhan Singh is Don. In the meantime, Bhaiyyaji hires a man, Bachchan Pandey, who has tracked down Jimmy and Pooja. <br /> <br /> Starring Saif Ali Khan, Kareena Kapoor, Anil Kapoor and Akshaye Kumar. Krishna Acharya and is produced both by Aditya Chopra and Yasha Chopra. <br /> <br /> "Tashan" must be one of the worst movies I've ever watched. Yes! The scenery is good, and Kareena Kapoor (and her publicity for weight loss) looks good. But the plot is very thin in history and sometimes there is no sense from one scene to another - that's why at the beginning I said that I expected more from this movie because it was Yashraj production. Regarding the songs, unfortunately, there is not one song I can remember now. <br /> <br /> There are times when you can laugh, mainly thanks to Akshaye Kumar, and Saif could definitely do better when Kareena Kapoor played his part well. But this can not be said of Anil Kapoor - he did not suit him as a villain at all. Finally, no matter, Aditya Chopra, who in the past produced and directed good films such as "Mohabbatein", what did Yash Chopra do, producing such a film with garbage? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: bad movie, it is not worth wasting time and this is my first and last impression.
