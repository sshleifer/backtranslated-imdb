This was my first and probably the last Angelopoulos movie. I really wanted to get involved because it was Mastroianni, one of my favorite actors and the movie By Theo, which I heard a lot about. The opening was a promising, long shot over the jeep of soldiers on the Albanian-Greek border. WELL! but that's all. Nothing left. The film had large holes and I do not know what to mention first. The main plot of the story is revealed to the journalist by an old woman. during a long walk. It's like a 15-minute monologue, killing the spectators' action and patience, nothing happens on the screen for 15 or even 20 minutes, in addition to the old woman telling the story. Anything that is supposed to be shown by action was simply said to the camera by an elderly woman. In a moment, the TV set was going to the bar. They turn the corner and immediately winter begins! Probably, filmed on different days, there was a leak of continuity. Many of the problems associated with telling stories have changed from absurd to irrational, never stick to the style, so that the viewer asked questions that were never answered. Poor Mastroianni, who was given a role that lacked integrity or charm. On the other hand, as many Greeks, Albanians and Balcan would agree, the films showed a lot of historical, ethnic or political inconsequences, just to make a film about "humanity" as red in another review. Much more to say, but no time to lose in a bad movie that was not a movie at all, but lunacies a person impressed by the film and paid from state money.
