Essentially a story about a man versus nature, this movie has beautiful pictures, lush jungles of Ceylon and the presence of Elizabeth Taylor, but the movie never really moves. Newlwed Taylor is ignored and neglected by her husband, and is later attracted by the foreman of the plantation played by Dan Andrews. Plantation is under the spell of the late father of Peter Finch, whose spirit throws feces on the Sun, which becomes the main point of the dispute between Taylor and Finch. Elephants are determined to regain their traditional water path, which was blocked when the mansion was built on the right side of the road. Beasts are crazy and provide the best moments of action in the picture. Taylor and Andrews have some good times when he tries to remain a faithful wife, despite the difficulties of marriage with Finch.
