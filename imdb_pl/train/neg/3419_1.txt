OK, so Chuck Norris somehow found a way to produce this sequel. I have one question - why? Who reads this script and said: "Sounds great! The original! "This movie is a bad shit that I would not mess with in the gut. Of course, this is another story, following the tradition of MIA, Invasion USA, Walker, Texas Ranger, Delta Force and so on, in which of course Chuck Norris is the only man who can the same America from some bad guys. In most cases, he does not even need a weapon. It's stupid patriotic jargon that strengthens the mind. A great surprise that the only director of these Norris films is the son of Chuck Eric. Eric Norris worked mainly on his father's films and TV shows. Is this not a sign for anyone that he has no talent for driving? Afterall directs the same people as before, in the same stories as before ... The only difference are the names of the characters. If it is to make me patriotic and cheer on the US, our country is in a much worse condition than I ever imagined. I hope it will be a nail for Chuck Norris' coffin.
