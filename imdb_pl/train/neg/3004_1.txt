What a horrible movie. Acting was bad, the stimulation was bad, the cinematography was bad, the direction of evil, the special effects were bad. You expect a certain degree of evil in the strait, but even the killings were bad. <br /> <br /> First of all, the past event, which set the motive of the slaughter, lasted 15 or 20 minutes. I thought it would never end. They could remove 80% of them and explain what happened well enough. <br /> <br /> Then the victims were invited to a "meeting" at the abandoned school, which still had all the tools turned on. One of the victims thought it was a bit strange, but they rejected her and decided to break in. <br /> <br /> After all, the killings were so false that they could hardly be seen. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to watch this movie, unless you want to see some breasts and not very good breasts. This movie makes Showgirls virtually indistinguishable from Citizen Kane.
