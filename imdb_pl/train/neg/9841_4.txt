I really wanted to like Julian Po. I think that Slater is underestimated as an actor, and many players supporting him are better than they have a chance to show in this film. I realize that it is based on a story I have not read. So, I do not know if what I see as the film's errors arose from history or was imposed by the director / screenwriter. The premise is great, and I loved reading, the tone of the confessional that hits the opening narrative. But then...? Nothing! Several local heroes ask Julian to explain that he intends to commit suicide. One can argue that he does not answer, because it is not their business. But Julian is the one who publicly expressed his intentions under apparent pressure. At that time, neither Julian nor the director / writer, despite the fact that Juliańska does not write a tape recorded for God's sake, seem to be willing to pass everything except the skimpy initial information about Julian's life. He says he was an accountant. He says that his family moved when he was a child because of his father's work. So what? There are several interactions with locals that seem to be meant for Julian's enlightenment. But none of them go anywhere, because Julian seems to consider all these stupid inhabitants aliens from another planet, as if he were the ultimate (and only) one of them. It may serve as an allegory if Julian Po had any definitive characteristics or something that would give him wisdom. The closest one, who reveals anything about himself, is in a scene in which he deliberately humiliates the naïve, religious wife of the mechanic. And this scene reveals that it is not something that would arouse empathy for Julian. I only see the Julian figure - which is provided - as selfish, petty and totally condescending. Fits the director's attitude of this half-baked, imaginary film. And poor Michael Parks, an actor who once had so many promises, there's nothing to do.
