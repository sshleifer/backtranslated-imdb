I saw this movie in my international cinema class and I was made my way. This movie is just one scene of gross shock value after the next. <br /> <br /> The fourth person is an alcohol writer named Reve who has visions of his danger. During a lecture at a local club, she meets a woman named Christine and decides to stay with her only when she discovers how attractive her boyfriend is. Put simply, Reve likes Dutch sausage. So Reve devises a plan to seduce Christine's boy so he can have sex with him. But later it was discovered that Christine had three previous husbands whom they all murdered. Now Reve and Christine's boyfriend can be "THE FOURTH MAN". The plot makes sense without any holes in the story. Editing and everything else that's technical about this movie is fine. The film is simply disgusting and I felt the need to vomit in some parts. Basically, this is not my cup of tea. <br /> <br /> The movie begins when Reve gets up from the bed in the JUST shirt. So at the very beginning you will see the lovely platypus Reve, who is moving around his cramped apartment in a hangover. Then he has a dream in which his pecker is cut off with scissors and show him along with the following fountain of blood. Reve caresses the statue of Jesus and has homosexual sex in the mausoleum. Plus there is a lot of blood. More blood than all Freddy Krueger's films combined. <br /> <br /> Not that I have something against "shocking" scenes, but this movie is so glaring when it comes to shock. The whole movie revolves around the value of shock. <br /> <br /> So if any of those are your cup of tea, watch this movie. Otherwise, stay far away from it. My mind is still scarred.
