I really did not like this movie ... mainly because of the main characters! They are immature, selfish and self-centered people. They hurt EVERYONE around, playing their stupid game. The visual effects were good, but they are good, if there are no characters with whom you connect or interesting threads. Should I be happy when these two psychologists FINALLY consume their love for themselves? <br /> <br /> After watching this movie I thought: "It has to be number 1 from France?" ........ <br /> <br /> * spoiler * <br /> <br / > The end: GOOD RIDDANCE! They both deserve each other! <br /> <br />
