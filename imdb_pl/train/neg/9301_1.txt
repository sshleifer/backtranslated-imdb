Spoilers in front of you, if you want to name them ... <br /> <br /> I almost recommend this movie so that people can really see 1/10. Where to start, we will start from the top ... <br /> <br /> HISTORY: Do not believe in the premise - the film has nothing to do with abandoned cars, and people finally understand what the mysterious events are. This is draub, basic, go to cabin film without intensity or "effort". <br /> <br /> SCREENPLAY: I usually reward independent writers, it's hard work when you start ... but this is nonsense. The story is flat - it leaves the whole movie without emotion. The dialogue is extremely weak and predictable, and the lines "Woah, you totally scared me" and "I was wondering if ... would you like ... oh, would you come to the cabin with me? ? "It makes me want to rip all my hair, one band at a time and feed it myself. <br /> <br /> CHARACTERS: HOLY CRAP !!!! Some have described the characters as flat, I want to go a step further and say that they actually have the opposite arc of the form. Actually, they start working on a parallel universe and they almost start to work back ... <br /> <br /> ACTORS: Actors are worse than the heroes. They take on poorly-written characters and add scary acting to high school. He said that "Woah, who totally freaked me out" was so monotonous and slow - as if he was muffled. I could complain for hours to the actors themselves. <br /> <br /> TECHNICAL: LIGHTING: An eight-year-old would be disappointed with the lighting of this film. Too dark in areas, too bleached in others. The director should not use the light as an emotion until he learns how to properly light the basic stage. Small steps! SOUND: How many guys do you need to make a really sounding movie? 9. With so many people from the sound, it should sound amazing, but something quite the opposite happened. There is one scene that really stands out, these people drive a car, and the sound of the car changes with every angle of the camera .... WEAK! CAMERA: Learn to use it. <br /> <br /> In any case, I end up complaining ... ... lend it - I dare ... Hire her and learn from her ... give this 1 rating ... he deserves it. <br /> <br /> Signing ...
