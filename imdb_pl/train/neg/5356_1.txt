I'm sorry to say that this movie is really bad. It reminds me of a c-grade porn movie with one major difference: no pornography. <br /> <br /> History and dialogue require a total change. Maybe then bad behavior would not be so noticeable. At least, the pace should be raised. <br /> <br /> Although I agree that he had a low budget and the director did a good job visually, considering what resources he had, he should have spent more time on the plot or better, let someone else write it. Many action scenes were pointless. <br /> <br /> It was a complete waste of my time.
