Today I wrote this review in anger at Uwe Boll and Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Hollywood produced films based on one of the darkest days of our nation. 911 changed everything. This has changed our perception of security. It changed our understanding of the evil of man and of humanity. Most importantly and destructive, it has changed our world. <br /> <br /> I can not stress, however, how totally disgusted, disappointed and angry I am in the careless, glaring ignorance of Hollywood striving to earn money from death and destruction. This film and others like him will surely cause controversy among the whispers of both moviegoers and critics; it will certainly be repeated by the mainstream press. Hollywood has dropped to a new level. Even lower than the rascals who committed the most barbaric acts of savagery and unrelenting cruelty. Uwe Boll is behind all of this. I am very angry at this movie. How dare they disregard the memories of lost families? How dare you mock the life of brave men and women who risked their lives to save those imprisoned in the doomed towers on this disastrous day of shame?!?!? How dare you try to satire, and at the same time take advantage of the national tragedy in the fog of mourning and the weary world after 911?!?!?! How could they? <br /> <br /> For those who want to even think about this morally terrifying parody, I say this with a heavy heart with all my strength: Remember. Return to this day and ask yourself if you are a reasonable and moral person. Let's go back to this day, ask yourself whether this movie is a disgrace and a disgrace to those who are lost on this day. Let's go back to this day of the cries of relatives. Let's go back to this day of life lost on these two planes. Let us return to the further slaughter caused by attacks. <br /> <br /> Ask yourself if you have a soul. <br /> <br /> Think. Remember. Respect memories of lost lives in 911, not seeing the film at all.
