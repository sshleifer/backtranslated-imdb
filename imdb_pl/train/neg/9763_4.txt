The best-selling writer George Plimpton (Alan Alda) accepts the task for Sports Illustrated. He is to go incognito to the Detroit Lions training camp and try out the position as the third quarterback. Members of the band quickly hear about it, including Alex Karras and Mike Lucci. The whole team considers it fun to cause obstacles in the writer's determination to play the series in a real game. <br /> <br /> This film is Aldy's debut and also helped Karras leave the field. In addition to the Detroit Lions in 1968, the cast also includes Sugar Ray by Robinson, Roy Schieder and Lauren Hutton. <br /> <br /> Alex March directs this story based on Plimton's book.
