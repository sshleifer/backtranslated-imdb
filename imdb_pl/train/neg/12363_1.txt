This is one of those movies that apparently tried to survive the madness of martial arts. Like Billy Jack, I think. However, while Billy Jack had one notable scene of martial arts, there is none in this one, unless you think of some gentlemanly grappling and roughhousing as such. We present a star that is described as learning judo in marines. I was in the Marines and although they are very well grounded in boxing, I really do not remember any pressure on Judo. As a result, the antagonist James Macarthur refers to Judo when he offers an excuse, why he was so easily defeated by the master of state. Lame.
