(Review in English, because Swedish is not allowed) <br /> <br /> I saw this movie with extremely low expectations and I can unfortunately inform you that the movie barely lived up to them. <br /> <br /> Although I liked Jansson "Loffe" Karlsson on the big screen again, the authors should realize that seven people falling into the water are not original or funny. The story is very thin, and the jokes are used and predictable, the ones that are not, they are just boring. I smiled three times during the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Placing Swedish Findus products is (unintentionally) fun, why not just a big sign; "Findus made it happen!" <br /> <br /> GÃ¶ta Kanal 2 does not have to be watched in cinema or on DVD, just wait until it appears on TV, it will not take too long.
