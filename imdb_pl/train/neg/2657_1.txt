I waited for this movie to play in great anticipation. Assuming that this will be more accurately depicted, like the movie "The Christmas Box" based on a book by Richard Paul Evans. I have sent many e-mails to friends and family asking them to watch this program, hoping that they will better understand a bit of my "new" life. After watching this movie I was very disappointed. As a mother who lost her only child in November 2003 and REALLY knowing the pain, I was hoping that this film would shed light on parents who "think" that they understand the sadness that the parent who lost the child goes through. This movie was a very light film, and Diane Keaton's stupidity was hitting the face of the parents who buried the child. From the beginning it was very unrealistic. I had a few phone calls after the film, everyone called the same: "It was so bad and it turned out that in a short time you are back on the road and listen to songs on the radio, and life comes back." bunch of bull! It is obvious that the director and Keaton never lost a child because it would NEVER make the film so bad. It's Hollywood, I think.
