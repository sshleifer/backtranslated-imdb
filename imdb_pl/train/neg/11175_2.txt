Until someone enlightens me, I really have no idea what the movie is about. It looks like a photo with a message, but it is far from it. This film tells the pointless story of a New York press agent and his problems. And that's basically everything. When this agent is played by Pacino, you have to think that it must be something important. But you do not have to wonder how senseless and boring this movie is. For one of the best actors in the world, Al Pacino, this is the second film of the year (the second is "Simone"), which deserves the title "the most boring and the most pointless film of the year". So what's happening, Al?
