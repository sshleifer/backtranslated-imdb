Lynch. A man has really great things! He knows how to disturb us, and then reward us by asking us to think in different ways. However, this is completely different. Dumbland's award is a 1% absurd comedy, gained by enduring 99% stupidity. I could laugh someday, but somewhere around episode 4 I just started watching quickly. I did not miss anything. I felt relieved when it was over and this is part of the cycle. This is an annoying series with annoying characters in annoying situations, complemented by annoying animation, voices and sound. However, the recognition of this and other absurd qualities still does not make Dumbland worthwhile.
