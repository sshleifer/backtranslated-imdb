I really have no idea how to comment on this movie. The special effects were weak, the acting was terrible, and if everything was fine, it was at the back of the box. I do not think I remember a movie that's been so bad for a long time, and I'm a big fan of lesbian sex and boobs !! ;) Even this could not save this film from being just a terrible pretext to pay someone for standing (or lying down in this case) in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> I was quite disappointed by the general "zombie" effect. Because apparently in this movie, zombies are so common that they run around a couple here and there, and casually talk about it at the gas station (one with internal windshield repair, but without an internal bathroom), the zombie movie genre is not even a factor to end. Even then, an episode of a dozen zombies ripping the girls' clothes is not really a zombie movie. <br /> <br /> Vampires: Apparently, all zombies are male, and all vampires are women, which is fine for me. I'm not sure how the vampires come out in the daylight, or why / as the vampire soldier stood in the middle of the road, still holding the gun with the pin in his heart, just waiting for the Vampire Queen to do it. The last segment of the old monastery did not make sense, and when one hot lesbian vampire asks the other hot lesbian vampire, "Do you think we did the right thing?" By killing two apparent heroes in the film, about putting him on top. <br /> <br /> Acting and special effects were also at a low level. You could almost see the snakes from which the fake blood was pumped out while the zombies who passed the general approached. Speaking of general, where did they find THEN Kenny Rogers anyway? I have no idea who the General was, except generally misleading and unjustified. <br /> <br /> In total, watch the movie if you have nothing better to do or you have a strong need to waste $ 3. Only my $ 0.02.
