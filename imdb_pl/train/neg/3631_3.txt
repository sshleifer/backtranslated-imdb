I must admit that Parsifal is not an opera that anyone can enjoy, although it is my favorite, in particular Knappertsbusch, 1951. Syberberg's whole approach is so static. Whenever the music suddenly starts to swell ... Syberberg keeps the cast at the same pace. Amfortas and Klingsor shots are unlimited. What happened to the film editing? The result is physically exhausting. The viewer is never spiritually transported. Your impulse is to hurry home and re-record to confirm that Wagner understood this well, Syberberg was wrong. And that was the pride of these "clever" reminders of Wagner's anti-Semitism - will he ever be a viewer of this film without previous knowledge of Wagner?
