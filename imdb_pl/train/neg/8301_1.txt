Very bad. Why someone thinks it's a good movie, let alone funny, it's a real mystery. I like comedies just like the next man and I LOVED "A Christmas Story". The fact that he has the same director and was based on the memories of the same writer, completely wonders why this movie is such a complete failure on every level. Charles Grodin is pitifully confused as a father to start with. Secondly, it seems that there is no stimulation - it just does not flow well. Everything seems tired and forced. The joy of life that penetrated the first movie is completely absent here - you just want the movie to end. I would not even recommend this movie for curiosity seekers who liked "A Christmas Story". It's so bad. 1/10.
