Maybe I'm out of date or I just do not know what Electra looks like in current publications ... But the electra I read was much more manipulative and always seems to have a plan. Usually, she used others to do her dirty work and more often than in the game there was something like a double cross. Just when you think you have all this, she understood that she is worried about your eyes and gets her way. <br /> <br /> This movie was quite weak in dialogue, the acting was not particularly convincing, and the action was uneven. I really was looking for something more like Frank Miller's "Electra Assassin". Which is much darker than anything in this movie. <br /> <br /> A special effect, when cool, the action was sometimes interesting, but more often than history and the plot were slow or illogical. The hand was not dangerous enough, and Electra was not enough ... strange. She's a girl you like to hate ... but in this story I do not care.
