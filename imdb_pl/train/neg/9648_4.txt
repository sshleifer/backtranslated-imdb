Vipul Shah has done a really impressive job as a filmmaker in the past. "Waqt - The Race Against Time" and "Namaste London" were fun and interesting to watch. "Singh Is Kinng" was the game he produced. His last appearance as a filmmaker "London Dreams" appears when his career is the weakest. <br /> <br /> "London Dreams" has an average story, tells how success turns friendship into hatred. I agree, it has potential, but when you watch "London Dreams", you wonder what's going on? This film probably has the worst climax in recent times. Vipul Shah writer disproves the director Vipula Shaha. <br /> <br /> The first hour is boring, the second hour is better; but again the culmination is terrifying. How can someone forgive a person who has decided to destroy you? I will not. Ajay Devgn suddenly decides to go to India and ask his friend for forgiveness thanks to his uncle Om Puri. When he reaches India, instead of beating or abusing him, Salman greets him with the baja band and says he was the cause of the whole failure? Was Vipula Shah's intention to show Salman's character as GOD? If so, you have failed completely. The only question I would like to ask Vipul Shah is: would you welcome a person who destroyed you with such a wonderful reception? Write what you feel, do not cheat us (viewers), we are wise enough to understand what is good and what is not. <br /> <br /> This is a musical, but Shankar-Eshaan-Loy's music is terrible. Not one song stays in your mind. <br /> <br /> Salman is outstanding. He wears a movie on his shoulders and does it really well in emotional scenes. But again his character is shown as GOD, which in the end makes him look like he is delayed. Ajay is equally good, but Salman completely covers him. Asin is wasted and what is the great talent like Om Puri in this film? Rannvijay hams, though Aditya Roy Kapoor excels. Brinda Parekh is fine as a vampire. <br /> <br /> In general, this dream remains a dream!
