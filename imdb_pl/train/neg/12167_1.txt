Although it is a continuation of the stronger original, it is a more comical remake of Friday the 13th, concerning the further antics of Angela psychopathic, killing more younger teenagers for their "immorality" in the camp. <br /> <br /> Pamela Springsteen (Bruce's sister) looks great. There are some funny sex scenes with some nice attractive girls, but the movie is (unintentionally) comedic than full of tension, it stinks. <br /> <br /> * with ****. <Br /> <br /> MPAA: Rated R for graphical violence and gore, nudity, as well as for sexuality, language and drug use.
