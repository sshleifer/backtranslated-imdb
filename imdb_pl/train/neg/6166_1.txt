I do not recommend this film because it is inaccurate and misleading, this story was supposed to be in the Algerian Berber territory, it was shot in the southern desert of Tunisia (a completely different culture, I know that I come from Tunisia and Algeria), the second shocking element was her character the aunt's aunt who speaks in a film with a very eloquent French, academic French dormitory, while the character she plays would be a restless person never leaving a kind of personality, so living as a Bedouin with such education that the context is impossible. The most disgraceful scene and disrespect especially for the inhabitants of the region is the "femme repudiee" segment, which is a pure invention of the writer / director. Algerian Association ever !!!
