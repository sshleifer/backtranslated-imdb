Jared Diamond took care of the first episode that other nations in the world did not have animals that could be domesticated, but the Europeans did what explains why we were able to make steel and invent complicated machines. <br /> <br /> But in the third episode, he says that when the Europeans in South Africa went too far north, they ran into Zulu people and other tribes that * grazed cattle and planted plants *. So what explains their lack of technological, economic and artistic achievements if they had key things that the author claims are needed for success? <br /> <br /> Diamond also claims that the germs are in the form of smallpox (imported to North America by black slaves were our biggest weapon.) Well, if 150 Europeans can beat 20,000 native warriors, and 400 non-military South Africa can beat 10,000 Zulus * without one sacrifice * in both cases, I think you have to come to the conclusion that the germs are irrelevant. With or without bacteria, we were going to succeed. <br /> <br /> He says Malaria has stopped Europeans from colonization in the north, killing "thousands" of Europeans without touching Africans. (I would like to know the real numbers, but he does not speak.) Finally he says that today Malaria kills thousands of Africans and that's why they can not catch up with us So what is it, Jared? Did Malaria help Africans, stopping Eurpeans or injuring them? Where did Europe come from despite the huge plagues in our history? <br /> <br /> Seems like also, that too would be happy to say that the reason why Europeans have been successful, it was dumb luck. At a time when evidence threatens to overwhelm his shaky theories, he is reluctant to admit that perhaps Europeans have been successful because they have worked for him. It is sad to observe this obvious neo-Marxist contradictory reality to try and prove its right.
