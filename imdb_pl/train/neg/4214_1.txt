I just wasted a few hours watching this and for 80% of that time with total disbelief, I can give this garbage turkey the prize of the year, no problem. To say that the plot was unbelievable is a big understatement. Honestly, I'm lost because of the words that describe this total tripe. Characters are not only completely and completely devoid of the appearance of originality (such things were done much better in dozens of "serial killer movies"), but the acting was terrible. For those who pay to see this, I hope you will receive a refund, for those who have received payment for it, I hope you will give away your money. Believe me, there are many new releases that are much better. Go see.
