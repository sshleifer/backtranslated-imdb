I chose this DVD in the Dollar shop. The DVD was on 2 on the rack for $ 1, but since it had Michael Madsen in it, I thought that if I had never seen the movie, I bought it after all. how was the film. The movie played more like a document or advertisement of religion than anything else. I found that using the flashback of the director did not add to the plot. I'd rather see the story in chronological order. <br /> <br /> I will not cast it out like one of the other commentators, but it may take some time before I consider revising this video. <br /> <br /> Who knows, since it was Michael Madsen's film debut, maybe he may have some archive value in the future.
