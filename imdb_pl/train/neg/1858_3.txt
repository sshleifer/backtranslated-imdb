The serial killer dies in the snowstorm and is mutated into the evil twin Frosty the Snowman. Then the killing rage continues. An interesting plot. It sounds terrible. And it is terrifying. If you are five years old. Otherwise it is cheesy. I saw it on the cable and I'm glad I did not see the money. It has all the charm and style of a low-budget film that can become a cult movie. I'm sure he has a loyal fan base somewhere. I just do not have it. Although I did not like the film as a whole, some of the scenes were fun for me. Such as the scene in the bathtub and the scene after the explosion with Picasso's reference. It was also nice to observe many ways in which heroes try to kill Jack, and he simply does not want to die. In short, "Jack Frost" is a good low-budget B-movie comedy, but a bad horror movie in a low-budget B movie.
