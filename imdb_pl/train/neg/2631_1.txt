Bum gives Secret Serviceman a tip about the Secret Service man in the presidential detail who plans to kill the president. Baloney. How did he know that ass? Then the script goes to the most detailed analysis of the Secret Service, but who cares. Most of it just slows down the movie. All subsequent chases are a version of tiring car chases in many films. Then, after many impossible athletes, in which our hero overtakes all his buddies, and shoot them, we have a shooting at Toronto City Hall. Canadians are clearly marked with maple leaves, but how did this happen? In the end, everything has been developed. But it still does not make sense.
