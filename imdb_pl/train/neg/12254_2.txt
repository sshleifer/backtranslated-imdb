Some may mock, but in reality there is a real art of making particularly bad movies. It does not hit all the fronts. <br /> <br /> A few young people - women with waving breasts and a still wet t-shirt, naturally - go to the film "surfing blood" and end up with 31 foot crocodile. <br /> <br /> Croc of course was not only false, but some props [notice that the boat hits the reef in particular] look like they came out of thunderbirds! <br /> <br /> Not good, from beginning to end. I can not see it!
