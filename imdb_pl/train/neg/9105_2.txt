What can I say about cruel intentions 2? Well, I can honestly say that I will watch this movie only when I'm attached to a chair and open my eyes in orange style. <br /> <br /> Movie stars Robin Dunne (No, I have never heard of him, whose terrible Ryan Phillipe impression made me angry.) In the event of a terrible cast, Dunne tries (and fails) to play a handsome Because the actor is not handsome, neither charismatic nor charming, the character is completely unbelievable.Amy Adams, (she was once in one of the episodes of buffy), tries to find out where Sarah Michelle Gellar left and enlivened Katherine to life .. However, Adams is not such a good actress, her performance was flat and she lacked real emotions, she often looked as if she were reading memory cards right on the camera, but there were two good actors in the movie, Barry Flatman (Saw 2 and Saw 3) and Mimi Rogers (Mrs. Kensington at Austion Powers), who made very good and entertaining performances as parents of Sebastian and Katherine and are the only reason why I judged the film I ko 2, not 1. <br /> <br /> The film itself is a poor version of the original, with such rebates as duplicate dialogues and imitating scenes devoid of the originality of the previous movie. <br /> <br /> I think that as a television program it could work, but if it was processed with people who could actually work in the main parts.
