I can not believe that people praising this movie do not think about another movie. I was prepared for the possibility that it would be horrible, but the script (or lack thereof) makes the film useless. On the plus side, the overall level of craftsmanship among the actors and the technical team is quite competent, but when you have an ear sow to work, you can not make a silk handbag. Ben G fans should stick to almost every other movie in which he was. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Fans of Peter B should stick to the Last Picture Show and Target. Fans of cheap laughter at the expense of those who seem to ask for it should stick to the incredibly terrible book of Peter B, Killing of the Unicorn.
