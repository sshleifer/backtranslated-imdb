You wonder how some flicks came into being ... he decided to skip why, among many other things, and just go beyond the matter. <br /> <br /> And yet you have many decent actors who do everything to get some history into this story. The blue tint in the whole film changes to "once more", which in itself would be depressing, but here is an exaggeration. The idea that this is not a medical condition, not a housewife, gypsy or trinket, but something that for no apparent reason begins to happen to our hero, and then everything else around her, just ends when someone takes a big gulp of an empty cup . Some doppelgangers have great powers, but others do not or do not know they're doing it? Looks like they're just as unaware as we are. <br /> <br /> It's the scarring by the poor "Body Invasions" from the "Mirror" and "Sixth Sense" of Keifer Sutherland, you were seriously bothered by these three people.
