I must say that this is probably the worst movie I've seen this year! The jokes were very primitive (I did not expect this from the PG movie) (rated PG in Canada) and they were not funny! With this great cast I expected at least a good game, but I did not even understand it. I am a big fan of Rainna Wilson and for the first time I was very disappointed with his performance. Neither the figures of Luke Wilosna nor Uma Thurman are the least pleasant, and I really did not care what happened to any of them. I did not expect it at all because in the past I really liked the other director's films (for example, six days, seven nights). This movie was NOT worth $ 10, which cost me, and I strongly urge you not to watch this movie. I guarantee that you will be like me begging for the end of this movie.
