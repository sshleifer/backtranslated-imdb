Revolt of the Zombies has no redemption function. I am tired of people who say that it is not so bad and that the effects had to be more striking in 1936. I suspect that this is not true: it is not that IQ has risen sharply in the last seven decades. The average viewer in 1936 was probably as bored with this garbage as the average viewer today. Why? Just try to look at the first scenes and count the pause between events, a terrible choice, when you cut to zoom, slapdash editing, which seems to contain an additional two seconds on each shot to eliminate the action time. Pay attention to the completely unnecessary dialogue: "I'm going to make a cup / go outside / read my book now." "You are?" "Yes I am." Such exchange takes place several times. Usually I would be very happy that I am a big fan of bad movies, but I watch the apathetic actors mumbling their banal and boring lines, and all the desires of laughter from the movie are slowly disappearing. This kind of selfless, time-boiling is much worse than energetic, ingenious mindblowers, such as the Plan of Nine from Space or Santa Claus Conquering Martians. Those who say it is "better" than the more interesting videos have an idea for entertainment. This film is not bad in the sense that your jaw opens in astonishment: it's bad in the sense that your eyes are slowly approaching boredom. Which is much worse.
