*** THIS CONTAINS MANY, MANY SPOILERS, AND NOT THAT THIS IS SIGNIFICANTLY, FROM ALL, WHAT IS ALSO OCZYWISE *** <br /> <br /> Oh my God, where to start? Well, here - I came back from the movie for the first time and said "I need to get to IMDb and write a review of this NOW. This is my civic duty. " This is the disadvantage of this movement. <br /> <br /> * start digressing * But let me just say one thing before I start. I'm not Harvard-art-major-film-noir-weenie (in fact, I went to college at the other end of the Mass at Cambridge, where real wise people without rich daddies and trust funds are going, which should put me in the census group writing down videos about the nerds who would like to obsessively love, and yet I hated the movie ...). My viewing preferences apply to the high-end film work that includes Die Hards, Flick, Clerks and The Graal. I would like the Titanic to never sink, not so much because of the lost concerts, which is because we would not give up this slurry film. And the only and only reason why I look at a snobbish French art film is the fact that there is young and often exposed Emmanuelle Beart in it. I even gave Maximum Overdrive one of its precious few 10s here on IMDb, for God's sake. So I'm as shallow as they appear, so I'm not criticizing this movie because I'm looking for some cinematic perfection standard - it's because Elektra stinks like a three-week-old dead goat. * end dygresji * <br /> <br /> OK, there is so much evil here that I have to try to categorize it. Here goes: <br /> <br /> MS. GARNER: One of the important reasons why a man would like to see this movie was seeing many hot JGar (I have no idea why my wife wanted it). I think that between this and "Finding Nemo" the latter was a more sexy movie. Do you know the red outfit she advertised, wearing every frightening commercial? You see her in this DOUBLE - once at the beginning, once at the end. Bummer. It looks like what Morrissey would look like if he was a woman - a lot of underwear and black clothes. This brings me to the incredible range of expression that JGar shows in his acting - from "sulking" to "sulking and crying". Oh, my God, you'd think she was forced to date Ben Affleck or something so horrible. Um, poczekaj ... <br /> <br /> BAD MAN / GAL: They show the same range of expression and acting abilities that you can expect from a slightly overripe grapefruit. At least outside of JGara's performance he does not stand out too bad. The role of one of them is to stand there and be huge, and the other is to stand there and leave it, and the role of a woman is to stand and breathe and / or kiss people. They manage to pull out these amazing exploits. The main bad guy has the most difficult role for everyone - he must EQUALIZE a) look angry, and b) for Asian. He's doing great with it. I think he was the fifth bad guy / gal, but my brain is starting to block parts of the film in self-defense. <br /> <br /> CREATIVE PLOTS! This film has as many surprises as the speech at the National Democratic Convention. Let's put it this way - my wife, who has been in the US for half a year and speaks only a small amount of English - whispered to me when the girl first appears in the pillow JG and I swear to God that I am not explaining this: "He goes home to kill a girl. And father too. "AND BEFORE THE FATHER'S PRESENTATION ON THE SCREEN. Now my wife is not stupid, but Mensa does not ask for her gifts, and she has zero exposure to Daredevil or the genre of comics. And she understood it in 0.00015 seconds without pokes and without previous information. Such is the blatant obviousness of this film. <br /> <br /> UNUSUAL BEFORE SEE DURABILITY! OK, so there's this big guy in the movie. He can take a breast from a shotgun and wipe the shot as it tugs, and he can brutally attack Electra's jabbing into the chest and just bend the metal (or melt it - or whatever - more defense, thank God). But JG jumps on his head and he explodes? The Achilles leg? WELL! Such is the paralyzing mind of the film's stupidity. <br /> <br /> Ack. I am beginning to feel a cerebral hemorrhage, so I have to stop. But you have been warned. If you must deliberately cut your own tires to avoid watching this movie, DO IT. And if Armageddon is to come, let it be before it comes out on a DVD.
