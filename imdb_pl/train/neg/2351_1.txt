I have no idea how someone managed to fall asleep during this concert. Acting was crazy and amateur, the story was old, and the development of the story (or lack of it) invariably caused that my eyelids dangled less than half of each episode. That's all you can say about it because it really lacked any substance. <br /> <br /> How can people like this nonsense? It's terrible folly, it's an insult to your intelligence. I do not even know how to explain it further ... It's as if some of you are staring at this garbage just because you like the way some actors look, or because you have not seen for some crazy reason the same formulas in dozens of shows a million times before. <br /> <br /> I just ... I forgot. This show has been drawn and, fortunately, disappeared forever. I would like them to work on demolishing O.C. once and for all.
