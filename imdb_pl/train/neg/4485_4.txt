It seems that in Science Fiction you have this periodic phrase to perform a strange phenomenon that appears in long serial novels. This is where the first novel (Dune, Ender's game) blew you up thanks to a revolutionary story with action. The following parts, however, occupy this universe and lead you through the garden path to new, small social or political comments that the author wants to do. The Matrix is ​​finally the equivalent of a movie. The Matrix is ​​high, in itself, as an interesting movie with a strange twist inside. Seeing this ready cow who is sitting there, and wanting to get to know other aspects of society, writers and directors carry you through what must be one of the most painful monologues and non-action sequences in SciFi. While the visuals remain just as great from the first films, the new explorations of the heroes become horrible in the sequel. Watch out for sweets for eyes, not for deep thought. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10, registered by this amazing website.
