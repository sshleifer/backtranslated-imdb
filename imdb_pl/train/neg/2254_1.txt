OK, people, honestly ... it must be one of the worst films about show business that has ever been made, but I laugh silly (which may be the reason I liked it). Basically, it's about sex, sex and a way to get personal 15 minutes of fame. Did I mention that sex was the main problem in this movie? If you have something for bizzzzare character and easy entertainment, watch this movie when you have a chance (and you have nothing better to do). <br /> <br /> *** Note, spoilers !!! *** The funniest thing in the movie was the guy who asked Jerry if he could marry his goat (!) In the show and flash his love wallet cinema. Triple A for bad taste and fun!
