SPLIT SECOND could have been a good movie. The story of the murder on the road of rage has a very young Clive Owen, who gives quite a good performance; ALE ... but .... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the filmmakers cut their own film with idiotic camera work and really horrible editing. The camera jumps over the whole creature in an unsuccessful attempt (I suppose) to reflect Owen's stress on the part of business, family and traffic. In fact, it gives the viewer a headache. <br /> <br /> Because filmmakers did not care about making a good movie, but only to impress with idiotic photography, do not waste time on this parody.
