It really should deserve an "O" and even a negative ten rating. I've watched this program for ages, and the show has jumped over the shark around series 7. This episode, however, is proof that the show has jumped the shark. This writing is lazy, absurd, indulgent and not even worthy of nits like Beavis and Butthead. <br /> <br /> It's quite possible to be funny and still be fun - Pirates of the Caribbean, Mumia, Count of Monte Cristo - all "fun" movies that should not be taken seriously. However, there is something as ridiculous as "this is the worst thing I have ever seen." And indeed, this is the worst episode of the Stargate I have ever seen. It's absolutely horrible, and it comes from someone with star gates in her basement. <br /> <br /> It makes me want to sell all my star props, most seriously.
