Move to the pursuit, this is one of the five worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Not that they did not try. There was some decent writing with elements of structure, good cast, good acting. I'm not sure where it went wrong, but it went terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> Some elements may have a bad structure and lack of substantive history, a lot of excess by the leader (which is probably much better when he is restrained), some bad directing and editing. I had enough after about an hour, tearing my hair out for about an hour and a half, and very nervous about an hour and fifty minutes. It was a disaster, because I went with someone who was addicted to heroin. He was moved that he charmed something that had nothing good. This was strengthened by a beautiful 17-year-old girl who was in love with a 30-year-old junkie. <br /> <br /> And the crazy nature of lead was enough. There were clumsy plot points that were an attempt at construction, but the end result was apathetic and endless (with uneven timelines). The characters were colorful, but without end, which made me feel bad about the high-quality actors you simply did not see. <br /> <br /> Skip it. I assumed that he was the director for the first time, who was in love with his own departments, but he did it before. I am surprised how this and many other really bad ideas find someone who will actually give them money.
