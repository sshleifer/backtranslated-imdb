I will not mention any of the threads, because it would be very predictable anyway, one significant turn of action is distributed everywhere, in the comments to the movie, in the summary of the story here, and even in the summary on my Netflix envelope. I would like it all the more if I did not know it. Maybe. This movie has a deceptively good cast, most of whom have credible acting with fairly limited material, including Donald Sutherland, Lesley Ann Warren and Tia Carrere and Rosemary Dunsmore in smaller parts. You could not like William McNamara, but it was obvious. There were also some nude scenes recorded by callipygian Lenore Zann. But none of this gives me the slightest recommendation from me. Are not any of these great actors reading these scripts before signing up?
