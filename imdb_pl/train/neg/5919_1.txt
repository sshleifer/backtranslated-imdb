I rented this movie yesterday and I can not express disappointment with little Laura Ingalls for being involved in something so badly produced. I'm not sure if it was a horrible writing, poor directing, or both, but it leaves the viewer very disappointed that he lost time to watch this confusion. It consisted of a weak naive plot line, very weak lines, and it relied solely on the pretty scenery and beautiful people who sold it. Unfortunately, that was not enough. It would be better to rent a tape full of noise than to waste time on this shit. Lindsey Wagner also played a rather pathetic role as a ranch owner who apparently works very hard without doing anything, anyone who has ever been near a ranch knows that a young Los Angeles man obviously wrote, not someone with a lot of knowledge about the world .
