Any movie that has a naked Karen Allen scene, and I'm still bored, I'm leaving, it's stinky! <br /> <br /> Karen got stuck in Paris and befriends a handsome French man who soon gets sex with him. Of course he is married ("But, cheri, why would it be a problem?") What could be an interesting clash of cultures is (believe or not) just boring. I went out. <br /> <br /> Maybe the movie went much better after my departure; but it would have to be much better to make up for the rotten beginnings. <br /> <br /> My advice, if you find yourself in this, run away, do not go out. Save time and energy. You certainly save money. It is a pity that the production company did not save money.
