I'm sorry to say that in my opinion Enzo really can not keep up with the Saleen S7 Twin Turbo. The strength of S7's advantage would simply be too big. The S7 has a power ratio: weight 3.93 lbs / hp, while Enzo has 4.61 lbs / hp. The lower end of the S7 is also much better. I'm sorry for Ferrari fans, but Saleen does it a lot better. <br /> <br /> As for the other parts of this movie, I just have to say that it's so subtle that it's pathetic. The story is too weak. Acting in this lemon is worse than soap during the day. <br /> <br /> I can say that when it comes to the treatise on negative psychology, it is a real gem. This film is nothing but a glaring definition of what narcissism and sociopathy are. It's about those rich punks who throw away rocks, showing only traces of feigned remorse for all innocent road users, they also cause injury or death. <br /> <br /> I can not give the film a "1 star" rating because it did not force me to leave the theater. I also think that having an incredibly beautiful brunette with lethal blue eyes, as a leading woman, will save her from being completely bottomless ... although there is no way that her singing will be on the cover of "Variety". <br /> <br /> ps: the guy who plays Jason is SOOOOO in the version with the James Vanderbek order.
