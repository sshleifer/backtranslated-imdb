I have never understood the attractiveness of this program. Acting is weak (Debra Jo Rupp is a notable exception), the threads of most episodes are trivial and uninspiring, the dialogue is weak, the jokes uncomplicated and it is painful to try for a half-episode. What's more, the association of this series with "70s" is extremely weak outside the dressing style and scenery and background used in the program - it seems to be nothing more than a modern sitcom with the same old, unscrupulous, stereotypical scripts that modern TV series have changed for a performance from twenty years ago in the hope that it will gain some nostalgic viewers or something like that. Both "Happy Days" and "The Wonder Years" use the same technique much more effectively and are actually a pleasure to watch in contrast to this awful, pathetic excuse for the show
