Forbidden Siren is based on Siren 2 Playstation 2 (so many 2s). Like most videos from video games, I would say that most do not really translate into other mediums. And this also applies painfully. <br /> <br /> There is a fairly long prologue that explains and sets the premise for this story and the mysterious island where the writer (Leo Morimoto) and his children, daughter Yuki (Yui Ichikawa) and son Hideo (Jun Nishiyama) come to enter. The villagers do not look too friendly, and soon enough a sound advice about the mermaid on the island to stay home when the mermaid starts to fail. <br /> <br /> Naturally and slowly, things start to go in, and our siblings will set out on a mission to beat the bush to discover exactly what is happening on this unfriendly island with its weird inhabitants. But to tell you the truth, you will not be worried about what's happening because folklore and fairy tales are thrown in to make the story even more so. What really pushed him into the realm of bad comedy was the unknowingly bad moments in which he normally did not stick to the norm, and which caused pitiful giggles because of his stupidity until he was explained much later. One thing is to try to invent and present something intelligent, but another thing that does it convincingly and with gaps covered. <br /> <br /> Although it reaches less than 90 minutes - I think it's a horror phenomenon that has it as a benchmark runtime - it gives you almost two hours of feeling thanks to slow building to say what you want. Things start growing in the last 20 minutes, but this is a classic case too little too late. <br /> <br /> What saves the film is how it changes tack and its revelation at the end. Again, this is a common device that tries to pick up a seemingly simple horror to something a little extra in the hope of delighting the audience. It turned out to be rather satisfactory, but it leaves a bad aftertaste, because you feel a bit cheated. Twist will make you feel in two ways - either raise the movie to an unforgettable level or give you a hokey feeling. Unfortunately, Forbidden Siren belonged more to the latter. <br /> <br /> Saver grace will be his photos using light, shadows and mirrors, but I will be so clear - it is still not worth the time, so better to avoid it.
