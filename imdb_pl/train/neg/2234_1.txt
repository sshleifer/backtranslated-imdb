I bought this DVD for GBP 1 and now I understand why. Acting was the worst thing in a long time. Lighting and sound are, at best, cheesy. The plot does not make sense, even when it is sober (PLEASE NOTE: I do not advise watching this movie when it is sober.) This movie has the impression that you are watching a home movie of someone who does not go far. It is a pity that all the very little money spent on this project has been in vain, I can not wait to see if any of these people still have a career, except eva longoria, which is the only "star" of this film apparently has not been hit by a malfunctioning stick. I am sorry that none of these critics seem constructive, but I will say one thing to James Cahill, do not try again. In the words squirlyem "Its seriously lacking in a good section."
