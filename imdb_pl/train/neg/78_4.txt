Annoying mouse and lullaby really came to me and really had nothing to do with this story ... It's something that I would do in the first year at the film school. So sad. What's more, history seemed to go on for no apparent reason ... there were too many things thrown in there that had nothing to do with history, which makes me feel that the creative team did not really know what they were doing or simply that it should be shorter ... which would be a blessing, not a crime. Because I just watched all episodes up to this point in the past week ... I have to say that it was definitely the worst and I just wanted to warn others not to start it.
