This movie was a stupid piece of shit. Bad everything. Why are we who love Western movies, rented nine times ten times when renting westerns. It seems that if you do not see names like Robert Duval, Kevin Kostner or Tom Selleck attached to the cover, it is not worth talking about. The main action of Shiloh Waterfalls was in 1892, However, used revolvers were models from the 1860s. Even the shooting was bad - in one of the scenes, the marshal kindled his six-time shooter about nine times and he could not hit any of the three big people who were just twenty feet away. I had to turn it off after about 15 minutes of this disaster. Perhaps those who participated in this film could take several lessons at the Sunset Carson School of Acting.
