I have read a half-dozen other user comments on this board and it seems that the opinions are very different. I have to agree with those who found the movie horrible. It hurts me to write, because I would hope it would be great, otherwise I would not like to see it. I like to support indie cinema, especially if they are gay themes, but this movie is too big to tolerate. Those who left, as I thought, after about three minutes, probably did not mind throwing $ 11.00, or simply stated that it is not going anywhere, quickly and will not improve. Maybe I'm a bit more optimistic than they ... neither they nor they paid for entry at all. <br /> <br /> Logan is bored. He is a klutz. He is gay. Alright with this. The problem is that the main character of the movie is bored, which does not necessarily mean that the film about him must be boring too! There are ENDLESS scenes of this kid who just puts like a load of laundry, restores everything you've already learned in the first scene, and the second scene etc. etc. Nothing or nobody goes anywhere. Nobody says anything even insightful, funny or interesting. Probably the most frightening thing is that I did not feel the slightest empathy for Logan. This in itself is a great achievement. He did not grow up, he did not change, he did not learn (there is nobody who could teach him something), he DID NOT DO SOMETHING and the film did not do it! Scene after the scene does not do the same thing. <br /> <br /> In addition, the title does not make sense. 1/10.
