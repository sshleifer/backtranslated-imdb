I read EVEN COWGIRLS by Tom Robbins, who as a teenager wins BLUES. I loved every word. It was sexy, fun and full of great scenery and beautiful writing. But when I saw this movie, I could not believe it was a dull, sour, helpless piece of rubbish. How did this happen? I think someone in Hollywood read this book and put it under the slogan "GAY PRIDE - WOMEN - LESBIANS". (This is the theme of the Library of Congress theme.) Now anyone who is 12 and reading a book knows that there is nothing to do with real lesbians, just as STAR WARS does not apply to real space travel. The book was of course - and I mean COURSE - written by a heterosexual man who loves IDEA lesbians (naked, all the time), but never really met. <br /> <br /> someone in Hollywood said, "Oh, better give this gay director or Gay People trouble." So they handed it to Gus Van Sant. There is nothing against this man, but - however Gay can be real - he has no idea how to make a funny movie. Gus Van Sant took the funny fantasy of a man about the blame-free action of a girl / girl, and male voyeurism turned her into a boring, literal recruitment poster for lesbians. It's like turning Oscar Wilde's comedy into Arthur Miller's tragedy. Not pretty. <br /> <br /> The main clue that Gus Van Sant had absolutely no idea what to do with the source material is a shamefully bad casting. His influence allowed him to hire the best. His ignorance of the real subtext of the novel (the fantasy of a simple man, not the recruitment poster of gay pride) meant that he made choices that were not only bad, but also strange. <br /> <br /> Meet the cast of EVEN COWGIRLS GET BLUES. <br /> <br /> PAT MORITA as "THE CHINK" Okay, there are not many Asian actors who recognize names. And Pat Morita, in HAPPY DAYS, was quite funny. But throwing him like CHINK was bad, bad, bad. Pat Morita has no idea that Chink is a very funny man. (Gus did not tell him.) Pat also does not seem to know that Chink is. . . Well, SEXY !!! The book is not a wise old master of Miyagi. More like Hugh Hefner! He is an old-fashioned goat and he knows a lot about the nice and sensitive Sissy AND Bonanza Jellybean. (See, they are not REALLY lesbians in the book. Do you understand that this is the fantasy of a simple man?) <br /> <br /> JOHN HURT as "COUNTESS". Okay, he's friendly gay. But he is SERIOUS, EVEN MORE! For this role, you need someone who is funny and camp. For John Hurt, cast as a foolish guy like Countess is tragic and sad. I was expecting Paul Scofield to wander in the guise of Thomas More and shake his head sadly. "You know, Richard, you know you've completely lost your soul. For shame, my old student! And yes, John Hurt was funny (and cute gay) as Caligula. But it was BLACK humor, not humorous and perverse humor like a book. <br /> <br /> RAIN PHOENIX as "Jellybean Bonanza". No talent, no training, no problem. Only that Bonanza is fun, cheerful, cheerful, (mainly) heterosexual and loving. The film is grim, passive, expressionless and boring. As for her taste for women, Robbins in the book puts it that way. "God knows that I love women, but nothing can replace a man who fits." Uh, Gus? Have you read this book? <br /> <br /> UMA THURMAN as "Sissy Hankshaw". This is a difficult role. In the book, Sissy really is an extremely passive and shy heroine. Still, a more talented actress could spark a glint in her eyes or sway in her walking, suggesting some hidden strength or hidden joy of adventures. Uma does not pull her away, probably because Gus never told her that Sissy should be happy, being a tourist with a train with a beautiful body and gigantic thumbs. Uma plays it more like a television movie about a girl dying of leukemia. <br /> <br /> This movie is sour and boring. And I accuse you, Gus Van Sant!
