Shazbot, is it embarrassing. Here is the list 100, which is embarrassing: 1.) Christopher Lloyd's unsuccessful return. 2.) Jeff Daniels plays essentially the same role in which he played in the remake of 101 Dalmatians live, which was not too juicy. It certainly has a fun way to promote your Purple Rose Theater ... 3.) Disnefluff. 4.) Another disappointing reminder that Wallace Shawn is for Disney what Jet Li was for Bob Hoskins in Unleashed. 5.) Ray Walston, the original martian from the television series, played a bit (read the "cameo") in this movie and died two years later with lupus. Coincidence? 6.) horrible special effects. Seriously - terribly. 7.-100.) This damned talking farting suit made an annoying step through Wayne Knight ("Newman!"). My favorite scene? HA! Hahaha! Ha ha ha ha ha ... Uff! ... Good. You - you are a joker.
