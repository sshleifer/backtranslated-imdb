First of all, I have to say that I loved the book Animal Farm. I read it in my ninth grade and it was great. We also thought that watching the movie would be beneficial. The film was very disappointing for me. The movie cuts out some characters and lacks many of the book's main points. It jumps a lot and does not explain in detail. If somebody watched this movie without reading the book, they would be confused. The most disappointing thing about this film for me was the ending. The ending in the book was the most powerful, and in the film changed it! It was supposed to be pigs and people in the alliance and "melting" together, but instead the movie gave the impression that the animals would rebel against the pigs. In conclusion, I do not think this film captures the true meaning that Orwell presented in his book.
