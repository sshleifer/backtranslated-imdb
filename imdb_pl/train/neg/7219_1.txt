It's still difficult for me to understand that a movie is as bad as it can be in Hollywood. Acting and history are simply pathetic, and the direction is terrible. I do not see any logic behind the trash, unless the director had nothing good to do. It took me ten minutes to realize that I had wasted my precious thirty rupees. It filled me with horror that I was going to waste a little more time on this nonsense. I bet the film was made in less than a day. I do not know what category it is in. Please, avoid this movie at all costs, just do everything, even hit your head against the walls, but do not go on this movie.
