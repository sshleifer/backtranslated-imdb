I base this on my observations from one episode that I saw last night (27/06/06). I do not think I will be watching again. Acting was completely wooden, the plot completely predictable, the end totally unrealistic - I mean, who would believe in the $ 30 million sentence for the death of a drug addict with terminal cancer? The main actor (Victor Garber) seemed so uncomfortable, almost embarrassed by his role - maybe he realized how wrong it was! I fully realize that the drama offered this season is quite weak, but it can certainly find better writers. Maybe they write writing to India or China !! I bet we will not see it next season!
