Above all, Zorie Barber (Zeke) may be one of the worst actors I've ever seen. As a character who is supposed to be a fashionable, rural writer in martial arts and proud of being mysterious, why is such a hyper, overly dramatic and simply horrible? Did he know anything about his character before they began filming? Is the director? Do martial arts not teach discipline? In addition, this movie does not hit the target with its lame jokes and cruel humor. Hand in the toilet? <i> Trainspotting </ i>. Masturbation? Hmm. <i> Fast times in Ridgemont High </ i>, <i> American Pie </ i>, the list goes on .... In dialogue: In one sequence, Eric says: "this is not my case <i> but </ i> . ... and 30 seconds later Mia says "why is this your thing?" Bad assembly: at least five minutes of the movie is wasted on shots from NYC. <hr> You can not believe that the four main male characters will be a close group of friends in any world. I can not comment on what makes everyone laugh, but if you like low spirits, basic humor in the bathroom and insults, most of all, enjoy. If you want something a bit wiser, but on the same lines, see <i> Boomerang </ i>. If you want a solid romantic comedy, go to <i> The Tao Of Steve </ i>. But anyone who thinks <i> Whipped </ i> is a witty and accurate dating portrait, I can not agree at all.
