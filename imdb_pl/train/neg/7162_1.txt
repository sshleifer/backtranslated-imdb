This film makes a good idea, a mummified 2000-year-old witch and completely destroys it. Nora and Jim are alcoholics who go to Ireland to dry up. They stay with their Nan and uncle. Uncle discovered a 2000-year-old witch preserved in peat. He revives her and takes the form of Nora. It can not be killed conventionally (there is more pity). Nora, however, develops a way to do this. <br /> <br /> This is a gothic horror movie that has been made cheaply. It's a huge mess. I have to ask why someone would like to make such a bad movie. I feel tempted to learn spells to make them disappear. <br /> <br /> AVOID ALL COSTS
