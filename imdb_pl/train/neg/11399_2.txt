I can not believe I've wasted 80 minutes of my life watching this awful movie. I was hoping that at the end it would be better, but the boy was wrong. The plot was terrible, the acting was very weak and the special effects were terrible. Even two beautiful girls could not revive my interest in this boring and bloody mess. However, I can not lie, some of the poems in this movie were quite unforgettable, just like when the Asian boy says "I lost my virginity to the babysitter, so **** stereotypes" do not waste time on this accident unless you're prepared or want to good laugh .. maybe in this way you can watch it to rip this movie with some friends
