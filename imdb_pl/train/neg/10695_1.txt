... Ok, I read about this film somewhere on the internet, and many criticized how bad the movie is and suck. And I could not agree more. Then, after watching this movie on DVD, I was wondering twice about this movie, and then I appeared in the commercial of this movie on television. Fortunately, I saved money for this nonsense. I sacrificed my dreams for this film and soon it turned out that this movie can not satisfy me. So I can not judge how the movie was made, but in any case ... it still sucks. As for those who liked this movie, I would apologize for burning this movie and telling you how the movie sucks. I do not know what you think about this film?
