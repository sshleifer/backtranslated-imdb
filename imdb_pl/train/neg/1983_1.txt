Oh, give me a break, give this movie a break. The only thing I liked was ......... I'm sorry, I still think. Oh yes!!!! When John Wayne came and shot the bad guys. Oh, sorry, bad movie, I was thinking about a better quality movie. I will see now, I am still trying to defend him. Oh yes, the chick with Clueless was in it. Do not put off Stacy Dash. I mean, we all make mistakes. But boy, Stacy, you did a dooooosie. <br /> <br /> Hey, one thing that has never been done in the western, even female cast, actually hanged a woman from the gallows. This may be the first west. Even though her neck should be broken and she has a hard test, you still have to give the director some effort to try the western first. Besides, I never saw a woman lynched from a horse in any western country, although this did not happen in this movie, I thought I would give the director another idea for Gang Of Roses # 2, which should be done right after Ed Wood's Bride Of The Monster # 2 Maybe this is what the creators of this film were all about. Originality, especially in the case of the entire cast of an African woman and an oriental cowboy. <br /> <br /> Heeey, if the creators of Gang Of Roses want to make a sequel to this mess, you can have a slang like "Hey, do not take care of my girls" and "talk to your hand, baby, talk in your hand" . You could also have a deputy surfer dude, who says things like "This shooter was COMPLETELY TOTAL, completely." You know such things.
