I will not devote much attention or energy to this commentary. I just want to add, because all the comments were so positive that I felt like I had to let people know that not everyone is so enthralled, let alone intellectually provoked by this attempt to create a fascinating philosophical puzzle. Some of the scenes seemed promising, playing with visual dimensions, but they could not stop the rest. I felt like I was stoned again, conducting semi-philosophical talks with other teenagers. <br /> <br /> What a vain attempt to raise the Dutch cinema to new heights. I would rather see Jesus as Palestine, without any grudges and with simple humor, also raising questions about the life and reality that we create for ourselves. <br /> <br /> Gert de Graff is not Jean-Luc Godard or Tarkowski and apparently he will never be.
