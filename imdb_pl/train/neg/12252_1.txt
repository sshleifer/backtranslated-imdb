** SPOILERY ** <br /> <br /> This is one BAD movie. Seriously. Acting absolutely horribly, the FX is terrible, and the plot is terrible. But hey, it's so bad that it's cool to watch! The script is so bad it's nice! You just have to laugh at lines like "I'm guessing that's what you call CROCTEASING." how women flash their breasts into a crocodile. I mean, COME ON is funny because it's so bad! He has such awful jokes that they are fun! But after some time the film becomes the same as the movie turns into shit. I really started to fall asleep. Trust me, the plastic Croc foot on the leaves and the continuous rustling of the hunchback tail make you laugh for a long time. Although I must say she had one nice part when Croc ripped the guy in half and just hung for a moment, wondering what to do. Heh heh a thoughtless movie that MUST be nominated for the MST3K line !!
