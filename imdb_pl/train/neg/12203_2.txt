I think it's time for John Rambo to continue his life and try to put Vietnam behind him. This series is aging, and Rambo is no longer a soldier but a cold-blooded killer. Whenever it appears on the screen, someone dies. Vietnam was not a nice place and to be honest I'm tired of Hollywood doing it. This is not the worst of Vietnam films, this honor falls to John Waynes Green Berets. In any case, John Rambo, carrying a 50-karat machine gun taking part in the half-army of Viet Cong and many Russians is an insult. What's worse, at the end is Rambos' tacky speech ... Please !! Oh yeah, I hear they're doing another ...
