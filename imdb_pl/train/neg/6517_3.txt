I went to the screening of this film and although I had a few moments that made me laugh, it had some serious disadvantages. This is primarily the humorous feats of a real divorcee who is trying to find love in LA. What he is transforming is depressing, narcissistic and unhappy in the filmmaker's life and professional life. Jokes are quickly consumed and suddenly you do not care how the dates of this man are. The ridiculous thing is that the director at the same time presents himself as an extremely annoying and very flawed character, and then expects us to worry about it.
