This remake of the original 1962 film. The book has some very good fragments that are worth praising and some great performances by great actors - but Scorsese chooses the end in terms of the most formal twists and shamefully terrified Shakespearean demise that had me looking at my watch. <br /> <br /> DeNiro is a great actor, devoted to everything he does in his work, but he needs a direction to focus his talent, and this is a very short film in the last five minutes. <br /> <br /> Kamea Gregory Peck is useful, but nothing more, while Robert Michum is always cool to watch, even with as few lines as this. <br /> <br /> Nick Nolte is better than Lorenzo's Oil, but does not have the same form as "Weeds". Joe Don Baker has some great lines, and Juliette Lewis once again proves that talent sometimes skips a generation. <br /> <br /> Some good points? First points (!), Cody's first view of his back when diving in prison, the scene where Cody is attacked with baseball bats, decent Sam Bowden in full-fledged panic, externally calm but irritating pressure. <br /> <br /> The worst? "Cleaning woman - BUT REALLY !!!" part. Car attachment for a hundred miles at high speed. (Is there any unevenness in the US?) "He is dead - BUT REALLY !!!" partS and the aforementioned ending of the journey. <br /> <br /> I can see the original again, but I do not want to watch the remake within four years of watching it.
