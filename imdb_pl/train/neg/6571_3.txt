Although I completely disagree with one reviewer who described Charley Chase as inconspicuous, in this movie it certainly is. It is a pity, because I suspect that the second reviewer only saw a few of Charley's duds and assumed that the guy is not funny. Films like MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE and WHAT GOOF'S PRICE? it's very good Chase movies, so he could be really funny considering the good stuff. Unfortunately, he did not give anything in this movie. Even the inclusion of ordinary good Oliver Hardy as a film does not constitute any help, because the basic assumption (the boy wants to marry a girl, but the girl's father thinks the boy is a nerd), and the gags are so poor. It's a pity, because I really wanted to love this movie, but I could not. <br /> <br /> By the way, for those who have got used to looking for Charley since the mid-twenties, you'll be quite surprised how Chase does not have glasses or mustaches - and looks very little as you'd expect.
