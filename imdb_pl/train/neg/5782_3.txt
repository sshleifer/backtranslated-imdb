A lesbian vampire movie about a couple on vacation, which is based on what they think is an empty mansion, but is really used as a pair of lesbian vampires. When vampires bring a sporadic victim, the couple goes to work until both groups split together. <br /> <br /> A great-looking movie with two very sexy women as vampires, there is nothing but candy to ensure the recommendation of this iconic movie. Yes, this is a sexy story about vampires. No, it's not interesting, except women. Honestly, there's a reason why I watch the photos from this movie in horror and magazines, it looks great, but otherwise ... <br /> <br /> For those who want to see only sexy vampires.
