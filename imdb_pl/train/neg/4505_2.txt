Memoirs of a geisha is a beautifully filmed movie, there is no doubt about it. And the game is generally excellent, at least when it comes to the way it presents characters in the form of scripts. <br /> <br /> However, so many small and large details are simply wrong, that it just bothers me too much to fully enjoy it. A small detail, which is characterized by a kind of insensitivity, is one scene (nothing breaks), in which Mameha rings a bell that hangs in the door of the house where Sayuri lives, on a snowy winter day. The bell that rings is a wind or wind bell - which in the summer remains only outside the homes in Japan! People in traditional Japanese homes did not have door bells - they just opened the door and announced. (You might think it is such a trivial detail, but I would identify it with a film about America, in which hanging a hanging Christmas wreath hangs in July and nobody thinks about it.) And do not even start me about completely wrong hairstyles given to maiko and geisha who are niejasno panazjatyckie / Chinese / kung-fu-ish and nothing similar. I think that this rather bachelor attitude towards culture, which they try to present, appears in the attitudes and portraits of people and situations. <br /> <br /> I suppose that the less you know about the Japanese culture and the world of geishas and maiko in Kyoto (which is what "Miyako" is), but I suppose that it will be all the more appealing. I really think that this movie could have been much better ... in fact it is another Hollywood version of "exotic Japan".
