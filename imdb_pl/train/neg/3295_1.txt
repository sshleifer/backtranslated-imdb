... it's better not to watch this movie. They completely ruined the premise of the series. In the movie, Duke boys are idiots, Daisy is tramp, Roscoe is sinister, Boss Hogg is capable, Uncle Jessie is a criminal ... only Cooter and Flash are true to the original characters. At least Enos is close. <br /> <br /> At one point they open the door to get to General Lee, "said Nuff. <br /> <br /> The original program may not have been a great TV, but it was fun and the characters made sense. This movie is like "Stupid and Dumber" meets simple life.
