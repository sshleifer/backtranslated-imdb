Being a fan of Billy Bob Thornton and the diversity of his skills, I noticed this movie on the list and was surprised that I did not hear about him. <br /> <br /> I traveled more than usual during both period was shot in 2000, and when I went to cinemas over 2 1/2 years later (this passage of time is the first indication that everything was bad with production). <br /> <br /> Now Patrick Swayze can not act on sour apples, but Thornton has more than enough ability to make up the difference between them. And Charlize Theron is someone who would be nice to see, even if it would show that he was painting dry. <br /> <br /> Being interesting, I checked the production information on this page. During the opening weekend, he spent as much as $ 600 on the screen and just over $ 400 after his month in the theater began in 2002. In total, it amounted to 261 thousand. Dollars, which I doubt, would cover the hotel staff and crew and food for a week's location. <br /> <br /> The story is quite mild, and even the use of the usually interesting Reno housing is as boring as the rest of the events. <br /> <br /> It's something like several SNL bits put together, none individually is too big, and the overall presentation is even worse. <br /> <br /> Regardless, the expenses for this production had to be significant - even if all of them worked for less than usual fees - so the only thing that made the barely good work was the quality of filming and the gift of Billy ' Bob's ego (albeit a bit laconic here, compared to normal work. <br /> <br /> Think of three great, totally different characters that played in "Sling Blade", "Bandits" and "Bad Santa", and you know that he realized it was below the standard, long before the viewers had the opportunity to confirm it. One star for him, even here, and one because production was better than, say, typical "life".
