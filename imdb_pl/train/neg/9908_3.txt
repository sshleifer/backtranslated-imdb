I gave these 3 stars out of 10 - because the stories are open and unexplained, and also because of the bland scenes in which someone in an extremely disgusting way, and the scene of the decaying corpse. <br /> <br /> None of the above had to be shown graphically. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film, as it is, concerns three loosely related stories, none of which ends satisfactorily. <br /> <br /> Bounty Hunter, played by Bruce Dern, is a character that combines all three vignettes. <br /> <br /> We first have Dylan McDermott, who looks damned good, as a wanted criminal who escapes to Mexico to escape both the law and the bounty hunter as he crosses the border city and sees a girl with a sad face, played by Helen Hunt. <br /> <br /> So we have one of Hemingway's girls, I'm not sure which of them, playing a western wife on a lonely border, who goes to see a neighboring woman, an attractive redhead who soon realizes that she was too long in the highlands. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie returns to the bounty hunter and what happens to him, and the last scene in the movie goes beyond rational understanding.
