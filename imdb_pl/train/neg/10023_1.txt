Shame in the films of Yash Raj and Aditya Chopra, who for years lost their intelligence and secured a fixed fee for traps in this piece of film, which is not even worth the standards of You Tube. I gritted my teeth throughout the movement, ending with a schizophrenic direction, storyline that never materialized, and on the last scene I was just ashamed that my country and its filmmakers might be "stupid" in "THROW AWAY". Shame on the actors for doing this work, and even commenting on it as a piece of work that they can have. Saif Ali Khan - completely disappointed with the choice of the movie. Kareen shows enough skin for puberty, and Akshay appears as dim-wit. Anil another delayed with hairy English fascination. His friends were praiseworthy in their acting and thanks to the bizarre photos scattered in the last 15 minutes, it was enough to fire a blood vessel. DO NOT DISTURB any brain cells, energy or money to see it - See SEE / Rent AMU - instead of Konkana Sensharma - a beautiful piece of independent film that ever came out of India. An intelligent, poignant and wonderful story that touches all intelligent actors and gave me hope that everything will not be lost in the Indian cinema.
