Well, reading the title, you would think it would be a good movie. Well, at least I did. It started well, but it became so boring after the first half hour. * spoiler * <br /> <br /> Tells a story about a mother who is so desperate that her daughter becomes a cheerleader that she will make every effort to get what she wants. The only problem is that her daughter's friend is a girl on the road. She always wins the competition, which is why she pushes her mother further towards "eliminating" her. After talking with the hitman, the mother decides that the girl must be a little aroused. So actions are taken, but eventually it is caught. <br /> <br /> The cast is terrible and the film drags on for too long, nothing happens. Do not waste time watching this. <br /> <br />
