For more than 70 years watching movies, it must be one of the worst comedies ever made. Mel Brooks, Mike Meyers and a few others have created very bad comedies, but this is the absolute bottom of the barrel. <br /> <br /> It is not funny from the beginning, to tack on the stage during loans. <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton, which I normally like, had to pay badly. He desperately needs to learn his craft again. <br /> <br /> Dax Shepard (I do not know who he is), I need a better director to show him how to act. <br /> <br /> Liv Tyler is also unable to fulfill his role. <br /> <br /> Mike White has to find a different character, he has done the same person several times too much. <br /> <br /> Ken Howard, who I started many years ago as the first actor, also not as good as before. <br /> <br /> There is nothing decent about what I can say about this film comedy attempt. <br /> <br /> Ratings: * (out of 4) points 25 (out of 100) IMDb 1 (out of 10)
