I saw Chan Is Missing when he first appeared, about four years after moving from San Francisco to New York. Maybe it was the prospect of a few years, but this movie seemed to capture the essence of the city and its inhabitants better than anything else I've ever seen (still doing). Focuses on one particular community - Chinese - but it's okay, because such a large part of the city's soul is broken down by settings, faces and maybe above all the voices of the characters. <br /> <br /> This is not San Francisco tourists. The settings are modest and everyday: a taxi, Chinese restaurant cuisine, Richmond District terraced houses, small Chinatown apartments and small offices, bridges, a Filipino center for older people. This is what the city looks like and feels day by day for people who live there - even now, in the era of revitalization of the urban silicon canyon. In contrast to, say, Dirty Harry (in a way, also a great movie in San Francisco), everything is shot at street level: We come to understand the viewpoints of heroes from the perspective that gives them their surroundings, and not from some fanciful dizzying shooting . <br /> <br /> Wang apparently filmed in B & W because he did not have the money to do it differently, but one of the strongest visual elements of the film is the natural light that he achieves. Often the harsh, ubiquitous quality of sunlight is one of my closest associations with San Francisco: It seems that everything exposes, bringing buildings, hills, other landmarks on a scale and in a funny way, making the people you pass on the street seem become more individual and potentially closer to you than elsewhere. Wang's photography perfectly communicates it, and even supports the story in points. <br /> <br /> Wang gives the speech and conversational style of Chinese and other san Franciscans better than anyone else, I think. If there is such a thing as a real "San Francisco accent", then you will hear from the mediator of a balding taxi medallion (I think) who appears talking on the phone in one scene (listen to what he calls the person at the other end) ya dingaling! "). <br /> <br /> The story is moving and, despite some minor mistakes, beautifully speaks about the longings that draw hearts of people living in old immigrant communities - including legitimate political and ethnic resentments and small ironic entertainment that help them drive them . All this is conveyed gently - perhaps because some respondents believe that the film is twining. It is not enough - just say that looking for Khan by two taxi drivers becomes a search for something more personal. <br /> <br /> Chan Is Missing ends with a Chinatown travel sequence backed by a foolish novelty from the 1930s (probably) of San Francisco and all its crazy diversity. Yes, an American caricature, but not quite.
