I like Billy Crystal and I thought it would be nice to watch this movie because I know he admired Alan King and they would be fun together. I thought I saw all Billy's movies, but I did not remember it, and now I know why. It is full of clich√©s and false emotions; you can feel every upcoming scene (and go!). Billy is often not even funny. He is too busy trying to cry false tears or show his anger at how much his father failed him. Sam Alan King is quite nice, as is the story of being extra in films. But what a coincidence that Billy is just visiting his father when there is a serious health crisis, etc. Etc. Or that two busy doctors can just close their practices on the moon in LA. And when the end comes, boy, it comes quickly! Almost as if the writers realized that they were painting in a corner, and the only solution was to make a death scene. Mainly disappointment with a few flashes of good humor.
