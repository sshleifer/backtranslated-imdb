I fell into this movement, as it began, in the afternoon, when I was at home with a bit of flu - otherwise I would not have noticed. That would probably be the best. <br /> <br /> I noticed the presence of Lindsay Crouse and Jay Thomas - both very good performers - and I thought it was worth seeing. It turned out that to some extent, but only because it is one of those stories so terrible that it fascinates. <br /> <br /> Zoe McLellan has little to recommend to her talents, except her Jayne Mansfield- or Loni Anderson-like bust. Unfortunately, her acting skills - at least here - make Mansfield and Anderson appear to be Garbo or Davis in comparison. <br /> <br /> White nut of a young walnut, the owner's cat, a young box with nuts, whose owner has been evicted and restrained in his own home, as well as a handful of dungeons (including a young box of nuts) running around the object of biological threat and an absurd conclusion . I waited for at least part of the scene or story element to contain at least a bit of realism, credibility or ability to evoke empathy / compassion - but it turned out to be futile.
