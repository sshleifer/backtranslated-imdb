It's really a cheesy parody of Tomb Raider and some Indiana Jones, trashy humor, just like acting. But in the end it is a soft core movie that is expected and does not matter because you really want sex. Which brings me to the biggest problem of all, almost nothing. What makes you feel like you're watching TV at 3am and playing independent movies, and the one that's on has been created by some friend who's nowhere in the industry. You have to wait a long time for a real sex scene, many times you think something will happen and then it just hangs. One (maybe two, or one with two parts), which really goes somewhere, is very pleasant. Personally, I can not recommend it unless you have found it in a clean container for a dollar or two. If you're lucky enough for a good plot movie and good acting, you do not want it. If you're looking for a good lesbian core movie, you do not want it.
