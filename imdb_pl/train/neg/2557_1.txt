Actually, I like asylum films. I've made the habit of watching as many as possible. Even the savagery they did was as cool as EXORCISM AND WHEN HE WILL RETURN TO THE KILLER. It's just bad. I can not believe that the same people who created DEAD MEN WALKING and DRACULA'S CURSE also made this film !!! He is not even ridiculously angry like JOLLY ROGER or ALIEN ABDUCTION (which, incidentally, is very bad). It's bad! My point is that I can appreciate and / or forgive bad special effects or bad special effects in a movie about asylum, but this film is too serious. I really hope that SNAKES ON THE TRAIN are better. Now this is a movie that I can not wait for.
