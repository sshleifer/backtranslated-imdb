Pluto is for the Vietnam War, because Rocky IV is a heavy heavyweight boxing. The story of Oliver Stone about the experience of the US Army platoon in Vietnam in 1968 is so exaggerated that it is ridiculous. While most or all of the events in the platoon took place over more than 10 years of American military involvement in Vietnam, to present these events to one small group of men in such a short time (in weeks), there appears a horribly skewed image of war. In platoon, platoon soldiers see the following in a week or two: American soldiers murdering civilians, American soldiers raping civilians, American sergeant murdering another American sergeant, American private murderer American staff sergeant, US soldiers killed / wounded by friendly fire, 90% + killed or injured in a platoon. For Stone to try to reject the film, the typical experience of an American soldier in Vietnam is a disgrace. Two films from the Vietnam War, which I would recommend, are We Were Soldiers (TRUE history of the worst battle for American soldiers in Vietnam) and A Bright Shining Lie HBO.
