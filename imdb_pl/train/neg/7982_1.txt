It's hard to say whether Noonan and Marshall are trying to attack Abbott and Costello, Martin and Lewis, Curley and Larry, or any other comedy group, but whoever it was, they tried to imitate, they were defeated. In this incredibly stupid picture, he barely laughs. Noonan (who helped write the supposed "script") and Marshall have no chemistry; Marshall seems to be trying to flog Dean Martin, but he does not even come up close. God knows what Noonan thought, but it was not fun to be. He seems to think that fluttering his arms and legs and looking at all stupidly and everything is the pinnacle of screen comedy; maybe it's for him, but not for the audience. I remember seeing it in cinemas when it came out. He was at the bottom of a double bill with the three-year-old western Jeff Chandler ("Pillars of the Sky", which was quite good) and a short shortcut Three Stooges ("Sappy Bullfighters" who was not), and about 20 minutes for all this, all children on the audience threw things on the screen; it was so amazingly unpleasant that she did not even face the worst shorts of Three Stooges. I stayed until the end (not what I wanted, but my people would not pick me up until the end of the movie), and when this mess ended, I was the only one in the theater. I saw it again about 15 years ago on the cable one night and got stuck to see if it was as bad as I remembered. It was worse. The only thing that happened to him was Julie Newmar, who was as burning as ever; outside of it, this thing absolutely DO NOT recommend it. Both of them also play Japanese soldiers, and the way they do it, makes the infamous playing of Japanese characters by Jerry Lewis thick, serrated, mumbling psychic flaws look mild. Marshall played "Hollywood Squares" and Noonan tried his hand at making movies, but most of them were almost as bad. Not really, though, because I do not think anything could be as bad as that. A really pathetic waste of the movie. Do not waste time.
