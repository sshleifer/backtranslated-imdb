I saw this movie at the premiere in London and I have to say - I did not expect too much, but I expected something that was at least slightly amusing. <br /> <br /> The original "Basic Instinct" was not a great movie and is still a kind of "classic sadness", but it was fun. I can remember countless times on the TV channel in late Friday or Saturday night when I came across a movie and started to pay attention to it. <br /> <br /> However, this lame brain, waaay - a late sequel has nothing. Is Sharon Stone still great? Let's put it this way - for a 47-year-old woman she is quite hot. Is she as beautiful as she was in the original? No. She also clearly had plastic surgery on her face, and her hairstyle in the film is somewhat unattractive. It does not look as soft, honest or innocent as it was in the original - that's the whole sense of being an evil seducer and something else. <br /> <br /> The rest of the performances range from bad to horrible - and Michael Caton-Jones (usually a safe director - one who does not always do a great job, but manages to make valuable films) officially released his first real turkey; film so bad that people laughed at certain moments that were supposed to be serious. <br /> <br /> I have heard that the film has gone through many editing sessions and it is very clear from the very beginning. Nothing makes much sense. The whole story is a space mess and ending - oh! Talk about stupid and unbelievable. (Still predictable.) I saw "Gigli", I saw "Son of the Mask" - and although I do not intend to "smear" this movie, I can say with my own authority (what you do not have to agree with it, remember that I prefer both of these films from this catastrophic failure. By the way, Stone went out five minutes before the movie began and the people in the theater began to throw the screen during a particularly outrageous and offensive scene at the orgy club. <br /> <br / > "Primary instinct 2" - basically stinks too.
