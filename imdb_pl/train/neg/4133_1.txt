A few months ago I watched this movie with a few friends, I still laugh today thinking about some total stupidity. The first few scenes were fun. I will not ruin anything for those who want to see it, I would not want to ruin laughter. Needless to say, throughout the time I watched this movie, I tried to determine exactly what the characters in the movie are doing. At the end, we all got bored, because the initial mirth and shock in the film that accidental fell out. There is no plot or trace of decent action. Characters are as well developed as those in the "Learn to Read" book in kindergarten. They even managed to make a lesbian sex scene uninteresting.
