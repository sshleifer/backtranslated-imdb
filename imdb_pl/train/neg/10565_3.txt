You can give JMS and boys a pass to this because they were at the beginning of their series and on a small budget, but the movie is still below normal. Do not get me wrong, the B5 series is definitely the best show ever, but if I was the performer of this movie, I would not order this series. I do not like O'Hare as an actor, the costumes are stupid and there are a lot of clich√©s. The same can be said for most of the first season (except for Babylon Squared and Survivors); Bruce immediately set the series on fire and became an amazing spectacle. If you're a B5 fan and have not seen this movie, check it out. If you're not a B5 fan, do not ... you do not want to watch the series.
