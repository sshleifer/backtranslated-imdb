Do not waste time, let alone rent this piece of thrill! How it happened is beyond me. (I do not know why there are at least 10 lines ... I've already summed up this kitschy movie, but, well ...) Acting was awful, as if everyone needed a lesson. The plot was weak, the end ... Feh! I think that cinematography was the only thing that was not really sucked ... well, maybe the sound was minimalist OK. The only good thing is that if they could do this movie, even make some money on it, there could be hope for any writer with a real idea. So you all have a heart! It seems to me that the same applies to the actors ... if these people really got paid, then you too can!
