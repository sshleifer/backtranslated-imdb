One two three four five six seven eight and back, haha. This is a must see, first of all to see what has been done. Many exercises have been shown, see these approximations, man, you'll like it. A few years ago, the video clip was certainly based on this film. It's a contraction, but no tension. The ending is also fun, and the clothes he wears in wood, with copper, Jesus, look like a clown. The murders take place mainly off the screen, the blood flows, but it is never too bloody. There are many battle scenes and hey, no one was hurt. And what about the weapon to kill, I have never seen such a big one, it will not spoil it, you must see it. And being a slasher, there is also a lot of T & A. To guess who the killer is, you will be trapped several times and this is the best part, but what about the history of copper in the forest, huh! But still because of its cheesy it is still the one that many would like to have. I am glad that I have my copy, one of those failures. But man, these clothes and not to mention hairstyles! If you are aged 40, it is a return to the belt of memory.
