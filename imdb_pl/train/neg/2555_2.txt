This movie is probably one of the scariest horror movies I've ever seen. The length was not long enough to cover a good storyline. Also, the way the adoptive parents died was just ridiculous. The mother suddenly dies because of falling in the shower after stumbling over a figure, and my dad is shot by a policeman? I can see where some originality could have been what they intended, but it could have been better. In addition, the trashiness of all this made me want to press the stop before it ends. After hearing the whole name of Lucy and understanding that it was "Lucifer", I wanted to gag. Yes, it's interesting that Lucifer was a woman, but look at the name. It's a male name. He should be given a masculine character. In conclusion, the movie was boring and could use a better story.
