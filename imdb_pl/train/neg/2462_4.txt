Well, I like the whore in this movie - it's really disturbing. Anyone who was at the dentist will know why. The story is really not so bad, the motivations of Corbin Bersen characters have a lot more sense than in most horror films. <br /> <br /> I've seen worse acting, directing, script etc. on this day is still a bad horror movie. So it boils down to whether you like this type of thing. I tried to watch the sequel, but it was exactly the same as the movie. Remember, if you like people being tortured at the dentist, this is the movie for you!
