It is always difficult to have siblings better in your life than you, always fight to get out from under the shade and not let bitterness keep you away from your family. So, imagine that your older brother is Santa, and then imagine how difficult it must be. Here's the premise here. <br /> <br /> Vince Vaughn plays titular Fred, an embittered loser who devotes a lot of energy, so people do not walk around, expecting good things to meet them or give them to their brother, Santa (played by Paul Giamatti), too much praise for being just a grim, hungry fame, a bit of a terrifying guy Fred would like to introduce to him. Then, if you did not know that, Fred needs financial benefit, so he needs to make up for it by helping his brother run on Christmas. And joy and life lessons are born. <br /> <br /> Well, that should happen. The reality is that we get a Christmas movie with some good moments of Vaughn's patented fast speaking, absurdly short video video with music, Kevin Spacey plays the auditor who closes Santa's activity (and is one of the weakest) of the bad guys I've seen from some kind of time), not enough great Elizabeth Banks in a lush outfit, too much John Michael Higgins in his elf dress (to be honest, but it's a great point) and a movie that is too smooth to feel like a good seasonal dish, but too nasty in their second half to feel like a funny fairy because of bad things related to the commercialization of those times. <br /> <br /> Rachel Weisz is also on a ride, like Kathy Bates, but it's really just a movie for Vaughn, and if you like his style, you'll find something for yourself. Unfortunately, little more can be recommended for this seasonal smelly. In addition to Vaughn's insults, the script hardly sheds anything decent, except for one particularly good scene involving a cheerful support group dealing with a very specific problem. <br /> <br /> David Dobkin is just as average as 20p Christmas card that you send aunt you have not seen in 10 years and it seems that just a combination of ingredients without a good mix or decent care will guarantee a delicious Christmas pudding. No, we get a burned, bland figure with too much sugar on top. Forget it and put on a fun Elf again, if you want a great, modern Christmas comedy. <br /> <br /> See if you like: Santa Claus 2, Santa Claus, Santa Claus 3: escape clause.
