It's disturbing how this movie was nominated for seven Oscars and won one. Not because it is hopeless or because, considering the collective qualities of the creative team that really stands behind it, you really should deserve it, but because in every category in which it was nominated, Prizzi's Honor disappoints. Some say the old Hollywood pioneer John Huston lost him at this point in his career, but I do not buy it. It was not until last year that he signed a contract with UNDER THE VOLCANO, a dark study of characters in Mexico, which is among the best in history. Prizzi's honor, on the other hand, a film filled with the power of the star, good intentions and a decent script, turns out to be a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> The general tone and intrigue of a gangster falling in love with a hit-man woman depicts bizarre crime novels that stormed Hollywood in the early 90s, but the script is too intricate for itself, motivations are off, and the whole story it seems uncertain what exactly is it: romantic comedy, crime drama, gangsta saga, etc. Jack Nicholson (Brooklyn's accent, which perfectly suits De Niro, but sounds unconvincing from Jack) and Kathleen Turner in the main roles seem to be in the pay-out mode by simply passing through the movements of almost sleepwalking through some parts. On the other hand, Anjelica Huston fares better, but her performance is sabotaged by the heroine's motivations: she begins the scorn of her bigot's father, turns out to be helpful for her ex-husband, and then becomes a vengeful bitch who wants his head to eat. <br /> <br /> The film colors are of the same quality as in the early 1970s, and the direction of Huston is as uninteresting as anything else. Behind the story lies a promise, and perhaps in the hands of a director who wants to be recognized, it could be transformed into something better, but what remains is like a film that nobody really was interested in.
