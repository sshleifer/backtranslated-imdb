Man To Man is trying to be a good movie: he has his heart in the right place, he aspires to be epic and has a message that everyone will undoubtedly appreciate. But there are also some problems of this image. It strives to be good and to convey the message that sometimes the viewer must feel unquestioned. It is enough, therefore, that the images that are used by this image are simplified - Man To Man does not allow the viewer to decide what he thinks is right, but he puts his voice in the head. Joseph Fiennes is an example of this in his role: he tries to look concerned, genuinely touched and all the other emotions that can be expressed with one expression of the face the repertoire has to offer. Let us add that the film is too long and at the end loses speed, so you can easily come to the conclusion that Man To Man is not worth watching. But there are enough points to defend him: he's funny, he has some humorous scenes and the stealing show Kristin Scott Thomas. Of course, you should not compare it to humanistic masterpieces such as The Elephant Man (David Lynch), but you'll be happy with the theater. Trying to catch your heart (even if your brain thinks it's too obvious) and it's a success for most of the time.
