I am very sorry, I know that Fa√übinder is still called one of the greatest directors in post-war Germany and that most of his films are considered "masterpieces", but when I see "Lili Marleen" today, in 2004, I wonder what everyone is up on the subject of this movie! Acting is just awful - Hanna Schygulla smiles like an idiot! - changes between the Nazi glow and battlefields are funny, the whole movie looks as if it was created in two days in the attic. This is probably how it was and many people seem to take it for "real art", but for me this movie is simply bad and cheap. Compare it with Viscontis "La Caduta degli Dei" and tell me again that "Lili Marleen" is a good movie ...
