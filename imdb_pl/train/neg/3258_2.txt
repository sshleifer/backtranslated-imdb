DOC SAVAGE: A MAN OF BRÄ„ZU (1 out of 5 stars) <br /> <br /> A horrible, scary movie ... based on a series of magazines / soft covers Lester Dent / Kenneth Robeson ... about a super heroic hero in the 30s and his five assistants, all experts in some field of endeavor that allows them to fight evil. It was a nice hokey series ... but it's nice to read when I was a teenager. I knew that they created a movie version in the '70s, in which Ron (Tarzan) Ely appeared ... but I never had the opportunity to see her. He never played in the cinemas where I lived and was never shown on television. Now that I finally saw the movie, I understand why. The plot and characters are never taken seriously ... it's all on the cheek and campus ... a bit like the old Batman TV series ... just without the benefits of being funny ... or having any visual talent. Corny dialogue, trashy special effects, stupid stereotypes, bad action scenes and bad, bad acting. In fact, it's fascinating in his evil ... what would they think? Apparently Arnold Schwarzenegger appeared in the modern remake ... but I can not imagine that it would be better.
