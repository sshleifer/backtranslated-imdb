It is hard to believe that the movie from this book can be successful in making up for its horrors! The story is so fancy and unbelievable. . . starting with putting a ton of blame on a small child to save her pain! Then we have collusions of at least six and maybe more people (including clerics) involved in what is a crime around the world. Then we have a wife who apparently stays on a ferry crossing, from being relatively satisfied with a very short digging of footprints. Very unpleasant and cooing mother, supported, incited and supported by a politically correct group of friends! Moving scenery from the island off the coast of South Carolina did not help this story, although it could have helped the budget of the filmmakers. The very beautiful buildings allegedly housed the monastery did not seem to fit the island sufficiently small to need golf carts and such small ferry connections. Kim Basinger, which I really like, is very painful in this film, and her hairstyle certainly belongs to the next decade. There is simply no chemistry between her and any of the men. I did not like the book it was made of, but I read it all. The film I was constantly surfing had to leave as soon as the saccharine music was too big. If you do not like unbelievable history, wooden acting, a distorted mix of religion / mythology / allegory, I advise you to omit this. Oh, maybe a little critical criticism, but would not a caring father have a life jacket for a small child on a small boat? Scenery is the best part of this movie
