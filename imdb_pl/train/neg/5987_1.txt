I really did not like this movie. The plot was very predictable. A typical American plot, I'm sorry. At the end, the guy gets a girlfriend. And London has a monorail? Bank of London ??? The Bank of England is what it really is !! - However, I like the look of Tracy Island and the Thunderbirds themselves. And the British were angry? (except Parker and Lady Penelope) What happened to this? Oh, they kept repeating things like "Here they come" The Thunderbirds "" - but in the show it was never known as "The Thunderbirds", why? I would like to see this remade of more than a dozen British casts over 20 years. I preferred the original series. Excuse me!
