In the years 1919-1933, Germany does not resemble the Czech capital after the Second World War. Oh, sorry, this is the capital of the Czech Republic and it is 2003, how ridiculous. <br /> <br /> This is one of the scariest historical films in the near future. Röhm is a head higher than Adolf and looks so damn good, Göring looks 40 when he is only 23 years old, and the "Führer" always looks 56. And buildings, people, even buildings, were sometimes young. Especially in 1919. Many houses in Germany were almost new (the first world war does not reach German cities!). No crumbling plaster! Then the building of the Reichstag. There were never any urban canyons around this building. This may sound like a miracle: in 1933, the fire brigade in Berlin has many vehicles with engines, some even with swivel racks, but none with a hand pump. <br /> <br /> One last thing: what was the PLAYMOBIL lock in the last sequence? For me, it was a kind of "Adolf's Adventures in Wonderland"
