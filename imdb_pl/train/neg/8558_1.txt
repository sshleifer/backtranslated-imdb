This movie was absolutely horrible, I feel even uncomfortable calling it a movie. This is a typical mumblecore movie, with a zero story and a group of aimless, grumpy twenty people who stumble, trying to "invent something". I tried to give mumblecore a chance, but honestly, it's just awful. <br /> <br /> I have not synchronized with the cinema, I appreciate the movies Dogme95, Idiotics is one of my favorite movies. So it does not bother me that the movie is cheap, if there is any (Some) substance. <br /> <br /> Everything in this movie is awful, acting, writing (was it all improvised?), the direction, but MOST all, first of all, working with the camera was plain and simple nonsense. The camera was never logical, there was no consistency. I must admit I was the guy I heard that nudity was in this movie, so I thought well, even if its horrible is at least a nudity (yes, I know I'm a jerk). Well, thanks to the uber crappy camera-work you never really see anything, and the things you see, TRUST ME - YOU DO NOT WANT TO SEE. This movie made me want to vomit on many levels. <br /> <br /> Dialogue made me want to vomit, working with the camera made me want to vomit, but above all the idea that this movie was praised by some legit critics, well, now I want to vomit more than anything else .
