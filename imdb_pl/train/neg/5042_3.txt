The main complaint related to this film is the fact that I can not say who is who. It was not intended to be racist, but these Asians look the same! I can tell a little bit about this story, but to hell with what's happening. The identities of nations are not secret, if they were a secret, I would care for them. Instead, I was not from the screen ASAP. <br /> <br /> In this film they take a lot of wide shots and quiet, emotionless faces. Heck is boring, I do not just know these people, but they just sit there. <br /> <br /> The production is a typical Chinese John Woo, a terrible film with stains. It looks just a little better than Andy Lau's "Fulltime Killer" (which was a great movie). You'd think of a decent budget to at least make it look like Hollywood from the '90s. I did not know that the Chinese have these artistic beatniks.
