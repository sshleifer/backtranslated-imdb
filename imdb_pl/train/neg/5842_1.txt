What a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> It starts well with the title sequence, but it's as good as it gets. <br /> <br /> The movie is something like rats that turn into monsters and go on the madness of killing. Acting is not too weak, but the script is pointless, and the film is not even frightening despite the atmospheric music. <br /> <br /> It's really amazing that some group has gathered this bag of garbage and thought it would be a good movie. <br /> <br /> This is not a good movie. It's rubbish and I am calling you not to waste a moment on it! One in ten.
