I just watched this movie and did not read the book. The good part of this movie is that in some parts you are a little wondering about the spiritual theme, evolution, sincronism and your role in the world. <br /> <br /> However, immersing the film is easy to break and there is very little relationship between the viewer and the characters. It is very clear that the book loses much in this version of the film. Events that were supposed to show that sincronicity is taking place are almost unrecognizable. To see that the scene shows a coincidence, you have to do a lot of thinking, and even more imagine that it has something to do with the larger goal. <br /> <br /> The Enlightenment scenes are visually weak and do not create a better feeling than they should. Do you remember enlightenment with Keanu Reeves (in Little Buddha)? It's nothing. <br /> <br /> Most scenes are poorly made. There are many scenes that really do not develop stories, and also do not help in creating an atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The better actors in this movie, namely Hector Elizondo, Joaquim de Almeida and Jürgen Prochnow, can not write it. The first 2 seem to have more scenes than their heroes should try to save the movie, and also because they have been paid more, but it does not work. Most of the scenes are not really needed and do not help throughout history. <br /> <br /> Jürgen does well in his scenes and sells as a bad guy (as always), but the script does not help him in everything. The scene in which he tries to convince John (Matthew Settle) for the first time to join him is simply a bad script. Performing the scene when dying in an explosion is absurdly bad. You can not even comment on the flashback in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is a large deck of time, read a book! I have not read it, but it is probably a billion times better than it must be. <br /> <br /> It's so bad that I had to write my first comment in IMDb.
