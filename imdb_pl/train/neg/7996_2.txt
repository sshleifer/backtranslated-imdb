Is there a book entitled "How do I make a movie with every clich√© imaginable"? If not, the ants would be a great source material for the killer insects chapter. Ants do not have one piece of originality that could be found at any time during its 100-minute operation time. I suppose the most surprising thing is that the ants have stretched the movie up to 100 minutes. Settings, characters, various threads, death scenes and the manner of presenting ants have been made before any number of times? and in most cases much better. It's amazing that so many of these Rampage insect films were made in the '70s because they are basically the same movie. <br /> <br /> And can anyone tell me what in the name of God Myrna Loy is doing this monkey movie? A woman as talented and classic as Loy deserves better than Ants as one of her last films.
