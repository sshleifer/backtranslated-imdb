Remake of Abre los Ojos Alejandro Amenabara, but this time with a live, breathing mask in the lead role. To get the dubious advantage of the English soundtrack, we endure the cruel action of Tom Cruise, as usual, with zero depth. Yes, the character is identified with his person, but usually we have a character under her who is interested in us. His empty attitude negates any erotic energy that could have been between his character and Cruz or Diaz. <br /> <br /> There is an acting action that involves using masks to free the actor, enriching his presentation with the word and the body means language. Cruise's masking painfully underlines his ineptitude as an actor. See the original Amenabar from 1997 Open your eyes!
