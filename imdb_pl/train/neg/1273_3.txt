I have two good things to say about this film: the scenery is beautiful, and Peter Falk gives a good performance (considering what he had to work in terms of dialogue and direction). However, I said that this movie is extremely tiring. Watching dry paint would be more fun. It seemed much longer than 97 minutes. Starting with the opening sequence in which everyone talks to each other and Paul Reiser repeats everything he has told him over the phone, the video is irritating. The film is filled with clichés and clichés, not to mention the endless incidents of the audible flatulence of Falk. In addition, it seems that the director had difficulty deciding whether to pursue laughter or tears. There are some sequences that touch, but all are played for laughter. If you like schmaltzy, sentimental and "sweet", you will love it. But if you were hoping for something bigger, see another video.
