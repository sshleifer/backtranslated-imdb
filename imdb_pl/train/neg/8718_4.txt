The third part of the "Carnosaur" trilogy consists of a group of Keystone Kops commandos who try to kill two Velociraptors and T-Rex. I give him 4 of pure sympathy and affinity for dinosaurs. The film is by far the worst of the trilogy, it can not be taken seriously. More importantly, watching this movie, I can not help but notice the similarities between the "Carnosaur" and "Xtro" trilogs. The first part of both franchises is a dark, disturbing movie that has become an iconic classic, the second is "Alien" ripoff, and the third is a bold, almost slapstick (or intentional or not) movie that you laugh on the floor. As with the "Xtro" series, all "Carnosaur" films are completely unrelated. They only bear the name of a franchise to arouse interest in "sequels". Of course, "Carnosaur" and "Xtro" have two different production groups here, but if you've seen all three films from both series, then you're going back and forth.
