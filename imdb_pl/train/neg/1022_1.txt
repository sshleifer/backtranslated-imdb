Starting with the poster (with only Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey), the whole movie was a scam. One stereotype after another, this movie was about nothing - at least nothing new. After 10-15 minutes you realize that you have just paid to see how Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J recite their way through another cop. <br /> <br /> Essentially, the story applies to some corrupt city systems, all secretly backed by the spine and city, under the watchful eye of some kind of hot politician. An all-powerful and supranational organization is called FRAT and guess what? have a jittery policeman firing and beating at will - suspects, friends, call it. FRAT cops are corrupt and greedy, so they make mistakes that have been discovered by a young and talented (!!!) journalist. An hour later, after a series of incredibly bad photographic scenes and successive stereotypical lines, everything ends happily and we get the last line: you can not beat the system. Bah! Do not look at the waste of the film roll. Freeman and Spacey barely have 10 minutes!
