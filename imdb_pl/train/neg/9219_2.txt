I did not even know it was originally a TV movie when I saw it, but I guessed it all the time. It has the same washed out colors, bland figures and horrible synthesized music that I remember from the 80s, as well as a "social platform" that practically screams "Afterschool special." Anyhoo. <br /> <br /> Rona Jaffe (thank you) Labyrinths and monsters were created during the heyday of Dungeons & Dragons, a pen and paper RPG that took the hearts of millions of maniacs from all over America. I consider myself one of the maniacs, although I have never played D & D especially, I played in one of his brothers. M & M was also created in times of the greatest D & D controversy - that it was so engaging that people could lose touch with reality, worship Satan without knowledge, blah blah. I suppose it was a legitimate problem at some point, if it was extremely rare - but it dates horribly. <br /> <br /> We meet 4 young students who play aptly named labyrinths and monsters to socialize and have some time away from mundane life. Only that M & M, as presented, is more boring than their everyday life. None of the charms of the games are presented here - and the appeal of Jay Jay to transfer M & M to the "real world" appears out of nowhere. It's just an excuse for one of the characters to go crazy out of nowhere - although at the moment we do not really care. Jay Jay, Robbie, Kate and Daniel should be different - but they're all rich WASP's leaders who have problems that nobody really has. <br /> <br /> But everything just goes on, it gets worse in many respects. The low budget is terribly clean (I love the "Entry" sign and the cardboard cutout in the forbidden caves). Robbie / Pardu shows why he is not a warrior in the worst stitching scene, and the payoff for the "Two Towers" is accidentally cheerful. Tom Hanks blubbering "Jay Jay, what am I doing here?" He made me laugh for a few minutes. Definitely the lowest point in his career. <br /> <br /> Do not look at it as a convincing satire, just a laughable piece of TV from the 80's, and you'll still have fun. I mean, if you can not fall asleep. Most of them are mostly boring, but at the end it is worth considering the collapse of Pard. At least Tom Hanks has become better. Not that he could go much worse from here.
