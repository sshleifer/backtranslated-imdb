I just rented Creep and was not impressed. I felt nothing in this movie. I felt sick because the blood was shocking. <br /> <br /> Several times I left the living room in desperation that something will happen to this film. We have not seen this before? I did not like that one of the heroes became a guy in the sewage cage. I felt bad for him. But then again, I could not think why he was still alive and was not murdered by Creep? You have to answer many questions. <br /> <br /> Someone mentioned references to the PS2 Silent Hill game and I see vague similarities. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad movie, it's not good. judge for yourself.
