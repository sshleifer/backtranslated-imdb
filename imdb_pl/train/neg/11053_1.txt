This is one of those "so bad is good" movies that you always hear about, but you never see! Unlike Troma's films, which are deliberately evil and camp (and I'm not amused), this one is 100% clean serious. <br /> <br /> However, with features like the supposedly super killer robot killer, who divorces like one of the Solid Gold Dancers on a sour expedition and the magical first partner who summons lightning and transforms into the Good Witch of the East, that she takes her seriously, pushes her so far beyond the edge of evil that she makes the whole circle fun. <br /> <br /> That's why you can get torn.
