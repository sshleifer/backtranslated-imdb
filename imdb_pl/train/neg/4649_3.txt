1957 (yes, this is the correct date) production of J. Arthur Rank with James Robertson Justice, Margaret Rutherford, Wilfred Hyde White; it must be a broken comedy, right? Oh, it's just awful. This is one gag movie: watching people is shocked by the sight of a small alligator. Music is thrown in the most inappropriate and forgotten way. Jeannie Carson is a live dancer and a competent singer. But what was she doing in this movie? Diana Dors is here too, providing oh-so-bold shots for use in announcements. Her acting level is not bad, but she's in the movie to get someone to stare at him. Well, in this movie you have to do something besides moaning. The film is sold on VHS now by people on e-Bay. Save yourself the cost and time loss. Comedy without laughter. Musical without a memorable song or dance.
