I am a sucker of a good romance, but this one is not good or romance. I killed the plot before the loans ran out. With such a weak dialogue, story and character development, I propose to invest one and a half hours to another place. I had to sail out and rent a Serendipity for the third time so that I could get rid of the bad taste of the mouth.
