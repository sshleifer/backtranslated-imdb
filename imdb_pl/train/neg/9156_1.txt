Ben and Arthur could be 10. Sam Mraovich wrote, directed, directed and produced this movie. Sam should have given his idea to a good writer, director and leave the actor to someone who could act. this is a good example of one person controlling all production. there was no one to tell him, "Sam is bad, really bad." <br /> <br /> Jamie Brett Gabel was the only good point, but he could have been much better with a good director and better actors for work. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that Sam Mraovich should be tied to a chair and filmed to watch this movie (twice). acting and directing were so bad that this movie became a comedy. you just had to laugh and in the wrong places. <br /> <br /> Second good point ... it would be a great movie with dates. after the first two minutes you will stop watching the movie and pay more attention to your date!
