Ok, to be honest, I do not understand why everyone thinks it's so great. It really is not. There are two good things in this film: 1. Jacek's performance was very good. 2. Danny's performance was good. No, besides, it was pretty stupid. And what was Stanley Kubrick thinking when developing Shelly as Wendy? She was so angry. She looked the same every time she was afraid. The problem with this movie was the ending. I'd be more respectful if Kubrick had it different. And this whole movie was just stupid. The problem with the film is that the book was much better. So do not look at how the movie reads the book and you will be much better. 3/10.
