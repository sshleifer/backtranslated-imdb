This is the first review of sub-genres without zombies, but this movie is worth reviewing. Dinocroc is a good movie in general, but unfortunately it is still an obvious film. Sam Dinocroc looked great, but I thought that the film itself needs a bit more weight, as in action and violence, because every time the croc is shown or is on fight scene, little happens unless a croc is shown and croc kills or escapes in a recurring process. Jane Longenecker was hot, which is a plus, and acting was better than average, and the most surprising thing is that the croc looked fleshy instead of a cartoon cough * a curse of the komodo cough *. I really enjoyed this movie to enjoy that there will be a sequel that is more than what I can say about some movies at all. A total of 3/6 stars and worth seeing.
