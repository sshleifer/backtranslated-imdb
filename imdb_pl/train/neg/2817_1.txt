Tobe Hooper is probably the biggest horror game. Like any other horror fan, I loved Texas Chainsaw, but I think you should have at least one hit movie to put your name at the head of the movie. I really do not think about any other movie that Hooper did (alone, do not count the poltergeist) that really influenced the genre of the horror movie or the world of the movie. And this movie, Night Terrors, just confirms my point. <br /> <br /> Poor Robert Englund, I give him appreciation for at least a good job with the horrible stuff he was given. He did what he could. What about the movie itself? Pure dexterity. Unnecessary naked scenes every five minutes, a story that had to be written in our, or rather horrible scenery, music and cinematography. Nothing in this movie is exchangeable. Do not waste time. <br /> <br /> In general, 1 in 10. I'm sorry about Hooper, his career seems to be over before it really started. I hope he can pump out at least one good movie, in this way he can do his cult status as justice. <br /> <br />
