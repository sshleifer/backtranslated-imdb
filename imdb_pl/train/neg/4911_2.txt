First To Die 2003 <br /> <br /> First I will admit to the error: I did not realize that it was a TV movie. I was "kicked out" from the "R" certificate. The plot is strong, but the film lasts about 40 minutes for a long time. The direction and continuity were excellent. For the most part the cast was exceptional and did a good job with her characters. The disadvantage of the film is that it definitely belongs to the "chick flick" genre. Although there are some violent scenes, none of the violence should require an "R" rating. There is no nudity or free sex scenes. Actually, there are no sex scenes. She Grauer (who is absolutely beautiful), Kristina Copeland, Sonya Salomaa and Glynis Davies were guests of the SG-1 series, but this movie did nothing to speed their career, because they were all used as low-level supporting actresses. Robert Patrick was fantastic as always, and Mitch Pileggi made me think about contemporary Lee Marvin. The very talented Megan Gallagher, whom I respected as an actor in the Millennium series, did not receive any challenges to show her skill range. The biggest disappointment with regard to the cast was Tracy Pollan. In addition to being below the average actress and not particularly attractive, her voice is absolutely annoying. I found myself in the TV crowd during her dialogue. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes Lifetime TV. However, I do not recommend paying any money to see this movie. Given that I have not found anything that could cause censorship, it is a movie that deserves to be watched only on television, because nothing will be cut out. As a TV movie, I would rate it as 5 out of 10. As a full-length feature with an "R" certificate and such a strong cast, I rate it as 2 out of 10.
