This is really a weird movie ... First of all, we have an ex-gymnastic from the USA who is trying to change an actor (or something like that), and it seems that this is the only role he has ever received (I know). for a good reason. While he plays a role well enough to maintain interest, it is rather nondescript and flat performance. Second, we have WORST EVER sound effects ever used in the movie !!! I am not joking. Only this makes the film extremely comical, but in such an irritating way. hehe and thirdly, while we have a generally decent cast (including the required hot staff!), actually not too bad story and cool visuals; dialogue, gymnastics battle scenes (fun!), and the overall plot is poor. This movie would be barely better than a television movie on the net (in 1985 it was not too bad Fox). It's one of those movies that's just bad, but you can not resist watching and even enjoying it when you get used to it, especially now that you've found the perfect eternal home on your TV and cable late at night.
