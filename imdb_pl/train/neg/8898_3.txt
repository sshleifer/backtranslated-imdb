Can artificial scenery destroy a photo? You would not think so, but really for me here. Look, I have a lot of movies from the classical age and I know what except for what the drivers do, such as the drivers immobilizing cars in front of the screen etc. But many of this hokey business is related to the action scenes. To get a false scenery, false mountains and flowers shot after the shot, as seen in "Brigadoon", after some time offends. <br /> <br /> When it comes to musical entertainment, it's always subjective. What songs one person likes, the other does not, so it should not be a big part of the film's rating (does anyone like the song). I could have smashed this movie for his infernal songs from 1950, dances, romances and characters, but it was the fifties and many people liked that kind of thing. The music did very well in the 1950s. I liked the 30's and 40's with big taps. In the 1950s the tap was turned off and new things - which I can bear - were. Does it make a bad movie? No. It just makes me not care about the very <br /> <br /> Despite the good cast, good director and high expectations, this film bombed at the box office and with me. I should like it more, being a dreamer myself and a nice part of this story. I'm not a cynical type and a nice city, and nice people make me feel good, it sounds awful. So why could not I connect to this movie? Part of it was also dancing. I do not care about things that have replaced tapping on the screen. But - no - the matter has really pushed me away from what the staging is. It was not Scotland, high places, just a hokey background that made it look like it changed me almost from the beginning. Get one point for today's realism, where they "go there" most of the time.
