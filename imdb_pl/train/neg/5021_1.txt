This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. The story was boring, the dialogue was terrible, and the acting hammy. I'm not sure if this movie was the result of a film school homework project, but it certainly played like that. It is not even particularly effective in its central concept of attempting to appear as a single continuous attack. Fluttering horizontal camera pans are a cheap and unoriginal way of hiding cuts.
