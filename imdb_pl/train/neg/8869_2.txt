With the release of "Farligt förflutet", the Swedish film industry has really reached the peak of popularity. Stefan (Jens Hultén) ​​has lived a quiet life with his wife Marie (Regina Lund) in recent years. One day, Stefan's old friend comes to ask him. Stefan has to do a small courier job. He should bring a suitcase filled with heroine by Swedish-German customs. Unfortunately, things in Germany do not work as planned, and Stefan is in serious trouble right now. It is always nice to see a Swedish film that breaks the traditional pattern of the family drama. Unfortunately, if people involved in production have no idea how a movie should be written, filmed or cut out, the result can be catastrophic. The content can be ended with the words: bad acting, inconsistent plot and idiotic dialogues. The only attraction of the film is the unprovoked sex scene with the amazingly beautiful Regina Lund. It lasts only a few seconds, leaving about 90 minutes of pure, let's say what it really is, crap.
