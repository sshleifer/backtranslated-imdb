I wanted to love this movie. How could I not love it? Cary Grant, Jayne Mansfield, Stanley Donen; all icons in their own way. However, the wreck of the Suzy Parker train ruined my entire experience. Her acting was so frightening that I sat there with my jaw open, not believing my eyes or ears. I could barely go through one watch, IT, how horrible it is. <br /> <br /> Cary? A great and great dramatic form. Jayne? Adorable, endearing and of course having a ball. The supporting cast is fine, and the city of San Francisco is captured in all its stunning retro elegance. <br /> <br /> Then you see Suzy Parker trying to speak with her lines of wood, worry, lack of consciousness just resists the faith. Who told this creation that it can work? Oy VEY, people.
