If not bad dialogs and scenario. I mean, the direction was really in touch with the topic. The actors coped well, introducing their characters to life. But ultimately the thing that was really missing was a solid script to store all the elements. I would strongly suggest not to watch it. Unless you're an Al Pacino enthusiast like me and I will be watching everything he plays. Even if the result is rather weak. After S1m0ne it is the second very bad movie for this actor who once knew how to choose roles.
