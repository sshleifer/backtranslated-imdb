Coyote Ugly could have been much more effective if the filmmakers made it a movie with pleasure / exploitation with an R grade (with plenty of nudity). But because the PG-13 rating is what all studios want, end up with a movie like this: "irritant" PG-13, who can not go anywhere, if the movie should have disappeared. <br /> <br /> The script is generic, it is easy to guess which storyline will occur 15 minutes before its actual occurrence. Acting is enough, but the characters are as thin as paper, not to do anything about them. There were also many points in which it seemed to me that I was watching a music video rather than a movie. <br /> <br /> The only advantage of the film are extremely beautiful female leads. We see them in extremely tight and pretty clothes ... but that's all that was possible due to PG-13 restrictions. There are plenty of cleavage and toned bodies that perform well choreographic dance numbers, but you do not have to talk about nakedness or sex. Tyra Banks (with age becomes even more beautiful) is also in the film for a very short time. Sexy novice Piper Perabo is also very easy for the eyes (and has a deadly smile) and shows the real potential of the actor. <br /> <br /> The only people who have seen that this film is attractive are the boys before puberty, they are not allowed to watch movies with the rating of R. This audience can derive a lot of excitement from it, but the audience for adults will feel annoyed and cheated. <br /> <br /> Rating: film-1 for women-10
