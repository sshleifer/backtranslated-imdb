At first this movie seemed pretty good, even though it moved quite fast and even though it only had a budget of $ 60,000, it was good, but if you found your sister dead in the lake and found out who could kill her, why would you chase? go around him and pull a gun on him with only one bullet and waste him, and eventually you will run away from him and you will die? Plus, after you found your dead sister in the lake and found a clue and found out who the killer was, why would not you give this to the police who think you killed her? And at the end of the movie, when she acts like her sister, who was a waitress and talks to the bad guy she should meet with, and somewhere she taped him saying he was dead and what happened to her "proof". I do not know if I was not satisfied with the ending. This movie could have been a lot better if it lasted longer and the game was better and the ending was not so bad! Do not waste money on this movie, because if you do, you will write a review here and you will not be happy.
