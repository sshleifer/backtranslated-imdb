We went to this movie because my husband enjoyed the original version of "My favorite Martian". We had a 6-year-old daughter with us. She wanted to leave halfway through the movie, which was fine with both parents! The parts we saw were only sometimes funny, mostly too stupid or disgusting. I would expect that this movie can appeal to children aged 9-12, if so. It is definitely not suitable for younger children. From what I heard, the original series was definitely better and if you're going to "survive the past," you'll probably be disappointed.
