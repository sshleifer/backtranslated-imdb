When I saw that Mary Louise Parker was associated with this epic novel, the movie, I was intrigued. Being a fan of this book, I assumed she would be playing Tony, Roza or Charis, but I was more intrigued when they saw how they would change this almost-psychological (but not psychological thriller) novel into a movie that would be available to those who did not read the novel, and that would be at least slightly satisfying for those who had. The book is a complex reflection of society, women and modern life. I wanted to see how they used 3 different narratives that lead to the development of the story in the film. What they actually did was a crime. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake and mystery is: Why Oxygen, a network advertising as a woman, will take an amazing book about how complex, wonderful and scary women are and can be and change the hero from 3 women to some stupid former policeman with no real motive to take part in this story? It seems that whoever adapted it came out easily using this guy to ask Roz, Tony, and Charis, as they know Zenia, and by doing it, they rushed forward. By doing this, however, they mixed up the story and cut out everything that is great in characters, except to create it, so that the audience would have nobody to associate with. In the film, these women are not human, they are characters. <br /> <br /> In the book, Zenia falsifies her death, but the book mentions it to achieve this goal, while the film is wasting 30-45 minutes focusing on this former clay running and doing nothing. They tried to make this complex a book section of Law and Order or CSI. <br /> <br /> It turns out that Mary Louise Parker played Zenia, which was SO wrong. Zenia is Catherine Zeta-Jones, Angelina Jolie, and maybe even Scarlett Johnasson. She is a woman that men can not adore, and a woman whose women are intrigued and threatened, but in a way "keep their enemies closer". And when he approaches, he seems completely sincere and trustworthy, despite your better judgment. She is a woman who, even when she loses, wins: she is always beautiful, still rich and there are always people who do not know her game. <br /> <br /> In the film, Zenia did not take the man Charis (a blond American fellow who used Charis first ...), but instead took August and tried to become her legal guardian (and apparently she came back to to become her lesbian lover's kiss in a cafe suggests). And Zenia killed the chickens before leaving in August, but it did not make sense, because all the buildings were removed. It's as if anyone wrote the script, grabbed the straws to please those of us who read the book, but I think if I did not read this book, I would spend the whole movie confused if I wanted to stick to it. <br /> <br /> And Roza's husband was dead before Zenia came to the picture (which was weird, since Zenia took Roz's business and home life in the book, which is why Roz hated her so much) and she and Zenia plotted to kill Rata's husband years ago. And according to the movie that Tony and West were forever ... even at the party where Zenia and West (in the book) painted the whole place in black and made Tony seem so completely connected to him (and angry, strange) person who has always been respected by all for her intelligence and popularity. Tony's character was so bad in this movie ... she seemed a bit psychic and how the brain was descending behind any conspiracies, as opposed to how the teacher was in the book. The film basically suggested that smart women are bad, beautiful women are bad, powerful women are bad, and women who teach yoga are not their fans. <br /> <br /> Basically, they tried to do it, so Zenia was not necessarily as horrible as she was in the book, and then three women are convincing this former policeman (who, of course, is Zenia and is having an affair with her who studies it) it's supposed to end in Barbados or something funny, which Zenia is obviously waiting for) to hide Zenia's body (which she found in the hotel where she was staying, but the movie suggests that one of the three women pushed her on the balcony, or they conspired together) to do it ...), then Zenia managed to collect all Roz money. At the end of the movie, I was just halfway between the b / c ads, which jumped so far into the cosmos of what it could and should be. <br /> <br /> If you are not confused by the break of the movie, maybe you might like it, because I read the book and saw the movie, and the movie itself is ridiculously lost. That was awful. It seems to me that making a movie from this book is quite a difficult task, but if you are going to take on this task, you should start by defining what is unnecessary in the book instead of creating some useless character that will be our Alice in Wonderland. <br /> <br /> Is there really no more fluffy books that Oxygen could have done in at least half of decent TV movies?
