This film proves that cinema "commercial" or Hollywood movies is in a serious crisis. There is absolutely no reason for this film to be produced except for the fact that someone expected success based on Shaquille's name. it is worth relying on the story: it is slightly more embarrassed than the knot. Furthermore? The screen is a bit dark, O'Neal is a bad actor, but Francis Capra is even worse. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/10.
