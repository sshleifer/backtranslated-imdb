Madhur has given us a powerful movie of Chandni Bar in the past. His next film was one of the worst movies of all time. Apparently, it tells the story of some high-class people in India. After watching the scene in which the man forces another man for sexual reasons to the Star in the movie. I wanted to spit and break a DVD. I did it accidentally. The reason why the film contains scenes of child pornography and harassment. I literally vomited and was shocked to see a movie showing naked children. Very disturbing things, there was no need to show children completely naked. One of the rich guys likes to kidnap poor children and sell them to strangers, the British in this film. I am shocked to know that this movie was a hit in some parts of India, otherwise the Super Flop in the UK, USA and Australia. I am from the UK and these kinds of things make me sick, I should not be released in the UK.
