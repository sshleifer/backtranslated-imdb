Superdome is one of those movies that makes you wonder why it was made. The intrigue concerns someone who tries to sabotage the owl and all attempts to stop it. How you managed to survive the career of Tom Selleck and Donna Mills is beyond me. However, the most frustrating thing was that there was NOT A FOOTBALL in them! Avoid this if possible.
