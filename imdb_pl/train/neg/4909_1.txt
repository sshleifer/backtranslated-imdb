That's right, you heard me. I'm a big fan of James Patterson. I have 10 of his books and read the whole series about Lindsey Boxer. In my opinion, the screenwriter should be shot. <br /> <br /> What kind of film maker had the right to kill the frightening work of fiction and make him a mockery of a mysterious genre? If I ever thought Harry Potter was murdered, Michael O'Hara proved I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I can only pray that the next scriptwriter who can handle this wonderful book would do a lot more justice. Michael O'Hara and Russell Mulcahy: do not give up your day job.
