Hubert Selby Jr. he gave us the book "Requiem For A Dream" and co-wrote the script for Aronofsky's film. This film has been successful at every level, providing an intimate and impartial portrait of the horrors of life of heroes and defects that have destroyed them. "Last Exit To Brooklyn" still has an addiction and multiple characters living in a sad life, but it does not do it as well as Aronofsky. <br /> <br /> The movie sometimes seems ridiculously anti-gay. Especially when homosexuality means death in the film. One of the homosexuals is stoned, he is shot in the sky by a speeding car and he lands dead on the sidewalk. Another is crucified, and more are beaten. Another exaggerated shock value that could be convincing if it was done well are the scenes of trade union workers literally struggling with strike breakers. Who would have thought that the Brooklyn drama would contain sequences of action and explosions of trucks? <br /> <br /> The director, Uli Edel, has a skill level similar to that of a television director, but it is much lower than real cinema. The film is clumsy, which does not even seem to prejudge the genre. Lake gets a useless role that any mannequin could fill, and Baldwin seems only to know how to look stupid in his equally modest part. And then comes Jennifer Jason Leigh as our leading, nasty whore named Tralala (believe it or not, I'm not joking). Her performance is not big, and the fate of her character is at least dirty. Poor use of color and composition makes it look cheaper than it is, and also takes the "real" edge from more provocative bits. Defeat.
