VAMPYRES <br /> <br /> Image format: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: Mono <br /> <br /> The driver (Murray Brown) is lured to a secluded village house inhabited by two beautiful young women (Marianne Morris and Anulka) and become entangled in their free sexual lifestyle, but his hosts turn out to be vampires with crazy lust for human blood ... <br /> <br /> Given the cycle of lesbian vampires initiated by an independent director Jean Rollin in France and consolidated by the success of the Carmilla series Hammer in the UK, brave shocking Jose Ramon Larraz VAMPYRES moved the concept of adult horror much further than the British censors were ready to tolerate in 1974, and his film was shortened by almost three minutes after the original British edition. It is not difficult to understand why! Larraz (who wrote the screenplay under the pseudonym "D. Daubeney"), using the gothic motif as a pretext for such high nudity, sex and bloodshed, as the short duration of the film allows, uses these commercial elements as an ordinary background for a sluggish meditation on life , deaths and impulses - sexual and other - that confirm the human condition. <br /> <br /> Filmed in place in a picturesque country house in the fall of 1973, the haunted photos of Harry Waxman evoke an atmosphere of grim premonition, in which the deserted area - equally bleak and beautiful - seems to herald the vortex of the coming horror movie (Larraz he made a similar trick earlier that year using SYMPTOMS, a low-key thriller, which in the final will explode with madness of violence) roll). However, despite their pretensions, the VAMPYRES 'thin plot and raw production values ​​will immediately separate the audience, and while the two characters are as charismatic and attractive as you might wish, the masculine clue (Brown, after his age) during the filming) he is pitifully mistaken in a role that should have hit a beautiful twenty-something. An indispensable element for cult fans of the film, a fun curiosity for everyone, VAMPYRES is a taste. Watch out for the Bessie Love super-star in a short episode at the end of the movie.
