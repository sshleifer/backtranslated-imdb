I've never seen a comedy that would be so hard to sit ... not one laugh. Ok, maybe one giggle for Michael Clarke Duncan a bit like a big, black, bald virgin gay. But the rest was shockingly unpleasant. In addition to the lack of laughter, the "skits" last forever! Avoid this if you value your time and money. HORRIBLE!!! The worst !!!
