*** LEKKIE SPOILERY *** <br /> <br /> A humpbacked 15-year-old boy kisses a very cute 15-year-old girl and eventually does sex for the first time. After the act, he lays on the bed without touching it. The next day he comes to the conclusion that he does not like sex and does not want to try it again for at least a few years. <br /> <br /> This is a seemingly good start of a teleplay about a boy discovering his homosexuality, or maybe a medical drama about a teenager after puberty with severe hormone deficiency. <br /> <br /> However, as the story unfolds, the story of a 15-year-old father appears, supported and supported by his overbearing mother. <br /> <br /> At some point his mother tells his colleagues who are not as forgiving as they can be: "At every step, my son was amazing. ... I have never been more proud of him ... "<br /> <br /> The older sister of a young father who is otherwise cold towards his brother, begins to show pride in his siblings:" because he gives him encouraging warm embrace. <br /> <br /> A 15-year-old father wants to become a father. I want to be a parent. <br /> <br /> Why not? The "new" baby is seen a few minutes after birth - it seems to be a healthy, happy four-month-old child. Just like children were born on TV in the 1960s and 1970s. <br /> <br /> When a young father is a parent, he found happiness. He claims that he will change the dirty diaper. We see a 15-year-old father sincerely holding his child while the teenager is busy = mother over his shoulder. Decay in black.
