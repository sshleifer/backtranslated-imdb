When I heard about "Down To Earth" for the first time, I was very excited. I'm a big fan of Chris Rock, he was especially funny at Dogma. But this movie turned out to be a disappointment. Chris Rock's performance was not as good as his previous performances, and the film was simply very badly aimed as a whole. <br /> <br /> First, Chris Rock. He plays the whole movie as a standard comedy. Of course, it works well in scenes where it should standup, but in the rest of the movie it is not. Even when talking to another character, it seems that he thinks he's trying to make people laugh. He has some fun moments, but usually they appear in stand-up scenes (no wonder they decided that his character would become a comedian). As for the rest of the cast, they're just there to give Rock somebody to talk to, none of them stand out. <br /> <br /> Also the movie was badly targeted. The film is basically the story of one joke: an old white guy behaves like a young black comedian. Although I prefer movies with more than one joke, it still could work and it was quite fun. The problem was that we saw too much Rock and not enough old white guy. It's supposed to be fun because it's a white guy telling Chris Rock's jokes, but most of the time we only see Chris Rock, so it's not so much fun. A few scenes where they decide to show us a white guy who talks like Rock is actually funny. If it was shown to him more, the movie would be much more fun. <br /> <br /> In general, a few moments of laughter can not compensate for the fact that "Down To Earth" is poorly maintained and poorly targeted. It was a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4/10
