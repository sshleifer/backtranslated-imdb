I was really scared by this amazing movie. What an extraordinary dark atmosphere. And such a frightening musical result. Really promising! Indeed, after ten minutes you really start to sweat and you feel uncomfortable, because you start to fear the worst. This movie has the atmosphere of a real nightmare, and what's worse, everything goes out. For an hour and a half I tried to fight with total boredom and fall asleep, but the monstrous soundtrack did not let me fall asleep. Nuit Noire is a really frightening image - for your eyes, your ears, your intelligence, and above all: your wallet, because the thought of spending valuable money on a cinema ticket for this cheap amateur home is the biggest horror of all.
