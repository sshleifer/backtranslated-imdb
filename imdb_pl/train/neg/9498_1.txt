When I am looking for new cars, I expect that boats will not be shown. When I drink a cola fountain, I should expect the drink to contain cola. When I watch a movie that beautifies with the name of a perfect scientist, I expect it to be appropriate for that person or her work. It could be people discussing my grandmother's diary. This material is important only because it vaguely torments science. I fell asleep for the first time when I tried to look at him and for the second time I stopped watching him. <br /> <br /> I love learning and documentary films. I'd rather watch them on the latest hit. However, this is not enough to provide something worth your time? Avoid at all costs.
