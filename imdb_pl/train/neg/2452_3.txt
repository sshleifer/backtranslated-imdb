Recently, watching this, I found out how sincerely they tried to bring the book to the screen, even if modest budget and inept actors meant unavoidable failure. Any objective measure was a disaster, but it was easy to imagine how good the Lord of the Rings movie could be if someone would do it honestly - and for the money to hire the most talented artists and screenwriters. Unfortunately, thanks to Jackson, it will not be possible for a long time. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie has left me with the impression that with any budget this story simply could not be stuffed up. Fantasy provides so many opportunities to make an interesting movie. There were many moments in this movie that were potentially more interesting than the way that Peter Jackson did, though of course you always have to use your imagination for bad executions. For example, the way they tried to show the world of ghosts from Frodo's point of view. Or the way Galadriel showed Sam what's going on at home for another. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I really appreciate in this version - silent moments. There were moments in which they talked about a dialogue without a musical background against the ever-receding. Compare this with the impressive Jackson movie camera and the intrusive score that seemed designed to highlight how each scene was the most moving and powerful scene we've ever seen. Jackson's films were full of meaning, it was quieter and much more modest. <br /> <br /> Jackson and colleagues have achieved more than $ 270 million in production costs, at least $ 90 million more in marketing, a huge tax break from the NZ government, and huge savings from filming in NZ, not in the US. However, despite marketing claims, the intention to be faithful has never existed. This is well documented. Philippa Boyens said the same in an interview when she said that they deliberately did not read the books before writing the script. Jackson also stated that they originally intended to create a fantasy film "like the" lord of the rings, and the one he really wanted to do was the Return of the King, because he had many battles, but he did not have character development. <br /> <br /> In contrast, this movie tried to be more real. Of course, many things were wrong, the acting was terrible and almost everything was sunk and the pace was too fast. Naturally, many cut out and adapt other scenes, and deserve recognition. While Jackson added many action scenes that did not serve the purpose of the story, Bakshi cut scenes from books that did not go any further. In fact, at the beginning there is a strange similarity between the structure of Jackson and Bakshi movies - in the same sense, they both deviate from the original books - although of course some of them may be a coincidence. <br /> <br /> It was not a good movie, but the potential was. Bakshi said in an interview with the Onion AV club that only animation can do justice to the lord of the rings. His version did not work, but he could be right.
