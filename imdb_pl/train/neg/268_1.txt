1 How is it that everyone understands perfectly well without devices such as universal translators or microbes translators? Did the creators of this program realize that people who were taken from various parts of the earth, in different time frames (Attilla the Hun was not contemporary in the Hellenic pre-liter cultures, and the Vikings were not modern pyramid builders) speak different languages ​​and can never to develop a language so similar to modern English (with the exception of inflection, which they "do not" use) influenced by Latin, ancient Greek, Danish and French? <br /> <br /> 2 Cultural differences can not be overcome so easily, you have to gain trust, but wherever the team comes, they are welcome without suspicion and start ordering people around as if they were their designated leaders. Of course, real fans comment that they are seen as gods. The people they meet should be shocked by their technology and accuse them of witchcraft and the like. <br /> <br /> 3 Historical background: missing. Visually, it may look a bit like a Greek or Viking culture, but everyone can dress up with a few tablecloths or go to a local costume rental company for a plastic helmet with horns and claim it looks like a part. The small theater group probably has better props. <br /> <br /> 4 boring! Another lame production of Canuck, which inexplicably ran over ten long years. As kids show they can do that, but anyone who has little knowledge about human behavior and language can not stand up to the first twelve episodes of season 1, as I did. I really wanted to believe that I found a decent science fiction program, otherwise I would have closed it and cleaned my computer from that shelter after the first five minutes!
