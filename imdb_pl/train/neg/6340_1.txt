This is the movie I'm most afraid of. Arrogant and irresponsible, he presents a sketch of the Colombian conflict so dingy and stupid that it is an insult to all Colombians. The performances are genes, from Grisales (her naked scene is absolutely pathetic), to Bejarano, to Fanny Mickey (which looks good from Tim Burton's nightmare), to Díaz, who makes a significant effort to revive the figure so -dimensional, so cliched and so badly written everything that was left for him to work, is a mustache. Not to mention unreasonable ending, the festivity was so shoddy that it would make Ed Wood cringe. It does not work in every respect, cinematography, directing, costumes, makeup, editing, and above all directing, Jorge Alí Triana has always been a poor filmmaker, but at least his previous films had some dignity. I can not say anything good about this waste of money, except that I hope Colombian filmmakers will learn about honesty, integrity and responsibility because of this evil intent.
