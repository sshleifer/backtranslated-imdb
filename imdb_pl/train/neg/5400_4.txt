This is just a short event in full swing, based on the story of Stephen King. Two tabloid journalists, one experienced (Miguel Ferrer) and one not very successful (Julie Entwisle), start to believe that a serial killer (Michael H. Moss) can be a vampire. More strange than the fact that the modern bloodsucker does not move naturally but uses black Cessna to look for its victims. Gore actually becomes macabre because the film is approaching the stupid final. Remember that Mr. King had nothing to do with this film. I admit that it is a bit scary in the early hours of the night.
