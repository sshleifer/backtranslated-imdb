If you like occasional nudity with a spanking comedy in middle school, look no further. <br /> <br /> Starting from about half the way, Arielle Dombasle, beautiful and erotic, begins to hang around at every opportunity. This is the only thing that made this movie worth watching. <br /> <br /> History is both lame and ridiculous, humor is trivial, and character development does not exist.
