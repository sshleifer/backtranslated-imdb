STUDIO 666 (also known as THE POSSESSED in the UK) is another sub-par slasher that has the look of a movie straight to DVD. <br /> <br /> While many simple DVD movies are fast-paced or unintentionally funny in as bad as it is good, STUDIO 666 is a deplorable failure. <br /> <br /> At the time of writing, each comment on the first page contains a negative rating and a negative opinion. Each of these people hit the nail on the head. <br /> <br /> Two people (at the time of writing) who wrote comments with a grade of 10 per 10 should not be taken seriously. Of course, they have seen a few films and have an even more limited understanding of the horror. <br /> <br /> The only positive point I can make about this movie is that it's better than THE CHOKE and ONE of them, two extremely mediocre movies that I would not like to have on my worst enemy! <br /> <br /> The story of this movie had to be made hundreds, if not thousands of times. The film has only a slight turnaround (and one that is badly supported) to the usual expectations. The depressed singer commits suicide. Soon after, her spirit returns to possess one of her surviving friends. The possessed friend is crazy. The rest of the story is really too strange to sum it up. You will have to see it with your own eyes, provided that your interest has not diminished to the point that it has expired. <br /> <br /> Acting in the film is mostly very weak. The actress who played Dora was an exception. Her character was always interesting and seductive when she was on the screen. It helps to raise the film beyond similar modern efforts. Unfortunately, some of the lines she was told were misspelled to put it in a gentle manner and prevent her from saving the film. <br /> <br /> The direction was just as weak. The villains did not seem the least threatening, each killing was completely devoid of tension and tension, the atmosphere did not exist, and the work with the camera was incredibly simple. Some special effects (if you can call them that) reminded me of the TV series GHOST STORIES. Unfortunately for the producers of this movie, GHOST STORIES intelligently wrote scripts, credible performances and perfectly used camera angles. Maybe if the producers closely watched this series, they would choose more techniques that could save this excuse for the movie! <br /> <br /> Music is completely unadapted to the tone of the movie. It's just rock music, not the best examples of this type. Do not start this horrible song at the beginning! <br /> <br /> Some aspects of the film, especially dialogue, are involuntarily ridiculous. Unfortunately, they are not fun enough to move the movie (or it should be down) to a level so bad that it is good. <br /> <br /> In general, STUDIO 666 is a mundane average slasher with very few noteworthy aspects. I recommend this only to those who are fans of movies straight to DVD and want to see every single slasher ever made.
