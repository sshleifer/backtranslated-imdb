I used to think that "The Stoned Age" was the worst movie ever made ... I was wrong. "Hobgoblins" surpassed him in every possible way and a few could not. In "The Stoned Age" I hated the character. In Hobgoblins, I hated actors ... and all others involved in creating this cruelty. I will not turn on the teaser for this movie, I'm not that cruel. I could not give innocent people like myself. In fact, any discussion about this movie is pointless and humiliating. The words I would use to describe this movie are as bland, asinine and ingenious. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, PLEASE do not watch this movie. I am begging you, from one movie lover to another ... no, from one man to another, PLEASE. Because of your own mental health and intellect, they DO NOT PAY ATTENTIONS. Destroy all copies you encounter.
