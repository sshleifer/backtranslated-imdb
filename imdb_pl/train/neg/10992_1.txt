Underground Comedy Movie is probably the worst train wrecks I've ever seen. Fortunately, I did not pay for this movie, and my friend reluctantly agreed to see him again, stating that he was so horrible, but he had to prove to me how terrible it was. I love the colorful comedy. I came to the conclusion that at least it will be and I will play. No, instead the acting was so awful, the "jokes" were extremely bad, and the plot could not be found. Maybe there should not be a conspiracy, so I can not oppose this movie. It's quite sad when the funniest thing about the comedy is an old woman with a batman's head ... by Batman ... A man wearing a baseball uniform with a baseball bat. Cheerful. Just brilliant. I have the impression that I am watching this movie, which was created by its creators and laughed hysterically with friends. Perhaps it was full of internal jokes, which we simply do not understand. Or maybe it's the worst piece of trash ever made and it should be locked up in the vault and abandoned in the Arctic Ocean. <br /> <br /> P.S. Do not buy this movie!
