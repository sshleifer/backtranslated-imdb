All you really need to know about this movie is the opening scene in which the guy falls into the lake and gets eaten. Then they start to draw titles: You see "Snails!" In large letters, and soon after "The Movie". Whew! I was worried that I accidentally tuned in to "Slugs: The Musical" or "Slugs: The Game Show". In any case, since then, the film has deteriorated as a festival. You see how the guy cut off his hand because he had snails in a gardening glove, two people are attacked by snails during sex, and a girl falling on her back in an underground passage is killed by deadly snails. This is quite a stupid movie, belonging to the category "yes-bad-is-good". It is also so poorly shot with such a grainy movie that you are shocked when you learned that it was made in 1988 (I suppose it was 1974). I am VERY surprised that he has obtained such a high result as here, because most people here do not give films any love. But if you want a movie that tries to be frightening but ends up funny, this is one of your main candidates.
