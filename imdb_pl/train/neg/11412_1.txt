This movie is so bad, you can not imagine. Acting is terrible, even worse than in third-grade soap operas. It is a pity that this film has been the most successful in the last 20 years in Switzerland. Interactions between soldiers did not make any sense at all. The story could have been taken out of the daring photojournalism, the dialogues were as wooden as the Treebearer, and the holes in the plot were larger than the black hole in the center of our galaxy. But currently, he does not need much to please the audience. The actors were handsome, for example the former Miss Switzerland and the main character was even suspended (woah !!) and there was certainly a lot of drug abuse. He is a really cool man! Especially for teenagers aged 12 and 13. But the media created an atmosphere in which you were not allowed to reject the movie because they manipulated the dynamics of the peer group, indirectly saying that you are a sucker if you do not go along with other "sheep" and say. That's exactly what it was like when I was in the army / this is exactly what I intend to do when I have to go to the army ... for any bad action that was related to drugs and cold. And do not think I like the army. I was there and I hated it, but this movie is worse than cleaning a sticky toilet with a toothbrush (which I had to do because I offended the lieutenant). It is not necessary for every movie to be sophisticated. Sometimes you just want to play for a few hours and forget about problems and I think it's not a bad thing. But these kinds of movies affect teenagers by showing them a cool lifestyle that is actually just stupid and turns them into mindless ignorant and egocentric idiots. But because now that my opinion is not very popular, I will be quiet now and I recommend that you avoid this terrible flutter at all costs and to save cunning! <br /> <br /> 2/10 <br /> <br /> (sorry for my bad English)
