Man, there are many good reviews in the review books. Honestly, I thought it was too slow and unpleasant from the very beginning. I waited until I picked up some steam, but it never happened. This movie is very overrated. <br /> <br /> Shakespeare with King James English I have never liked it, so it may be me. In the first half of the movie there are quite a lot of them, because they show that Ronald Colman plays the role of Othello. <br /> <br /> The advantages of the film are - thanks to the restored print - some decent pictures and young, slim and attractive Shelly Winters. <br /> <br /> In general, it's just too boring, too many repetitions in some scenes to watch them again. Besides, we all know that most of the actors are by any chance nutty, but Hollywood is for showing it here in this story.
