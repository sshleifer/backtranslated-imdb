I love the killer. Insect movies are great to watch, I had to watch this movie because it was one of my favorite horror films by Shun Hutton. <br /> <br /> I met him and I would like to hear how this movie was awful, as he said, after he said that I'm still dying to see how bad it is. <br /> <br /> Plot: People die mysteriously and terribly, and no one has any idea what the cause is. <br /> <br /> Only health care worker Mike Brady has a possible solution, but his theory of deadly snails is ridiculed by the authorities. <br /> <br /> It's only when the body starts to get up and the snails expert starts to sniff, does it all start to look like Mike has the right idea. <br /> <br /> This movie is the most moving movie you've ever seen! The tracks in this movie are fast (then normal) and it looks like they are scrolling through the scenes! <br /> <br /> This movie is nothing like a book, the book was ten times more terrifying, ten times worse and had many more stories! <br /> <br /> I did not like this movie at all! As I am a huge fan of Åšlimaki, a book and a second book called Hodowla ziemi! Both books are great <br /> <br /> Read the book, then watch the movie, maybe you'll like it more than me Give it 2 out of 10
