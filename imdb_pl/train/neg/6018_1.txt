The sad thing is that Christians (and I'm one) feel that we have to make films like "Left Behind". We have much better stories to tell, which do not have to be so informative. I was very disappointed with this film. As an ambitious filmmaker who believes in Christ, I see this film as a perfect example of what I will not do with my film career.
