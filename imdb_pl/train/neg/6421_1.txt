I am surprised by some reviews of this film. The only place that seems to be telling the truth is RottenTomatoes.com. This movie is horrible. The plot is extremely lazy. This is not too scary. People who think that because Sarah Michelle Geller is playing, somehow the Grudge should forget about it. This film is more like Dark Water, but it is even more predictable and slower than it is. I was very disappointed with this film. It did not frighten me or interest me. Let's face it, this type of conspiracy was flogged at this stage, for example, the dead trying to contact the living - Dragonfly, What Lies Beneath, Ghost Story, Dark Water, Darkness, The Changeling etc.etc. It seems to me that the only ones who currently write original horrors are the Japanese and Koreans. Movies that come from Hollywood, like this, are cynical exercises in making money without a little respect for the viewer. They are simply thrown away
