Although nothing can match the Vampires Vs. Zombie ... I will try to evaluate this film in every area of ​​film making. <br /> <br /> First, the special effects were breathtaking. When the TV screen exploded, I thought my whole house would explode, and when automatic machine guns were fired, I thought the shells were lying on the floor next to me. Just stunning my friends. <br /> <br /> But the scene in which Jack Black sounds like the worst monologue I've ever heard, I almost killed myself, but do not worry, because there was a film involved that can convey its horrible actions to "I have to be tall" . Seriously, he had to watch her mindlessly mumble about inconsistent thoughts that make absolutely no sense and simply added that he must be "high" to justify his horrible behavior. Well, if you can say that you justify terrible acting, then if you talk to writers, directors, executive producers, sponsors, you'll probably get the same answer ... seriously. <br /> <br /> With a production team called "Shock-o-rama" I was shocked that I did not put a rifle in my mouth and ended my life after a shockingly awful excuse for the film was reproduced. <br /> <br /> If you want to see this movie, so you should be murdered <br /> <br /> Pozdrawiam, <br /> <br /> General
