This movie is simply bad. Poor story, poor direction and below the average game. The thing that really annoyed me was the glaring advertisement - constantly - for a well-known internet provider. It is obvious that some scenes are written for this purpose, advertising. This film is a slap for anyone who paid for it. <br /> <br /> Do not watch it, it's not worth your time.
