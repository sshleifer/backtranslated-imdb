My result for this shit: 1/10 1 only for technical reasons. Everything else is very bad. <br /> <br /> Another movie that does not make sense. Apparently, it seems that creating a good screenplay for a movie or television is an almost impossible mission. <br /> <br /> Although it is easy to understand why politicians never tell the truth, they are among the greatest liars in the world, it is difficult to understand how to make films so pathetic. <br /> <br /> We must believe that taking people for morons. Perhaps that was the reason to believe, because 99% of movies are nonsense. Because they are stupid and funny and very bad scenarios. <br /> <br /> When we look at the price we give Oscars, we understand better why we're still making movies more ridiculous than others. <br /> <br /> And what's strange, there was always money for such nonsense. But it was not about education and health. <br /> <br /> If you still want to listen to this, press the Super Fast Forward button (at least 20X).
