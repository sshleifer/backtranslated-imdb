In the HOME of SPIRITS there is enough star power to create another galaxy, but the end product is quite controversial. The film and its messages are very noble and I think most would agree with them. (Liberal democracy, good, brutal fascist regime, open mind, good racism, etc.). Unfortunately, we are battered from head to toe, and so much subtlety is used, as I described it. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, we were watched by very noble people, without any scruples with nasty morons who have no beneficial qualities. It radiates the tension of a poorly organized "wrestling" match. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Irons plays the patron, a man of many contradictions. Meryl Streep as his talented bride and Glenn Close as her sister-in-law. When the camera stays with these people, the film tends to move and is quite pleasant. Unfortunately, the GHOST HOUSE simply engages in too many sub-threads, and the characters jump out of the picture like shooting goals. We do not recognize them, that's why we do not care about them. The result is boredom. <br /> <br /> If Bille August, the director and screenwriter (from Isabel Allende's book) would lengthen the movie or cut off a few characters, this movie could work completely. At the moment it was a nice attempt, with nice messages and bonecrushing yawnfest. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
