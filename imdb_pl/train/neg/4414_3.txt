Christopher Durang must have been taught by a terribly nun who is dreadful because he simply can not abandon this concept. The play "Sister Mary Ignatius explains everything for you" was presented - at least in Hollywood - in exactly the same tone as the scenes from Diane Keaton's lectures. Sister Maria was an exaggeration, a lampoon, a bitter satire of a cheerful self-confidence, a doctrinaire and a highly-judging nun-and like Lynn Redgrave, she was hilarious. But the film emphasizes that we take this exaggeration absolutely seriously - while, as mentioned, keeping the same tone in the scenes "explains everything". These two approaches collide forward and for the last twenty minutes the film disappears from the track, submerges into the ravine and explodes. There are no survivors. It could work if the tone of the scenes with four former students and their meeting with sister Maria were broken like the scenes of Maria's sister. Or if the scenes of Sister Mary were presented more realistically. This simply does not work.
