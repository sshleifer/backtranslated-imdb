Yesterday was Earth Day (April 22, 2009) In the United States and other countries, and I went to see the full-length movie version of "Earth" DisneyNature. I guess, like car makers, Disney is trying to convince us that they care about the planet. Maybe they're really looking after the planet, I do not know, but I do not think it's a special unit with the word 'nature'. I know that my youngest daughter loves Mickey Mouse, and who am I to tell a year-long story of my life about Disney? <br /> <br /> In addition to amazing photos, it was a typical dislike for Disney. Preceded by half dozen teasers of Disney movies, rich with Disney stereotypes ("circle of life", "fall with style"), dramatic music, recycled material (Disney claims that "40% of new recordings"). I even began to think that James Earl Jones's narrative becomes a bit boring. I like James Earl Jones, but his work for Disney and Morgan Freeman in every Warner Brothers narrative begins to diminish. I really think Disney bought pictures of BBC nature that were so spectacularly made, felt that they would sell if they hit the orchestral music and recognizable sounds. <br /> <br /> And what is Disney's obsession with showing predators chasing and killing small animals? There were half a dozen such scenes, along with bleeding youngsters on the verge of pulling their throats out. I think Disney has to recognize that animals have a rich and interesting life beyond the battles of life and death that appeal to teenagers-oriented action movies that have been drawn into the film by their parents. I was also aware of how Disney refrained from suggesting that humans have something to do with climate change. Are they so afraid of a small minority denying that they think it is still a controversial topic? <br /> <br /> I recommend omitting this and renting Blue Planet DVD on Netflix. Nature films seem to be the best performed by the British.
