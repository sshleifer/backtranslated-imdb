After the mob boss Vic Moretti (late great Anthony Franciosa) kills his lady who cheats on him with Derek, their new chauffeur / vet from Vietnam, and blames him for a poor man, Derek is in prison, where he has to deal with a corrupt chief, brother of Vic's prisoner who leads the prison, and, oh, illegal experiments carried out by a suspicious CIA agent (a great mainstay of the genre and the first time John Saxon) to transform different prisoners into super-human invincible zombies. Of course, things get out of control and it depends on Derek and the rest of the unchanged prisoners to save the day after the infected took over the prison. <br /> <br /> John Saxon is a great talented actor and as a director, Saxon is ... a great talented actor. To say that this movie (the only current John's guide) does not have a certain visual talent, it would be a bit unsaid. However, the movie is not completely worthless. Dialogue, though idiotic, is bad enough that it can sometimes be humorous. Unfortunately, this is not enough for the film to appear on it itself, and the film lasts even forever (which is quite late in the film). Therefore, the most I can recommend this movie is that if you are a Saxon fan (which I really am), it is worth one watch, just go into low expectations and you should be ok. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dana Lis Mason and Tane McClure get topless <br /> <br /> My class: D +
