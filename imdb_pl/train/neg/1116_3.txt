This film seems to be an exercise for the Coppola family. It seems that it is not known whether it should be a western "A" or "B". That is to say, the hero is called Hopalong Cassidy for God's sake. William Boyd must be in the grave. <br /> <br /> All western plates "B" are here. Bipolar, pearl serrated hero in a white hat with a faithful steed ("C'mon Thunder"), black bearded villain, heroine in danger, rancher in trouble, cowardly sheriff, on top of bad guys, etc. <br /> <br /> Acting with a few exceptions, is closely related to the Yakima Canutt School of Acting. Chris Lybbert (who?) As a hero and Louis Schweibert (who?) As a villain they look like they were at home in a 30-year-old "Poverty Row". An addition to the cast of performance veterans of Martin Sheen, Robert Carradine, Clu Gulager and Will Hutchins helps a bit, but it is not enough for them to save this one. <br /> <br /> What was the meaning of this Martin Sheen / Robert Carradine framing sequences? Are we to believe that Sheen was a ghost? What was the purpose of the black gloves? It just did not make sense. <br /> <br /> Being a great fan of westerns from all genres, I tried to find some advantages of this film. The photos were very good and the settings looked very authentic. Apart from the hero and the main villain, other characters looked authentic. <br /> <br /> If the producers were going to resurrect the character of Hopalong Cassidy, they might consider presenting it as it was originally written - a frustrated dirty ranch hand with a chip on the shoulder, a kind of part in which Lee Marvin would aim. <br /> <br /> What else can I say, but ... on Thunder, on a big guy.
