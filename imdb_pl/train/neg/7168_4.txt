The writer came up with a pretty decent idea for the story, but many of the errors in the story were so different from the film that you could hardly see it. The basic elements, such as character development, were transparent at best. Inconsistencies were also raised by their ugly heads. A huge residence in the middle of a rural Irish village? Characters just "appear" in the gardens during a stormy night (at very convenient times, I can add)? In total, it was not "bad". I rated it 4, mainly based on the history and talent of Alison Elliott.
