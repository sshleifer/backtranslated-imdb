This series is getting worse. Badly written and simply not funny! The assumption is perfect, but the translator's lack of experience translates. Trying to offend anyone so badly, they offend everyone. In the second season desperate guests stopped waving their hands and resorted to a condescending, self-satisfied style of "Oh, silly you", which does not have a laughter scenario. They roll their eyes and shake their heads, as if to say: are we not crazy? Is not that funny? Well, no, it is not. Gum disease is less painful. No wonder, except for Corner Gas, Canadians generally avoid Canadian television. Come on CBC, you'll probably be our leading station presenting the best Canadian talents. Pull the plug out of this amateur mess.
