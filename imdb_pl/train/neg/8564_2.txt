The film itself is so pathetic. He depicted the deaf as cynical about listening to people. It is true that some deaf people are wary of dating people, but they are not necessarily bad for Marlee Matlin in all of history. Deaf people do not go to the bar and do not dance as Matlin did. In total, the movie itself is more boring than pathetic. It's so boring that I would like to believe that this movie is cured of insomnia. If I have a sleep problem, I can just jump into the Children of the lesser God and observe. It will put me to sleep. <br /> <br /> Remember, it's a deaf guy.
