Some illegal so-called asylum seeker comes to Stuttgart and states that Germany is "racist". <br /> <br /> This is just another forgotten nugget steaming a long list of anti-German propaganda films after World War II, the aim of which is to make the Germans feel "bad" for not greeting anyone degenerated in their country can chase German blondes and sell drugs to German teenagers. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for good German films in general, see "Der Tunnel", "Der Untergang", "Europa Europa" and "Lola rennt. "<br /> <br /> But not that. <br /> <br /> Also "Das Experiment" with the same male actor from "Lola rennt".
