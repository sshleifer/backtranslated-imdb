Not only did the story of this movie be invented with ease, in which two psychos are able to kidnap a pregnant woman, without interrupting the sweat, but it was a terrible scuffle of "Misery". However, the main reason why I gave this film such a low rating was that it absolutely disgusted me. <br /> <br /> I am not someone who is shocked by what the filmmakers are giving away and always loved the horror of the cinema, but this movie has gone too far in terms of violence and torture just to gain points in the shock factor. <br /> <br /> I think that most people, watching the first ten minutes of "Hide and Seek", will be within range of the pilot.
