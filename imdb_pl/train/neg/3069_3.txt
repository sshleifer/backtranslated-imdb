Yuck! And again I say ... YUCK! The original version of this film was a well-made story of a man who was already dead and was traveling through purgatory. The original movie had a lot to say and did nothing to say it. And he had a naked cane on a motorcycle. <br /> <br /> This version seems to me something that the producer bought right, and then abandoned it due to lack of interest. It seems that a group of people consciously decided to fit it to the nineties and changed their ethnicity and sex so that it would be sweet. The film is not about burnout, which will commit suicide in the last act of rebellion. It's about a man trying to get to the hospital to see his wife. <br /> <br /> There was no reason why this movie was supposed to be done differently than to piss me off
