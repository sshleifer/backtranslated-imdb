I will tell you where it is, and I will say that Linda Fiorentino gives a good performance as a drinking actress who does what she wants. She is bold, sassy, ​​hard and very sexy; it is much better than it deserves. <br /> <br /> But this is IT. This blunt film of suspense is a fragmented mess, trying immediately to become a thriller of persecutors, a murder thriller, a tale of loyalty and betrayal, and an exciting erotic thriller. Film, my friends, is not exciting at all. <br /> <br /> For example, who thought about filling C. Thomas Howell as a desirable leading man? It is not ugly, but for crying loudly, it seems that hard Fiorentino cookies do this with a kindergarten teacher. Howell has no authority or presence on the screen to fill the role of a leader. <br /> <br /> The screenplay is by far the worst aspect of the movie. There is no tension when the Fiorentino character gets amazing phone calls, there is no secret about her guilt in the murders on which the film focuses, there is no sense of liberation, because Fiorentino loses Howell's nerves to lose inhibition. <br /> Look for interesting but poorly realized scenes with Adam Ant and Issac Hayes and one really good sex scene between Howell and Fiorentino. Besides, my first impulse would be to put this pathetic waste bin and rent something else.
