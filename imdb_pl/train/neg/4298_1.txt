Unbelievably confused, repulsive and ultimately ridiculous ("horses, oh my God, horses!") Thriller. Sometimes it is frightening, but it has one of the worst scenarios written for horror. See how in the last 10 minutes everyone "magically" does exactly what the story needs to do to make "resolution" happen. Bland appearances of the leading, typically eccentric Richard Lynch. Video streaming is a real job that cuts scenes in half and makes the video even harder to understand. 0 out of 4 stars.
