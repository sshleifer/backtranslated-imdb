I'm sure there is some kind of IMDB cult that likes movies that MST3K made fun of. After watching this and "Werewolf" and reading dozens of comments about how excited they are, I found out that there was a conspiracy going on. Many people say that people who hate it are "just afraid of gore", "I do not know good horror" or similar things. Well, I do not care about gore, but I want SOMETHING to happen in the movie! Most are just a wife sitting and looking around! Or walking around the house / garden! The film requires something to give it a climate, you will not get it just pointless scenes when someone walks and looks. Oh, and "It makes you think"? Yes, I thought "MOVE! YOU @ # $ 0 &% !! "One of the worst horror movies I've ever had! <br /> <br /> P.s. As a reminder, I am a huge fan of the old horror style, Dracula, Frankenstein, that kind of thing.
