This movie was bad because there was nothing interesting about it. It was a remake, but on the other hand, not really. I was very disappointed considering the tools that Tim Burton has at his disposal. He had great makeup and CGI and a lot of money (100 million dollars), but can you honestly say that what we got was as good as the original movie, which was produced for less than $ 6 million? Certainly not. Therefore, the movie fails. <br /> <br /> At least in the original movie, the Statue of Liberty scene was shocking, but in this movie there was nothing shocking, not even the final scene, because you could see it coming. By the way, if you think a little while I did it, you can find out how it can end. I just want to have the time I've wasted thinking about it. <br /> <br /> This movie would be great and fun if it stayed according to the first movie and accepted the part "Beneath the Planet of the Monkey". Here's how I would write it: <br /> <br /> Astronaut (it really should be something more than Mark Mark, because he's not good enough to worry about the movie himself, so I'd put three guys in) that he would land on something what they would consider a different planet, meet people (not silent), city ruled by monkeys, hunted, befriended some good monkeys, discovered that they are on earth by finding destroyed ruins, finally bumping into crazy mutated people living underground, explodes a war between mutated people and monkeys, and then ... well, let your imagination go crazy about how you want to end it. <br /> <br /> But I mean, there could have been more in this film. Unfortunately, Tim Burton really knows how to destroy a good thing. Think about what he did with the Batman series. He is a broken director, inspired by what people think. It's trendy, so it must be good, go thinking. Sorry but no. If anybody else made this film, it would be much better and much more satisfying.
