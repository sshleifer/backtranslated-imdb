Bad description of the lie on the cover, "fun like an American cake", my girlfriend and I sat in front of the TV, waiting for the comedy ... and it definitely is not one. You probably will not laugh if you're not one of those little minds like Jackass. It's not even an erotic movie that would at least be something, considering it's about sex ... <br /> <br /> So what is it? The unpredictable story is about a guy who wants to lose his virginity (zero in originality, I remember "Losing" for one) and his gang of friends. The rest of the character (ie Girl) just comes and goes without a credible reason. Come on, there are even Dwarves (so simple: "Dwarves are fun ho ho" ...) Acting is very similar to TV (like video in the whole movie) and definitely amateur for most girls ... <br /> < br /> A horrible movie. Amateur, badly produced, and above all NOT FUNNY. Children and adolescents love to watch them with friends because of sexual curses and jokes. Also, do not even think about borrowing this movie.
