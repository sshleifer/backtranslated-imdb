I usually like these movies. It's a documentary style, but acting and writing are just awful. Acting is wooden and stiff, and writing is so trivial, but not in a good way. As for writing this, I'm surprised that it is 5.2 / 10 on IMDb. I am sure that most of these voices must come from relatives of people from the film. I suppose if that's the case, you can deal with a few laughs because it's always fun when your relatives / friends make a movie. Well, I think in a sense, it gives hope to all writers, directors, actors, etc. Because if they can do it, you can do it. Although maybe you should not.
