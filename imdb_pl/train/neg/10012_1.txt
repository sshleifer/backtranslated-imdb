This film must be compatible with the most boring movie for years. Even Woody Harrison can not save this movie from falling down. <br /> <br /> Murder in this movie is to be of interest to this film, but it is not, nothing is interesting. The cast is not bad, but the script is just awful, I just sat in complete astonishment during this movie, thinking how someone can find this movie funny <br /> <br /> The producers of this movie were very clever. They made a boring movie, but they hid it well with the names of good actors and actresses on their cast. People will go to the blockbuster and will probably see this movie and think: Woody Harrison, Kristin Scott Thomas and Willem Dafoe it must be good and rent this movie. (Boys are in a terrible time) <br /> <br /> If you like to be cheated and rent this movie, some people really liked this movie, but I like watching a movie with meaning
