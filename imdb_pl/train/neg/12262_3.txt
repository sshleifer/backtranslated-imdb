Fans of feature films have recently had to endure many terrible films. Blood Surf shamelessly joins the list of stupid, unnecessary titles with a terrifying treat of ridiculously large animals that want to turn the food chain upside down. Crocodiles are particularly successful because we had to deal with the terrible "Crocodile" (directed by the disappointing Tobe Hooper) and "Lake Placid". Blood Surf is just as bad as these other movies and ?? on top of this ?? he likes to exaggerate. The saltwater crocodile is probably 90 years old, it is over 30 feet long (!) And it kills for fun! During the movie, he plays with a group of stupid surfers - dudgets and bagpipes who have started to look for new emotions while surfing in a crowded area of ​​sharks. The only beautiful aspect of this movie is the tropical location. Although this is a completely inappropriate setting for such a movie, the lagoon and nature look wonderful. Every other aspect is simply disastrous. It's a bit gore, but everything looks fake and funny. Dialogues are simply painful to listen to! You will not believe the lines those actors have to say! I know that surfers are supposed to be a poorly developed group, but I hope that for them they are not that stupid! At the beginning of the film one of the characters refers to Jaws as a "mechanical toy", but the croc looks here at least 10 times less real than the big white Spielberg shark. The visual effects in "Blood Surf" are amateur, and the massacres are not impressive. I will not say too much about acting, because it is secondary in such films. Girls look sexy in wet shirts, and their tits joyfully bounce when escaping from the beast. You guessed right: Blood Surf is a very bad movie. So bad that it becomes funny again. But "funny" for a completely different reason than what James Hickox intended.
