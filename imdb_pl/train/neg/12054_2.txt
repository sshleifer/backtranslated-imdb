"What happens when you give a homeless $ 100,000?" As if asking this question, they are somehow morally relieved of what will ultimately happen. The developers of "Reversal of Fortune" try to get their voyeuristic giggles, hiding their antics as a kind of responsible social experiment. <br /> <br /> They take Ted, a homeless man in Pasadena, and give him $ 100,000 to watch if he turns his life around. Then, having only the most cursory tips and advice, let him go joyfully. <br /> <br /> What do you want to say? "Money can not buy you happiness?" "Homeless are they homeless because they deserve to be?" Or maybe "Raise a man - it's cooler to watch him fall from a greater height." They took a man who had nothing to lose, gave him something to lose, and then they watched him drop it all down the drain. This is to be entertainment? They dress in this dark music and dramatic camera shots, but in the end have a moral advantage in films from car accidents - only this time they have developed a car and asked: "What will happen when you stop the car sign?"
