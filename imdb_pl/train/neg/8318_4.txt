I have seen fantastic stories, but the reasons for this are so incredible that they are very close to being funny. The rich and young boy transplants the heart the day after the wedding, and he himself is a witness to his own operation and the conspiracy of the surgeons who killed him. Even if there is a medical explanation for this phenomenon, what happens next is a combination of dialogue between ... say ... souls? ... maybe even a real life where a devoted mother will do anything to save her son's life. There is no shadow of uncertainty or emotion, only the combination of a bad and simplified plot with a series of coincidences that will never happen in life. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that the film lacks quality - actually the first director Joby Harold does a decent job in managing a good team of actors, including Hayden Christensen on his first role after removing the Anakin Skywalker costume, the great Jessica Alba and super talented Lena Olin. Everything would deserve a better story.
