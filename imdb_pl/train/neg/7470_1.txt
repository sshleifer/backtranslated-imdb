In SÃ£o Paulo, teenagers from the upper middle class Cristiano, Chico and Gabriel just joined the university, and on the eve of the opening class go to a party with drugs and alcohol. The next day, after classes, the date Cristiano comes to his house from the previous night, and three friends rape the girl. The girl dies, panics and decides to get rid of the body, but Cristiano's mother arrives, surprises Gabriel and rolls the stairs, breaking her neck. The trio decides to dump and burn the body in a garbage dump, but at night other tragedies happen. <br /> <br /> Polemic and disgraceful "Cama de Gato" is an overrated pretentious shit about youth alienation, and is certainly the worst Brazilian film that I've seen for many years. The tile, tragic and dark history is in fact a black humorous comedy with a bad taste. The script is not funny, with stupid lines and dialogues, and boring, manipulative and stupid reports with interviews with moron teenagers at the beginning and the end. Acting is terrible, apparently with many improvisations, but without talent, and I was disappointed with the presence of promising Caio Blat in this basket. The camera, framing, photos and editing are amateur and very low quality. The sound is terrible and in many parts it is impossible to understand what actors and actresses say (probably it is a plus, because this movie sucks). Bang bang is very realistic and used to promote this mediocre movie in the very bad marketing of sexual abuse. My voice is one (horrible). <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Cama de Gato' ('The Cat's Bed')
