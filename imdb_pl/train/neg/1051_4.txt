Although Frank Loesser's works are among the best that Broadway has to offer, they are drowsy in the lethargic staging and uninspired presentation of Joseph L. Mankiewicz - when it ends, he barely feels like you're watching a musical. Mankiewicz does not seem to know how to present ambitious but melodic melodies of Loesser to get the maximum effect: for example, one of the best numbers, the impressive "Lament Adelaide", ends when Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) deals with the finale. chaise longue; and the artificial ghost of Stubby Kaye "Sit down, you're Rockin" The Boat "has its own under-back choir, which sits on folding chairs while he just stands. Mankiewicz enjoys everything, allowing static scenes to last too long, and his dialogue (adapted from the stage book Abe Burrows) has nothing to do with the fact that his films, such as "All About Eve." Part of the blame should be referred to the leaders, all of whom are wrong: Marlon Brando looks stunned, why plays in the musical, Frank Sinatra plays too nice guy and has no advantage that makes him so important (songs are not adapted to his style) and Jean Simmons barely records the way Shirley Jones can. Only Blaine, as a lovelorn lawyer, directs our attention like pro Broadway. The colorful direction of art is Joseph Wright, and Howard Bristol has created flashy sets.
