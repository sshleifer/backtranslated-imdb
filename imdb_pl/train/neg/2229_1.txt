Maybe it's not right, because I managed to get only halfway through the movie. One of the few films I could not watch because of lameness. <br /> <br /> Acting is awful, the camera's work is terrible, the plot is ridiculous, and the whole movie is simply unreal and tacky. For example - during the sale of coke, coke is simply kept loose in a briefcase - I'm not an expert, but I think people usually put it in a bag. <br /> <br /> They use the same stupid sound effect every time a blow is cast (this is more than a "crunchy" sound "and they use toy guns with dubbed sound effects.) <br /> <br /> Worst a movie in history.
