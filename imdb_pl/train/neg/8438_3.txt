I suppose that the bad Laurel and Hardy is better than none of Laurel and Hardy, but barely. It's sad that Fox's films are the ones that release a big DVD release, putting people who may not be too familiar with L & H, their WORST things, not their classic comedies. <br /> <br /> Once again, the boys are saddled with a stupid romantic story about a guy who invented an invisible ray. He is in love with the daughter of the bosses, who hates him and prefers some clever guy. It's amazing that geniuses from Fox believe that it was L & H that needed in their films. <br /> <br /> Without the pancake makeup, the boys look tired and old. The only scenes that work for them are the attempt to sneak out of the bedroom window at night and the rather bizarre scene in which Robert Mitchum, being a classic bad guy, is trying to sell Oliver Hardy "insurance" for Stan. br /> <br /> Otherwise, this script is just a mess. Forget about it and see if you can find a copy of "A Chump at Oxford" or "Bohemian Girl" or "Sons of the Desert".
