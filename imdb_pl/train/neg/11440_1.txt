Otherwise, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen - and I mean at any time. Both my wife and I got bored within 10 minutes. Not to mention nausea, it's totally unbelievable. Women (non-lesbians) do not take a bath together - they do not "accidentally" kiss each other. Brothers and sisters do not live together in their thirties and run, swinging, dancing together and hiking in the central park. Men do not find out that their wife and sister are romantically kissing the night before the wedding, and then they never talk to my wife. Absolutely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Heather Graham is probably the worst actress in today's films. She smiles when she should cry and vice versa. The only movie she has ever been good at is Boogie Nights - and that's because she did not play. <br /> <br /> I can not stress enough how bad this movie was.
