This movie is fun enough because of the great performance of Virginia Madsen and the fact that Lindsey Haun is cute. However, the reason the film is so predictable is that we have seen it before. I have not read the book "Mother's Gift", but I hope that Britney and Lynne Spears are completely different from this movie. If you do not consider ending the movie with the original idea of ​​a music video, the whole movie brings to mind the word plagiarism.
