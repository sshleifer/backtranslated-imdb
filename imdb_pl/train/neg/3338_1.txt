It took 9 years to complete the film. I think in the past nine years someone would say, hey, this movie is awful. I've seen better performance in porn movies. History is tired and played. The battered child turns into a serial killer. Or maybe something new for change. How about a battered child turns into a florist? At least it would be a new phrase. Why do everyone with a camera and an idea for a film (especially non-original film ideas) think they can be a director? I admire the fact that they have been stuck in this film for 9 years to finish it. It shows perseverance and spirit. With this type of drive, I hope that next time they will be able to focus on a better script. If you want to see an unsuccessful experiment in creating movies independent of the writer / director from Michigan, see Hatred of A Minute. If you want a good movie writer / director from Michigan with Evil Dead.
