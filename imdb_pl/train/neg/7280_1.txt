I will make the review of this program as short as possible. Skip it. Low budget, not funny, bad script. Acting not as bad as writing, but still bad. That's all you need to know, but I'll continue writing more than necessary. <br /> <br /> This is a movie with three segments, each of which is a parody of a different kind of film. Much more fun movie with the same exact idea is "Film" with George C. Scott. Very vague, but worth the search. MM parodies movies from the thirties and did it with elegance, precision and dry humor. <br /> <br /> This movie does not. It parodies three kinds of films, presumably from the late 1970s, early 1980s, just a parody of movies I've almost never heard of. The first is, I think, the parody of "Kramer Vs. Kramer ". Peter Reigert does everything in his power. The second is a parody, I do not know what ... Danielle Steele's novel? I mean, you can see such a story on Lifetime TV, but in the cinema? I mean, I remember the '70s, I was there. It is a parody of a type of soap opera about an attractive young woman who falls asleep. These types of things usually parody themselves, so I do not see how it was necessary. <br /> <br /> We are a bit easier with the third segment, "The Municipalians," which parodies police movies. I noticed elements of "The New Centurians" and some "Dirty Harry" that were almost 10 years old when the movie was made. Yes, nice and up to date. Robby Benson plays an idealistic young debut (impertinent), while Richard Widmark plays a gray-haired policeman who drinks whiskey while sitting in a police car (OH! Stop! My pages! Actually he drinks alcohol in an irreverent car!) Note that this was the first movie after " Animal House "with the name" National Lampoon "attached. Wow. Five years from this classic swipe to this pile of dung is shocking. I could talk for hours about a sad fall, which caused one of the most modern and original voices in the American humor (it would be National Lampoon, the original magazine for about the first 10 years) sold and began a long, slow moving into the world of nonsense, where now the magazine it's been a long time ago and exists only as a brand that can be counted for low-budget comedy movies for a fee. Another reason why capitalism (and cocaine) is so badly sucked. <br /> <br /> In any case, this movie is a serious problem. Do not waste 90 minutes. I want my back. Positive side is Fred Willard!
