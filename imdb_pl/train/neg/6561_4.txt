The opening sequence is to show the Legion arriving in Paris on November 13, 1918. The troops flow from the train - in uniform, in which the French army, including the Legion, marched to war in 1914! This is a sure sign that the war movie you will see will be a turkey. (The French Army realized until 1915 that the war in red trousers and dark blue coats did not work, the French metropolitan units were placed in the "blue horizon" and the colonial armies in khaki). Remake at least got uniforms more or less okay. It is really too bad when directors make these kinds of mistakes when they make all the effort to fix other things.
