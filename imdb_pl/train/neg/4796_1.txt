I love John Saxon in everything he's in. He used to take over the camera, although he directs a film that should be more aptly titled "Please, do not watch this movie, called: Zombie Death House." An insurance certificate for a $ 1000 shock is expensive to Fred Olen Ray, who makes you spend $ 14 on a filmed screenshot of the 70's cheese legend. Ray is a frontman at RetroMedia. Ray, by the way, makes the Charles Band look more hot than the stucco at Ford Falcon. Just bad now, both - and boring apart from that. It's great that Ray is kicking these old things, and in some cases it's a public domain, like the rest of the video enthusiasts from the dollar, but in the case of Zombie Death House- (the word "Zombie" sloppily overlaps to add property and interest from parts) FOR FOR) THE ONLY WAY IS THE TRIPE IS THE RELEASE OF IT ON A LARGEST MARKET FOR A CULTURAL COLLECTOR AND SAXON VENTILATORS !!! If you want to see real Saxon, take Black Christmas, Nightmare on Elm Street or The Glove.
