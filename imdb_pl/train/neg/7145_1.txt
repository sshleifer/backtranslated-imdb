Apparently, Hollywood is giving money to anyone with the camera and the ability to speak. This movie was terribly bad. The cast was terrible, the acting unspeakable, and the story filled with holes. Scenario? who needs a script? I was surprised that the film was not as verbal vulgar as I thought, but I have enough of T & A to survive my whole life. The movie was like listening to a 19-year-old street racer from ADD (who decided to buy a car instead of going to college) to tell a story. Being so badly written, I thought that the two brothers in the film were lovers at the beginning. Scenes on the racetrack, along with the main actress in the film, made me think about Herbie: Fully Loaded. This is the kind of film that Grindhouse modeled on ... only the writers thought they were serious.
