This film is an insult to ALL submarines. It was stupid. It looked like they were written by monkeys. The act was absurd. If this is the view of most Navy people, I cry because of our defense. This movie was terrible. I put it below "Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea" when it comes to underwater movies. Gene Hackman really needed money from rent to do it. Denzel Washington had to be tall. Little in the story makes sense. The end. That the rebel would be rewarded for his crime? Only Hollywood would have thought about this junk. If you have not understood it yet, I did not like it. And if not all pro's comments, I would not bother publishing posts.
