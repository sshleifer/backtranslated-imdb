This should be a great movie ... Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson acted as two newspaper authors. Directed by Mike Nichols. Uh. It's boring, boring! Pointless and predictable! Slow and unconcentrated! <br /> <br /> He is a boy who meets a girl, a boy marries a girl, a boy has an affair, tells the story of a girl. Now is the original concept! After winding for two hours (or just two? I felt like six.) I was not sure if it was comedy, romance, tragedy or soap opera. It was done in 1986. I'm sure we all did things sixteen years ago, which we rather forgot about. I hope that damage to the reputation of Streep and others begins to heal and that the emulsion in the master begins to disappear. This is not a bad picture. It's just not so-good.
