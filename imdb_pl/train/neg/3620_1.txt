I tried to watch the disgust of the cinema when I was five; I have never been the same since then. Filled to the brim with images caused by drugs that stink with the ordinary bullshit of your average sanctuary, this "film", despite its colorful appearance, is not for people, ESPECIALLY, not for children. quite innocently with a poor boy who is ruining the classmate's drum (wait for it), putting his head in it; yes, inserting your HEAD into it. But do not be afraid, my friends! He is quickly comforted by the chirping of the flute, which is quite strange, I will give you, but still acceptable. <br /> <br /> THEN: The film transforms into a combination of the Wizard of Oz and Where are the wild creatures, but loses all the "warm and blurred" aspects of one of these two books. <br /> <br /> So this seven-footed yellow relative of Barney makes friends with this poor boy and plunges him even more in despair. br /> <br /> And to add a pleasant set of terrifying themes, a carnivorous boat, formerly a friend of the collected team of twisted grandfather clocks and doped "dragons", is added to the mixture of chaos. br /> <br /> The most comforting image among this chaos is the villain, aptly named "Witchiepoo" (?). Of course, he has his own problems: with an obvious plastic mask limiting her facial expression to deal with the broom, whose gas level always seemed the lowest at the most inopportune moments. Therefore, one of her favorite activities was diving into the nose in a water body, which separated the land of Pufnstuf from her degenerate, decaying headquarters (I do not know where I would rather live). > <br /> In summary, this movie is frightening ... <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie that has similar effects in the audience as the Exorcist, then this movie is for you. Enjoy.
