"They Are Among Us" is poor science fiction at best. Weak acting plays this movie. The holes in the story are numerous. Foreigners who have somehow arrived on Earth with a meteorite and have been hiding among us for over 100 years, but they need a plastic surgeon to look like people. In their alien form, they supposedly have exo-skeletons (that's why they need plastic surgery), but when you see them, they have teeth and nails. The hero's father "disappeared" after closing the Blue Project Book, but apparently he was a F-16 pilot. And so on. If you want to see a movie about an alien invasion, select "Invasion of body hijackers" and see how it's done well.
