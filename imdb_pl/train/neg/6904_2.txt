It seems to me that as the last graduate of film school, in the time of New Zealand film reaching new heights, the public seems to think that every film produced in New Zealand is great. Sione's wedding proves that it is dead. <br /> <br /> It's completely overrated and it's not funny, and far from the comedy movie commented by other IMDb users. The only really funny thing I found in this movie was Derek, the would-be black guy, but otherwise the jokes were remade nonsense we've all heard before. <br /> <br /> Being half-Samoan, I wanted to see how the film would handle the Polynesian representation. It was a complete ball - I know it was a putative comedy, but I did not want the characters to have something new to say about Polynesian identity, even if it was brazen. I was the most disappointed with the ending of the film and the solution of the relationship between the characters - Mikaele was a player who only bothers white women, comes to turn a little, when "Dusky Maiden" comes to the city, has a revelation that maybe should start looking for a stable relationship, and then, at the last minute, he rejects him and accepts his position as a Polynesian Playboy for women palagi. I did not understand why they did it. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was very disappointing. My whole family went to see that he was expecting a good laugh, but it ended up really bitterly paying to see it at the cinema. The jokes are bad at best, the acting, especially the girls Sefy, APPALLING, and to be honest, I would be happy if I had one of those pirated copies of the movie to save myself 15 dollars. /> <br /> I think the only good thing about the movie is that it's the second step (after the second, much better movie, of course) in the birth of Polynesian cinema. I hope that future Pacific filmmakers can learn from Sione's Wedding, how to NOT reflect Polynesia and have something more meaningful and sensible to say. Even if it's done in a comedy fashion.
