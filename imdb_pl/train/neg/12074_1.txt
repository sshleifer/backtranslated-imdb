A funny horror about a wealthy man (John Carradine) who dies and leaves everything to his four children, and his service is shared equally. One condition - they must spend a week in their property to get money. And if one of them dies, others will get more. Guess what's happening next ... <br /> <br /> I saw a completely new print of this movie on the cable. The colors were bright and lively, and the house looks beautiful. It's all good things I can say about it. <br /> <br /> Let's just list some of the problems this movie has: the killer is loudly obvious; the servants are called Igor and Elga - come on! some of the sound recordings were so bad that I could not see dialogue (I certainly do not have a big loss); the blood was rare and very poorly made; other murders were simply boring, stupid or impossible, and this movie contains a really disgusting acting - so bad that you stare at the screen in disbelief. Even pro Jeff Morrow was horrible! The only fairly good actor was playing with Faith Domergue (who deserved something better) and John Carradine (who looks painfully old and weak here). But I must admit - closing this movie is a real gem! <br /> <br /> Why this name has been changed to "Legacy of Blood" is beyond me - there is another horror of 1978 with that name! br /> <br /> Whatever his name is, it's a bad movie. Avoid at all costs.
