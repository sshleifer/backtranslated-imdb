I'm not sure what HK movies were seen by other reviewers, but Enter the Eagles is nowhere on the top of the stack in HK action. Michael "Fitz" Wong should be happy that he can get an acting job at HK because he could not get out of a wet paper bag in English. Shannon Lee looks good and is a fantastic fighter (she even fights better with her legs than her father), but her acting skills are also below the norm. In fact, the whole English dialogue (90% of the movie - even more than Gen-Y Cops) is so bad that I moved to the Mandarin sound to save me the misery of poor dialogue and English language redundancy. Clear, there are some decent shootings ( but nothing that we have not seen before) and good photos, but poor visual effects really spoil the action. <br /> <br /> It means that it's worth paying for admission to watch Shannon and Benny "The Jet" Urquidez go for it. Spectacular and almost worth seeing the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, you may notice a few scenes that seem familiar to you, in particular the shooting at the outdoor market (think Matrix) and diving Fitz from a helicopter in black uniforms (think MI: 2). Guess someone thought that at least a few things in this movement were worth breaking.
