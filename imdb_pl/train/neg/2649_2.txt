My wife and I started watching this movie with impatience. It looked warm and moved. It started well; but soon he became boring and sincerely idiotic after a while. It was so bad that we turned it off. The film was poorly preserved and honest, we could not really understand or we wanted to understand why exactly or how the hell could they endure this woman! You lost sympathy to her after she was rude and acted out wackos singing and cleansing. I would make her commit. And of course, like most of the T.V movies and TV series produced in Hollywood, we have to give it a "gay" sign! This movie was boring. I expected more from Diane Keaton!
