It's good there. It's bad. And then their "Sentinel," a political "thriller" that counts among the worst movies I've ever seen. The mole plot at Secret Service is good, but there is never a movie with such a huge potential. Every actor in this film, directed by Clark Johnson in the style of "madness", seems to work on the autopilot. Even the great Michael Douglas looks bored. I can honestly say I've NEVER seen another movie with so many bright holes in the story for all my life. The twist is predictable from the square, and the motifs of the characters are so absurd that they inspired the audience to laugh. Avoid this at all costs. This is a movie disaster without the value of redemption.
