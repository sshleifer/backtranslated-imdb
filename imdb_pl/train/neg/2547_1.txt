I have not seen him for more than twenty years. OJ was a bus driver, Arte Johnson was a guide, Lorenzo was a hijacker. <br /> <br /> Lorenzo looked very natural like a villain. I think that I watched it more in the case of OJ, which I saw in Towering Inferno and Cassandra Crossing, but also in Arte Johnson. <br /> <br /> I was a little bored that Johnson was so serious. <Br /> <br /> And yes, he moved the threads. Reading the other posts, I remember that it was a conspiracy that a rich girl was planning to kidnap, but then that priceless interest turned out to be unexpected. <br /> <br /> I'm going, stamp? If he appeared as a late movie, I would probably record it to check it out, but I would not be nostalgic. In any case, not yet. <br /> <br /> There are even better videos from the seventies to check.
