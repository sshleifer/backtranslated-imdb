As you probably heard, in this movie there is no real fight between vampires and zombies. You can then ask why the title suggested something like that, but it really is right, because nothing else in the movie made sense. There was absolutely no story or story, only things are happening. Acting was incredibly bad, worse than safeauto ads bad. <br /> <br /> Not only there was no fight between vampires and zombies, but I think there was only one scene with zombies even in it. Their make-up looked like it was worn by an 8-year-old girl. The scene was completely accidental and out of place, and one of the characters fought with zombies using a hedge trimmer (I'm not joking), but they used the sound effects of a chainsaw. <br /> <br /> It was undoubtedly the poorest movie I have ever seen in my life. The only circumstance that I would not mock completely every person responsible for the production of this film would be the fact that I learned that it was produced entirely by 11-year-olds. <br /> <br /> I really, despite all the critics, suggest here, I suggest you watch this movie solely on the basis of the fact that it may be the worst movie in history, which is why it is quite comical. Even the mere counting of defects should provide entertainment.
