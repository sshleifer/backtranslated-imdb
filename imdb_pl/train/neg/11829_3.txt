I went to this movie after seeing the 82-minute "Borata" tonight and left it quite disappointed. I was a huge fan of Wallace and Gromit and I visited animated films routinely. With that in mind, it turned out that I was nodding and at some point I almost left, but I waited for the film to improve. It never happened. <br /> <br /> The visuals are stunning, and the voice work is at the highest level, especially in my opinion, Kate Winslet and Ian McKellen (I had to remember several times the bulbous villain of lizards Gandalf and Magneto). The problem with this movie is for me one of those animated functions for the ADD set. It registers after the fact as one bad slapstick routine after another, loaded with a story filled with a melody that pulls out each stop, trying to pass the "Important Message". It looks like an Oscar bait in the animated category, and given the way in which he scores points with critics, I would not be surprised if the Academy made a mistake and offered its equipment. But if you're looking for a nice animated movie about rats, take my advice and wait for Ratatouille.
