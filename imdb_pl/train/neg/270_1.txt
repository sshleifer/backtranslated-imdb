Now I watch it in pink (TV station in Serbia) and I have to say it is nonsense. Shallow, without acting, too sloppy effects. I mean, who created this series? <br /> <br /> It was a stupid rehearsal of the record label to make a little more money for the film's success. WELL. The film was great in 1994, when it appeared. But the series? <br /> <br /> Sometimes you can see how idiotic the lines are in the characters' speech. I mean, did they actually pay someone to write it, is it someone in the Studio? This is not SciFi. <br /> <br /> The film was a bomb, the series sucked.
