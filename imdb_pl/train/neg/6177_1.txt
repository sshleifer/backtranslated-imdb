The real irony is: Joe Besser was a top-class comedian, in other situations away from the Stoogs. He had a specific story that he was very funny and wise. Moe, Larry and Shemp knew him or at least for many years and liked his work. So what happened on Earth when he joined the unit as a "third cone"? Of course, nothing. In most of these "late Stooge" era, more often than boys, they oppose each other or Joe against the other two, and this is not the exact Stooge label. "One for all, all for one, each for each other", quoting Curly from "Anxious Knights". One thing about a good comedy band, Laurel and Hardy, Abbott and Costello, Marx Brothers, no matter how much everyone tries to use each other or hit each other, when the chips are really lowered, they stick together to come together. Nothing happens in this particular. It's almost like watching a dog fight when trying to deceive others or be mean and nasty, not for a comedic effect. It can be assumed that something is happening behind the scenes, art imitates life. Maybe that's why Besser did not stay long with Moe and Larry. Just look at the history of other bands and tell me I'm wrong.
