Why did I waste 1.5 hours of my life watching this? Why was this movie made? Why do I even comment on this movie? <br /> <br /> One reviewer said that this movie required patience to watch and was not for everyone. I can not understand who this movie is for. maybe after dropping the acid attack, SOMEONE can observe it and get the meaning out of it. It is incoherent, it is not experimental, it is simple and simple garbage. The movie does not follow a storyline, only when you think you have something, well ... no. <br /> <br /> I think the ending brought the finale of the movie (no pun intended), the viewer has an insight into what could have happened. I do not think I put a spoiler here, not that it would matter. This film is another film that can not be missed in the film world.
