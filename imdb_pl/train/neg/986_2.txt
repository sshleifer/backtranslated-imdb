This movie had an IMDB rating of 8.1, so I was expecting much more. It begins with fun and endearingly, with energy that is spontaneous. But before the film is half way, it begins to drag and everything becomes morbidly predictable. The heroes in the office were delighted in the first third of the film, but we get to know them too well; they become caricatures, not real people. It's the same story I've seen hundreds of times, told here only in slightly different circumstances. The thing is, I could bear another predictable love story, if only dialogue was not so old! <br /> <br /> The only thing that can be worse is that the characters have inconsistent and unbelievable motivations, and unfortunately this is also the case with the Dead Letter Office. I hope that this movie will soon go to the office of Dead Movie Office.
