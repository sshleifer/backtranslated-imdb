First of all ... I never considered myself Uwe Bolla Hater, because I think I have never seen any of his films, but after seeing a cheap excuse for a movie called "Seed" (this is what the serial killer is called) I'm close to joining the club hatred. This movie does not make any sense ... the plot is a joke, and although Boll clearly tries to attract attention, shocking people, 90% of the film is just boring. You can sum up this video in this way: <br /> <br /> 1. The killer with a hood watches the clips of tortured animals on TV. This is film footage from the skin farm, and the film begins with a funny reason to "comment on the subject of humanity" and give the address Peta. Since this movie has no news and is the worst piece of torturing pornography, you already have a reason to hate the movie from the beginning. <br /> <br /> 2. Death by electrocution with an excuse that captures what happens later in this film printed on the screen so that every retard receives it. <br /> <br /> 3. Cops watch movies of animals, babies and women who are dying of hunger and spread out in the basement Seeds, they have stupid nightmares and cry for their whiskey, because Seed is such a bad bad mofo. Although acting is okay, the movie performs a dive every time it tries to turn on emotions ... <br /> <br /> 4. The policemen beat the Seed in their home, behave stupidly and are cut in the dark. This sequence reminds me of a video game, almost nothing but flashlights. Seed is a super killer that's all over the place and all the cops are foolish enough to be killed ... except for one who beats him. <br /> <br /> 5. Seed gets a chair and we see his electric shock as long as everything else in this "movie" ... will not die and reminds us that he must be released if he survives 3 electric shocks. Guess what ... just bury him alive to solve the problem. <br /> <br /> 6. The seed comes out of the grave, kills everyone in the other part of the cutting, and then looks for the main cop who will take revenge on him. <br /> <br /> 7. The woman falls in the head with a hammer in an infinite sequence from one point of view, only for fun and shock value. <br /> <br /> 8. Seed seizes the clay family, lures him home, threatens to kill his wife and daughter. After killing the wife with a nail gun, the policeman shoots himself in the head, taking into account what Seed wants (it's hard to get into it, because he not only wears the mask even in prison, but also never utters a word ... the movie almost never has no dialogue, so do not worry. 9. Boll goes to a nihilistic, shocking end where Seed closes her daughter with her dead daddy to rot like the people we saw on the video in sequence 3. < br /> <br /> This is ... no news, no story, no reason, no face behind the mask, no background except for stupid stories that Seed was burned as a child. <br /> <br /> This movie it's based only on a few key scenes and their shock value, I do not remember a movie that would be devoid of emotion, news or entertainment ... It's like watching the August Underground ... it's okay for me, some people will enjoy this mindless snuff. what is really difficult is pseu to-message at the beginning and the fact that the film is well made, taking into account the work with the camera, the effects and even the action is too good for this waste of celluloid. <br /> <br /> So how does Boll get money for such "movies" when thousands of talented directors work on modest budgets? The "seed" is not only the essence of the absurd, its living proof that the free market is flawed ... Uwe luck that a German taxpayer pays too much of this waste to get a deduction.
