After watching this movie, I was so upset that I wasted 2 hours of my life. It's 2 hours I will never go back. Ugh. When you start, you can think "Wow, this is really good!" But you can be sure that the first impressions mean NOTHING. I was so excited about the movie until the dumbest ending I've ever seen. This movie is simply pathetic. Acting is bland, the plot is not original and there is nothing particularly special about it, except that it is the WORST MOVIE EVER !!! DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM !!! WARNING!! DUMBEST MOVIE YOU WILL NEVER SORRY, IF YOU WASTE 2 HOURS OF LIFE AT THIS !!! 1/10
