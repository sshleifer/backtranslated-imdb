If there was a scale below 1, she would receive -10, following Godspell's footsteps. Acting (if there was such a thing) was terrible, the conspiracy was in disarray. And Rene Russo was disgustingly sweet in her role, enough to be fooled. Ten thumbs for a stupid movie. Saving: kudos for period costumes.
