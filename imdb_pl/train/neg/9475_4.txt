Beautifully photographed and generally working, but the writing is very slippery. There are scenes of such unbelievableness that watching does not bring joy. For example, the fact that a young lover has a twin brother is so invented that I moaned loudly. And "combining emotions with a light bulb" also seems catchy. <br /> <br /> But I do not know. If you have a few glasses of wine and you want to relax with something nice looking in a few flimsy comedy scenes, this is a pretty good movie. It does not require much effort on the part of the viewer. But an Italian film, especially an Italian comedy, is usually much better.
