Thank you Hollywood. Another movie classic completely ruined by cheap, shallow, heavy and unnecessary remake. The original "Planet of the Apes" was an intelligent and provocative movie with a very clear message. It was a film that focused almost exclusively on dialogue, which sounds very boring, but in fact it was very interesting. <br /> <br /> It seems that this movie has eliminated almost ALL dialogues. Instead of a great movie, we get an incredibly stupid chasing movie. Dialogue has been reduced to a minimum, interaction and character development do not exist, and most of the time it is very difficult to understand what is happening. Instead, we get a few pointless action scenes, some slightly funny one-liners and some very empty quasi-intelligent conversations. <br /> <br /> The only thing worth mentioning about this movie is that it looks absolutely fantastic. The makeup of the monkeys is wonderful, and the sets and backgrounds are beautiful. However, this does not distract from the fact that "Planet of the Apes (2001)" is a very shallow and simple film, filled with thin paper figures, stupid dialogue and an almost non-existent thread. Please, Hollywood, stop ruining great movies, turning them into meaningless hits. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, the end did not make ANY SENSE. , mainly for visual effects <br /> <br />
