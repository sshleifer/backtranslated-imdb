This film, though not entirely bad, should be filmed where real events took place. Grand Island in Nebraska was devastated by no less than seven tornadoes on the night of June 3, 1980. The creators of the film filmed on the tree-covered hills of Ontario and moved the entire event to the non-existent city of Blainsworth. The inhabitants of Grand Island bravely survived this terrible night to be forgotten due to a badly made movie.
