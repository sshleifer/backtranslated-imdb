Last night I caught "Starlight" on TV and I can only say. . . Wow! It's hard to know where to start - incredibly hokey special effects (see laser beams shooting from Willie's eyes!), Horrible acting, heavy dialogue, unmatched use of footage or air of serious pretentiousness that fills the whole production. It's really a one-of-a-kind experience and we should all be grateful for that. I appoint Jonathon Kay as the true heir of Ed Wood!
