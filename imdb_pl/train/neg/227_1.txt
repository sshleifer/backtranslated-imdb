Was it to be a comedy or a serious drama? This film begins with the slight banter of three women. Fine. It goes into conflict between women when one of them meets a man. Fine. There are several pranks between them. Fine. But when the story becomes thick and becomes black, I began to wonder if I misinterpreted the first part of the movie. This continues in this spirit for some time, and finally tries to return to the original jokes. But now it is too late. It is difficult to understand why these women are still talking to each other and the finale is unconvincing. Really a lesson (and so for British filmmakers), how not to make movies. It's hard to see how the producers have found out that this movie will work. And the cashbox turned out to be a real flop because I never heard about this film until this weekend (four years after the premiere).
