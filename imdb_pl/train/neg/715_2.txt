It sounded like an interesting blurb movie. Nazi, occult, government conspiracies. I was expecting a low-budget Nazi version of the DaVinci code or the Boys from Brazil, and even Shockwaves. Instead, you get something completely different, more psychological, more like David Lynch. It was a plus. But the way history is told is simply terrible. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem is casting. The character of Andrienne Barbeau begins with a move, is a bit shy and afraid. It just does not do it well, even at her age, though she certainly did. The actor played as a son who apparently considered it a comedy. It seems that most of the other actors thought it was a camp movie, or at least it behaved in this way, instead of just being weird. The only thing I thought was really good was the daughter of Siri Baruc. <br /> <br /> Another important part is stimulation. It starts very slowly. You may be tempted to turn it off. But then it gets discouraging when you come to your daughter's suicide and its aftermath. But soon afterwards everything becomes a confused mess. Some of them were intentional, but most of them were unnecessarily misleading, monotonous and poorly focused. <br /> <br /> A real problem, it's just not a nice movie to watch. It is slow, boring, none of the characters is nice. Overuse of images and sets. Some movies where characters are tortured. In this case, it's the viewer. It has some terrifying moments, especially frightening Nazi images and subtitles, but the rest of the movie is simply tiring.
