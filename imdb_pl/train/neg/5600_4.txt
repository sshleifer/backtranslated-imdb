fulci experiments with sci fi and fail. usually in his movies, not horror, we still get the sum of great blood, but not here. Add very funny scenes, like when prisoners are forced to stick to a bar for 12 minutes, and if they drop, they are subjected to electricity. the guy falls down and has some fit on the floor for about two minutes, until his friends, who have tried to keep him, lift him off the floor. The city is an obvious model, but not bad. and the final explosion is ridiculous at best. And do not start me from terrible battle scenes. <br /> <br /> 4/10
