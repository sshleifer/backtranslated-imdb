The week before I saw Iowa, I saw Art School Confidential, in which a pretentious pupil makes a film and can not decide if he wants it to be a work of art or brutal exploitation. Iowa can be a movie that he did. I see elements of much better films in Iowa - Spun and Natural Born Killers. However, apart from artistry, both films had a good character development and a consistent story. Iowa. This movie is becoming ridiculous. I must admit that he was coherent. This film is bad from beginning to end and is not particularly bad or better in any part. All the actors did what they could. Roseanna Arquette deserves more. She shows that she is very talented, very funny and very sexy. But why must he demonstrate this in this ball.
