Disappointing action movie with an interesting premise: a young mafia mafia killer (Chandler) must demonstrate to his boss that he is a good man for the service, so he goes to California to take lessons with a very well-known professional killer (Beluschi). The first and most important task: to kill a young woman (Lee) who is completely strange to them. But is it an easy target? The film lasts and is based on this main idea, but the result is simply bad; even a strange phrase at the end does not save the movie. Good Chandler performance. I give it 4 (four).
