For your own sake, it would be best to disregard any positive reviews about this film. This STINKS move. Now I like (at least theoretically) low-budget horrors, but this makes the worst mistake a low budget can make: it cares too much. And unfortunately, this is not the only problem. <br /> <br /> This is the story of Beane of the British Ilses killed by the modern day. Interesting assumption, but there are two things that immediately start to embarrass you after watching this movie. <br /> <br /> # 1- Why is the biggest name on the box with Jenna Jameson records? She is a woman of average appearance who can not work and she plays a smaller role. ANSWER: Apparently, she is a known porn star (as you read without doubt in other reviews), so I think it is an "episodic" look for her. It looks like the movie really needs "name resolution". Her highest bills, however, are not a sign of her talent, but are proof of how restless the rest of the cast is. <br /> <br /> # 2 How can the creators of films be so stupid that they think Canada can be gone as Ireland? It does not even look like Ireland. And the house where the guests / victims are is the big Edwardian wood frame from North America. They should skip the whole topic of Beane and develop a story that took place in the NA. Also, if you're going to make a movie that's in Ireland, it's probably best to have more than one character with an Irish accent (and it was REALLY REALLY REALLY an Irish accent.) Now it would not be too bad if the director did not try to do the next "Night" of the Living Dead, "but it seems he was. Detriment. He could have fun with it. In fact, some of the scenes were not far from involuntary comedy like they were. <br /> <br /> Like the infamous scene of gutting, whether the woman was chained to the table, stripped naked, and then dissected and gutted. It's funny, you ask? Well, in the removed version of the scene, the mutant killer pulls out a mile after a mile of intestines. It's really fun after a while. Is the self-respecting cannibal eating the intestines? Do we eat cows 'and chickens' intestines? Heck no, we eat ham, ribs and drumsticks. Well. <br /> <br /> Some of the other casters who were annoying: tearful, terrifying Howard Rosenstein. I'm not sure, but I think he was supposed to be cast as STUD. In fact, he is such a big loser and idiot as his name would suggest. That would explain why the character played by equally annoying Gillian Leigh fell on him. <br /> <br /> I checked Gillian Leigh on her link on IMDb and apparently it's important to know that she graduated from high school with honors. I can not decide if it's more fun or pathetic to know that just a few years after graduation, an honorable student makes a nude porn scene with a soft core in the shower with a guy named Howard Rosenstein. I wonder if her classmates have seen this movie? If so, hopefully they will receive a message: AVOID THIS WAY! GO TO UNIVERSITY!!! I could continue and continue, but why. If you like gore, in this movie you will find something repurchasing, but not much more.
