Nicholas Walker is Paul, the local city of Reverand, who is married to Marta (Ally Sheedy), but is also a customary womanizer and decides to pretend his own death to escape his current affair with Veronica (Dara Tomanovich). However, when doing this, he gets an amnesia attack (hence the name of the movie). Sally Kirkland is also on hand as a crazy old coot, who sits in a good mood in shades of "Misery". It is sad that a pretty good cast is wasted in this way. John Savage in the least terrible role of a forgotten private detective. In the film announced as a "black comedy" you have to bring elements to the IMAGE. Although it causes the first one to be quilted, unfortunately it does not contain any of the latter. What's more, you can not emphasize any of the characters, so you have absolutely no interest. Technically, this is not a completely bad movie, it's just extremely forgotten. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dara Tomanovich stays topless; Sally Kirkland also shows some skin <br /> <br /> My class: C- <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Showtime Showcase
