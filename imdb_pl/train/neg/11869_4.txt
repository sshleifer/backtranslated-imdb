I do not know if the problem I had with this movie is the fact that I was unable to capture the way films were made in the past, but I believe that he did not miss the possibility of using the trendy conventions available in the 1940s to shoot movie. If you do not have anything better to do, I advise you not to watch this movie, but to read a book or go for a walk.
