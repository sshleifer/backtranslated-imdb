The question is, when someone sees a film so bad, it does not necessarily have to be: "How was the movie so bad?" Or even "Why did I see it at all?" But "What did I learn from this experience?" Here's what I learned: <br /> <br /> - Just because the "rules" of horrors have been cataloged and satirized countless times in the last ten years, does not mean that someone will not make a movie that uses ALL of them without a little humor and irony. <br /> <br /> - If your video needs to be described as ** loose ** based on a video game, you have script problems. <br /> <br /> - A black character does not always die first, but the Asian character always knows kung-fu. <br /> <br /> - Although you can be proud that you have discovered how to make a "Matrix" effect on a budget, which does not necessarily mean that you should use it repeatedly and nausea. <br /> <br /> - Being Ron Howard's brother does not guarantee the choice of roles. <br /> <br /> - Whenever the scene does not edit together, just use the footage from the video game, no one will notice. <br /> <br /> - If your cousin's rap team offers you to write your movie theme for free, politely decline. <br /> <br /> - Zombie movies are not people killing zombies. It's about zombies killing people, preferably in the most macabre way. That makes them SCARY. <br /> <br /> - White people who can pay $ 1,600 to get to the rave deserve to die. <br /> <br /> - If you find an old book, it will tell you everything you need to know. You will think of something else on your own two lines when someone asks: "What was this?" Or "Where are we?" <br /> <br /> - Naked breasts are not a panacea in horror. <br /> <br /> - A helicopter shot and a Sega license agreement magically transform your movie from a "student film" to a "large studio edition". Try it! <br /> <br /> - Just because you can list all three movies of "Living Dead," George Romero does not make you. Or even Paul W. S. Anderson. <br /> <br /> I've seen worse movies, but only because I saw "Mortal Kombat: Annihilation".
