This movie is simply awful. It's so bad that I can not stand anything but a few words. Avoid this movie at all costs, it's terrible. <br /> <br /> None of the crime details are played correctly. Many recordings from the slaughterhouse. Strange cuts and changes. Lack of continuity of the plot. Acting is absolutely the most amateur I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This bomb from the movie was created to earn some money, regardless of the accuracy of its content. Camera work is sometimes out of focus and always unstable. It looks like it was shot on video. <br /> <br /> Actually, now that Dennis Rader is in jail, I'd like to put the guys who made this awful movie, too. <br /> <br /> Seriously, do not even think about watching this. If I could, I would give him a negative star.
