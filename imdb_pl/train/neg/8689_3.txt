The main problem with "Power" is that it contains too many characters that have no meaning in the movie. After a while, it gets boring, sitting down waiting for scenes that do not connect to find something that drives the movie. You can probably turn it all off as character development, but all of them are either processed from earlier movie scenes or are simply flat and uninteresting. Lumet never gives you enough time to let each of the supporting flowers. He should cut several characters (hackman, wife) and focus more on others (Billings). It could be a great, heavy political thriller instead of a chaotic mess that loses all news in a sea of ​​evil writing and acting, a fact that surprised me, considering the cast. Even Gene Hackman's performance was not equal. Denzel Washington is the only real actor here. Gere and others performed much better performances elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Sidney Lumet must return to the fierce performances of one man in the seventies (eg Serpico) and stop trying to regain his success thanks to "12 Angry Men" and "Fail Safe". Sidney has not worked yet and will probably never work. leave team drama to Altman. <br /> <br /> 3/10 <br /> <br /> * / * * * *
