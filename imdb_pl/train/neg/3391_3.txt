I wonder who, and more importantly, why the decision to call Richard Attenborough to address the most remarkable sensation on Broadway for many years? He is a Oscar-winning director. Yes, he won for Ghandi, moron! Jeremy Irons is an Academy Award-winning actor, do you want to see him at Rocky Balboa? He has experience in musicals. Really? "Oh, what a wonderful war" you forgot? To answer your question, yes! The film is disappointing, bright and simple. No ounce of living energy has survived the difficult procedure. Each character danced beautifully, they were cute, but their projection was theatrical. I do not feel anything. But when I saw it on stage, I felt everything. The film should be filled with stars, unknown, novices, but the stars with irresistible unforgettable faces, even the most invisible in the group. Great actors who can dance beautifully. Well, Michael Douglas was in it. Truth I forgot that I am completely wrong and you are absolutely right. Nothing like the Richard Attenborough musical by Michael Douglas.
