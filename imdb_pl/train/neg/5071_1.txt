I can not even believe that this performance lasted as long as it happened. I think all this is part of America's stupidity. Personally, like David Spade, I liked the performance when it achieved its original title - "Seinfeld". What disturbs me most in this show, apart from the obvious basic sense of "humor" and general restraint, is the pretentious way in which the episodes are titled. Really great concerts are still funny after many repetitive reviews, such as "the one in which Rob is accidentally hypnotized," in "Dick Van Dyke Show" or "the one in which Lucy and Ethel work in a candy factory". In other words, it is an honor given to great programs by viewers. The fact that the writers and producers of the "Friends" would have the unwavering pride to designate the episodes themselves, in such a way, before anyone could even see the occasion a second time, speaks not only for mediocrity and lack of original thinking on the part of these writers, but also the intentional minds of their viewers. <br /> <br /> You have read some of these people's comments and you can come to the conclusion that they live in a Hallmark Card like Neverland, full of sentiments from greeting cards. The true meaning of friendship? I want to be a friend? I want to live in Manhattan? Wake up. These people should work in cafes and look for work as actors, but somehow they manage to live at 4000 $ / mo. flat? Get off your high horse. All I need to tell those of us who want to move to Manhattan and live the idyllic life of New York with Rosses and Monicas, good luck with all this. This New York does not exist for anyone who earns less than a serious six-digit income. But in any case, good luck. Now shut up and give me Soma.
