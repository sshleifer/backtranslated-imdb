Maybe I'm not a critic, but here's what I think about this movie. I just watched the movie on Cinemax and, above all, I just have to say how much I hate the story. It's about what a snowman makes a mess besides young children. they probably used ketchup, so MY CRITICAL VOTE IS BOMB !!! nice try, and the sequel will be twice as large.
