well his official. they just killed American Pie. The first three were absolutely hysterical, but this and others were terrible. My point is that the story is about two collegial brotherhoods that are fighting against each other for their homes, that is, let's talk about a weak conspiracy, the first three concerned growing up, change and marriage, which are worthy of development in human society. <br /> <br /> The new Stifler is the biggest joke, I know it's hard to compare it with Steven Stifler, but there's no cigar. I'm giving this film 3, because there are 2-3 funny pieces in the movie. <br /> <br /> The best character in this movie is of course Jim's dad, I do not know why he's still doing badly-designed movies.
