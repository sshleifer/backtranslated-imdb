Each generation fully believes that it lives in the last days. It has been like that for thousands of years. And movies like this feed on it. Where did they get the great Orson Welles to tell the wreck of the train? This is a document about the biblical prophecies of Armageddon. He tries to combine prophecy as well as possible with what happened in the times in which it was created, making it obviously outdated and a little stupid. <br /> <br /> The reconstructions look as if they were out of "Unresolved mysteries" but without high production values. People should have been ashamed to take part in it. <br /> <br /> In short, the movie is outdated, stupid, reactionary and useless. Okay, if you want to laugh, but not enough to really look for it.
