As many others have said, this is a scary movie from every aspect of film making. It is amazing how some well-known actors took part in this project. <br /> <br /> Many people complained that it was shot on "cheap" video cameras. Yes, it was shot on video, but not on "cheap" movies. Lighting, white balance, shooting technique and assembly were bad. <br /> <br /> There were so many different shooting and editing techniques that it was a production mess. Sharp inconsistent lighting, the use of manual shooting (ala Woody Allen), intermittent editing (another Allen technique), but poorly made, with no real purpose. <br /> <br /> The lack of white balance in the restaurant kitchen scene are embarrassing; very amateur. <br /> <br /> Simulated sex scenes had no artistic value at any level. <br /> <br /> How this movie has ever been printed is beyond me. It's worth taking a look to be amazed at how bad it is.
