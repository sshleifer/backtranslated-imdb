Incredible Melting Man plays like a prolonged episode of The Six Million Dollar Man, but with violence and nudity. I know this movie is a bit haggard, but I could not dislike it. <br /> <br /> Acting and the script are not the best. But the effects are good for a 30-year movie with a budget of $ 50 - the title character needs some time to melt, but when he does it quite impressively; we also have one ingenious death scene that includes electric shock. It is also worth mentioning music, it is crazy - a cheese-flavored blend of nonsense. <br /> <br /> Noteworthy: <br /> <br /> * See the nurse in slow motion, who jumps through the glass pane for absolutely no reason. <br /> <br /> * Be amazed by the day in the life of the severed head. <br /> <br /> * Watch out for a psychotic, cannibalistic, melting humanoid. His name is Steve. <br /> <br /> * Be surprised when our hero takes a break from hunting for a crazy nutty, to have a bowl of soup and complain about insufficient crackers in the kitchen. <br /> <br /> This movie is in 70 years, so that I would hate it. It's cheesy and tacky, but I thought it was fun. You can do a lot worse.
