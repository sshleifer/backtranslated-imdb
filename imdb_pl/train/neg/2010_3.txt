Oh, this is a movie - I thought I was waiting too long to take out the dog ... I can not believe I was watching the whole thing. I think I was optimistic that it would be better. A terribly chaotic dialogue, pathetic acting and completely unbelievable events. Like Toby's mother hanging up in time for Col to go upstairs and back to the room with the 24-inch ceiling, there are no chairs, no track or anything around her still suspended body that she could use to climb a little girl who she played the daughter of the last family, she was the best actor in the whole movie, and the puppy of the first pair was in second place. The basic story has potential, and thanks to good scripts and directors it can be a seriously frightening movie, but this version is unfortunately not. I am more and more scared when I open my electricity bill every month.
