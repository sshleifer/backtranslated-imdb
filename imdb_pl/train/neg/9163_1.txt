In "Przemy≈õl years" there are several heavy hits in the local and regional film and television scene. And yet they can not save this movie. He has so many things that go against it - over acting, overly melodramatic, poor script, inconsistent direction; and there are not enough things to do - good music, good pictures. This comment is intended primarily for anyone who, after watching the movie, casts all local movies into one basket and says that all local movies are bad. Please do not judge the rest based on this one movie. It is a television soap opera masked as a romantic feature film. My hopes were high when I bought a ticket and my hopes were interrupted for five minutes in the film.
