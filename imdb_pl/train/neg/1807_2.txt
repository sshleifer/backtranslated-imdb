I admit that after reaching the age of hippie age, I am a sucker of this kind of movies. I can enjoy a hint of the hippie genre much more than most "normal" people. However, this movie is simply awful in every possible way. <br /> <br /> Every banal perception of hippie stupidity is portrayed as a gospel, cops kill their young long hair as the plane lands quietly. This movie is so horrible that it is not even fun to see goofy on the excesses of a hippie drone. This is similar to the Dragnet's left version, with the exception of no professional actors. The only reason I gave him two stars was that there were some ambiguities on the soundtrack, and I could not find a choice for negative stars. <br /> <br /> There are no actors, almost no plot, sheeze, barely even a script ... you have it, the film "art" .... All this done with the slowness of drilling root canals, dragging any senseless scene just for that to fill time. <br /> <br /> In the bizarre turn of life imitating art, the nonactor star of the movie joined the commune in real life and robbed a bank in Boston, one of his thieves was killed and he was sent to prison where he was killed in a suspect raising the "accident" ... and just think that he must leave it for the legacy ... Oy vey.
