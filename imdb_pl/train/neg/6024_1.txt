I watched the movie about 30 minutes before I finally got tired of the fact that this movie was smashed over my head. The soundtrack, the so-called "plot" and every actor. It's as if everyone thought they were the main part of the movie and shouted "NOTICE ME!" Over and over again. A bad guy has his bad guy's music and talks about sinister, bad guys in case you do not get along. A good guy is doing bold and noble things in case you do not know he's a good guy. And for Lord, the airplane scene. "MY MALE IS MISSING! (And yes, I know his clothes were still there, but to be honest, she woke up and panicked before she could even look at the damn place he was in.) <br /> <br /> Like a religious girl, I want to apologize world for wasting a movie on which it was printed. <br /> <br /> And I want my 30 minutes back.
