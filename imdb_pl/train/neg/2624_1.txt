Saying that this movie stinks would be offensive to skunks. As another commentator says, this video is offensive to everyone aged 7 (especially extremely offensive to gays). This is awful - and not in a way "so bad it's funny" - it's just awful. No, I have to say: THIS IS THINKING! (Sorry, skunks). <br /> <br /> From the initial titles to the final titles, there is no more than 10 seconds of this movie worth your eyes to open. "The plot" is incoherent, the characteristics are non-existent, the acting is exaggerated in advance "look at me I am funny!" School and so on. The songs are awkwardly set (if at all) and they are badly made, just on every front - maybe apart from music, I do not remember thinking that music stinks (except songs). <br /> <br /> To be honest with the creators, they quickly place the cards on the table: the first points include the title "Also with Ertha Kitt as the voice of Betty the meteor" (because the meteor never said anything at all, only from time to time, muttering noise, which certainly contributed to raising the contribution of Mrs. Kitt from one of her albums). . "Uranium - geddit" Your anus "? geddit? What? huh ?? Your anus? Humor is really cheap. <br /> <br /> He says weird things about "comedies" from this period, because the hero could have intentionally shot dead people on the street, but do not say "sh * t" loud. <br /> <br /> I paid fifty pence (about $ 1.00) for this movie on sale. I feel cheated.
