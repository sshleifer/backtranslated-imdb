I watched the movie for 45 minutes and counted 9 colors. It's a mullet every 5 minutes. Seriously though, this movie is a living proof that the formula works. If it is not damaged, it does not require any repair. The heroine from the street, but defenseless, hardened was a martial arts policeman with a gold heart and a serial killer with "problems". Pure magic.
