It seems that the purpose of the much prolonged preparatory phase of this Star's history is birth, that the ultimate success would be even more exalted. Summer Phoenix is ​​very effective as an inarticulate young woman trapped in herself, but never convincing as a stage actress of growing fame who both defeats and derives profits from this distance. Even in the long scenes of Esther's acting lessons, we never see him do the teacher's instructions. After suffering through pain Esther (largely self-harming) in the tearful details, we have no convincing sense of her triumph. <br /> <br /> The obsessive presence of the heroine's pain seems to be a guarantee of aesthetic transcendence. However, the causes of this pain (poverty, quasi-autism, Judaism, sexual betrayal) never merge into a coherent whole. A 16-minute movie with a straight story should be able to roll loose ends. Esther Kahn is still not ready to go in front of the audience.
