A funny concept, but badly made. In addition to quite good makeup effects, there is not much. There are obvious problems; for example, after doing something that seems to be weeks and weeks to go from fat to normal size, the main character seems to go from normal size to deadly in a few days ... and when he is deadly thin, he remains almost as deadly thin for what seems to be a long time. <br /> <br /> In any case, the film has much worse problems - cinematography is definitely low-budget - the quality of television programs, and above all the game is pretty awful all around. Robert John Burke always seems to be asking for some bizarre, snarling impersonation of Charlton Heston and is literally painful to watch ... The only horrifying thing is that Lucinda Jenney and Kari Wuhrer are even worse. <br /> <br /> The only reason I give this film such a high level is that when the film comes in the last 1/3 and the character Joe Mantegna takes over the role, the film develops a fun, camp "cheese slaughterhouse" "And the crazy plans of the gangster to torment completely unbearable Gypsies are somewhat pleasant to watch. The ending, if it is predictable, is also nicely significant. Avoid unless you are King-o-Phile or REALLY you are excited by the idea that Fat Tony's voice from the Simpsons terrorizes the Gypsy camp.
