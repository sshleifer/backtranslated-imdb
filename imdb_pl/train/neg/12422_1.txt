I rented this movie to see what could be a bloody action movie non stop, and I got this too sentimental and super cheap drama with a low budget that makes the Kickboxer look like Die Hard. Lou and Reb are in Vietnam, and when Lou rescues Reba from the gang, he gets shot in the head, which is one of the worst effects in history. Scenes in Vietnam are shot in the yard, I swear! Lou is broken in his brain now, and Reb and he live together and have a bar. Super homoerotic. Lou is convinced he is fighting in the cage for money, and Reb is continuing his deadly madness to get him back. There are no good fight scenes, the blows are two inches from the person. Character personality changes in a few seconds. One guy is angry, and the next one is good. Acting is awful, and the music is too sentimental Frank Stallone song that will make you sick. I hated this movie.
