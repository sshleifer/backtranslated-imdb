It's a sad movie about a woman who thought her ex, who loves her so much, is probably dead, but in fact his dad's scientist has just cast a spell on him to turn him into this really cute shark. As if in Beauty and the Beast. She probably could have used the ballroom dance scene and maybe a few singing candlesticks, but instead there are some pretty large plants. They make this one really itchy, so it lets you devour the shark instead of scratching the whole movie. A scientist is a good dad who tries to connect his suspect son with a shark with a woman he was engaged to, even arranges time for sex, but a woman is really a shallow snob and thinks the shark is a ugly, disgusting monster and does not want to have nothing to do with him. She gave up love! Just because he was a shark! I thought it was very sad how she had to kiss him, and he would return to normal and live happily ever after, but this is not a movie.
