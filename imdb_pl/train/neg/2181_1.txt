I saw this movie thinking it would be one of those old B movies that are cool to watch. I was wrong! This film was boring and of course directed to men who like to look at stout women. This story was so unreasonable and unbelievable that it interested me completely. It seemed to be in the same genre as Ed Wood's films - the bottom of the barrel.
