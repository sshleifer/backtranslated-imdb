Recently, I was obsessed with this movie that I almost had to see it. Seeing it today, the rating of 5.8 is perfectly understandable. It seems to me that if you anticipate something so much that it becomes a terrible need, it turns out that it is not worth it. <br /> <br /> Sure, The Hills Have Eyes 2 has its moments. It has a very nice and well-developed story that fits well with the product itself, but the whole thing is so indulgent that it's hard to follow. And if it was not for the production of Wes Craven in this film, it would have nothing to do with the original remake. <br /> <br /> But the whole thing makes you go, "Is this supposed to be horror or COMEDY?" because there are many funny, randomly placed moments of jump and stupid liners (IE "There is a hand in sh ** er ! "Or" You mother ... "I will kill you all damn sons b ** tches!") And acting (God does not even remind me how bad it was. <br /> <br /> STORYLINE: (this part contains spoilers, Attention!) The film begins with a woman giving birth to a mutant child (ooh la la!), then the screen disappears in black with the appearance of the film title and monologue, and then we go to this office, where there are random mannequins of war veterans. <br /> <br /> Then we go to this military recruit training team in Baghdad. When the captain parades with them "Well done in stupidity" their last Day training takes place in New Mexico, in the desert where the family in the last THHE remained use, that they got stuck. Everything goes wrong during training, people die and ... do I have to tell you more? Because now I have the attention of the goldfish, who is forced to sit here and enter this. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with THHE2 is that it does not work. No flashbacks here, and the ending is quite safe ... but with a surprise! It's stupid. I'm sure that cutting the Ultra Super Director's Cut with the holographic cover and the ticket to The Hills Have Eyes 3 will show all its alternative endings, but at the moment I'm not sure I care. <br /> <br /> So, if you loved the first THHE so much, then almost no sin can see it, and then, just in case, see. But if so, avoid it at all costs. It's for your own good. <br /> <br /> 3/10
