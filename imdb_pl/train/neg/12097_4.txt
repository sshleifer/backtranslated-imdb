I did not count on much when I went to see it. After Mst3king from JasonX with a few friends, I was hoping for a similar experience here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film took too seriously. Do I care for Jason's problems? I'm sorry, no. There are still legionary Ft13 movies. At the end of the day he is an undead serial killer, I just will not have such compassion. <br /> <br /> Freddy was definitely the most interesting aspect of the movie with hallucinations, but unfortunately they were few and at the end of the movie turned into a bad deathmatch episode of celebrities ... just not funny. <br /> <br />
