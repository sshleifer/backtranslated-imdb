This movie is really unbelievable. I've seen so many cheap junk movies, especially lots of "full moons", but "Dollman" is really difficult. So many links: funny story, actors always on the edge of a parody and special effects! How long can I talk about them! It's a really bad movie, but also one of the funniest. If you're a fan of bad movies that you can laugh at, you have to see it. And do not miss "Dollman Vs. Demonic Toys. " It's really funnier and worse.
