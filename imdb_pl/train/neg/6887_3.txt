Another "son who will not grow up" flick, and other recently similar entries. Heder in another bad wig, telling Napoleon what, for the third time? Anna Faris is always forgotten; Jeff Daniels called at least from another state; and Diane Keaton ... how can you get tired so late in your career? Do not worry. Nothing is said here that has not been discussed many times. I will say this; it's about a hundred times better than "Failure To Launch". There are very few funny songs in the movie, unless you think Eli Wallach's curse is ridiculous. Ha ha! He's old and he dropped the f bomb! Tee, hee, hee. Pitiful!
