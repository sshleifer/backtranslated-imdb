Easily the most well-known of all Shakespeare's plays, it has been seriously collapsed here. Poor direction, stagnation in the studio and irregular performances spoil a good tragedy. <br /> <br /> In Verona, Capulets and Montagues have been struggling for centuries, but the tragedy is close when Romeo (Patrick Rycart) Montague falls in love with Juliet (Rebecca Saire), the kapuleta. Soon there will be a blood spill ... <br /> <br /> Working in the studio, especially in day scenes, seriously stops the game's energy. It is a story that deserves to be taken outside with its energy. Combined with this, the costumes are hideous, with too many tights and ridiculous straitjacket. The fight on the stage looks frightening, it stretches too much and runs to be addictive. <br /> <br /> Patrick Ryecart is too light to be really effective Romeo. He manages the intensity of the character when the action develops, but his dignified accent and nausea, often without eyes, limit its range. It is very difficult for the public to refer to Romeo. Rebecca Saire is too young to be a good Juliet - she grabs the naivety of the heroine, but a little more sassiness would be appreciated. <br /> <br /> Supporting roles do not do better. Joseph O'Connor's brother, Laurence, is fine, but too many of his best lines have been cut. Anthony Andrews' Mercutio belongs to the stage, not the camera. He's angry and over-gesticulate and, as a result, looks rather ridiculous. Alan Rickman, playing his role, practically does not have Tybalt's presence. He developed the advantage and intensity to ensure good performances on the screen in later years, but here it is not. The prince may be a great role in his short performances, but actor Lawrence Naismith gives no authority to any authority. Only Micheal Hordern, probably in his best role in this series, comes out with any dignity. His Capulet is well played and a joy to watch. <br /> <br /> Instead, see one of the other versions of this story.
