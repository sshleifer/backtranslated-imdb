This film has many negative comments and I have to agree with those who consider it to be one of the worst films in history. It is true that most of the films based on King's works are quite bad, but this movie goes beyond the realm of horrors. There is not one terrifying moment in this, unless you consider terrible stupidity. This is typical King's trash - myths twisted around that did not make sense at all, mixed up with the obvious and known so-called. It is full of funny moments, the least of which is the character of Alice Krige. When he goes crazy and starts to tremble like a villain in an old Batman TV series, it's so absurd that it can be nauseous. All the people who had episodes in this (including John Landis) are lucky to still have a career. But the most absurd part must be the cat costumes at the end, which look like cheap rubber clothes that someone bought in K-Mart. The best part of the movie is the appearance of some real cats that actually affect the people in the film.
