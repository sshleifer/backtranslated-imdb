This movie is a repetition of Warren Beatty's 1978 film "Heaven Can Wait", but it is written with a view to the comedy style of Mr. Rock. The premise remains the same: Lance Barton, (Rock) is taken before his life expires and works with God's representative, Mr. King, to return to Earth as someone else. As in Beatty's film; he chooses the murdered Charles Wellington, a rich white man, because he likes Sontee Jenkins (Regina King) who happens to be at Wellington's house during the murder. The role of Mrs. Wellington and her lover is suffering from this remake, and the idea of ​​turning an old white multimillionaire into a standing black comedian who tries to fool Sontee simply does not work. The spaces also showed Rock as Wellington, and then as a real "white" Wellington. The improvements could have been incorporated into Beatty's original story - which in itself was not masterfully depicting the idea of ​​life after death - but it certainly could not be found in "Down To Earth."
