For God's sake, please do not watch this movie! It is a waste of time, the plot is predictable, as are romantic scenes. Trying to build too much with a very small one, this movie and its bad predictable villain is simply bad. Characters are not developed, and most of the film is filled with shots from Rome, which is much more interesting than the actual movie. To top it all, acting is a disgrace. I know everyone is trying to find a niche, but it's really a catastrophe. I can not believe that someone actually paid many millions of pounds for putting this movie on the screen. Do not waste your money or time on this movie, go see your grandma or something valuable.
