This movie is a waste of time and money. During the whole hour and a half I was still waiting for everything to improve and it never happened. The movement was slow, the story was jumping around, it was not frightening or interesting and it really never was anything. The loans during the introduction were long and drawn, which was basically the same as the rest of the movie (long and drawn). Numerous parts of the plot did not make sense. Several times during the movie I thought that maybe "I rendered" because the plot was not compatible, but my companion had the same problem and assured me that I did not "step away" from boredom, but it was really a movie. I have never written about the film here before and I have been actively looking for films on IMDb for many years. So the fact that I really spend some time writing something should talk about how bad the film is and you should not waste time or money.
