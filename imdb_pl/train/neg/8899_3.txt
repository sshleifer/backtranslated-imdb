Where is it written that sequels must suck? Scream 2 no! Others do not! But this one is for sure ... problems include horrible actors (only Christopher Walken could act in the whole movie), bad writing (you never understand what's going on, and I even did research on the idea of ​​Nephilim before) terrible casting choices. Eric Roberts does the stupidest Michael Archangel I've ever seen in my life! <br /> <br /> Avoid it like a plague, unless you desperately want to see Christopher Walken. In this case, just scroll to the parts in which it is in the movie, and avoid others. <br /> <br /> Jech!
