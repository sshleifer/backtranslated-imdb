In a moment I'll go to the movie. First, someone wanted a "proof" of Clinton's comments in Georgetown, where he claimed that the US "deserved" the September 11 attacks. Well, here's what Clinton said: <br /> <br /> "In the first crusade, when the Christian soldiers took Jerusalem, first they burned a synagogue with 300 Jews and killed every woman and child who was a Muslim on the Temple Mount. I can tell you, that history is still told today in the Middle East and we still pay for it. <br /> <br /> We still pay for it? What does "we" mean, a pale face? Marines did not storm the Temple Mount. <br /> <br /> But to be honest, Clinton never really left and said firmly that we "deserved" 9-11. Like all his speeches during the presidency, they ALLEGED that we deserved 9-11. Just look at the "fact" of A, B, C and perhaps D, and let the listener conclude that they must add up to the conclusion of X. When in fact most of Clinton's "facts" added to the guacamole. <br /> <br /> But it does not matter. We're here to talk about movies, not about politics. Unfortunately, when Oliver "Captain Conspiracy" Stone makes a movie, you can not get away from his perverted policy. It was only a matter of time before he focused on his paranoia and bitterness in the Reagan Age, and what better time than when Stone's dreams almost came true, on the day that Reagan almost bought the farm. Not being able to find any evil plots or plans to assassinate Hinckley, one of Al Haig invents. From a simple misunderstanding of the constitutional power chain, Haig is transformed from a public official who should have come into contact with his resourceful community in a raging megalomaniac. You almost expect Haig to wipe his hands like Montgomery Burns and tell Cap Weinberger to "Free the hounds". Stone even recruits the saddest person in Hollywood to play our former secretary of state Richard Dreyfuss. The guy you love to hate in your eyes. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie is fine. The average, floating below the average. Do not bother with renting or buying. Try to catch him on the cable. 4 out of 10.
