Actually, it was quite funny ... in "god, how the hell did this movie." if you make fun of movies ... what am I doing ... go ahead and look ... but if you think "is this a good movie?" <br /> <br /> this movie has been pulled from the beginning, with the worst action I've ever seen in any movie ... they usually get five minutes before you realize that "this movie can suck" .. but no, you know right away ... this movie is about Edgar Allen Poe ... he never tried to explain it to people who did not remember Poe's life history ... so I do not know if any of these words is a fact. <br /> <br /> this film tells the story of the writer "etan poe" joining with his cousin "ann" ... both are descendants of edgar allana poe ... are they?!? evidently people give what their ancestors did, this guy ete poe is actually etan "Cautious", who should be the descendant of the story "healer's house" written by Edgar Allen, brother Ann sometimes appears to rape her ... Ann is also persecuted, at some point in the film, by three different people on the same street (seriously, three ... they are right behind her, staring at her and she does not even realize. characters who are murdered all the time, appear at the end to try to save the day ... but they can not. at the end ann shoots to ethan while he tries to kill her best friend. of course, before he shoots, he must shout "never again!" this movie should never be again!
