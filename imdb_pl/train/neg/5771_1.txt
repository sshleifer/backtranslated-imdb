I will start by apologizing filmmakers around the world for using the terms "filmmaker", "film" or "film" in connection with this, but "criminal" and "crime against humanity" seem a bit harsh. <br /> <br /> Scripture: pathetic. <br /> <br /> Director: pathetic. <br /> <br /> Acting: pathetic. <br /> <br /> Pictures: too clumsy for words. <br /> <br /> The technical skills used to mount this cruelty: NONE WHATSOEVER. <br /> <br /> This lump of waste is hardly known as cinema. Most home movies are coming closer to this award than Revenge Quest. No, it's just a 10-story car caught on video. <br /> <br /> We will skip the plot in this review because there are far too many openings that can be covered right away. Let's say it stinks worse than the rest of the movie. Calling a one-dimensional actor would give them credit. What is not enough is terrible at the beginning and much worse than the terrible video and editing. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this cruelty, in addition to the plot, would have to be effects ... or rather a disturbing lack of it. There are no empty spaces in the guns, there are no flashpots, and what few sound effects existed were either gun action sounds or mouths (yes, you read it well). The director had the boldness to record the sound of "shh" for the elevator door; It seems to me that he felt that they sound more futuristic. This is to be finally established in 2031. This, however, does not explain the sounds that he made with his lips in the scenes of fighting fists. <br /> <br /> If it was not bad enough, the sound quality is awful (it just used the mounted microphone on the video camera, and it shows it), the use of gun sounds was almost worse than the lack of any sounds. Sound effects stand out from the rest of the soundtrack like drunken sheep and are just as clumsy. Imagine this: a bad guy enters the office building in search of his victim. The lady is afraid of fear. He raises the weapon (uzi) and shakes it. We hear a sound that is clearly not Uzi. The woman escapes from the camera and suddenly a single packet of blood (only 1) explodes on her back (it looked like she was hit by paintball) and she falls on her face. <br /> <br /> Jump in the idea that my description is far too correct for the ineptitude of the real sequence. <br /> <br /> In a different sequence that almost - but not quite - makes the movie so funny that it can be watched, it takes place in the stairwell. The bad guy chases a good guy and a lady who protects him up the stairs, shaking the plastic Uzi all the way. You may want to jump; there are badly planned sound effects everywhere. <br /> <br /> I thought that Alan DeHerrery could not be closed at the conception of this train wreck, but he went on to edit and release it. If there is any justice, there is definitely some karma with his name there. <br /> <br /> If you decide to view this lump of industrial waste - and strongly advise against it - you must watch the whole scene almost literally raised Bladerunner, and AM radio doubled the walkie-talkie. Try not to focus too much on the story; it will only hurt you if you do. <br /> <br /> 0 stars out of 10. And that's generous.
