Who likes horrible "comedies" like Little Mosque on the Prairie? The only two kinds of people I can think of who watch this: One, Muslim and self-proclaimed liberal defenders of every ethnic group who are so excited, is a show about Muslims, that even it does not matter if the performance is good or even fun ( what is not). Two old people and people whose idea for comedy is incredibly predictable, badly written, outdated joke. <br /> <br /> CBC must really look at what he's doing and who their audience is. If they write only a comedy for really old people, then guess what will happen, their audience will soon die and the audience will not remain. I would be curious who even writes for this concert? Do you think it's Muslims or fashionable, funny young people? No, I bet they are old white guys who write the same jokes for the same kind of bad CBC programs since the 1960s. <br /> <br /> When you look at CBC comedies, Air Farce was just He got airborne (thank God!), but we still have lame ducks such as This Hour Has 22 Minutes and Rick Mercer, for which we pay, not to mention this weak excuse for the "comedy" Small Mosque on the Prairie. This is supposed to be offensive and fun? Only CBC thinks that this lame show is offensive or funny at all. It's a shame for CBC for wasting our taxes on shows that only a few people will worry about.
