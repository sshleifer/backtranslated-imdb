This film is probably pro-Muslim. <br /> <br /> Why am I writing this? The main character has a Muslim father and a Christian mother. He lives in the Christian village for the first 20 years. At the end of the film, he seems to be a Muslim because he has a headgear that he kept his amulet and his general clothes. He has a six-year-old child who bears the same headgear and is therefore probably a Muslim, although the mother is a Christian. It seems that the main character is a Muslim, and his child becomes a Muslim. None of the other main male heroes who are Christians seem to give birth to a child. At the end of this world there are more Muslims in the world, which is why it seems.
