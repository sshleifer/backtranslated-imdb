I needed an excuse to leave the house when the paint was dry - I left the movie after an hour to come back and see the paint dried up. <br /> <br /> I do not recall ever going out on a movie, but I really tried to stay. The screenplay was not dependent on the cast and it just was not working well - give me a break! Uma Thurman does this? Pretty bad special effects. They were older characters and actors who make superficial horny 20 lives, just something like annoying and bad feelings. <br /> <br /> This review is based only on the first hour - it could have improved. I just had to go home and see if the paint had dried in a darker shade than when it lasted.
