in this movie, spanking Joe Pesci threatens basketball. joe pesci ... <br /> <br /> and being consistent, the rest of the script is not equally reliable. <br /> <br /> pesci is a funny guy who saves this movie from sinking in the back of the basement, but other roles were quite bad. my father was a greedy businessman who valued money more than people, which was not even well played. instead of being an archetypal villain, he seemed more like an amorous android programmed to earn money at all costs. then there is a symbolic piece attributed to the song as a girl or something ... I do not even remember ... it was that forgetful. <br /> <br /> anyone who evaluates this movie above 5 or 6 is a paid member of a film studio trying to improve the reputation of this sunken movie, or at least one of those millions of media servants who can not criticize effectively (you know, people who feel bad if they give something tick below 6). <br /> <br /> stay away ... far away. and shame in the central comedy where I saw this movie. they usually choose better.
