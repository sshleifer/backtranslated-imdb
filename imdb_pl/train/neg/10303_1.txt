*** Comments include spoilers. *** I barely stayed on the show as a TV show when they started annoying music under EVERY SCENE when Don Epps averaged almost every shot when the very nasal Diane Farr was obviously pregnant (but we should not notice it ) and when Colby was a ***** TRIPLE agent. But now, in today's episode, David is trapped in paranoid work, which is a real amateur with a gun, in an elevator, and ... CAN NOT REDUCE IT. A trained, experienced field agent who many times was the first in the door and has experience in melee combat, CAN NOT MAKE NECK WORK. No, when we say that work with nuts blinks, looks away, drops her head, closes her eyes; even when looking at a fiber optic cord that snakes on the ceiling like a stripper on a pole for 20 seconds. <br /> <br /> Then came the scene that let me know that I like to learn from chubby, frumpish, but very charming Charles Epps and his sexy business / love Amita, my Friday evenings will be better spent differently involved. Don gives David the "word of danger" which is the code "S ** t intends to fall"; David is ready, they kill the lights, they throw the elevator, they surprise with a note and ...... <br /> <br /> David CAN MOVE / KILL / STOP JOB. The bad guy ends up with BOTH GUNS, David ends SHOT. <br /> <br /> I'm done. I hope that NUMB3RS is great fun.
