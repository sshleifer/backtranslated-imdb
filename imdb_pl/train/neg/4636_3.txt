The "Private" part was intended to draw attention to the popularity of the popular "Lurid" magazine of the same name, while the workers' motif was linked to the main congressional investigations of that day. However, despite the cast of the B-class movie and some good ideas for the script, the film lasts 73 minutes. It is a production with a cheap jack. What is needed to compensate for the poor value of production is imagination, especially from the little-inspired director Sidney Salkow. For example, several photos from a daytime location would help ease the order of gloomy studio sets. A stylish helmsman, like Anthony Mann, could have done something with thick ear material, but Salkow treats it as another paid exercise. It is a pity that the typical style of Brian Keith in the low-key style does not work here, as an ordinary wooden and lethargic, and at the same time the cult figure of Elish Cook Jr. goes to the forehead as a drunk with wild eyes. Apparently, Salkow is not an actor director. But you must give this to the small number Beverly Garland, who treats his role with characteristic verve and devotion. It is a pity that she did not lead. My advice - skip it, unless you're in a funny bar-girls, who do nothing else but to distract whiskey in a 50-year-old style.
