I just hope that none of the classicists / ancient historians have seen "Cleopatra", and if so, they accepted it as laughter. The film is frighteningly inaccurate, even more funny than "Gladiator" (at least a well-written script whose historical mistakes are articulated and correspond well with history). The most glaring is Octavius, the heir of Caesar, in the Senate before the murder of Caesar: at the age of 19! <br /> <br /> Besides, acting is mediocre. Timothy Dalton has more than James Bond when he says, "Caesar. Julius Caesar". Billy Zane is a ridiculously thick Mark Antony. And Leonor Varela tries to be a seductive pharaoh (who in fact was not handsome at all), but he is unbelievable. <br /> <br /> So this is a warning for all historians - this movie is not compatible with life!
