I put this movie in a hotel room to entertain children in the morning when we were leaving home, because I packed all their toys. (Young children do not like "Regis and KAthie Lee" or "The View".) My four-year-old found a funny scene, but she told me that the rest were "too stupid". This is FOURTH YEAR, people. Anyone who exceeds the age of, say, nine, will want to kill his television, and not let it play alone. <br /> <br /> To say that this movie is bad is how to say that the Holocaust was a small mistake. There are no words how funny and completely horrible this "movie" is. Acting is bad, the plot is stupid, and the script is pitifully indecent. Because it's supposed to be a comedy, the fact that you can not even laugh at a bad movie makes it even worse. Bronson "Balki" Pinchot is the worst with some strange false accent (Irish-Pakistani-Bronx-Cockney-Cajun, as far as I know), but all characters are terrible. I have not seen the real Laurel and Hardy movie for ages, but I KNOW they MUST be much better. What is the point of ruining a classic comic book with ... this? <br /> <br /> Bottom line: derived garbage. Avoid at all costs, unless you have some bizarre fetish Bronson Pinchot. 2/10
