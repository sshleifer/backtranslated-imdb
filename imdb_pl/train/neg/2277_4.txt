"The Vampire Bat" is definitely interesting, it is one of the early horrors describing species from the thirties, but in isolation everything is a bit too squeaky for real praise. <br /> <br /> The film is set in a European village in the 19th century, where vampirism assigns a series of murders to suspected residents. It is very similar to James Whale's "Frankenstein", which adds to the character of Dr. Niemann Lionel Atwilla, along with his erroneous ideas for scientific development. <br /> <br /> The subject of the vampire is arbitrary and only used as a red herring by the suspicion that he will fall on Herman's loving prostate bat (Dwight Frye), thus providing an excuse for the crowd with a torch to go on a rampage - as if they needed him. <br /> <br /> This is one of the three early horrors in which Lional Atwill and Fay Wray performed (also "Doctor X" and "The Mystery of the Wax Museum") and like their other collaborations the film suffers from recklessness comic relief and a tendency to move from horror to the main elements of the thriller. Considering the context, "The Vampire Bat" is still weak and derivative. <br /> <br /> We only have a bad quality Frankenstein imitation, with elements of a vampire purely a device to confuse Dracula's fans. But in the case of the title, the film would be difficult to consider as a horror movie and it is worth noting that the director Frank Strayer made the films "Blondie" a few years later.
