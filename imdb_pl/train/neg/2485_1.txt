A film like Bulletproof is just one: it reminds you how bad it can be. We often see movies that we describe as "quite awful" or "not good enough", but then one hits such a movie and it can be seen that although all these other films are not "good", they are not as bad smelly as Bulletproof. It was a birthday present from someone who spent less than two seconds, rummaging in the "DVD basket at our local supermarket to fulfill the commitment (ie Give me a gift). This could have been an unexpected discovery, but it was not: it is so banal, so badly written, so badly targeted, so badly preserved that I'm surprised that everyone involved has not been arrested and sent for 10 years. God, it's terrible. I suspected for about 30 seconds, but I continued because sometimes - sometimes - bad movies are so bad that they can be pleasant. This is not one of them. It's just bad. I stopped watching after 45 minutes and tomorrow I will throw him into the basket.
