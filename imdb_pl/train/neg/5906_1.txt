This movie was terrible. The plot was broken, the acting was bad, the editing was inept, and this movie forced me to take my eyes off. I would like to have time spent watching this movie. The balloon scene was stupid, Mormon's jokes are really old, the soundtrack has been sucked, I have not seen the chemistry between the two tracks, it's full of stereotypes, stupid local scene of "celeb" ... Del's was most often recorded "I'm going to drive as fast as I want to ... "Computer idiot. The worst part is that these actors had to play alone on the spiritual side and even screwed up. This film helps create a long line of nondescript efforts to incorporate the LDS beliefs into Hollywood. IT MEANS. RM, church ball, etc. I would give up watching this movie and instead ran my head to the brick wall. You will be more entertaining than watching this poor excuse for the show.
