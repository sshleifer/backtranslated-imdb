Timberlake's performance almost caused an attack on the screen. It was not bad, I just think that the role of reporters was bad for him. <br /> <br /> LL Cool J played the typical role of the rapper, the toughest and the worst guy in the area. I do not think there is a smile in the whole movie, even if it was offered to his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman almost carries the whole movie. He had some funny scenes that are the highlight of the movie. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey was not good or bad he was just "there". <br /> <br /> Generally, it's a boring movie. bad plot. many bad roles or bad roles for actors.
