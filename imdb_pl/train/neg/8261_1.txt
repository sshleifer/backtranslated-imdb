I was looking forward to watching this movie, and then I realized that all hope for a coherent dialogue between the actors was sunk by unnecessary curses. Now I'm not prudish in any way, but shouting curses is not a good movie. Ewan Bremner is probably one of the worst actors in the world at the time (a witness to his performance in the god of horrible life of things), and his accent "Cockney" is almost as bad as his accent in Edinburgh. Avoid. How many more "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" and "Beautiful Creatures" movies we have to suffer before the filmmakers realize that the word f, word etc. is not a substitute for proper dialogue.
