This film can be assessed from three points of view: as a history, as an Amina profile, as a fictional thriller. <br /> <br /> It does not succeed as a story, it mentions the coup d'Ã©tat which he threw Obote, expulsions of Asians and has hi-jack Entebbe as a backdrop, but not in any chronologically coherent time span. <br /> <br /> Amina's profile could be interesting because Forest Whitaker is incredibly good, and if it was a better movie, he would get an Oscar. (He got it - which proves that the Oscars' voters do not watch the films they vote for.) He ignores important historical episodes in the novel that watched Amin and Uganda's story from the doctor's point of view. Instead, he talks about the fictional history of the Scottish doctor and his impossible love life from Amin's point of view. But the story is told the incident in which Amin was probably innocent. <br /> <br /> As a fictional thriller, there is no conspiracy to keep it. The beginning is tense - it takes a fictional cinematic freedom, but creates a story. The character of the doctor is well defined, but he gets lost in the second half of the movie, which suffers as a result. <br /> <br /> Why is the doctor deciding to stay in Kampala misunderstood - seduced by power? Why is nobody making friends strange. The figure of a friend in the novel has been lost because the Scot has an affair instead of a black doctor - a ridiculous entanglement that seems even unreliable, but allows the writers to show the cruelty of Amin at hand. A man named Horse at the end is risky. <br /> <br /> Finally, in 1971 Uganda went left, not right, license plates were three letters and two or three numbers - and where are Equator's fangs ?! <br /> <br /> In short - if you've never heard of Amin, you can spend two hours watching this movie to appreciate Forest Whitaker's acting, but the last hour will bore you into confusion. If you know Uganda or have read a book - you do not see the movie - it only depresses you. And if you want to know why the doctor was so imprudent - he was not.
