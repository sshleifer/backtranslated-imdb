Jeux d'enfants, or how the movie was mis-translated into English. Love me, if You Dare is a movie created by stupid people and fools. I just do not know how I could expect something worth seeing from a movie with such an intrigue: Two stupid ignorants assume that each of them will do something (certainly very idiotic) to prove to each other are "cool guys". I know that I have exaggerated some aspects, but that's what the whole film is all about. They get old ... and instead of realizing that they are just a few alienated freaks, they're still doing their crazy things, thinking they're great people. <br /> <br /> You could expect this movie from Hollywood, but France? It is even more insulting to watch a film from a country that Amelie created a few years ago, which, with the help of a film, tries to look, but it is far, far away from. <br /> <br /> Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.
