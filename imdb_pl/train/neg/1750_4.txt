HERA PHERI Priyadarshana was a cool situational comedy. However, this film lacks a story, but it is quite funny, but it is not logical. <br /> <br /> In fact, this is not the right story, but somehow it works well, although it is not a big deal <br /> < br /> The first half has two funny scenes, like the one where Akshay and John invite Neha for lunch, and the second half when Paresh comes in. <br /> <br /> The first half gets boring, but the other half is more fun, Although it is not a script <br /> <br /> The jokes are fun, but you may wonder how they never hear the voices of each person inside? <br /> <br /> Confusion at the climax is treated like a stage game, but it's quite fun. But the movie suddenly ends. <br /> <br /> The direction is fine. Music is good. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar excels in his role, which now becomes his second skin, but this is his movie completely and he outshines everyone else. <br /> <br /> John stumbles across the comedy Paresh Rawal is cheerful. Rajpal is fine. Girls ar Sometimes loud and uncomfortable Nargis, Daisy and Neet (only Neet is now seen) are good in part, but all too often yell Manoj Joshi is okay
