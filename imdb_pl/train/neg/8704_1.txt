Generally I like movies with dinosaurs, but this one is clean. Without a script, no dialogues, no acting. And brave Colonel Rance, trying to show that it is hard, so curved mouth reminiscent of the twin brother, stupid Proctor of the Police Academy. So it was a complete waste of time (fortunately not wasting money, as I saw a movie on TV). And I really can not understand the 7 people who rated this sh * t 10. They had to joke. My advice, if you see this title, start with this!
