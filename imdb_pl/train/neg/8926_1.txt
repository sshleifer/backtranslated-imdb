I saw "Myra Breckinridge" when it first appeared in 1970. I was a healthy twenty-year-old who loved movies and liked Raquel Welsh very much. Besides, I read the novel Gore Vidal, on which she was based, and I thought it was very funny. I saw the film on the local driveway and about halfway I was very tempted to turn on the engine of my car so that I might die of poisoning with oxide and did not have to watch the rest of the film wreck. He was not "smart" or "fashionable", he was disgusting and messy. All the actors were deaf and the director did not have the slightest idea what he was doing. The cast of Mae West was one of the worst choices in film history. As one of the reviewers said, her role had nothing to do with the movie or the book. Her character in the book is sexually assaulted by a young stud who would never do it for the legendary West. Oh, no, the plot has changed, so HIM is sexually beat, very reliable from a 77-year-old woman who looks every day her age. I can continue, but why? It was a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Bluto
