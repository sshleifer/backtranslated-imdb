It gives a nice, deep cast, but it's better for the thriller to deliver more than actors and conversations. The first third of this movie is nothing but conversation and more conversations. Most of them are a group of women who talk to each other. <br /> <br /> The first five actors on the list here are women who confirm that it is really a "chick" and not much more. This is probably a game on the Lifetime network. <br /> <br /> There was a quick scene of the murder and then more talks. They lost me in the middle. <br /> <br /> By the way, Sally Field was around 15 years old here.
