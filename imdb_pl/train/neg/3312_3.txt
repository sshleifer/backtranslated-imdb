... but I regret that I saw it. Since IMDb assessments are relatively high (and they also had to be relatively high in Netflix), I think I put them in my queue because it is advertised as a mild comedy from the UK, a category that produced many movies that I liked immensely. On the other hand, "Saving Grace" belongs to the category of comedy without laughter, which is usually filled by Hollywood films produced and directed by talent. Brenda Blethyn is a talented actress, and I liked her in other movies. The concept - a gardener growing marijuana to overcome the poverty she struggles with after her husband's death - does not offend me. Despite the efforts of the cast, to create humor, the film falls flat on the face (falling flat on the back may be more fun) when it comes to me and my wife. Be warned, oh a gentle reader, not all unusual British comedies succeed. This one is a dud.
