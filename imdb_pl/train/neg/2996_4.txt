Born Again is an unusual episode from the first season. He deals with the subject of reincarnation and simply does not fly. I have never been great in reincarnation and this could have been part of my apathy for this episode. Refers to the case of Tooms, which is a nice continuation of the previous episode. But the positives end there. Which is unfortunate, because it happens at the beginning of the episode. I think it's ridiculous that a dead guy would decide to reincarnate in a completely unrelated girl's body. And she waits for the girl to turn eight and begin to demand revenge. There is even a serious lack of witty dialogue between Mulder and Scully to keep the stretch on the surface. If you're in reincarnation, maybe this episode is your street. If not, you can find out what bradycardia is.
