The great Ecstasy of Robert Carmichael is a bad film in every respect. A script, a gloomy pace, a lack of depth in any form, senseless threads, frightening acting, unnecessary climax - all this makes it the worst movie I've ever seen. I did not find anything sympathetic, pleasant or intellectually stimulating in any way. <br /> <br /> I imagine that the creators of the film thought they were doing something clever and dark, with its mood lighting, long, long silence and a somewhat tiresome classic soundtrack. If so, they completely failed. It just bored me and I regret that I never saw it. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
