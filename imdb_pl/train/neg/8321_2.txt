Hayden Christianson and Jessica Alba, two of my least favorite actors of this century, are probably joining the most flat remake of the Dark Butterfly Effect. Awake is so boring and so completely uninteresting that it is better to sleep. Terrance Howard is still recovering after a diabolical August rush, he puts a decent fight as a sadistic doctor who seems hellishly willing to kill Christianson and after seeing his performance I will be happy to help. <br /> <br /> Alba, still recovering after the fantastic four Rise of the Silver surfer. It is naturally catastrophic and as unbearable as ever. Only once was she quite brilliant in the safe hands of the directing director Robert Rodriguez in Sin City. Is it possible that Jessica alba is not as poor as an actress, because most deserve that her acting skills are burdened by a bad script. If so, it would explain Awake. What about the script that would embarrass Plan 9 from space. <br /> <br /> Jessica Alba, Hayden Christenson and Terrence Howard play for the first time in the director / scriptwriter Joby Harold in a nervous psychological thriller about a man who experiences a terrifyingly universal surgical phenomenon known as "aesthetic consciousness" in which those who they were placed on the operating table, they are fully aware of what is going on around them, even though they are completely paralyzed and unable to cry for help. When a young, successful young man (Christenson) goes under the knife and realizes that the anesthesia did not fulfill his task, the horror quickly begins when his worried wife (Alba) waits anxiously and the frightening drama unfolds in the operating theater. <br /> <br /> Hoping for the operating tables that Final Destination made for planes, this first effort of director Joby Harold revolves around freezing blood. The sequence of advances tells us that one in 700 people suffer from a phenomenon called "anesthesia awareness", where the patient remains conscious but paralyzed during surgery. One of these unfortunate individuals is Clayton Beresford Jr. (Hayden Christensen) who feels awake during a heart transplant ... and can feel every single piece. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly ingenious, when he probes his psyche torture, Awake does not inject real terror into his novel premise. Moving from cool simplicity to the absurd conspiracy, her slim turns from Christensen and Jessica Alba hinder her. Do you want me to quit calming agent before watching? <br /> <br /> WERDICT: Awake is extremely undemanding at best. A film without punching, which no doubt looked better on paper. As a movie, although it is terribly general and unusually evolved. Awake does not inject terror into its novel premise. The end result is really bad. Alba and Christian are the least of your worries, because the main disadvantage of films is their inability to scare the audience. Awake is a movie that you're probably going to sleep with.
