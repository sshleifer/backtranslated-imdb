With Bo Derek's film, the audience gets what they expect. A paper thin plot and a few pictures of Mrs. Derek without clothes. "Spirits can not do it." The first fifteen minutes are just a television drama, if Scott [Anthony Quinn] is alive. He is a very good actor with many years of experience in many different roles, but it seems that even a famous actor sometimes has to work only for money. Because Derek is against, always playing a strikingly handsome young woman with or without clothes. Film is a total waste of time. If you want to see Quinn, hire Lawrence from Arabia or La Strada. If you want to see naked women or bad acting, rent any porn movie.
