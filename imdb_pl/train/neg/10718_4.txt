Come on, Tina Fey, you can do better. As soon as the movie started, I knew how it would end. Sure, it was sometimes fun. Even laughter loudly funny. But there is not enough laughter to save this movie. I do not recommend buying this. At most I recommend renting, but that's all. Baby Mama has a few funny scenes, but she is predictable and does not try to make her hearty ending. <br /> <br /> Tina Fey and Amy Poalher have created a good team. Mean Girls is one of my favorite movies. Tina Fey and Amy Poalher did a great job and they do it well. But this is not the best. Baby Mama had a great cast. Cook data, Sigourney Weaver and Steve Martin add splendor to the cast. <br /> <br /> Another pregnancy movie hit the world of cinema. After the big Knocked Up and Juno, Baby Mama looks very average in comparison. Knocked Up and Juno are fun, cordial and have endings that leave you with a smile on your face. The ending of Baby Mama was unpalatable and boring. <br /> <br /> Baby Mama was not the best comedy of the year and does not try to be. I recommend it, but do not expect it to be completely fun. Expect an average comedy that does not give you a huge emotional end to trying to achieve. DajÄ™ Baby Mama ..... <br /> <br /> 4/10
