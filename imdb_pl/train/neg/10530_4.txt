Disappointing musical version of "Anne and the king of Siam" Margaret Landon, filmed in 1946 with Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison, Deborah Kerr cast as a widowed teacher and mother who travels from England to Siam in 1862 to accept the job as a teacher of many children of the king - and maybe they teach Royal One or two in this process! Stagy's image starts well, but loses energy and focus quickly. Yul Brynner, reviving his triumph on the stage as a King, is a proof of presence, but is used - according to imaginary history - as a buffoon. Kerr retains his cool dignity and better results despite the need to synchronize with vocal Marni Nixon. Perhaps already playing this part to death, Brynner looks like he had nothing to translate on the screen except for the bombast. The second half with Anna and moppetami depicting the musical version of "Uncle Tom's cabin" is quite ridiculous, and Rodgers and Hammerstein's songs are usually heavy. Brynner won an Academy Award for Best Actor, but it is a pugnacious Kerr who holds the bomb over the water. Long, heavy and "old-fashioned" in the worst sense of the word. ** with ****
