Considering the people involved, it is difficult to understand why this movie should be so boring and boring. Two years later, writer David Ward wrote the amazing movie "Sting", Jane Fonda just won an Oscar for Klute, and Donald Sutherland just did an excellent job in such films as "Klute," "Start revolution without me," and "Kelly's Heroes." Otherwise, the film is a story about capers, with a small gang of inept losers planning a big assault. At the same time, the film wants to be a fashionable satire, a series of comedy sketches of this type, which the NBC TV show "Saturday Night" would do so well two years later. The bad result is that the plot makes comedy fragments seem awkward and forced, and the disconnected parts of the comedy destroy all the tensions that an attack may have. It is literally a film that breaks into one another, just like cars in demolition scenes are falling into each other. <br /> <br /> The only thing that interested me was watching Jane Fonda. Her "Iris Caine" is supposed to be a lightweight figure of her dramatic figure of a prostitute Bree Daniels in "Klute". However, for a moment she does not believe her. Always Jane Fonda pretending to be a prostitute we're watching. It's a terrible performance because her performance in "Klute" was great. It would be a good lesson for the actors to make two films together to show how the same actress in the same role can be great or pathetic. This suggests that the actors are as good as their writers and directors.
