Man, if I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> 1) Adam Arkin is more tearful than Ross Geller from "Friends" <br /> <br /> 2) A great cast is wasted (Kenneth Mars, Alan Arkin, Ed McMahon, Pat Morita, Louis Nye) with this amateur script. <br /> <br /> 3) The movie suffers from terrible stimulation. It jumps in a chaotic, misleading way. <br /> <br /> 4) History does not even make sense. Why does he want to break the football band? And what about this stupid violin music? None of this is explained. <br /> <br /> 5) It's not even funny. It's like a bunch of accountants trying to improvise, saying: "Look at me! Look at me, I'm funny! "It was a bad attempt to do another" Love At First Bite ". <br /> <br /> I like Larry Cohen's films, but man did not succeed here. I could not wait for the loans to start spinning. Terribly disappointed.
