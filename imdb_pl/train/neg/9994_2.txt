Hmmm, the sports team is in a plane crash, is trapped on a snowy mountain and faces a difficult decision to eat the meat of its dead companions to survive. Sounds familiar? I refer to "Alive" from 1993. The only significant difference, of course, is that the big white drunken Yeti appears several times to tear the dead away. I think people taste better than what. <br /> <br /> Stupid: the man in the first scene does not have a reliable firearm while hunting the Yeti, nor does he have a backup. <br /> <br /> The airplane crash is completely false. Or it would explode in the air, it would explode when it hit the ground or it would be blurred. People would not survive, but hey, it's sci-fi. <br /> <br /> Stupid: they survived and are cold. It may be a good idea to use some of the burning remains nearby so that they do not freeze to death. The fire is warm as it is ... <br /> <br /> WTF: The pilot has frost formed all over his face when he is alive and talking, but strangely, no one else does it. <br /> <br /> Stupid: One of the guys tells others to look for matches and lighters, but around them are scattered parts of the plane NA FIIEÅƒ. <br /> <br /> Stupid: They find coats and sweatshirts, but they do not use hoods in the coolness of the Himalayas! <br /> <br /> Stupid: they stare at the pile of sticks when, I repeat, there are pieces of the plane THERE ARE SMOKING. <br /> <br /> Stupid: The Himalayas are famous for storms. It would be common sense for them to collect rubbish to strengthen their structure rather than sit outside. There are many pines around, whose branches are excellent insulation. <br /> <br /> WTF: If in doubt, use the dead man's arm as a splint. <br /> <br /> WTF: If this guy knows so much about the hibernation habits of squirrels, bears and leopards in the Himalayas, why does not he know enough to take shelter and set the traps right from the start? <br /> <br /> Stupid: Trying to trap wild animals, thoughtless conversation near the mentioned trap always helps. <br /> <br /> WTF: Do you know how hard it would be to freeze a corpse with a piece of glass ?! <br /> <br /> WTF: The group was ready and armed to fight the Yeti, while the other two were defenseless. Yeti snatched his heart and hit the girl's head, and the gang did nothing. There is love. <br /> <br /> And so two Yeti and a comfortable avalanche, to bury evidence forever .... or so we think. Mwuhahahaa! The story continues with more idiocy, but as usual, most of the action takes place in the last 15 minutes. Nice thinking with javelin and chain, although it's ingenuity (with a magically appearing chain) that was missing at the beginning of the movie, when they could not even start a fire despite being around them. br /> <br /> As is typical of Sci-Fi Originals, a loving couple kisses at the end, as if nothing terrible happened to them (not to mention that they ate the human body and did not wash their teeth for several days). <br /> <br /> The end, however, is a bad quote.
