This must definitely be the worst movie I've seen in the last 20 years. When I saw Michael Madsen in it, I figured it could not be a bad movie because he was in pretty decent movies and he was quite an honest actor. WRONG! No one should waste time on this movie. I quickly scrolled through 80 percent and I do not feel that I missed something.
