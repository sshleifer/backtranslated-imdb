This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, EXTREMELY boring with lots of boring dialogues and VERY annoying characters and a funny looking creature. The only reason I watched this piece of rubbish was because it was on this 8-disc horror set. The plot is ridiculous and completely stupid, like the finale. No blood, like never, except for a few bloody traces on creation and several bloody gunshot wounds. Acting is terrible! Richard Cardella is horrible as the sheriff and he was quite funny and his character is annoying. Glen Roberts is a comical relief and it was not fun at all! Mark Siegel is very annoying and NOT too FUNNY! Bob Hyman is decent, but not much more. Richard Garrison is annoying and has no chemistry with Kacey Cobb, ever. Kacey Cobb is like this here and there is no chemistry with Richard. Generally, Avoid this piece of rubbish at all costs! BOMB with 5.
