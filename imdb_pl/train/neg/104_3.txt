On the way to a small town, which lies far from the beaten trails (but looks suspiciously close to the highway), the reporter encounters a strange hitchhiker who agrees to help her direct her to the goal. A strange man tells a few macabre stories related to this area: in the first story an adulterous couple conspires to kill a woman's husband, but in the end, when attacked by zombies, they will have a much worse fate; In the second story, a group of campers is interrupted when an undead outcast begins to fear that his tomb will end. <br /> <br /> Zombie Chronicles is an attempt by writer Garrett Clancy and director Brad Sykes to create an anthology about zombies? a nice idea, but with only two stories falls pitifully short. And this is not the only way that this low-budget film is going to fail: acting is poor (with Joe Haggerty, as told by Ebenezer Jackson, giving one of the strangest performances I've ever seen); the locations are not very inspired; the script is gloomy; there is a sex scene with zero nudity; And the end ... well, it's a lure of faith. <br /> <br /> To be honest, some of Sykes' creative works are effective (although the artificial technique used by the heroes in the forest is a bit overused), and cheap gore Joe Castro is enthusiastic: the ear is chewed, the eyeballs are pulled out, the face it is removed, the brains are crushed, and a disorderly decapitation follows. These positive features make the movie bearable, but warn you, The Zombie Chronicles is not a walk through the park, even for seasoned viewers with the Z-grade Trash. <br /> <br /> I give The Zombie Chronicles 2/10, but I will generously raise my rating to 3, because I was unable to watch the film with the benefit of 3D (although I suspect that the additional dimension would not make such a big difference).
