What an empty and glorious performance of the classic novel. I would like people to stop playing with classics when they clearly have no idea about the real intent or point of the original. This version is not different. I felt that the Ralph Fiennes version was much worse, because casting Juliette brioche as Kathy must be the worst decision EVERYONE ... anyway back to this version. Its aim is to make history relevant to the contemporary environment and musical style. It works in both, but high art is no wonder. Throwing watching on a rainy day can ... The direction was mediocre and the editable bottomless. Worse than the old Quincy. Deepak Verma performs a great turn as Hindley and is in fact one of the British wasted talents. Part of Heath was played with great grace and conviction and I think that casting is the strongest point of this project. Although a more talented director would make better use of his facilities. It is clear that he was a director for rent and did not instill the project with the passion he deserved.
