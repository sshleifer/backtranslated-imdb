(spoilers) One of the truly unforgettable parts of this fairly boring and lukewarm piece of British cuisine is the henna-henna Steiner, one of the worst dye works in history. This and the gorgeous eyebrows on the old bad guy who tried to steal the invention of Steiner. MST3K does an admirable job, making a ridiculously boring and gray funny movie. I especially like it when Crow kills Mike with his "touch of death" and when he brings him to life in the theater, Mike cries, "Guys, I died, I saw eternal truth and beauty! oh, this is the movie ... "It would be a disappointment, I had to get back from the underworld to see the rest of the Project. The movie could sell a fortune as a sleep aid. Some of the puns in the film were bad: police inspector - "electric shock!" Crow- "Shocking, right?" Police inspector- "This is LOEVE, okay" Tom Servo- "Very low, right on the floor!" Police inspector - "Can I get it?" Tom Servo- "He's dead, but break out." MST3K is definitely the only way to watch this nap.
