Alone in the Dark is the kick of Uwe Bolla in Hollywood after hitting House of the Dead in the face. <br /> <br /> If anything is proof of how great the master is Boll. After forcing Artisan to withdraw from the flop, which was House of the Dead, it can be assumed that the normally credible Lion's Gate Films issued AITD only on the basis of a contractual obligation after the acquisition of the Artisan estate. Because AITD is an even greater example of the total lack of ability to create a coherent movie, exposing the plot and just stealing poorly from other movies, because it was supposed to look cool, not because it was within the framework of the movie. <br /> <br /> But that's it, right. Boll does not try to create a coherent movie because he does not try to direct Alone in the Dark. He's just trying to manipulate Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Alone in the dark, like House of the Dead, Dungeon Siege, Far Cry, Bloodrayne and other 3 or 4 designs that are "advertised" or "before" production. "<br /> <br /> These are not films for directing, but investment portfolios. Each of them fell into production under the pretext that Boll's tax law and its investors are exploiting can be closed in the next 2-3 years. The more bombers can spend at this time the more money he and his investors can get in. Why bother yourself with a good movie when a bad movie makes you look like a mint? The result is movies like the horrors of Alone in the Dark. <br /> <br /> Alone in the Dark, like all of his other films, is just a cynical use of the current Hollywood trend for lazy movie making. <br /> <br /> And for those who support Bolla, calling him misunderstood or next Ed Wood, congratulations, making a cult figure out of it man, please here you make it easier for him to attract investors, but give him publicity. br /> <br /> More information can be found here: http://www.cinemablend.com/feature.php?id=209 http://www.cinemablend.com/forum/showthread.php?s=&threadid = 21699 By the way, just do not ask me how she collects her letters. As long as the actors are not somehow an investment fraud, this mystery still has to be discovered.
