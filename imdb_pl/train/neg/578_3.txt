This is not a good movie. Acting is extremely rigid and unconvincing. The film does not seem to know whether it will be a real approach to horror or going off the camp and kitsch route. I have never seen the first movie, but this one does not stand out from its own advantages, there are a few unconvincing twists and the viewer is never aware of the importance of the main vampire. Not worth the effort of watching
