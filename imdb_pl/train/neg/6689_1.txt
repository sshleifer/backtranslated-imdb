I can only assume that other reviewers of this "movie" are shareholders in a production company, because it was probably the worst movie I've seen in the last five years. From the first photo of a rabbi laughing uncontrollably for no apparent reason, it was clear that the actors in the movie would kill to be considered a "B-Level". Both my wife and I were in a great mood before the start of this movie, and we were really waiting for a funny movie with popcorn. We knew we had not rented Citizen Kane and we did not expect to see the most amazing film in history. However, after 40 minutes of enduring the most painfully unpleasant piece of garbage I have ever seen, we turn it off, instead of wasting more minutes of our lives. <br /> <br /> If "comedy" without laughter, horrible acting, a thin plot and annoying characters is your thing, this movie is for you. Honestly, Troll 2 is better - at least I was laughing at the popcorn sex scene. <br /> <br /> I can not justify writing a longer review of this photo, because I've already wasted almost an hour trying to find one joke.
