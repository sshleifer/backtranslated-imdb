Acting was terrible and they both had problems with sports ... not only made the rules in figure skating were bad, but they also rule GIRLS Ice Hockey. You can not check GIRLS ice hockey. You do not block someone either. Not all girls are disgusting, mean and big. I play hockey and I'm only 4'11 and I was asked to go to schools like this one in the movie. Not all hockey players hate figure skaters. Many of the current girls' hockey players were once figure skaters themselves. Also, we skate a lot faster than the ones in the film. I was ashamed of the movie, which gave people the idea that we are sucked ....... although I must mention that it is difficult to pass between sports because of the choice of fingers on skates ... those thorny movements that KAtelin did on the ice, not You could do in a regular hockey match. Basically, she stumbled over someone who is illegitimate. It is also unrealistic that he will receive the HOCKEY scholarship when he is ice skating. It really made me angry that the scholarship would usually be used for someone who could benefit the team.
