Gymkata is undoubtedly one of the worst films ever. But not bad bad movies. This one is so awful that it's cool to watch and laugh. Kurt Thomas clearly has no lucrative acting career. He should go back to gymnastics. But who can forget about such memorable scenes as a high bar with chalk, a stone horse with bows or a five-minute scene of chasing through a village of madmen in slow motion. I do not think it would be that bad, but who can say it. This is not art, but if you want something solid and fluffy, which will make a good conversation, rent a gymakt. It makes the evening fun.
