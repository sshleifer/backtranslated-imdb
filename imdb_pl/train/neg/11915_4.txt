This obvious pilot for the unproduced TV series portrays the young Canadian actress Shiri Appleby as an amnezi, with some amazing powers that must be used when the demon facing man is released in the world. CGI is equivalent to a television task, and Appleby is fine as amnesia, but it's hard to swallow it as a superhero. The well-known face of the TV Richard Burgi is going to ride as Appleby's mentor, but he can not do anything to raise this craze beyond the average level. From the very beginning, we see too many cartoon flying demon, a bad sign. The scenes in which Burgi trains Appleby are actually funny. They are bad copies of similar scenes in several other films, most notably REMO WILLIAMS.
