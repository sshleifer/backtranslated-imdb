Stephen J. Cannell apparently decided a few years ago that he would broaden his horizons and start to fear horror. The result of "Dead Above Ground" is a miserable piece of garbage. If I noticed his name in relation to this particular film, which I would put down, but no, I did not wear glasses and that's why I missed him, damn, I really have to bring these shopping videos with me. The first question is: who the hell is the target audience? It's almost like a "scary" movie for children, but on the other hand there are topless babes and a bit of gore and a few bad words spoken here and there. The main characters are so cute that you want to see someone, anyone, follow them with the kind tools of SOME. It looks like a guy opens a bed and breakfast with a tumultuous past, a witch who murdered children, where the teeth of the children had been gathered. Probably something the real estate agent did not mention. Of course, now in the modern world there is a little ghost of girls who warns the living girl who is now living there, that something bad will happen. Yes, there are also two Bubby who were squatting on this property when the new owner took over, so they want revenge. The whole thing has something of a junk on the cable that is intended for children on Halloween, except, of course, things that are not suitable for young children, so not only is it mediocre, but also confused. Big boo and hissing at Anchor Bay for the fact that he also presented it, taking into account their usual achievements with excellent editions, this is a new low. Great Britain receives a set of phantom boxes, we get "The Tooth Fairy". Almost does not seem fair. 1 in 10, absolute rubbish.
