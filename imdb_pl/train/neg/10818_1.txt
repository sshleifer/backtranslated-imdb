After reading the novel before watching this movie, I was very disappointed with the wooden acting and the arrogance of the producers in their gross disregard for the plot. I believe that this film in no way reflects the brilliance of Bronte's work, rather it gave the impression of a shallow love story. In the condensed film for a short 2 hours, the film lost many key features that make the book understandable and progressive, which results in a slightly lively story with little grounding. The romance between Rochester and Jane Eyre is not built, so it seems rather sudden and unfounded, because the two characters have such a rare interaction that one can not imagine that their "love" is superficial. It's injustice to Bronte's novel, you do not have the impression of Jane's weird cheek and boldness that draws Rochester to her, and his arrogance that draws Jane to him. <br /> <br /> Despite the weak scripts, I think that some characters were presented very aptly, namely Mrs. Fairfax and Grace Poole, but overall the production was poor. Given better scripts, maybe the movie would be more successful. See "Jane Eyre" (1970) with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton for outstanding production.
