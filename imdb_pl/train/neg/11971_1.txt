Although the movie with Bruce Willis is always worth a look, it's better to leave this one. I watched it on TV, so I did not have to pay cash. Lucky me. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds slowly, very slowly. Although the first 30 minutes are quite reliable, in the end it becomes more and more unreliable. This is very doubtful if an experienced soldier, such as Lieutenant Waters, does not comply with direct orders. And even if he did, if the rest of his platoon did it. They know that he exposes them to imminent danger, and they know that they will certainly die if they follow him, but whatever he is, he is our lieutenant, so let us do what he says (despite direct orders, remember). <br /> <br /> In this movie, however, there are some nice scenes. In a sense, they are saving a village where rebels are massaging the population. Well, they save a dozen villagers, the rest have already been killed. A strange part of the fact that they took trucks that the rebels had left behind. They are walking rather. Maybe because the roads are dangerous, but there was no explanation. Anyway. I think that's what brought the film the only point I gave him. <br /> <br /> What made this film an insult to the brain, and therefore totally unbelievable, is that a group of 7 soldiers can kill so many rebels without being injured or killed. Only at the end lose several companions. And that's because they have to fight an army of almost 500 or more. Can you believe it? <br /> <br /> They fight with so many army, kill hundreds of them and lose only a few of them. And they have rounds and a round of ammunition. It will never be missing. Claymore grenades and mines, M60 machine gun, and even RPG. Where do they get these things from? Wearing him or what? They even got a laptop that shows them the activity of the enemy rebels. And this laptop has a battery that works for many days. Really? Who will invent this nonsense. <br /> <br /> I guess if you completely turn off your brain and you think that rebels are a bunch of idiots, you give this film a high rating. If not, skip this one. It saves time.
