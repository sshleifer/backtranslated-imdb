Band Camp was terrible, The Naked Mile was a little better, and the third immediately on the DVD in the American Pie series seems the same as the predecessor. Essentially, Erik Stifler (John White) parted with his girlfriend after losing his virginity, and now he and Mike 'Cooze' Coozeman (Jake Siegel) join cousin Erik Dwight (Steve Talley) in college. Promising many events, a lot of alcohol and enough hot chicks at Beta House, they have only fifty listed tasks to become official privileged members. However, along with rivals, House GEK ("Geek"), headed by a hungry energy sucker (and sheepdog sheepdog), Edgar (Tyrone Savage) offers bigger and better than Beta. To solve this problem once and for all, Beta and Gek fight against the forbidden for forty years of Greek games in which they lose, and the loser moves out. The last game master, Noah Levenstein, known as Jim's Dad (the only regular Eugene Levy), conducts a show in which people break off their bras, gladiator match floating on the water, catch a greased pig, Russian roulette in the mouth with contributions an old horse spunk, wife carrying and drinking a full barrel of alcohol (with vomiting and not disqualifying). All of this ends with a sudden death when a guy gets a lap dancing, and they have to resist Cumming, win at Beta House, when Edgar drops with a girl dressed as a sheep in her lap. Starring Christopher McDonald from Flubber as Stifler, Meghan Heffern as Ashley, Dan Petronijevic as Bull, Nic Nac as Bobby, Christine Barger as Margie, Italia Ricci as Laura Johnson, Moshan Halbert as Sara Coleman, Sarah Power as Denise, Andreja Punkris as Stacy and Jordan Prentice as Rock. The amount of nudity is very slightly increased, as is the thickness of the jokes, and I could guess that it is rated as one star by five, but I like it. Suitable!
