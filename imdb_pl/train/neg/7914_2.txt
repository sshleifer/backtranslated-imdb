This movie was supposed to be a movie hit and it really is. It's a kind of movie that tells you to eat popcorn and watch brilliant graphics. With that in mind, the movie provides, maybe not as good as the brilliant Iron Man, but good enough. In addition to the crunching process of popcorn and special effects, the film drops off the cliff faster than Wile E. Coyote. <br /> <br /> Many viewers, including me, complain that most of the characters have been seriously changed, but this just makes the movie a poor adaptation, not a bad movie. This film is unsatisfactory for other reasons. The creators have focused more on attracting the eye than on the mind. Characters that were long-awaited and promoted are reduced to scenes with 4 scenes. The main characters of Wolverine, Victor Creed (never called Sabertooth in the film) and colonel Stryker are well developed. I was pleasantly surprised by the performance of Liev Schriber. The rest of the character is tossed aside to make room for all important sweets. Wolverine's character is fully developed after 30 minutes, just like Sabertooth, though Victor does surprise late in the movie. <br /> <br /> The "final boss" of the film is a twisted and perverse adaptation of the original character and barely develops to show why it is the way it is. The filmmakers apparently thought that all they really needed was to create a bad hero who could do whatever he wanted and fall into the name of the popular character. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing ...
