I saw this movie in the theater. As soon as I handed my money to the cashier, she said two words I had never heard in the theater, before or since: "No refund!" As soon as I heard these words, I should wave to my cash and go home. But no, stupid, I walked in and watched the movie. This movie did not make anyone laugh at the theater. Not once. Even unintentionally! Mostly we sat in a dazed silence. About every ten minutes someone would be shouting "This SUCKS movie!" The audience applauded, then sat in a dazed, bored silence for another ten minutes.
