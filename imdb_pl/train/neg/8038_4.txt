** SPOILERS ** Redicules slasher movie, which does not make sense at all with an assassin running in black robed clothes and wearing something that looks like a pulled up rubber mask Peter Lorre. At the beginning of the film, I was told that it was almost the first scene that young Beth Morgan was in rehab because of intense drug use after her boyfriend was murdered at Tennyson Collage about a year ago. <br /> <br /> this agent FBI Sacker (Jeff Conaway), who is obsessed with catching the killer, was also murdered at Tennyson at the same time. Before the film "Do You Wanna Know A Secret" is over, it's never been explained what these two killings in Connecticute have to do with the Florida slaughter of about half a dozen college students a year later? besides, the assassin, at least in the murder of Boy Beth, wore the same stupid Halloween outfit. <br /> <br /> During the spring break at Sunshine State, six students spend their holidays at home on the beach and before they know it, they are wasting their time. Starting with Brad Clyton's computer geek, Chad Allen, killing spills even into the city with many people who have nothing to do with the target student, including the police chief Gavin, Jack McGee, who opens. <br /> <br /> The masked assassin rescues Beth for the last time in this strange ceremony at an abandoned church that looks like the Florida Everglades. In the end, he reveals who is his, and what are his intentions that have as much sense as a movie, none. Trying to scare the audience, the whole movie is confusing and stunning with many not-so-convincing scenes. The most effective with the victim of Oz Washington, Tom Jay Jones, will survive at least three attempts in their lives and end up with agent Sacker, the protagonist of the film. <br /> <br /> Oz also had a fierce impact on his foot from a large shard of glass, which almost cut him in half and crippled him, but later miraculously he recovered, after being arrested for a murder he did not commit, in fact he did two more times with the killer with him, not so much with slight relaxation on the walk! It did not make any sense at all, why did Oz and Beth go alone to catch and catch the killer instead of calling the police instead of the cell phone Oz had? <br /> <br /> Boy Beth, who is losing his head, in the movie Hank Ford, Joseph Lawrence, is also very unconvincing, as are two girls from the house on the beach. Together with Beth Oz they end up being victims of killers, then somehow disappearing from sight! for a moment you did not know if they were really killed, or if it was some kind of hallucination in part of Oz or local police. Until the final scene in which they appeared in the church. <br /> <br /> We also get an insight into the previous relationship between Tina and Hank, drunk and acting unbearably, trying to get him with Hank when Beth enters without Hanka and Tina, even noticing her. It seemed that Beth was even more upset than murdering her boyfriend at the beginning of the movie!
