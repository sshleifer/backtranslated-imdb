"Land of Plenty" is not a movie. It is a tombstone for the career of the director of German director Wim Wenders. <br /> <br /> Many thought this was "The Million Dollar Hotel" and now "Land of Plenty" makes it completely clear; Wenders not only lost, but became the director of BAD, creating terribly weak and superficial stories and scenes. <br /> <br /> You can argue that the "time you lose" comes for each director, but Wenders' case is extreme. It's as if he completely forgot everything he knew about cinema and started from scratch - just to get sloppy results. <br /> <br /> In a few words, this movie does not deserve your time.
