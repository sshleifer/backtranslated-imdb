Goofy Griswalds win the main prize on the television program "pig in poke" and they all fly together to Europe, where they manage to cause one silly catastrophe after another. Of all the absurd, indecent, rotating sequels, this one beats a lot. Harold Ramis' film from 1983. He was below the average disaster in which a clumsy family set out on a horrible "holiday" all over the States. This time, the helmets of Amy Heckerling ("Look Who's Talking"), which turns out to be a catastrophic "comedy" that will annoy you more than it will make you laugh. <br /> <br /> Hughes' script (with Rob Klane) is horrible and you wonder why Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo teased the project with dead rhythm, because even Anthony Michael Hall and Imogene Coca made sense to refuse the offer. Even the omnipotent Michael Palin is not able to raise the proceedings to a level that could be called entertaining. <br /> <br /> However, as it might seem unthinkable, "European holidays" turned out to be enough to guarantee a second follow-up! Certainly it can not be as unbearable as this one. You know, I have not seen the National Lampoon show yet, which was worth attention. <br /> <br /> Monday, December 26, 1994 - T.V.
