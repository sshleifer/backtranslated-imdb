This does not entirely determine the depths of Creepshow 3, but is approaching. It also uses the same technique of using some of the same actors in many roles throughout the anthology, which is at least distracting. <br /> <br /> It is also an annoying tear of the Twilight Zone (at the bookstore comparable to the later Noctilnia Serling Gallery). Unfortunately, producers and writers have forgotten that Serling will build sympathy for his heroes before he begins to torment them. None of the characters is particularly nice or interesting until the last segment. <br /> <br /> The story of the frame: Adam West is ... well, alone. He does not go to the Bruce Wayne / Batman 60s campus, but rarely. It's just a not-too-enigmatic Jay game (it's an ominous name that chills you, comparable to Dr. Terror, Eramus and The Cryptkeeper), and creates some awkward / frightening statements. <br /> Abernathy: "Willoughby break" Seena Rod Serling? Then you saw it. The red nutso nut wife was introduced aimlessly, but even the friend of the main character identifies him as a mollusk. As well-targeted as you might expect, but basically inconsistent. <br /> <br /> Nex's Diner: recalls various stories from the journey during Serling, mixed up with Steve Allen's "Meeting of Minds". Most of the actors are not so bad (except Josh Astin as Cassius, who manages to walk, talk, and even breathe awkwardly), and the idea is slightly interesting. But like Abernathy, he is not going anywhere. The main protagonist raises some relatively reasonable questions, a little surprised (who would not?), And for some reason he ends up being sent to the nuclear wastes. <br /> <br /> Repetition of life: a nice little bit and he manages to overtake both Click and Creepshow 3. I suppose he says something that people are fascinated by the magical properties of pilots. The main character is slightly sympathetic. Nothing fundamentally innovative here, but it's fine. <br /> <br /> Fighting Spirit: You see that the turn is approaching by a mile, but how the main character has a little heart and this is a decent story of failure and redemption. /> <br /> Finale: So ... why do people get to the cold store in silver llamas? I do not know And it does not make sense. So ... all heroes went to the bookstore and were imprisoned? Kinda undermines a happy ending with the boxer (thanks, guys!), And the guy in the first segment died. So how was he imprisoned? Did he visit the bookshop before he died, he was imprisoned and ... he did not die? What? What? I suppose it should not make sense because it is supernatural. But still ... <br /> <br /> In general: it's basically no different from the two newer Twilight Zone series or episodes of Tales From the Darkside or Monsters. The last two stories and part two are probably worth your time. But here is nothing spectacular.
