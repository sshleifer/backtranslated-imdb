SAKURA KILLERS (1+ outta 5 stars) Maybe in 1987. This movie may have seemed cool ... if you had never seen a * good * ninja movie. Cheesy '80s music ... cheesy dialogue ... shoddy acting ... and uncompromising series of martial arts. The coolest scene is at the beginning ... with an aged Chuck Connor playing golf on the beach ... a few of the black ninja's are trying to sneak up to him and it looks like he's trying too hard to hit the ball to notice ... he suddenly reaches for your golf bag and ... na, I will not ruin it for you ... if you ever have the misfortune to see this movie, you'll thank me. This story is a lot of nonsense about a stolen video tape or something like that. A few dark bulbs of Caucasian heroes are trained in a ninja way, because "only ninja can fight a ninja" or something like that. Strange, these guys do not seem to fight better after training than before ... well, the movie is moving quite fast. Combat scenes may not be great ... but they're plentiful ... and exaggerated sound effects are good for a few chuckles.
