Something very strange happens when you talk about global warming: science comes out of the window, and "faith" and "consensus" become the topic of discussion. <br /> <br /> That's because I'm giving poor grades to the Al Gore Document. <br /> <br /> Instead of promoting intelligent discussion, he led the debate on the level of "faith" and "consensus". <br /> <br /> Of course, when you try to sell the world to spend trillions of dollars on "stopping global warming," this may be a problem to tell the scientific truth: we do not know how much of the current warming people have caused. Maybe none of this, maybe a bit of it, or maybe jumped the next Ice Age and we were really lucky that we did not cook the planet. <br /> <br /> But the fact is that I do not know. <br /> <br /> so we are asked to "believe" in "consensus". It does not matter that any scientist who deviates from "consensus" is excluded. It does not matter that the scientific investigation is about moving away from consensus. Einstein did not "believe" in consensus, as did Copernicus or Galileo. <br /> <br /> So why do so many contempt for the same researchers who will move forward, asking difficult questions? If Global Warming is so undeniable, certainly a few people testing this theory can not be so dangerous. <br /> <br /> What's going on here? This is a movie that I hoped Al Gore did. And so, he decided to support his support with true "believers" of "consensus". <br /> <br /> Sad, really.
