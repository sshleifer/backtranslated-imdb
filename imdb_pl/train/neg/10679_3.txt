I did not expect the film to be as good as "In The Line of Fire" or episode "24", but it seemed that this movie was made for television and did average work at best. (Good) cast could not hide the fact that the plot was too predictable and the actors had to struggle (really try everything in my power) through their lines of bad script, giving their flat characters rather extras. When I watched the movie, I had the impression that I saw most of it in other (better) movies. In it you had car chases, big gunfights, romance, twists, etc; This movie has none. <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler ** As soon as you see another woman talking to the phone on Cuba, you know who is behind all of this and all the tips you receive ("you are standing too close to the president, look from my perspective ..." ) sounds stupid. <br /> <br /> If it depended on me (or maybe it's not right), I would rewrite this story in this way: <br /> <br /> The first lady orders her to murder her husband, because she is sick and tired of constantly writing checks for Cuba.
