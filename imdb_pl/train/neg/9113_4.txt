They had such potential in this film and they are completely falling. In the first cruel intentions, we wonder what motivated the main characters to how they behave and behave as they do. There is almost no character development in this prequel. It's a really sad story, but this movie did not do anything for me. It was like they skipped good writing instead of unnecessary f-words. And the end does not make sense and does not explain anything. Writing was just awful. Another thing that worried me was that they used 3 lines of EXACT SAME lines that were in the original. Such as the "eagle owl", the scene of kisses and a few others that I do not remember. Acting Robin did not impress me much, but Amy did a great job. This is the only thing that reconciled this movie.
