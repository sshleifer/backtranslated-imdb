How could 4 out of 16 previous voters give this film 10? How can more than half of the previous voters give her 7 or more? Who is voting here? I can only assume that it is primarily children - very young children. The fact is that this is a bad movie in every respect. History is stupid; acting is difficult to even think about acting; the characters are devoid of character; and dialogue is terrible. I saw this rainy afternoon on the Sci-Fi channel. In a sad event that has ever been sent out again, I suggest you read the book.
