This is one of the worst film adaptations of the musical ever made. The stage version of A Chorus Line is great. This film bypasses the mark in almost all ways. Even the casting is surprising. Take Audrey Landers as Val. "Dance 10 Looks 3" is the song Val. Val's story is that she is a great dancer, but she has 3 in appearance. Yes, he finds a solution, but ultimately he is a great dancer. What are the genius filmmakers doing? They employ an actress who can not dance and is famous for it looks great. A way to miss the boat. <br /> <br /> Then there's the choreography. I'm sure Michael Bennett turned over in the grave. Why did not they use his choreography? You really can not improve it.
