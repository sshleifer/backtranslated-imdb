I agree with some of the other critics of this film. I found it extremely stupid (at best) and even confusing, disinforming and harmful (at worst). Like the others, I thought this movie was a terrible mix of "real" science and New Age pseudoscientific propaganda. <br /> <br /> As a psychologist, I was especially offended by Candace Pert's contributions. It's true that I was not a fan of this film, but her discourse on cell "awareness" was one of the best examples of accepting the term "consciousness" that has predictable meaning for most people and uses it in such a distorted way that cause it to cover it and not explain it. This is the old Orwellian mind that the master himself described in his wonderful essay "Politics and English". Appealing to "consciousness" in this way - in fact, to refer to this film as "science-based" in general (which is its clear intention) - is to use language in the same way that Stalin used it as a slave states "democratic republics" and Hitler, when he called his party a movement of "socialist workers." <br /> <br /> I'm not saying I really understand quantum physics. I know enough about this to know that to really understand this, I need a lot of learning. Ah, but we Americans love "instant enlightenment," and this is the mistake the film attempts to achieve. If he asked questions, that would be one thing, but he clearly tries to ask and ANSWER on them, which no film could do simply because we are far away from the answer (if they really exist). <br /> <br /> Incidentally, ethically, this film demanded association concerns with several "expert commentators" from Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (and TM), not to mention JZ Knight, who often speaks with his voice "Ramtha". (It always amazes me that this Atlantean superman, 10,000 years old, understood the concepts and terminology of the 21st century, but again in this film, the past, present and future are all the same, so if Ramtha existed in 10,000 Atlantis years ago, I suppose he could exist now and tomorrow, only when his financial councils were so unbelievably bad for his followers? Oh, I forgot, I'm the creator of "good" and "bad" advice, so it's all my fault, not Ramtha .) <br /> <br /> What a mess.
