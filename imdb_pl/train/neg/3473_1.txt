This is probably the worst Christmas movie ever. The plot is virtually non-existent, acting (in particular Affleck) is at best weak. Fans of Ben Affleck will probably defend this film, but they must agree in the depths of their lives. As far as I could find out, the plot, consisting of Ben Affleck, a millionaire seller, was told by a psychiatrist to go to a place that reminds him of his childhood and burns a list of things he wanted to forget from childhood. In this way, he finishes paying the family currently living at home to be his family for Christmas ... and that's all. The film lasts and eventually meets the daughter of the family .... blah blah blah.
