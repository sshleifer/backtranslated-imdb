These 2 points are intended for a reasonable performance by Akshay Kumar. I know that Bollywood films do not try to be realistic, but PLEASE make Walt Disney's production more realistic than this story. My father dies and does what every good parent does ... to dig a son with his WIFE IN PREGNANCY. A few things that were too hard to swallow. 1. Priyanka "cool indoor swimming pool in the bedroom" and the transition from this to the hungry life in her mother-in-law garden shed ???????? 2. Akshay suddenly got a job as a stuntman, gets bitten by angry dogs, and then just walks away. This movie is an INSULT for our intelligence I can not really believe that I contributed financially to the "people" who made the film, taking my family to see it, left the cinema with a grimace, please, do not give up this mess to watch, take advantage from my advice and do not waste your "waqt".
