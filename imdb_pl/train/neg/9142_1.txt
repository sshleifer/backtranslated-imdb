I just watched it after I heard about how bad it is and I wanted to find out. Seriously, even if you read all the negative comments here, you will not be able to understand how awful this movie is, although it must be one of the most fun things I've ever seen! I've never bothered to post a comment before, but this piece of shit really does. <br /> <br /> First of all, the whole action is ridiculous and senseless. The brother of the main character (Ben or Arthur, I forget who is, and honestly, it's never clear) wants to stop some kind of homosexual marriage, killing everyone in sight - because homosexuality is repugnant to Christians, but apparently mass murder is not then there is some shit thrown in on the case of one of the former wives of a gay couple trying to force him to remarry with a gun in his hand. It leads to nothing, but it provides us with one of the funniest lines of dialogue in the whole "film" - "I have no sense? You do not make sense! It makes sense!". Brilliant. <br /> <br /> Then there is acting, which is simply awful. You have to believe it. My personal favorite is a seemingly stoned civil rights lawyer who clearly reads something from something, but still can spoil it. Sufficiently said. A gay couple could not be less convincing. He is vaguely attractive and a completely hopeless guy, and his boyfriend who looks like this little comic man from bisto ads. Only thicker. And less talented. <br /> <br /> The "movie" has also been filmed by someone who can not hold the camera even remotely, and the number of errors is amazing. The whole thing starts with a fat guy in bed with a pair of shoes. Yes. <br /> <br /> But in any case, we all know how scary this thing is, so I would like to highlight some of the most priceless comedy moments that the movie provides. <br /> <br /> - When a fat guy set a church on fire, then he drove around the parking lot like a six-year-old girl to run away. Funny. <br /> <br /> - Mildread! I have no idea what is the relationship to the main characters - sometimes they know her, sometimes not, but still appears in several scenes. Funny. <br /> <br /> - stoned lawyer. I have already mentioned her, but she is so funny that it is worth the next mention. <br /> <br /> - Dinner of bad brothers crackers, which he puts for his guests. <br /> <br /> - Anti-evil brother gay elixir. <br /> <br /> - Bad brother cats. <br /> <br /> - A conclusion that I will not give up because it MUST be seen. I warn you, make sure you do not eat then !!!! The bathtub of the main character / director / producer becomes naked. It's a foul. <br /> <br /> Basically Ben and Arthur are indescribably bad, but unintentionally the most comic you will see for a long time. Literally, nothing is good in this excuse for the movie, the director's fool even manages to make the initial loans a joke, writing his name about 15 times.
