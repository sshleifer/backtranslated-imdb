OK Hollywood is not liberal. <br /> <br /> Of course, I'm lying because it is. I am a conservative, but politics will go away from my opinion about the film. This film was anti-bush, anti-middle east, anti-big oil propaganda, but it was not because it was bad. <br /> <br /> I will push away that I will give credit where it is. I saw this movie opening night, because by chance I like these kinds of films and I'm a political scientist in a collage. The photos were perfect, and the acting was good enough to say very well. <br /> <br /> However, the plot was impossible to decipher. I've been tested and IQ 138, but no matter how hard I tried, there was no way to put together the story and what characters do what. <br /> <br /> The story and scene sequence was totally incoherent and poorly organized. <br /> <br /> Unless it's one of those movies that has to be watched many times to get the full depth of the story, which can be very good, I have no idea exactly what happened. <br /> <br /> It makes sense, because if you want to make a political argument and not get criticized, you can not criticize your argument! If you can not dazzle with their brilliance, interrupt them with Bull S.
