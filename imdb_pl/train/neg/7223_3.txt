My first attempt to watch it ended after 8 minutes, more or less on the stage of the TV reportage, which I could not deal with. It was something like this: <br /> <br /> Reporter 1: Hmm, there's a pyramid in our sky. Reporter 2: I think they are aliens. * niezrÄ™czna cisza * Reporter 1: In other news ... <br /> <br /> A few days later I watched it to the end and it was not as bad as I imagined, but there are serious problems with it. About half of the plot can be easily rejected. And the other half should be expanded to explain a story or something like that. <br /> <br /> What is the meaning of the detective, people of eugenics and monsters that are removed for a moment by Horus? The monopoly scene was more fun. "We are all powerful" gods "who lived through eons and all monopoly games happen to us." Monopoly? Monopoly?! Even Erich von Dainiken looks coherent in relation to this. <br /> <br /> The other half is terribly lacking. What did our hero do to freeze? Why was not there a big event when he was fired at the end? He had these unbearable supporters, remember? What happened to normal people? What's the matter with this masked guy? How did a blue-haired girl appear? What's up with her eyes? Etceter, etc. <br /> <br /> Visually, it's OK, more or less, if you disregard Egyptian gods that look like walking turf with rotweiller heads.
