I have read some of the comments about this movie and I can only assume that some people enjoy playing. This movie is nothing. It is so badly written, directed and acted that it barely makes an impression. The heroes talk in hypocritical dialogue, and the situations are completely unbelievable. Although it can make this camp and play, it is not because everything is so dead that the movie becomes boring. It's as if Lee Rose decided to write a drama about a woman struggling with her sexuality, but then she would not allow her performers to give a tale of true taste or no cojones. This film could be included in the encyclopedia as a standard movie "Lifetime TV".
