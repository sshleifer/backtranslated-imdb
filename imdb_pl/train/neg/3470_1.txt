As with most of Ben Affleck's movies, the comedy is dry and history is predictable. If you want to call it history. Many points remained connected without any thought. I want to thank the director for not explaining the points better. I say this because it would mean that torture would last longer. Regarding any of Ben Affleck's failures, this one is no exception and can only survive other actors. Even then, the actions were mostly invented and were not reliable. Traveling down the memory with the actors I have not seen for years was not worth the price of admission. Everyone thought that it should be said, they also quickly join the ranks of the "former". My choice was to wait for the repair of my car or watch this movie. I made the wrong decision. All in all, I'd laugh ... mainly because it's all I got out of it.
