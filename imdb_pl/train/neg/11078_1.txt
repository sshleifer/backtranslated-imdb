honestly, where can I start! It was a low-budget film "HORRIBLY acted", it was so tacky that it made us all laugh out loud, how delayed it was! Sword fight scenes were not even swordfights, they played with plastic swords they bought at Wal-Mart, and everything they did was just moaned to try and make them look like they were fighting! Me and my family were in the mood for a really good action movie one day, so we decided to go to the store and look for one, and there was the movie The Sawtooth Island. I mean, it looked so great, but when we watched them at home, I practically died after the first scene. <br /> <br /> Oh and the story of the movie, the screen, the script, etc. It was a group of trash that I do not even know why the director and producer wasted their time! But if you happen to come across this movie ... you will not get it !!!!!
