I never finished this movie for some reason, it was awful and it was just acting. I was not even sure what the film was about, but it did not make much sense, and the violence was terrible. I mean, I like naked in the movie (lol), but it was just sick because of what was going on. ALL characters annoyed me and it was just loud screams, and the camera shook on the parts and looked like a blair sequel to the project, but without any good features. This is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time and I would like my time to come back. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, or even consider it. (N)
