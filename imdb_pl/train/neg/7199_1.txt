Why?!! It was a bland, uninspiring and embarrassing movie. The embarrassment comes from being out of the city where you succeeded ... Pittsburgh PA! Why did they allow these people to do such a BAAAAD film there? <br /> <br /> When this movie was supposed to be released ... it was rather a romantic comedy ... and nothing like ROBO - nothing. Everything changed with the kindness of Disney. WHY???? They made a terrible interpretation of this classic comic character. Watching Matthew Broderick from his own movies was not fun either. Hell!!
