We gave up at the moment when George Clooney's figure has her nails stretched out. We were not sensitive - we sat for an hour of nonsense and knew what it was like. To say that this movie was incomprehensible, boring, pretentious, would be too praise! How did people manage to sit in this tangled, slow, depressing corner of the movie, let alone nominate him to the Oscar? Clooney looked as sick as we watched him. What was he thinking? Oh ... what about those subtitles? - did we just have a DVD, or was the original film made in this way - sentences left in the air? Without this, the film was difficult enough to track. I feel sorry for the cast, who apparently made every effort to make the material available.
