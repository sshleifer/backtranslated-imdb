In times before gore and sex, real horrors were created. Castle of Blood is, in my opinion, one of the best, although other reviewers gave it mixed reviews. In a strange way, it resembles the newer The Others, which was in cinemas a few years ago. <br /> <br /> Director Antonio Margheriti converted his own photo in 1970, titled it this time, Web of the Spider (AKA Nella Stretta Morsa del Ragno). Why he did not do it, I do not understand, although the remake played Anthony Franciosa and Klaus Kinski and was very good in itself. Perhaps he saw a good story and wanted to adapt it more to the American audience. I really do not know. It is interesting that he made the original in black and white, and the remake in color. <br /> <br /> Castle of Blood is a perfect Italian gothic. La Danza Macabra is considered the unpublished work of Edgar Allen Poe, who "appears" in this film. Poe and Lord Blackwood, the owner of the haunted castle, bet the American writer Alan Foster (George Riviere), who can not spend the Soul Night in that castle and survive. Foster willingly accepts the bet, but soon regrets it because he is witnessing a series of murders committed by the ghosts. It seems that ghosts come back to life once every few years, but they are doomed to recreate the crimes they committed in their lives. Lord Blackwood conveniently forgot to tell Foster that his blood was needed to resurrect the next Night of Souls! <br /> <br /> Foster and beauty Elisabeth Blackwood (portrayed by the incomparable Barbara Steele) do not fall in love long, although their romance is doomed to failure, because Elisabeth is one of the ghosts. I will not give it an end, but I will say that Castle of Blood is in any case a romantic tragedy, because it is a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Comments. This film is very atmospheric, even thanks to the excellent standards of Italians. My personal opinion is that they make a real horror better than anyone else, and a bit weak black and white filming only strengthens it. In fairness, Web of the Spider was okay, even with color and greater clarity. I loved the long shots that most contemporary directors do not have patience with. Indeed, when Alan falls into the doomed castle, we are treated for a few minutes when he does nothing but wander from room to room, and fear and anxiety arouse his face and manner. Before the first ghost appears, the audience is thoroughly prepared and ready. There is a great dialogue between Alan and ghosts, something else that is often not done in standard ghost stories. There are also unforgettable scenes, very visual for this type of film. Elisabeth's 'murder' and dance scene (reminiscent of a similar ghoul dance in the 1962 Carnival of Souls) were particularly good. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, few viewers of general interest will ever hear this movie. It's a shame because this one is higher than the rest. I have a copy from Sinister Cinema and I'm not sure if it can be bought anywhere else. For those interested in this genre, you must necessarily see.
