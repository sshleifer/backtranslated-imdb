I loved the first two films, but this movie was just a waste of time and money (for me and for the studio). I'm still wondering why they made this awful movie. The thing with a plastic gun and a toy car that can enter another house is ridiculous. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern in the first two films were so much fun, but the terrorists in this movie are so stupid and not funny. Believe me, this movie is just a waste of time.
