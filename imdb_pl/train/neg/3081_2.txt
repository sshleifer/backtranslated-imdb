Oh, jena! Although I still maintain that Manos: Hands of Fate are the worst kind of mental torture, the Hobgoblins were terribly close. This ... it ... something offends the audience at every opportunity. <br /> <br /> At least on mst3k you can watch movies such as Space Mutiny and Future War, this one was hard to beat. I literally sat on the couch. This thing embarrassed me - alone! <br /> <br /> Even if you are a die-hard MST3K fan and made it your job to see every experiment, think twice about seeing it. <br /> <br /> It's so bad.
