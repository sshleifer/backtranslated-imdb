What the Bleep Do We Know is a deluded and accidental look at the secrets of the universe. We get a parade of apparent experts (none of whom are named) who wander and pontificate in a completely unscientific manner. Their interviews are divided into very small segments and scattered in some brilliant cgi and banal mini-stories. <br /> <br /> The film deals with topics from science, philosophy, theology and politics, combines them irrespective of accuracy, and then somehow draws out some prosaic and absurd conclusions. We are convinced that quantum physics tells us about the purpose of our existence and any other difficult to answer question that movie creators would like to point their finger at. <br /> <br /> It is full of errors and logical non-sequel. How did we start with quantum mechanics and we ended up with this pseudoscientific spirituality and mysticism? It's like saying "two plus two equals four, so I can move objects with my mind." <br /> <br /> In this movie there is nothing original and almost nothing is accurate. Any discriminating viewer will be irritated by heavy editing, intrusive and pointless special effects, and a general lack of content. Educated viewers will be frustrated by tears caused by violence against science and any other topic that this film concerns.
