I turn on the 700 Club from time to time and agree only with some statements - I am one of many believers who is considered liberal by most Christians and conservative by most non-Christians. I vote with my mind and usually I am not a representative. or dem. - I do not believe that the 700 club tells people what to believe, but it represents many older Christians who grew up in very conservative environments. I think that many people misunderstand what is said in the 700 club. it scares me that I hear a name calling to both directions. I think 700 clubbers really love Jesus, but he's so busy trying to get people to vote for conservative votes, they forget to show love to some people and promote peace like Jesus. Please, do not judge Jesus on the basis of ignorant people who believe in him and do not be so unaware of our comments about them. Why are people so mean?
