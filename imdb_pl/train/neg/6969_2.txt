Blue Monkey (1987) or "Invasion of the BodySuckers", as you know here in the UK, is a pretty boring horror about an old man who is bitten in a greenhouse by some mysterious toxic plant !!!! The man is taken to the hospital, where this worm-like worm comes out of his mouth, of course he changes into this insect-monster and goes on a frenzy !! Although Steve Railsback and John Vernon are in the movie, I think it is boring, with a flat predictable plot, uninteresting characters, cheap special effects and no action !!!! Horror fans do not really have to follow this rare film, I will not lack trust! I give this movie 2/10.
