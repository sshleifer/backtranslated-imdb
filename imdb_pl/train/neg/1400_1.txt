Oh, my God ... I thought CBS TV shows were the worst in Gerald McRaney ... <br /> <br /> Four people experimenting with crazy mind control <br /> <br /> computer. That's all, do not rent. <br /> <br /> I've seen it under one of many titles - "Gray Matter", and this is <br /> <br /> perhaps one of the worst movies last memory. Other reviews <br /> <br /> are right, this is awful. There have never been so many <br /> <br /> shots on the screen, NEVER. The cast is horrible, the direction <br /> <br /> is horrible and the script is horrible. I can not stress how terrible it is. <br /> <br /> Avoid him like smallpox. <br /> <br /> This is rated (PG) for physical violence, violence with weapons, mild <br /> <br /> gore, a bit of profanity and some situations for adults
