The film is very horrible and humiliating for rape victims. At first glance, it can be a bold movie about rape, but if you dig under the surface, a lie is a not so positive message about rape. Aishwarya, a victim of rape, turns out to be a helpless victim who can not cope because she is a WOMAN. I need a HUMAN who will help her. When the public makes jokes about her and comments on her, he does not get up for himself. All this is left to Anil Kapoor, who does all the conversations while Aishwarya is crying. <br /> <br /> The director (Satish Kaushik) went in the wrong direction, presenting the rape victim as weak and submissive. It would be more effective to present a strong woman who rebels against her enemies in a brave way. The director is famous for chauvinism. His films are usually full of weak women, but he tries to hide them in controversial roles. It must be learned that just because the role is controversial, it does not mean that the character itself is strong. <br /> <br /> The most humiliating scene in the film is the situation in which Aishwarya "cleans up" after the rape. He does it to please his father who thinks he is dirty now. Although it is worth recommending that Shah shows the stigma on the victims of rape in such a harsh light, he does not show us whether Ash's father was wrong in making his daughter such a thing. In this way, we have a misleading message about rape. <br /> <br /> Comedy is not needed in such a strong thematic movie. What's more, the comedy is simply not fun. Ash is wooden in his role, while Anil Kapoor does nothing but scream. The music is mediocre, except for the title track, which is beautifully pictured (the only bright point of the film). Sonali Bendre's role is disappointing and pointless. In general, what could have been a great movie to remember ends in a horrible mishmash that will give some viewers severe indigestion.
