This is one of the fun things about being young, which can be easily deceived by advertising. I've talked about a different movie before, in which the movie (comedy) advertisement makes it seem more fun than it really is. Watching the movie's commercial in 1981 made me think it would be a wildly funny movie. What I and my brother, who went and saw with me, did not know that the scene used in the TV commercial was the last scene in the movie! <br /> <br /> Because this scene is the final result of everything that was previously in the movie, I can only guess that there was nothing else funny in use! The last scene is thanks to the youth mixture dr. Fu Manchu is changing from a long bearded old man into a bright young rock star from Asia / Elvis! (With no less vocalists!) <br /> <br /> For no reason, in the 1930s, Peter Sellers does everything in his power, but there is no really good reason to "comedy" moments. The rest of the actors were just boring, and my brother and I were sitting there just barely laughing at anything. It was only natural that we were expecting the Pink Panther comedy, Peter Sellers was great at it. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that it was his last film before he died. His performance at the Muppet Show was more entertaining than the badly planned flop. Nevertheless, I do not blame him. I accuse everyone else that they did not try to do it better. The 2 stars are generous !!
