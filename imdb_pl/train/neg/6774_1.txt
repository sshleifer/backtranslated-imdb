As an avid Cary Grant fan, I expected that I would watch this movie and howl with laughter when AMC announced it as a comedy. I've never been more disappointed with the movie! Cary's usual charm and carefree comedy are NOT allowed from this entire movie; he turns out to be tense, bored, and not alone. The Mississip character is one of the worst stereotypes I've ever seen - its accent is terribly exaggerated (and incorrect, depending on which part of Mississippi it comes from), and whenever it delivers a line, another cast member is a few decibels higher. Mississip tried to distinguish in the film as a nice, rural bomb, but in the end he manages only to diminish the already weak storyline. Mansfield looks more like an obscene doll than an erotic Hollywood cat, and although she has never been known for her acting ability in Hollywood, this movie screams she never had the ability to do it. Ray Walston's character was sweet and eventually made up. For four men on land, it was the mildest holiday I have ever seen. I watched this nightmare until the very end, and although I will not spoil anyone, I will tell you that it is the most absurd thing you will ever see. The film tries to evoke patriotism and a sense of debt towards the fighting men, but the film misses this point entirely because of the weak plot line and poor cast. I'm sorry, Cary!
