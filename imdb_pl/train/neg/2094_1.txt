I had to endure teenagers, high school and family conflict in almost the entire program. I really do not care about high school students who are worried about their relationship. I spent my time in hell dealing with such matters and I do not care about fictitious teenagers going through the "lite" versions of the horrors that I endured. I want science fiction. That's the only reason I'm here. The show had a few seconds of science fiction. FINALLY, we see proto-Cylon. It was good, but with one problem. His red dot would block the object of interest. We all know that Cylon eyedots always scan back and forth, giving the machine a map of the world. The red dot does not stop moving back and forth. <br /> <br /> I really hope that the authors will fix this abuse before the second episode.
