Although not entirely offensive, the 1967 version of The Perils of Pauline is certainly moronic. The title can make you expect Pearl White's homage (original Pauline in the 1914 series with a silent show from 1914), but it would be better if you served in the 1947 version. With Betty Hutton. This version from 1967 resembles the mix of "Casino Royale" and the weakest of Elvis films. The worst part is that it is not a mixture of these, but more like someone sticking together segments, so that the object jumps between these two styles. <br /> <br /> What's the unity in production comes from the combination of Pamela Austin (Pauline) and Pat Boone (George Steadman), a good match because they lack even the most basic acting skills (imagine Mandy Moore playing alongside Dan Quayle 'a. <br /> <br /> Austin later played alongside John Aston in "Evil Roy Slade," and the difference in talent between them was painful. In the mid-1960s she was a girl of "Dodge Rebellion" as she appeared In a similar series of dangerous situations - imagine Sandra Dee in a navy blue suit When a car manufacturer's advertising agency replaced her with a "Dodge Fever" girl, someone came up with a great idea to show her in a feature film. <br /> <br /> The story is here, starting with growing up Pauline in Baskerville Foundling Home led by actress who played Mrs. Chatsworth Osborne Sr. on "Dobie Gillis." George falls in love with her (Pauline, a not Mrs. Osborne) and sabotages some of the opportunities that she must accept. George goes to look for a fortune, and 19-year-old Pauline gets a job as a tutor to a young, oil-rich Middle Eastern prince. When she tries to add an attractive blonde to her harem, she escapes from danger. These include Pygmies from Africa, a 99-year-old millionaire who wants to freeze her until his one-year-old grandson is mature enough to marry, the film industry and the Russian space program. <br /> <br /> All this is going to be stupid and charming, but manages only a stupid part. There is some effort to turn on silent sequences to the sequence of actions, simulating the camera's overclocking (which speeds up the action). Unfortunately, everything else (film material, production design, assembly) is depressing in the 1960s. Nothing here comes even closer to the images of Pearl White tied to a log moving towards the buzzing saw or tied to the railway tracks waiting for an oncoming train. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
