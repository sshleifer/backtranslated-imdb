I saw this movie with several Indian friends at Christmas. A quick summary of this video is MUST AVOID. JP Dutta wrote, directed, produced and edited this film and did not do any of this work well. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of the Pakistani trial in 1999 to capture a part of the Kashmir region in question from India. Presumably based on facts, you get a hint from this movie about the difficulties of the Indian army in the area of ​​the Pakistani army - who occupied a high level. But instead of telling what had to be a fascinating and heroic story, this whole movie makes the Indian army look ridiculous and stupid, which I know is not true. <br /> <br /> I watched the movie almost entirely by an Indian audience who was very patriotic and apparently wanted to like the movie, but also laughed at scenes that were not meant to be fun. <br /> <br /> The script was absolutely terrible. It gave the impression that Mr. Dutta knew nothing about how the army works and used bad war movies for information purposes. The result is a script that is thoughtless and repetitive. <br /> <br /> Actresses of most directors were not stellar, but given the scenario in which they were given, I find it hard to criticize them too much. As for the cast, I can only say that I hope they were amateurs. <br /> <br /> The editing was also very bad. It was very difficult to follow what was going on most of the time, and the music would suddenly break the scene changes. <br /> <br /> Good stuff: the photos were pretty good, though a bit wounded by the fact that the film does not seem to be color-corrected (the color balance was often much different within the scenes). In addition, the few songs that were in the movie were quite pleasant - at least for the first half-dozen verses. Unfortunately, they went a lot longer than they should. <br /> <br /> And the worst crime of all? This mess is FOUR HOURS LONG. Enough, a good editor could almost squeeze a good movie about 1.5 - 2 hours from what was done. Unfortunately, a good editor did not work on this movie.
