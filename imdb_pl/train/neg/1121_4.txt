In the first few minutes of this Dutch thriller, we learn that Krabbe is a gay alcoholic writer who sleeps without underwear, fantasizes about murdering his roommate, tries to steal a journal from a press stand and craves a young student he meets at a train station. And he's the hero of this nonsense movie that's all dressed (except Krabbe in at least one scene too much), but there's nowhere to go. The basic graph is very simple, but it is dragged for almost two hours before a pointless conclusion arrives. Verhoeven has a cool visual talent, but he resorts to scenes of wild hallucinations, overt symbolism and unselfish blood when he lacks ideas.
