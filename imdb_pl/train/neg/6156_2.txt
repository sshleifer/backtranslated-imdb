It's a bad, bad movie. I am a real swordsman: trust me when I say that the pretension of the accuracy of this movie is just like that. This is especially true during this wretched little scene where fencers combine the work of legs with pop 80s. The ending is predictable and the movie is boring from beginning to end. Awful.
