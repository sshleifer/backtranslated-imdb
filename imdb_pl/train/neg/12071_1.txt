Horrible ... just horrible. Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I've seen pretty bad photos all these years. The sound sucks, like image quality, direction, game ... etc. The only good shots (which means funny because they are so bad) are special effects. In general, he laughs about 5 minutes. The rest of the movement causes brain damage.
