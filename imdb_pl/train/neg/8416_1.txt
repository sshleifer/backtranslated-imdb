It makes sense to me that this movie is getting amazing from Hollywood because often in Hollywood it's just a popularity contest. It also makes sense when you think that people who like this movie can react to the innumerable amount of songs they spit on you, not the content. However, this movie is overrated and exaggerated. Eddie Murphy just looks funny. There is no way Jeniffer Hudson and Beyonce Knowles will give the Oscars a performance so many delighted BEFORE the film was leveled out. I can not even believe that Condon will be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Director, when all he did was put together an album. Glitz does not replace anything from history. A few songs do not create a movie.
