I believe that war films should try to transmit the terror of war, avoid idealism and respect basic military rules. Zvezda barely makes the first one. Zvezda is a Russian war film, I expected patriotism, sentimentality, beautiful poetic images, lush scores, Slavic cheekbones and cruel Germans. What I did not need is the naive love of non-romance, unrealistic stupid war scenes and the misuse of a syrupy soundtrack in a film that carefully avoided any historical or political references (Stalinism, Nazism, the Holocaust) only to end but nevertheless offends our sense of history about "the liberation of Poland." A failed opportunity as a movie, but apparently not so propaganda.
