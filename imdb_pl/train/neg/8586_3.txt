What a disappointment ... admittedly the best of the prequels, but the story is weak, the conspiracy is hurried, and the end result is a set of sets, badly made and connected in an amateur way. There are many continuity errors that collide with the original movies, and the appearance of Darth Vader has been treated so horribly that what could have been the legendary moment in modern cinema is now instead a bad laugh that will be ridiculed for many years. I will not complain about the terrible dialogue, because these are Star Wars ... the original three films had a style, a cult feeling and breaking the story, and a strange dialogue added charm. Prequels were shallow attempts to make more money, and this lack of love is shown in spades. Completely disappointing.
