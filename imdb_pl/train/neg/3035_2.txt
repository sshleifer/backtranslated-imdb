We've been served - a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Okay, I must admit that since I am white and did not have practical experience in the "competitive step-dance world", maybe not exactly is the authority in this type of film. On the other hand, when I see him, I know a bad movie. <br /> <br /> And, boy, I just saw him. <br /> <br /> Filmed in Low-Budget-Vision and directed by Ian Iqubal Rashid ("A Touch of Pink") "How She Move" tells the story of how important it is to follow your dreams - even if these dreams include beating loud, annoying hip-hop music and talking to the average person would not understand if he had an international translator. <br /> <br /> I will try to present a short summary of the "storyline". Above all, there are two actors who look like LL Cool J, who work in a car store in Toronto (Mecca of racial diversity), but still have time to practice dancing for eight hours a day. <br /> <br /> There are several other guys in this "team", including a white guy and a guy who looks like "Denzel Washington" in "Malcolm X". There are also two women in the film - one resembles Serena Williams, and the other looks like Geraldine from the old Flip Wilson Show. One of these women was expelled from her private college because her parents spent the entire lessons on drug-addicted siblings. The second girl, a member of Salt N Pepa, is undoubtedly simply useless. <br /> <br /> There is another guy who looks like Eddie Murphy's Buckwheat and at the same time another actor who is a knock-up of Huggy Bear. These guys are rival dancers. Apparently this activity is very difficult to do, and everyone is practicing on the big "Step Monster" jam in Detroit. <br /> <br /> Because I was unable to understand 90 percent of the dialogue (maybe some subtitles would be useful, like in Bergman's movie or one Snow video), it's hard to explain what's going on, apart from quarrels, Serena Williams' girlfriend ( which, by the way, he never smiles) becomes a freelancer (he goes from group to group), there is a bit of step-dance and a lot of annoying hip-hop music. <br /> <br /> This is a typical story about rags to wealth; something like "Rocky" with a really bad soundtrack, "Rudy" with annoying rap music in the background, "Cry Freedom" without laughing. <br /> <br /> But why a movie - which could have a big impact on a black audience - must contain addiction to drugs, bad parents and a title that sounds like a first-grader saying, "How does it move ?? <br /> <br /> However, this movie "moved me". Moved to leave the theater as soon as possible.
