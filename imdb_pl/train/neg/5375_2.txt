Just watching this movie, I almost feel that I've wasted 2 hours of my life, but I think there's something good about it: <br /> <br /> If I were to rate it like any other movie, maybe you'll only get 1 or 2 vertices, but if I rate it as a low-budget indium. the film can have 3 or 4. This means that the movie should be "complete" and without long fragments of boredom or wasting time. This movie is not. But I think that many independent films are about showing film skills, and given that, this movie has some important events. If I want to comment on what the directors should take with me to the next project, I think that the distorted sound effects have some quality. They also manage to build some characters, which, however, leads me to what they should skip in the next project, because building the character takes too long, because it is largely irrelevant to the plot of the film. Long spaces devoted to walking should not be continued in the next project - what's going on? I think this movie is trying to be a bit of everything (building a character, tension and story), and ends with nothing (not too much). <br /> <br /> This movie is trying too much and too much, and I suppose it should be cut out for a short movie. I could easily find an hour of walking or purposeless dialogue to cut a movie. <br /> <br /> There are too many irrelevant things in this movie. History should be more simplified. I know there will be some secret in this movie, but a slight surprise with who the killer is is not a secret. The story of "mystery" almost does not pay attention during the film, which leaves the last "point" as a quick, unsatisfactory ending. <br /> <br /> That's why I would like to say that this movie was a nice attempt, but I can not. I hope the directors will learn from their mistakes and create a better product next time. <br /> <br /> If you're not interested in learning on a bench with low-budget movies, you do not have to watch it - I do not even see why everyone thinks it's bad. <br /> <br /> As others have said, I'm pretty sure that a lot of these 10 videos come from people who have somehow been involved in the movie. This movie could not receive "10", judging by any remote purpose.
