This movie was almost a waste of an hour and a half of my time. Generally I like cheap movies like horror monsters, but this movie was a disappointment. The main disadvantage is the lack of explanation of beings. When they entered the house and found the man he could rent, they explained it. He really does not say anything about them except that they killed his parents, and if I did not miss something, he did not say how he managed to escape ... not to mention that he has no idea why only the survivor stays and basically feeds the creatures after experiencing a near death. It would seem that she would have the opportunity to leave after the "cross incident".
