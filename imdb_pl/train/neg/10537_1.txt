Well, what can you say about the adaptation of Barbara Cartland? <br /> <br /> There are some amazing actors in it (Oliver Reed, Sarah Miles, Christopher Plummer), but apparently they are raising money. <br /> <br /> Lysette Anthony and Marcus Gilbert appeared in Cartland's two other epics - Anthony with Hugh Grant (who looks embarrassed, respectively) and Gilbert with Helena Bonham Carter. <br /> <br /> If you really want to see the observed "adaptation of Cartland, which includes Bonham Carter (" A Hazard of Hearts "- what a title !!). Gilbert is in this weak link, but Bonham Carter is beautiful enough and of course it can work, and the rest of the cast plays it on the cheek firmly (Edward Fox and Diana Rigg)
