<br /> <br /> This movie sucks. It reminded me of Resurrection (Christopher Lambert), which I also think is very boring. And "Semana Santa" is in every respect an even poorer film. <br /> <br /> The only great cast in the film is Alida Valli. Alida is one of the great old ladies in the history of European film. I loved her maniacal looks in "Suspiria" and "inferno" (Dario Argento). I will not spend more time dealing with this film. I will say one more good thing about this film ... use it if you want to fall asleep quickly ...
