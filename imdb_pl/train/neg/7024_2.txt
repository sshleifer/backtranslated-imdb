I borrowed this movie because not only because his gay motive, but the idea of ​​role playing really intrigued me. I was pleasantly surprised that he was filmed in San Francisco because I live near SF. And of course it was nice to see pictures from the Castro district (although castro really suits gays rather than women). But other than that, I can not really recommend this movie. Characters are not really developed so that I would care about them, and when they finally started to "play roles", I was bored. And the roleplaying scenes I saw were a little embarrassing to watch. Acting leaves much to be desired. Needless to say, I have not finished the movie. I will skip this.
