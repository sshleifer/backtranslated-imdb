Disappointing movie. <br /> <br /> The story set our hero as Chrissy, "young", rather grim individual drifting, not doing much. He does not really do much to convey the narrative, so it did not surprise me that I focused on her relatives. It is a pity that Chrissy seems to be an interesting character. <br /> <br /> The story was predictable and at times seemed quite formulated. The question now is when we see Campions, Jacksons and Tamahori's breakthrough with fascinating story-telling stories that will inspire and not entertain in two hours? > Technically, disgusting film shot.
