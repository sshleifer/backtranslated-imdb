I commented when he debuted for the first time and gave him "thumbs in the middle", noting that I gave him the benefit of doubts beyond the first episode. In June 2006, I have seen six episodes so far. As a fanatic of Batman for a lifetime I can say without hesitation: this performance is a complete shit. <br /> <br /> Everything is wrong with him. Everything. Leaving only bad animation and design, the stories are ridiculously intricate and devoid of character development or the explicit interest of the authors of this drain to give any content to any stories. Is it me or JOKER EVERY SIZE? Is Gotham such a great system of justice? Or, whether it is simply a total lack of interest in writers to put in any effort in other villains (see "no character development" above). <br /> <br /> And even worse, every single Joker tale is the same 3-part formula. <br /> <br /> 1) The Joker lets people pass. <br /> <br /> 2) The Joker sets out to gas the entire city. <br /> <br /> 3) Batman saves the day. <br /> <br /> Pfeh. <br /> <br /> There was one episode that I saw was not a story about Joker. The title eludes me, but the wicked was the wicked Cluemaster ... episode "Think Thank Thunk" with the show of quizzes. It was the worst Batman story I have ever seen, heard or read. Yes, worse than "I have Batman in my basement." <br /> <br /> I can not really say what I think about this performance because it's probably against ToS, but it starts with "B" and rhymes with "fastardization". Thank God for the existence of Timm / Dini / etc. Era Bat-Entertainment, return from Fox and Kids WB. Things so good, and I should have known about it, unfortunately it could not last forever.
