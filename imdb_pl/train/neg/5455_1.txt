I saw this work at a film festival in CA. My God, what was the director thinking? Film professors should use this film as a case study, what NOT to do when filming a short film. First of all, this project has absolutely no sense. The movie takes place partly in "The Waystation", a stupid, lousy bar in the middle of nothing where nothing really happens. <br /> <br /> Acting is beyond evil. It's so bad that I almost thought it was a comedy. The main actress Julia Reading is a step below acting in most amateur porn movies. There are one or two decent performances, including guys who played Jacob and Fenner, but it's as if the director had no idea how to work or use their thespian. The only worse thing than acting was dialogue, which bordered on absurdity. The writer (who I suppose is also a director) writes each character as he / she interrogates the comic. <br /> <br /> The overall value of the production is quite good, but to be honest, it's easy to overlook this bad movie. The production project is quite good, although Waystation looks like an ordinary bar. Costumes and make-up are fine and I understand that production has worked with a low budget. It's only when the heroes talk or try to push the story forward, the movie breaks into a pile of shit. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie is awful. It is as if the director / writer has viewed many science-fiction movies and threw all the parts he liked into the mixer and invented it. I just hope that he has used other people's money for it, because if he uses his own, he is a complete nerd.
