I'm a Lynche fan, so I was excited when I found this DVD. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. It's a series of short cartoons that try to show a disturbing and disgusting kind of humor. The animation is very primitive, no doubt done with the help of Macromedia. Every cartoon has a fat guy who beats a family and generally behaves like a moron for everyone he knows. <br /> <br /> For people who are not familiar with this animation, they will probably be under some impression. However, if you have spent a lot of time on Newgrounds.com, just like me, then these cartoons will not be different from other things you've seen before. Many popular amateur artists in Newgrounds do a much better job than what is shown on this DVD. If Lynch had presented this work on the website, it would ideally suit some of the better artists of Newgrounds. But since I saw it on DVD, instead of on Newgrounds, I give it 4/10, instead of 7/10, as I would like. These stories are suitable for the internet, but with the name David Lynch I expected better quality in both history and animation.
