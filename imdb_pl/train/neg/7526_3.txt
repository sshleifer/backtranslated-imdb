This is a high-class dish of kung fu cheese B. Bruce "wannabe" Lee plays Bruce Li ... I think. Of course, let's show Bruce's quick clips and make him close his eyes, and if we react at the right angle at a certain time during the winter solstice, it looks like Bruce. You will laugh at how splicing the movie is not very good, but some nice deleted scenes from Enter the Dragon are thrown into the mix. According to the film, Bruce Lee was killed by a dart as he hung on the helicopter. Of course, they think he can justify Bruce Li for trying to be Bruce, even though his character is supposed to be Bruce's brother (who for some reason still mimics Bruce's gestures and style - very LOOKED). See how Bruce goes one on one with a cowardly lion. The department of props was stopped by Kay-Bee. Bruce also finds nothing wrong with the brutal beating of a crippled man. At the end, the director decided to "throw the flashback" on the stage shown 3 minutes ago !! They must have thought that only single-celled organisms with attention disorders can fully understand this film. <br /> <br />
