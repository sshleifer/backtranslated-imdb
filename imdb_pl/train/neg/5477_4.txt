Take the original SciFi movie and mix up some alternative / revisionist history, and you'll get "Aztec Rex". Apparently Hernand Cortes had to conquer Tyrannosaurus Rex and her partner before conquering the Aztec empire. This is the idea of ​​this movie. Considering the plot, she could really be sucked; the fact that it is just a type of sucking is a cap for writers. There are several problems. At the beginning Cortes plays Ian Ziering. Even with a black wig Ziering as Cortes is as convincing as Axl Rose playing Gandhi. And although Cortes conquers the indigenous peoples of Mexico, it seems that the Aztecs are playing the Hawaiian band entirely. Putting it aside, the T-Rex (s) look pretty good, although each time one of them gets shot, it just leaked CGI. And they die too easily; I suppose if T-Rex were in real life, you could probably knock him down or at least hurt some primitive sixteenth-century weapon. But it takes something from the movie. There are also a few graphical scenes absorbing human T-Rex, which is surprising, but in this context I thought that they work OK. There is plenty of action, and the whole colonization angle is overwhelming, but it does not overwhelm the dinosaur angle, unlike another recent SciFi Original "Warbirds" dinosaur movie. In general, an average (but decent by SciFi Original) movie, which is assessed as modest 4.
