This movie is out of date and does not end up in a sign. He is far from Batman 89, who is trying to copy. This singer can not work, and we see why her filmmaker died. Please note how this movie died at the box office, no one is watching this movie on TV. My uncle and dad were expecting Batman, and the impression of the movie is more like Cop Rock. It is not worth renting 3/10
