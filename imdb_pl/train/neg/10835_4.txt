Great cast. Great acting. Unpredictable plot of the first half <br /> <br /> I really wanted to know what is happening <br /> <br /> with each of these non-reducing heroes and how their seemingly different life will become interrelated. But when <br /> <br /> writers pulled out the glue to start joining the players, <br /> <br /> they mistakenly used the super glue and stopped the movie <br /> <br /> for the last two hours. I still thought it would be better, but only <br /> <br /> it got worse. Do not believe in reviews. It is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Think about it - Tom Cruise has become ugly - why? Gorgeous <br /> <br /> hunky bartender in braces - why? I know it had to do with the plot <br /> <br />, but without them at least there would be one attractive cast member to remember.
