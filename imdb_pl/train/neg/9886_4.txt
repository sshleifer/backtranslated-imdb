This is Peter Falk's film. Period. <br /> <br /> I was 10 when the movie came out; I was a movie maven then. Of course, neither my parents nor I saw this movie when it appeared, but I was in love with the style of his ads and the aura that it was an important movie. OK, 34 years later, I finally saw this movie - I've never seen any film directed by Cassavetes before. Generally, it is a hack. Zero sense of time, editing. The Genena performance reminds me of too much of Dustin Hoffman's time in "Rain Man": technically equally, but completely one-word. When Tom Cruise stole "Rain Man", Falk takes the cake for this movie. <br /> <br /> I was irritated by Genen's performance, really all the time - it seemed more appropriate to "Awakening" (blecch!). It's not all her fault: it's the first thing from the first to the last scene. We never know why? But Falk's character seems real and WALDERFULLY is performed by Falk as a seriously defective man. <br /> <br /> Shave at least an hour (editor needed!), And this would be an arresting portrait of not a woman under the influence, but a simple Cro-Magnon, a man who will face a wife who is not working, yet she can not deal with three children and long hours of her husband's work. <br /> <br /> I rather remember Cassavetes about "The Dirty Dozen" or "Rosemary's Baby". He would have been a better director if he cut himself off from his own inclination to excess - which is shown in this film. <br /> <br /> Bob
