This film sucks from beginning to end (especially). You probably do not have anything worse, acting, plot, photography, working with a camera, etc. It's all bad, very, very bad. <br /> <br /> But it makes it a "big" watch, it will give you more than enough good laughter. The worse, the better! <br /> <br /> I really have no idea what these people really thought when making this movie. A serious movie of vikings? This story is damn funny, it's more like a comedy in disguise, a bit like a Mafia, also pointless, but damn fun. <br /> <br /> And watch out for the very end of the movie ... uhum.
