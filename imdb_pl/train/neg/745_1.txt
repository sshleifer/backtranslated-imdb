I'm not sure how to start describing how bad this movie is. I like bad movies because they are often the most entertaining. I love bad special effects, bad acting, bad music and inept directions. With the exception of music (which was better than I expected), this movie had all these features. <br /> <br /> The special effects were amazingly bad. The worst I've seen since Nintendo 64. Some scenes to watch are Thunderchild, a woman crushed by a mechanical foot, Big Ben scene, a train wreck ... Wow, there are so many bad effects! On the other hand, some scenes from space walkers are well done. <br /> <br /> Acting was as bad as it could be, based directly on the book H.G. Wells. When it comes to having such a good source material, it's almost as if the actors tried to be so exaggerated that it would be fun. And then a mustache ... the most distracting hair on my face that I've seen for a long time. Of course, only half of the film contains acting. The rest are unsmiling characters and poorly rendered effects. <br /> <br /> To say that Timothy Hines is an inept director would be an injustice to inept directors. Using different colored filters between shots for no particular reason, using poorly rendered backgrounds even in indoor scenes, bad green screen, I'm amazed at how this man ever got permission to direct a movie. I could not imagine that you could turn a genius book into this bad movie. Well done, Mr. Hines. Bravo. <br /> <br /> My advice to anyone planning to see this movie is to do what I've done: have friends who like bad movies, drink, play poker while watching, drink and maybe do it all through way. It makes the movie great, so have fun and laugh at this disaster.
