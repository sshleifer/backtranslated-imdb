When his parents-in-law are brutally murdered by a gang of bandits, the young deputy has the duty to escort his silent friend, forced to rap by a gang, to Tucson to the test and end up facing the real killers along the way. <br /> <br /> Decoy is a real lure sent to video stores to distract you from better movies! He is talkative, illogical, free and ultimately very boring. <br /> <br /> There are a few good costumes, sets and photos, but nothing else is good in this vain project by writer / director / producer / star Justin Kreinbrink, who apparently had too much money in his hands. <br /> <br /> They used to do westerns that were less than an hour old. Cut it about half the length and you can have something to look at.
