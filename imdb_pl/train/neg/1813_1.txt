If someone wants to really do a REALLY bad movie, "Wizards of the Lost Kingdom" really sets the measure by which the depth of evil is measured. <br /> <br /> Start with the pseudo-Chewbacca, which follows the main character ... Some poor asshole in a baggy white "furry" costume, which looks as if it were sewn from thrown pieces of carpet. Work slowly, painfully, through more not so special effects that completely deny the viewer the suspension of disbelief. Add a garden dwarf (just for it to be). <br /> <br /> Second, skip this movie completely and find something else to do for one and a half hours.
