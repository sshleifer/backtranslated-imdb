This movie has been rented by a friend. Her choice is usually good. First, I read the cover and expected a good movie. Although <br /> <br /> he was a horror movie. Which I do not prefer. But while watching the movie, no terror came to mind. To jest nudny, <br /> <br /> not a very funny movie. The appearance of Denise Richards <br /> <br /> was again pleasing to the eye. But that's it. My (our four) <br /> <br /> we are a little disappointed. But do not hesitate to see this movie and try to judge it yourself. <br /> <br />
