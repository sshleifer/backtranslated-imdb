With the exception of Brady Hour of Diversity, it was part of the craziest television I had seen for some time. The quality of video production was not so bad, but the general appearance and style were undoubtedly the early 80's. And Marie Osmond looks like she fought Avon Lady. WAY too many eyeliner. <br /> <br /> It was a bit embarrassing to watch veterans Danny Kaye and Eric Severeid taking part in it. Even more interesting was watching Alex Haley about the African pavilion in the World Showcase, which was to take place "in about a year". <br /> <br /> At the time of writing this text is 17 years later and it has not been opened yet (Unless you count Disney's Animal Kingdom.) All in all, despite all the shortcomings, it is still an interesting visual piece of Disney history.
