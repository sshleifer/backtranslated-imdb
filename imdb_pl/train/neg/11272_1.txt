... the first movie I had to go to. And it was a preliminary show of the cast and crew (not that I was involved, I'm in a hurry to add). I did it for the first hour, so I think I have the qualifications to comment, but that was my limit. <br /> <br /> Like other comments here, how it happened with any kind of QA. The accumulation of the worst dialogues, the epitome of wooden acting, the terrible casting, all packed up without a story. <br /> <br /> Tara Fitzgerald's cast was bizarre, almost comical. He has the worst Russian accent in cinema history. <br /> <br /> Starting from the screening, the director and producers drank at the bar in front of the cinema. Of course, they could not sit back. <br /> <br />
