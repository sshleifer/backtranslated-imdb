My wife and I just finished it, despite several threats from both of us to turn it off. For the most part, boredom was the worst part of the film, there was very little emotion. Acting was awful, to the extent that we actually chuckled a few times in some of the worse scenes (for example, church lady). The dead sister used paranormal means to contact the living twin, although instead she sent useful information that focused on trying to scare her, instead of looking like a Ring. Instead, engage the police who, I am sure, have discovered that earplugs are wearing DNA - instead, he is creating a horrible plan to "get" a man who hid his sister's accidental death. I call it a terrible plan, because eventually it lets him kill her, which disappears in black. Bad window, bad acting, bad ending.
