Here is the horror PRISCILLA: QUEEN DESERTY (they want!) With Melinda / Mindy (BACK TO LIFE 3) Clarke as Candy, a desert resident who breaks up with boyfriend Johnny (Jason Durr). It ends in a prison on the southern edge led by the sadistic Major Screw (captivating Robert Englund in the wig). She and her beloved boxes of animals are hiding in a monastery at a gas station until they are transformed by a newly fallen meteor. Dogs turn into an unbearable drag queen, and Candy develops a VERY long, talking, killing forked tongue that he can not control. Bandits looking for stolen spoil and other various skulls add additional complications. <br /> <br /> First of all, Clarke is fantastic and creates what is in this movie. You watch her and you see someone very funny in slapstick scenes, very convincing during the horror scenes and VERY sexy in different wigs and costumes, including pop-ups, latex body with taut skin ... a huge star. It is a pity that the rest of this iconic rehearsal does not fulfill her promise. <br /> <br /> Winny director / scripter Sciamma, who thinks the same bizarre premise is enough to sustain laughter ... but his vulgar gags, irritating support characters and stupid dialogue can not replace a real sense of humor. Another nail to the coffin; the film looks cheap, lots of bright colors and sets are strangely silenced by muddy photography and dusty deserts. Fortunately for Sciamma, Clarke is in her movie because she is watching you.
