I was looking for a charming, simple comedy that would have killed time, but the choice of this movie turned out to be a huge mistake. <br /> <br /> I can not write a good thing about it. First of all, the script is stupid and not funny at all, based on tired, recycled jokes and a fake turtle for laughter. In my book, it's not funny, it's pathetic. <br /> <br /> Low budget "effects" (if I can even call them effects) with horrible photos. In many places it seems almost like an indie movie with no money. <br /> <br /> Acting ... I feel sorry for the actors. Are Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards desperately looking for money they agreed to participate in? (looking at their latest filmography, so it would look.) Despite the costumes, Pamela shows her age and as a whole, does not even look sexy, let alone funny. <br /> <br /> This movie is not even in a bad category that is fun. It's just bad, as if everyone involved had enough. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
