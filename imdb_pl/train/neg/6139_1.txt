Thanks to G_d I bombed, or we can be treated to such delicacies as "Skate Fu", where we can see people like Brian Boitano doing triple lashing and cutting bad guys on ribbons with their razor-sharp ice skates, but digressing. One of the things that could have helped this turkey would be a little T & A from Mrs. Agbayani. The world would not see anything new (at least part of the world that saw her Playboy). I really believe that porn would be much better for her talents, although Aubrey Hepburn could not stay on the surface of this channel. One explanation of Kurt Thomas's presence may be traumatic brain injury, probably too short a descent. It is good that the IOC was not as urgent in "doping" as it is now, or Kurt would certainly be deprived of his medals. Avoid at all costs.
