First of all, let me say that I am a big fan of Fanpro. I see this as a way to continue a good performance long after its cancellation. Star Trek Voyages and Star Wars Revelations are examples of worthy efforts. So I have a weakness for the fanpro thing, which means I will overlook things that would normally be mistreated. <br /> <br /> So on ST: HF. First of all, good things. Enthusiasm is the main part of the credibility of each performance, and most crews of different ships seem to enjoy their roles. Then the effects are not bad for the effort of home brewing, without anything that really hurts you. These stories are not that bad either. Nothing particularly innovative, but solid enough stuff and at least stories last. <br /> <br /> But it has many mistakes. <br /> <br /> First of all, although it's quite obvious they HAVE to tear out the Star Trek material, set the background, music and effects, I see no reason why they would have to rip out virtually every other musical sci-fi score. Everything, from aliens to spaceship soldiers, raises the orchestra's head at one time or another. Similarly, much of the material comes from other films, conscientiously CGI, to look different. Gray warships, for example, though hidden, are obviously Star Star Destroyers from Star Wars. And the station is also quite an obvious battle station for Ticonderoga fleet from Starship Troopers. Similarly, sound effects from various Star Wars movies appear in space battles between fighters, just like animated movies. In one scene in the first or second season, I think you can see even two TIE fighters flying through the battle, which almost does not suspend disbelief. <br /> <br /> Action differs from sensible to terribly painful to watch. However, everyone improves with the progress of the seasons, but expect a grimace on the screen, especially in the early seasons. They also made interesting acting choices. Let's say food replicators at this show seem to be permanently set to "cake" and leave it. <br /> <br /> The makeup effects are generally quite effective. But they really should mercilessly club down to death a person who decided to use cheap Ferengi and Cardassian masks for anything other than using the background or "passing" shots. They are simply unrealistic. Each time I saw one of them (except for the attempt of too much laughter), I expected that the unfortunate soul would put a gun on it and announce that "This is sticking! In one scene, the "Kardasjanin" actually talks while wearing one of them. Not only the lips do not move, but the mask does not even have an opening where the lips should be. Someone must be hit hard. Could they not take a craft knife for God's sake! There are also well-made, but unintentionally funny make-up works, such as the look of Herman Munster. <br /> <br /> Writing, though consistent, is nothing new. Instead, the script works like a continuation of DS9, and ships leave DS12 in various missions. The new enemy, "Gray", is not too dangerous, and the storyline that concerns them is in fact a modification of Borg's themes. ie Starfleet meets Gray, Gray is extremely powerful, Starfleet is barely escaping with their lives, and then thanks to technology they start looking for ways to fight with the enemy, etc., etc. Everything previously done with Borg. the dialogue is the bone of contention. Star Trek writers have long been able to write "insert technobabble here" into the script. This usually means the exposure of the latest plan to fight the enemy with "quantum phase discriminators" or "insulating charges", etc. In other words, nonsense that says they are in the case, and the resolution is at hand. > <br /> Words are really gibberish. I do not have a problem with it, but where ST: HF makes this mess, it's where the concept from the real world joins this concept. <br /> <br /> Tactical advices, such as "We need to regroup," sound good, but not when the trio of characters already standing in the group. Similarly asked about the situation, the tactical officer will hear the answer "We count three battleships". Did he really have to count them? Come on! I expected the questioner to ask him: "Are you sure?" Or "Can you double check". But my favorite commentary is: <br /> <br /> Captain: "Can we establish two-way communication?" <br /> <br /> Commander: "No, we can only send and receive ..." <br /> < br /> Well, duh! ..... <br /> <br /> Having said all of the above, the show improves. Seasons 1 and 2 are quite bad, 3 shows improvement, but 4 and 5 are where it starts noticeably Season 6 looks pretty reasonable by now. <br /> <br /> I have a problem with the choice of media for performances. Quicktime sucks, to be honest and the sooner they go into the divx / avi format, the better. we like to do our downloaded programs and watch them on a decent size screen instead of looking at a small QT window on the computer monitor. Quicktime not only makes it difficult, but the resolution of 320x180, in which the shows are, is not in general, well-scaled. In fact, the shows are unobtainable, as if they were ten copies of the VHS tapes, at least they could have done it to include the high resolution download option. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the program has a promise, and even begin to like some of the characters. But it's 40 episodes, so I'm not sure if it speaks about character development at all. <br /> <br /> But what can you say, it's free .... <br /> <br /> PS: With 28 votes 19 people rated this program as 9 or 10. Hmmmm ... we watched this the program itself? Or maybe you are 19 years old?
