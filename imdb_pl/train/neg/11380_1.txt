When I first saw Robotboy, I found it fresh and interesting, but then I noticed that with each episode this series tries to learn how to behave, what is good / bad. The episodes have become predictable. And the main characters are not interesting. Again we see a hyper-intelligent boy, beaten up by his older brother, parents who do not understand their child, and his friends: a girl and a fat boy. Also this program has no logic. A state-of-the-art robot that runs on two AA size batteries and can use multiple weapons. But the biggest problem is the difference between activated and superactive modes. We see two different robots and reject the main idea of ​​the series: "The robot must learn to behave in human society"
