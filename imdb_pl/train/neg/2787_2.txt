By numbers, the story of Kid (Prince), singer, on the way to becoming a star. Then he falls in love with Apollonia (Appolonia Kotero). But he must deal with his father beating his wife (Clarence Williams III!) And with his own self-destructive behavior. <br /> <br /> I saw it in the theater in 1984. I was not a big fan of Prince, but I liked the three big songs from this movie - "Purple Rain", "Let's Get Crazy" and "When Doves Cry". The concert scenes in this movie are great - full of energy and excitement. Unfortunately, this is a VERY small part of the movie. <br /> <br /> The story is plainly obvious and has been made many times before - and much better. Subplots are, nicely, poorly served. The love triangle between The Kid, Appolonia and Morris Day was so predictable and tired that I was insulted. His wife fighting her is needed for the story, but the scenes are so badly treated (in action and direction) that I could not believe it. The script is awful - a bad dialogue and some really painful "comedies". And there is a lot of misogyny here - the kid's mother is beaten up; The kid hitting Appolonia and (for good reason) Apolonia is running apart and goes topless to swim in a dirty river. Also the characters of Williams and Princes treat women in a terrible way. <br /> <br /> Acting is where the movie REALLY fails. Apolonia is sweet and beautiful - but there is no actor. And Prince is (the easiest) worst actor I've ever seen. His empty face and wooden dialogue are so bad that I could not believe it. This movie comes to life only during the concert stages, but there are not really too many of them. The "dramatic" scenes are so badly handled that they make the film difficult to navigate. They should just make this concert movie. I give it 2 - only for music.
