Not a "feminine film", but a movie for a gang. One of the worst films made by a male director about a woman. Director Andy McKay simply does not know the woman. Tops of bad taste, humorous style of American Pie, raw story, meaningless, groundless story, overthrown figures. Vulgar fantasies came to life on the screen. Offensive and definitely not fun. I wonder how the three good actresses agreed to take part in it.
