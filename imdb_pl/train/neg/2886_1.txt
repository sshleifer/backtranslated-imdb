Horrible, horrible, terrible, do not waste your money on renting this movie. It's like a low budget for a Canadian TV movie. Absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen and there were many others. This movie is not worth the time it takes to put it in a DVD player or VCR. : ~ (Can you write ten lines? Acting was frightening.It had absolutely no flow.I saw a TV movie about the killer BTK and it was much better (compared with that) probably what they were going to do to produce this movie, but if he would educate us or tell the story of a BTK killer whom they missed a mile away.
