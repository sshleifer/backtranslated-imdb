This is the worst program I've seen for years. I think it should be removed from T.V. because of its delay. It's so stupid that I could faint when I watch it. (even though I never watch it because it's VERY poor) <br /> <br /> Goofs: When the mac says it can; do not eat sugar, in another episode it eats sugar. Almost everything in the world has sugar in it !!! In the episode "Eddie Monster", when whirls scream at Terrance, he falls into the PLUS chest twice, in the time when he falls, when he does not fall, he falls aside. What stupidity. I can not even say the word "I support the house". I even did a song with my band about how the concert is delayed. Byyyyyyyyeeeee
