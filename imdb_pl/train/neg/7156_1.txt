Dooohhh! My Bwainn Hurrrts! Certainly he does it after this endurance test of the film. How the hell I managed to go without hitting the forward button. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's me! Maybe I do not understand the premise of the film ... or maybe I do not appreciate his alleged mystical atmosphere. In my humble opinion, although the movie has more or less the mystical atmosphere of a trip to McDonalds. <br /> <br /> In addition, the characters were terrible, and in the cartoon Tom & Jerry is more character development. Yaarrrghhh! Why am I doing this? Why am I looking at such tripe? It's enough that someone escapes and joins the monastery or the Foreign Legion !! YAARGH !! Absolutely scary movie in every respect. Besides, it's not bad.
