I remember seeing this movie a long time ago on TV. I remember the assumption that the film is about several hotel guests who were attacked by ants eating people. What I did not remember was HOW IT WAS AWARENESS !!! <br /> <br /> I recently caught this movie on TV. I'm sure it must have been a mistake, because such films usually disappear from existence and you can never find them again! Suzanne Somers (at the peak of her career at Chrissy in "Three's Company") plays a vacationer at Lakewood Manor. Construction workers install the pool outside and accidentally interfere with the ant nest. Or maybe I should say: * MOST READING ANTS '!! One of the workers is attacked by ants. In an instant he removes them from his clothes one by one, the next minute, in which he covers them. The next scene shows the skeleton in the dirt. <br /> <br /> If you thought it was pretty far-fetched, you should see Myrna Loy playing a resident in a wheelchair that flies out of the Court through a helicopter! I could almost imagine how relieved he was leaving the movie! <br /> <br /> Recent scenes show Suzanne, Robert Foxworth and the third guy sitting on the floor in a hotel room with their backs to each other, blowing through straws and covered with ants. <br /> <br /> It's basically a movie. There really is no reference to a "catastrophe" or "big star". It was supposed to be a "big" television event. Now, you're lucky if you get dumped at 4:00 on the local TV station. <br /> <br /> If you want to catch Suzanne Somers at its best, take a look at the Kompania Trzy company. If you want to see Myrna Loy do something to put the bread on the table and pay the bills, watch this movie. <br /> <br /> 0/10
