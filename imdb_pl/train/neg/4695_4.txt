I watched the movie several times and never thought it was so fun, but it's still fun to watch and have fun with a few laughter. <br /> <br /> It's about women who work in the company, and their boss is a moron and they ended up giving him the taste of their own medicine and trying to get the respect they deserve. <br /> <br /> Acting is really good. Dabney Coleman is one of those 80's who plays a good bad guy, not really bad, just unbearable. Dolly's party is cute, and the fun in comedies and the south is really great. Jane Fonda is so-so and does not do much for me. Lily Tomlin is the best thing in this movie, she has the funniest lines and she made me laugh a few times, I have to love her. <br /> <br /> I can recommend it to anyone who likes a comedy from the 80's. I like the movie, but it has something I do not like about it. It starts great and has a nice flow, and then everything starts to meet at once and makes me less worried about the characters. Everyone has little fantasies about what they would like to do to the boss, and although "sweet", I thought it slowed the flow of the movie. As the film evolves, once again, things start to happen and the funniest things happen, and then slow down again to quickly finish what is too good to be true. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 stars, but try it if you have not seen it yet. I think that depending on the mood may be more or less likeable.
