Not only the plot is missing, but it is also awful. In connection with the obvious feature holes, this movie is very difficult to watch. I have questioned my own mental health many times, continuing to watch the movie long after the conspiracy jumped from a shark. Here's a sample of aspects lamera ... <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> A professional "Pogromca" insists on sleeping independently at night. He wakes up to a woman crying, sitting no more than 3 feet away from him, in the middle of nowhere. She comforts her immediately, without questioning her sudden appearance. Goes from crying to seducing him, and he lets it happen with obvious consequences ... <br /> <br /> One of the main characters is Zoe, she has been bitten by a vampire, but as long as she takes these "experimental" pills "she got in Mexico City, she's fine, although her body temperature is lower than room temperature ... <br /> <br /> The guard outside the monastery, where the protagonist is staying, is killed by vampires, the hero comes out the next day. Then he comes back a day later to be surprised that the vampires attacked the monastery the night after he left ... <br /> <br /> ... avoid this movie.
