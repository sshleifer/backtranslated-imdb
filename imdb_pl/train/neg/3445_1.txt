When the young Kevin receives a boat of his dead uncle as a present, he invites five friends for a trip to Catalina Island for the weekend. While traveling, they drink alcohol, have sex and play, and each of them talks about his greatest fear. Later, Kevin sinks in the open sea, the engine stops, and they are haunted and murdered by their greatest deepest fear. <br /> <br /> Yesterday, my wife, son, daughter and three other friends joined the "Haunted Boat" on DVD. With less than 30 minutes of time, the group gave up watching this sloppy and boring amateur piece, and we decided to watch another film. Later, I decided to watch the rest of this movie to see how bad it could be and it would be better to go to sleep. This confused story has a horrible cinematography and work with a camera, with a cast that probably learns to be actors and actresses, and in the end this movie seems to be a bad cinema school project. The horrible and pretentious scenario finally shows an absurd twist, actually a complete mess that does not allow me to understand what's going on in this story. Did the girl go wild and travel alone in the boat, imagining the whole situation with imaginary friends? If it's true, is their friend again at the very end of his madness? My voice is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Viagem Para a Morte' ('Trip to the Death')
