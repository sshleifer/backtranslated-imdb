Bad. Bad. Bad. These three lines sum up this shitty little movie that can only bring idiotic children and their parents to the cinema. and his ... # 1 Film in America! What does this country think? Mike Myers looks more like Micheal Jackson. A Chinese lady who falls asleep within 3 minutes. A lame plot with dirty jokes. It's grotesque and terrible. When Green-Eggs and Ham appear in 2005, I will be so happy! (no) Eddie Murphy and Tracy Morgan will probably play two hipsters trying to find lost Green-Eggs and Ham. They'll try Sam-I-Am and it means they're running away with this guy. (I hope they will not destroy the classic book). Do not waste time and money seeing this.
