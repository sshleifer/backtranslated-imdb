This is one of those movies that I could sit only once. Charlotte Henry is doing well - in fact all the actors were doing well. The problem was in the script, dialog, direction, editing, sets and special effects. Of course, it was 1933, but it really creaked. Part of the problem is that actors like Richard Arlen, Gary Cooper, W.C. Pola and Cary Grant are not recognizable (there the faces called for recognition that was not coming). The film simply got together without any consistency. There is a lack of Lewis Carrolls' soul, humor and continuity. What a pity! It's such a great book. I recommend the Disney version of 1951.
