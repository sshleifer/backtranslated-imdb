Dungeons of dr. Tarr's concern a journalist who travels to a psychiatric hospital to write about a new technique that they use with their patients. However, the journalist quickly learns that things are not what they seem, and asylum is run by patients, and doctors are in cages. First of all, some parts of the movie are just boring and just make you want to fall asleep, and the interesting parts are interesting for all the bad reasons (a guy who thinks he's a chicken, for instance). I must admit that the story is quite good, but the film itself is bombing. The film's music is really weird and like something you can hear in some crazy comedy, and yes, there is a scene where people from chicken dance, which almost made me want to turn off the screen. Watch this video at your own risk! <br /> <br /> Rated: R for violence and nudity.
