When I finally had the chance to watch Zombie 3 (Zombie Flesheaters 2 in Europe) on the imported Japanese DVD region 2, I was delighted with how funny this zombie epic is. The transfer is almost immaculate, as good as it ever will be unless Anchor Bay takes care of it. Gore really stands out as it should and you can really appreciate the perfect makeup and gore fx. The sound is also great. It's only 2 channels dolby, but if you have a receiver with Dolby Prologic 2, you can really appreciate bad music (actually a very good result) and effective, though cheap sound effects. It never sounded that good and the perfect transfer increases the overall pleasure. <br /> <br /> I never realized how much blood is flowing in this film, it is extremely brutal with exploding arrows in the head, exploding boilers filled with mega pimples, a cleaver to the zombie's throat, burnt limbs of a woman (how it happened I did not burn a guy), gut rumination, zombie children and much more lost song. <br /> <br /> No doubt for hardcore Zombie fans, especially the Italian kind. There are some great songs and photos that you can find, I think people do not give enough credit, if you see clean print, and not some terrifying pirate copy, this is a completely different experience. <br /> <br /> This movie never goes away for a second and I realize that it's incoherent in the plot, dubbing is horrible, acting is stiff and the sense of disrespect is celebrated in a big way, but it's part of its charm. <br /> <br /> For me this is one of the best horror movies ever made, you can not film it wrong, so good, deliberately. He is the random genius of the highest order. If he played it for a laugh, it would be a disaster, but they played it straight as an arrow, and the result is a great cult classic, which thumbs his nose in any traditional filming standard. <br /> <br /> Plenty of action sequences, exotic locations, great scenography, good, sometimes a game of cinematography, wonderfully trashy acting and inconsistent, but still interesting plot, great makeup effects, beautiful women who can kick butt, perfect music and sometimes funny, sometimes scary, but always funny zombies. If you can be wrong with this movie, it has it all, a cult classic that can stand the test of time.
