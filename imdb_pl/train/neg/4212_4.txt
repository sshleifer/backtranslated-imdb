The beginning of this movie is perfect, with amazing sound and nice humor, but when the film turns into animation, it quickly loses its charm. <br /> <br /> One of the reasons why it was, at least for me, was that the colors in most of the animations are too quiet, with too little contrast. It does not look good, at least on VHS. Every once in a while, it explodes and looks great, but not often. Characters come and go too fast. For example, I would like to see more "Moby Dick". When the film begins to drag, it rises again with the dragon's entrance, and then the movie ends strongly. <br /> <br /> In general, this is not memorable enough or able to compete with the big animated films of the last dozen or so years.
