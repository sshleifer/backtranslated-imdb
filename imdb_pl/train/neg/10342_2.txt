Jameson Parker and Marilyn Hassett are the most unbelievable couple since the days of John Travolta and Lily Tomlin. Larry Peerce's direction escapes uncontrollableness between the black farce and the Roman tragedy. Robert Klein certainly thinks it's the first, and his egocentric performance in a smaller role underlines the total imbalance and chemistry between the players in the film. Usually I do not like to let myself go crazy, but The Bell Jar is one of my favorite books of all time, and watching what they did with it makes me literally crazy.
