It must be the most brutal "comedy" I've ever seen in my life. Ben Stiller, Jack Black and Christopher Walken as a crazy homeless CAN NOT make me laugh? Something must be wrong with this picture. This is the only movie I wanted to leave. I used free passes and I still wanted to get my money back. I can say with all my heart that the only movie I've seen worse than this was HOUSE OF THE DEAD. The. ONLY. worse. movie. I laughed lightly on the carousel scene and that's all. Spending 2 hours on something that is comedy should make you laugh more, right? I do not know, unless the filmmakers thought that "flan" is a funny word or something. And the second running joke really overcomes the dead horse - literally.
