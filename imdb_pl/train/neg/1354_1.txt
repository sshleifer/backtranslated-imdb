I saw his movie at the Ann Arbor Film Festival. I'm a film student at the University of Michigan, so I know something about the movie. And Crispin Glover's film is outrageous. In principle, he uses the mentally handicapped. Shirly Temple is not only an antichrist (which I admit is a bit funny), mentally challenged to kill each other, but there is an obsession with killing snails. Crispin also plays with the idea of ​​falling in love with one of his actors, who is just like everyone else with a mental disability. PETA and human rights should be everywhere. This is not a "counter-culture", as Crispin stated at the Ann Arbor Film Festival, it is exploitation.
