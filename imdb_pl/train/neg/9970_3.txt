People who really liked the Child Problem (1990) must have examined their heads. Who would have thought that a malicious little boy wreaked havoc on others and considered it funny? The film is not funny, never, in any way, from beginning to end. He wants to be a cartoon, but writers do not realize that slapstick is not funny when people are attacked by bears or hit with baseball bats. It can be funny in cartoons, but not in the movie. <br /> <br /> The young protagonist of the film is Junior (Michael Oliver), who since childhood was placed on the front door of foster parents for adoption. Families reject him because Junior tends to give them hard times. <br /> <br /> Then he is thrown into an orphanage, where he terrorizes nuns and writes letters to the condemned Bow-Tie Killer (Michael Richards). He was soon adopted by Ben and Flo Healy (the late John Ritter and his wife Amy Yasbeck) who are dying to have a child to be like any other parent in their neighborhood. <br /> <br /> Junior becomes a member of the Healy family, and "Little" Ben is interested in him, even though he destroys a camping trip, luring a bear to the place or throwing a cat on his father "Big" Ben (Jack Warden), bigoted politician. <br /> <br /> I think we should take care of Junior so we can root him out when he gets revenge on people. His new mother, Flo, is a bitch, his grandfather is completely selfish, and one little girl - who despises adopted children - is such a spoiled brat. <br /> <br /> But what Junior does to get the last laugh is not funny - it's mean, cruel and sometimes life-threatening. <br /> <br /> And what is the message of the movie? That children should solve problems with violence and vandalism? That they should seek friendship by writing to convicted killers? They definitely do not know what it's like to be a bad child. Junior is not one - he is just a sadist, a small asshole. There used to be a time when other children fought. Now everyone is laughing when Junior beats children with a baseball bat. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that this movie was sold as a "family comedy". What's worse, Child Problem has a PG rating. What did the MPAA think when they saw it? There are a lot of profanity and malicious mischief that you can think about the division between PG and PG-13. <br /> <br /> The children will enjoy it, but the parents will be shocked by what is shown on the screen. For most people, Child Problem will be considered a classic "pleasure of guilt"; a film that someone will shamefully admit to like, although the overwhelming opinion, as reported by more serious viewers, is that the movie is a piece of nonsense.
