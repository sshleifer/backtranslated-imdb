"It's very difficult to describe how exciting it is to make a relationship like dramatic scenes, such as pornographic scenes cast as in a good measure, and arouse controversy-aversion and make us like money and things more. "- Ellen, lost quote. <br /> <br /> "Kissing, Like, On, Like, Mouth and Stuff" is like the best artistic venture ever created. Watching like Ellen's hairy arms and how Chris's masturbation was like the top of my many years of watching movies. But before I start to like breaking new US-20-airhead records with my "likes", let me briefly give you a list of high-class lights of this visual feast: <br /> <br /> 1 Chris is doing a deed of his genitals. And that's not all: the way the camera (directed so elegantly by Ellen and Patrick) rewards the viewer with a full-screen shot of Chris's fat white stomach after he finishes the non-Catholic act - it was really exciting. I can honestly say I have never seen such grace. Chris, you should be doing more of these scenes in your next movies, because that's exactly what we needed as a continuation of what this brilliant genius man, Lars von Trier and his "Idiots 95" started. Fast, and then hairy, thick, white belly: what can any filmmaker ask for ?! Needless to say, I can sit all day and watch Chris spatter (despite the fact that I'm simple) ... Such poetry in motion. Such elegance, such a style. No less than total, divine inspiration came to make this sequence - plus a solid amount of Zen philosophy. Even Barbra Streisand could not be more spiritual than this one. <br /> <br /> 2. Hairy, thick shoulders Ellen. Close-up wobbly-camera, so skillfully photographed by our two directors of photography (I can not emphasize enough), Ellen and Patrick, have often caused confusion associated with the proper identification of a given gender. There were several scenes in which we saw a part of the body (leg, arm or foot), but often it was a game of guessing: is this part of the body belongs to a man or a woman? Of course, Chris and his colleagues, Ellen, Patrick and whatsername, deliberately rushed because their bodies were perfect to create this gender-related disorder. Sometimes it was hard to guess if anyone saw a woman or man's leg. Patrick is so skinny and effeminate in his movements, so hairless and impeccable, while Ellen and the other girl are so damn pretty with their thick legs and arms. Excellent. <br /> <br /> 3. Brilliant - especially the way that connects to the theme of reversing roles between the sexes: so completely original and stunning. Ellen acts like a man, wants sex all the time, and her ex-Patrick wants to talk - like a girl. Spiffing. <br /> <br /> 4. Searching for Ellen by a leftist partner. "He must love" The Simpsons ", which is quite leftist." I am glad that the creators of this film decided to break the long tradition of offering us smart leftists. Ellen is such a refreshing - and realistic - change. The number of "likes" that she and her liberal friends can express in less than 80 minutes is really phenomenal (exactly 3484). They managed to realistically transfer their ineptitude from real life to the big screen with minimal effort, and applaud them for it. <br /> <br /> 5. Close-ups of toes. Lots of things here for fetishists, which I think is a very liberal, praiseworthy way to reach sexual minorities. After all, shoe fetishists are so little offered in a modern cinema, so it's nice to see that someone THIRST there. <br /> <br /> KOTM, or rather KLOTLMAS, offers more than meets the eye. This is not just a modest movie about shallow people who engage in empty relationships while indulging in senseless conversations. No, that's much more. It is the light that leads all stupid creatures; guiding light that dominates the futile lives of various pseudo-artistic would-bes who have just left the film school, and plan to attack our senses with a weak drift, which hopefully will play well at pretentious festivals such as Sundance and Cannes, enabling them to obtain the necessary exposure, and so a real cash change, with which they later hire Sean Penn and George Clooney to promote the saving of the planet and solve ALL of the political problems that this world is facing. Is there a better way to do this than to make porn at the very beginning? <br /> <br /> If Chris and Ellen made a camera here, as clearly stated in the endpoints, who held the camera while both were in front of him? They probably hired passers-by and pushed the camera into their own hands ... <br /> <br /> Go to http://rateyourmusic.com/~Fedor8 and check out my "TV & Cinema: 150 worst case list of nepotism".
