What a joke. I watch it on channel 1 and I think that watching dry paint is much more fun. What happened to Caspar Van Dien brought him to this nightmare. Horrible acting, very boring plot and terrible direction. It's horrible, fun. It has to be full of tension, but more comedy. If you want to see horrible acting, funny script writing and a story, check out this movie. If I was Van Dien, I would not only ask 10% of my agent, but I would fire this bastard. What a turkey. Does not even match MST 3K !! It would be a good movie to cure insomnia. I especially like the part where Van Dien throws overboard and then comes back in a few minutes! I can only imagine that the writers were not writing a relationship using the writer's strike. What a horrible movie !!!
