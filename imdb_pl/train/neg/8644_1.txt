It's a complete scam ... <br /> <br /> The film was clearly filmed in the northwestern state of Rajasthan. Look at the chase scene - the vehicles are Indians; the magazine is entirely Hindi - the language used in India. The ride takes place on the typical streets of Jaipur. Also the palace is in Amer - about 10 miles from Jaipur, Rajasthan. DVD movie makers (Bonus) seem to give the impression that they risked their lives by shooting photos in and around Kabul. Almost all of their action scenes are shot in India. The scene in which they see the group singing around the fire is so false that they did not even think about changing it to the folk song Afghani. They just recorded the Rajasthani folk song. How can I know this because I traveled extensively around this area. They are only in a team to make a big problem. I challenge creators of film.
