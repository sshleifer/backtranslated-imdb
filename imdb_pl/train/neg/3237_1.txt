Not that I am buzzing with joy at the sight of realistic blood shed, but when I put a DVD in the waiting for a bloodbath, and what I get is one bloody scene (eyeball) at the end of the tail of false slapping and spinning on a desk chair, I think "well that 43 minutes of my life have passed forever." I would not consider this "Flowers of Body and Blood" for exercise of will; check if you can sit through it. Flower of Flesh and Blood had some difficult places to watch. Devil's experiment is not. It was silly at best, and at worst ... well ... really stupid. Perhaps my expectations were too high. I put the DVD in thinking: "Oh man, it will be sick." After seeing their false strokes in the girl about a thousand times, I watched it quickly. <br /> <br /> Two kinds of people would be interested in this movie. 1) People who are looking for movies to see how it really is, or 2) the worst horror movies. I was looking for this and other Guinea Pig movies for the second reason, but even if I were in the first category, this movie would not float on my boat. Actually, I imagine that this movie increases blood lust ... like "WILL ONLY KILL B * TCH ALREADY !!" To sum up, the only reason for this movie is to collect data. If you want a carnage that traditional horror does not provide, get Traces of Death. Sure, it sucks too, but at least you'll get the blood and the courage you expect. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can praise this nonsense is because they feel they should. No artistic merits I can understand, no reason why he would not be known, nothing. Only a bad attempt to shock.
