This is the third parody of scary movies and hopefully the last one. This time, the parody is mainly on The Ring, Signs and 8 Miles for some strange reason. In my opinion, this movie was very pointless and unnecessary, and even funny. I may have laughed three times and it is not enough for a comedy. I really liked the first two, but this one was just stupid. If your jokes consist of corpses that are beaten and people keep throwing each other, then this movie is for you. In my opinion, if you are smart enough to stay at home and save money and stop making such movies, they just get worse 3/10.
