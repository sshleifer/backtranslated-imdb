Linda Lovelace was the victim of a sadistic female assailant, Chuck Traynor. I do not understand how having sex with a dog (which is also an abuse for animals) can be fun or fun. Linda Lovelace was a virtual prisoner who was forced to do these films. I know that some people will criticize this comment, but I am deeply convinced that such films fuel the fire of hatred and further misogynistic feelings towards women. This society still presents women as sexual objects as opposed to human beings. We call ourselves "civilized", but I feel that we have a long way to go before we can scratch the surface of civilization.
