I do not know how this movie has received so many positive reviews on this site! I am a big fan of vonnegut and I know the story of this original Showtime movie very scandalously, but even if I was not, it's a weak acting, VERY poor cast (Sean Astin as brilliant, athletic and all around, Harrison ?? This guy is totally general!), and writing to a lower standard meant that these tripe were barely visible. Someone pointed out how charming the line Maculay Culkin was. If you read this and thought it was pure comical brilliance (unfortunately, it's probably the most fun part of the movie), you might like this movie. But if you're a Vonnegut fan or you're not crazy, do not look at it. Please.
