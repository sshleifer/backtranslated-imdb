The message sucked me in, but it was clear about 30 seconds that it was either David Lynch or something serious. It's interesting to just look through the list of fundamentalist washes. I can be a sucker for a moving spiritual piece (Romero comes to mind), but there was nothing spiritual about it. It seems we all have to pretend to have an iQ 80 (or just do a lobotomy - Jennifer, what happened to you?) And blindly follow the Bible without any self-control, otherwise we will launch a second coming. It is a kind of attitude that makes people fly by jets in 110 storey buildings (I work around the corner from the former WTC). I like to think that God is a little bit bigger.
