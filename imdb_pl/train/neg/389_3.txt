I bet Gene Simmons and Vincent Pastore have negotiated in advance how many episodes would be willing to appear. Is not Gene too fancy to switch to a women's team and then throw himself on the sword? And Big Pussy? What the hell was, "look at me, I'm a rat!" Double nonsense? All this clich√© mafia teased - COME! The big names that voted for have simply received money for charity and received a non-standard exit. Hmm ... This is not reality, but the drama is staged! Another performance by Mark Burnett, "Survivor," also asked me questions when Johnny Fairplay started his trip when he had a clearly short time before his child was born. <br /> <br /> Yuk!
