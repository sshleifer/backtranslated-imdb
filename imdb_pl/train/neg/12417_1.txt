Any movie that starts with a cow's shagging female calf can not promise much. As for the kibbutz stereotypes, as it happened 50 years ago, it's good that I was there and it just was not there. OK, every kibbutz had only a small fragment of something shown in the movie (like young people at night in the kitchen), but you can not show the whole kibbutz as full of all of them - say - naughty features. Each kibbutz had its own problems, but hardly any kibbutz had all of them. Israel's views were great. I still remember my youth in the Garden of Eden, called Emek (the valley). Yes, and acting was good too, so you see that not everything was black - just a bad portrait - probably also deliberately.
