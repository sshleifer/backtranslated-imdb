Model Chris McCormack (Margaux Hemingway) was brutally raped by a teacher (Chris Sarandon) with her sister Kathy (Mariel Hemingway). He is put on trial, but he is completely free. Then he rapes Kathy! <br /> <br /> Abusive and sick film about rape. This film was advertised as an important drama about rape. This is a badly written and (mostly) badly played drama. It is suspected that he is sympathetic to the rape victim, but he throws the stage on our face. To be completely honest, Hemingway's acting is so bad in this sequence that it loses its real impact. The trial scenes were boring and predictable. And the movie went too far when 15-year-old Mariel was raped (fortunately she was not shown). I admit, however, that this led to a great ending when Margaux grabs the gun and shoots Sarandon dead. But seriously - raping a young girl is simply revolting. <br /> <br /> Acting does not help. Margaux, for example, was not an actress. She was certainly a beautiful woman (and in my opinion a real model), but her acting left a lot to be desired. It reduces the movie. Mariel was fine, but it was one of her first films. Sarandon does what he can as a rapist. He was not angry, but the horrible scenario worked against him. <br /> <br /> I remember that I heard that during the show in 1976. Some women got up and cheered when Sarandon was killed, so maybe for some people. I found it boring, simplified and REALLY sick. And 1 to the end.
