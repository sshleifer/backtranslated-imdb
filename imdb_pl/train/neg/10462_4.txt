What was it about? Pre-destination, you can not change the future because it has already been written ?? <br /> <br /> I'll give her that much. I wanted to see what happened later and that's why I watched the whole movie. This film adopted the concept and made it possible to see it. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a recommendation, see it in the morning prices. No emotions, but an interesting concept. They should leave the reference Y2K ....
