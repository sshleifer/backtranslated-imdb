One of the wedding films of lamers you will see. Too much time passes, so it was out of date before it hit the cinemas. Ethnic stereotypes are like a joke by Henny Youngman, except that they are not funny at all. Molly Ringwald, what else to say. Give you a hint about stupidity, destroying a $ 10,000 wedding dress, because "It just will not be me" doing it in this rag, with stripes and puts on the cylinder, and everyone smiles warmly at her and does not ring her neck . It's also a great cast, check how hard Ally Sheedy is. I see!
