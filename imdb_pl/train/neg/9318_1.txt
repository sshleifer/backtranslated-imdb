This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Again I made a mistake buying a movie, because the synapse on the back sounded great, and the front cover also looked pretty good (after buying this movie and the movie "Malevolence", about which I also wrote here, I learned my lesson). I love horror movies that take place in the woods or in the desert or on the farm. It probably takes place in the forests of Texas, but it was probably shot in the director's yard. Production was probably the worst I've ever seen. The actors were absolutely WORST. History had nothing to do with what the back cover said. I even tried to sell it to F.Y.E and another "mama and pop" store, which is buying used DVDs and none of them will do it. How awful was this poor, miserable excuse for the film. I've seen some bad movies (Troll 2 for example), but it definitely takes away the cake. I did not think it was a worse movie than "Troll 2". Boy, I was wrong! Do not buy this movie unless someone gives it to you for free, but even if you get stuck, unless you get rid of it, which I'm going to do !!!!
