Very interesting work with the camera and a story with great potential. But this is never more than the student's thesis at the film school. <br /> <br /> There are two main reasons. Fist, there is not a nice character, not even a villain whom we could admire for his own chutz. Secondly, the whole game is awful - even from veteran Willem DaFoe. Ham is so abundant here that you feel like a picnic - but one of those unfortunate picnics for company employees, where you drink too much cheap beer and get a hangover before you even stop drinking. Then you eat an un-hot hot dog and you throw yourself. <br /> <br /> Okay, I'm a little sick with a young director who can still go to places - as I said, the camera's work is pretty good. <br /> <br /> But I feel cheated - blurb on this movie suggests that we will be able to watch "Modern western", and there are photos on DVD packs that also suggest it - but no one is actually related to the movie it seems to know that this is the kind of movie that they should do. <br /> <br /> This betrayal is what hurts; but even without it, the fact remains that we do not like these characters, we feel embarrassed by the actors, the story is hopelessly muddled, and in the last analysis we do not care. <br /> <br /> I took it out of the DVD player about half way. but the rental company would not give my money back to me. <br /> <br /> Now it really hurts.
