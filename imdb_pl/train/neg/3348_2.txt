The 1958 version of The Haunting was one of my favorite horror movies for years, so I was expecting to release this remake from 1999 with a great deal of anxiety. It seemed that no continuation could cross or even match the original masterpiece. Unfortunately, my fears were justified: this movie stinks. <br /> <br /> I do not know what the people involved in this movie thought. Jan De Bont, who seemed to have fun when he directed the excellent "Speed", is doing so badly here (and maybe even worse), as he did with the very excited dups "Twister" and "Speed ​​2: Cruise Control". "Hey Jan, stick to cinematography, right? Liam Neeson is adequate in the role of a psychologist-pretending-to-sleep-I do not think he can achieve a really bad result - but even he can not write a lame script and poor story. Catherine Zeta Jones once again proves (as in "Entrapment") that she lacks the ability of an actor to rise above the material that is being transmitted to her. The leading woman who did a great job in the episode "The X-Files" looks lost here as Eleanor, insomnia floating on the edge of reason. And this blond, whoever he is, is more wooden than the ridiculous strange statues of children carved in the woodwork around the house. I do not think he changes his expression throughout the whole movie. <br /> <br /> (SPOILERS AHEAD) <br /> <br /> The reason the first movie worked so well is that we've never been sure if the house was really haunted or whether the demonstrations were the result of an uncertain mental state Eleanor. The original does not see any ghosts, leaving much to the imagination - a hallmark of other great horror movies, such as "The Changeling" and "The Blair Witch Project." In this updated version, of course, we get a lot of CGI ghosts, which basically (in the face of a weak script / story) make the movie very suspicious. F / x are not even that great considering they were made by ILM. Frozen breathing looks particularly false. The effects in Peter Jackson's underestimated film "The Frighteners", which I saw just before, were much better. Wooden sculptures of children who look scary look just stupid (especially when they shout), and the CGI monsters have nothing to write about. Instead of providing relief from bad acting, wrong direction and bad writing, the effects only increase this mess in the movie. <br /> <br /> Some particularly stupid scenes: When three other characters break into Eleanor's bedroom and none of them seem surprised at finding a big scowling demon hovering over the bed. A scene in which Eleanor "sees" a former woman from home hanging on the rafters ... here is particularly bad. And last but not least, an involuntarily funny piece, in which the Wooden Blond Guy gives an incredible cry of what should be a chore, jumps on the piece of furniture and begins to cut the image of the old, evil guy who built the House. We have some satisfaction in this scene, because after a few seconds of the attack, Blond Guy gets sucked into the fireplace by the ghost of an old guy and immediately cuts off his head. It was the only part of the movie that I liked. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, stick to the original "The Haunting" from 1963. 3/10 stars.
