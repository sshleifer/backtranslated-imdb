Cheap and manipulative. This movie has no heart. <br /> <br /> He also has a terrible dialogue, unconvincing characters and an absurd, or rather non-existent story. It just lies from bad to worse in the cynical effort to snatch some emotion out of an insincere and unusual histerion - afest! By the way, hedgehog gave the most convincing and possible to watch performances in this ninety-minute cult. <br /> <br /> If you were considering watching this movie, no. I am sorry but I can not find a single element for this movie. He will get a big, thick ZERO with me. Strictly for waterlogged pants. Yawneroony! <br /> <br /> Still, if you like Dancing In The Dark ... <br /> <br />
