This movie was terrible. OK, my favorite movie is "The Wicker Man" (1973), so I always had to be a bit biased. <br /> <br /> The plot is rolling along, throwing enough key elements of the original, so that the term "remake" would be highly questionable. (He is not a virgin, but he is allergic to bees.) WOW!) There are many things that do not make sense and are unexplained, and I'm afraid Mr. LaBute does not make a horror story. (How did the two people clearly see the car at the beginning and well at the end of the movie?) Cage looks haggard and stunned, and his character tends to call "Rowan!" With the slightest noise. "Kiwa" is irritating to the original, because it becomes rather cheesy than intelligent tribute. For example, some incidents reflect the original (the girl fell out of the cabinet pretending she was dead when Woodward / Cage searched the island) and several lines of dialogue are pulled directly from the original Anthony Schaffers scenario and integrated into. <br /> <br /> I'm sure others will provide a better and more detailed analysis than this one, I really can not worry to write more about this film. Any substance is missing. Put it on a heap of scrap, along with all other modifications that destroyed the good names of the films on which they were "based" (in this case very loosely).
