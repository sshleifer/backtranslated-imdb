Dinosaur movies can be fun. Like the films of Whoopi Goldberg. But Whoopi I dinosaurs? <br /> <br /> After the first 20 minutes of "Theodore Rex" I came to one conclusion: this movie is bad. Evil, wicked, vile and reprehensible in the eyes of the audience. Nothing bad happens by accident; it is a visual equivalent of a torture chamber. <br /> <br /> First of all, Whoopi does not make good action movies (see "Fatal Beauty" if you think he's lying), but the filmmakers do not care - he's a hard cop again. <br /> <br /> Have you seen one million buddies this week? Well, here's the number one and one, buddy. <br /> <br /> Do not you like sweet, humanistic animated dinosaurs since the Spielberg television show? It's a pity, here's another and he's also a cop! <br /> <br /> You are one of those people who hate car chases, shootings, sloppy dialogues, boring futuristic effects and seeing talented people (Goldberg, Mueller-Stahl, Roundtree) got stuck in a film that looks like a tax deduction ? A GREAT tax deduction? <br /> <br /> You have read this review until the end. You NEED a sequel. Seriously. <br /> <br /> No stars, not one. And if they really are a continuation of "Theodore Rex", Hollywood deserves to attack a whole herd of wise, cracking dinosaurs from foam rubber. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see it.
