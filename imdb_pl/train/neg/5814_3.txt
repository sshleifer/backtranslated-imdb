The film did what it planned: to show how a young girl copes with poverty and grows up. However, for most of us this topic has been researched appropriately and in most cases with more sophistication than here. Film captured on the chest, which soon became boring and lost interest. If it was on TV, I would switch to the latest news in the Starra Report. I've found this movie so boring.
