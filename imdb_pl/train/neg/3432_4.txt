The killer, a cannibal rapist, is killed by a crazed policeman in the place of his last murder. In his grave there was a cult with the intention of resurrecting him by pissing on the grave. This, of course, works and wakes up, tearing the guy's penis and going back to his old ways of killing with a completely new zombie look. Two cops who are crazy about scum in the city and have a drug problem come back to the case. Two original members of the cult also try to stop the killer by resurrecting something else. Thinking they folded, they leave, but a plastic doll comes from the grave, which was used in the original resurrection. Sounds a bit confusing, but it is not simply nonsense. <br /> <br /> Acting is terrible, and one of the cops is the same guy who plays Dr. Vincent van Gore in the faces of the Gore series and is just as awful as the annoying clay in this movie. The second policeman almost fights to get out of the terrible lines. I am now in favor of low-budget cinema, but this movie is simply awful. If it were not for the fact that women and their nakedness were very easy, I would probably fall asleep. There is some blood, but never more than a few animal guts placed on the victims' belly. The zombie makeup on the other hand looks great, and his foot has a long penis that he uses to rape his victims. There is also a decent scene in which the killer falls in love with a sexy doll. A doll with the voice of a squirrel is the stupidest thing I've ever seen in a movie. It's just a plastic toy on the line. <br /> <br /> The ending is very bad. You would expect the killer to fight a lot more than he did. God knows how they made enough money to create a sequel. <br /> <br /> 4/10
