Another FRIDAY of the 13th ripoff, even containing some of his music! A group of young adults meets at a small high school meeting and begins to murder la Jason Voorhees. Could this be the sucker who used to torment at school? <br /> <br /> A routine slash-fest is great fun for fans of the genre and includes the usual amount of T & A for movies, if so. The ending is a bit more imaginative than a standard slasher. <br /> <br /> MPAA: rated for violence / gore, language, sexuality, nudity and some drug content.
