I do not know if it's one of the original SyFy Channel movies, but that's how it looks. A cheap, low-budget action movie that's probably made very quickly, has fun effects, bad dialogs and one indistinct star that gives it brand recognition (fun, how many kids from 90210 are doing cheap TV movies right now). <br /> <br /> Ian Ziering plays Cortes, whom we know from history as a discoverer who destroyed entire populations of indigenous people, conquering parts of North America. Here you do not play him as a hero, or even a compassionate one, but as an open-minded opportunist; his character would probably have been killed if it was not loosely based on a historical figure. In this story, Cortes has a short geodetic mission, trying to find something worthwhile to prove he deserves funding to continue exploring America. He and his men find a small Aztec tribe harassed by dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> The true hero of this story turns out to be Lieutenant Rios, who turns out to be honorable, resourceful and wise. He knows what to do in every situation, which puts him in opposition to Cortes, as well as a young, ambitious Aztec shaman. Of course, a native girl who is supposed to marry a stubborn, intriguing shaman, falls on Riosa, increasing his anger at the Spanish outsiders. So all this is quite trivial. Dinosaurs are sent with relative ease. Despite the fact that it is happening in an area that seems wide open, the story takes place in the woods or in the Aztecs village for 95% of the time, so it is not visually exciting either. <br /> <br /> I did not even recognize Ian Ziering. They gave him a funny wig and unconvincing accent, and somehow disappeared in him. It does not look or sound Spanish for a moment, which makes the casting selection bad in every respect. If this film was released theatrically, he would have been awarded for Razzie, no doubt. <br /> <br /> Generally, forgotten.
