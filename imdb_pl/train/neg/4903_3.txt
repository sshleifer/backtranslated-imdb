I'm never a big fan of film production in Taiwan as opposed to Korean, Hong Kong and even China. Strong acting quality is rare in them, which is clearly visible in this film. I do not consider myself as a difficult audience because I am a fan of indie movies. However, this movie shows a weak plot and slow pace. I found myself lost in the middle of where the conspiracy goes. Acting certainly does not improve this. Rainie's acting is below the norm, because it "works too hard", trying to be dashing and sweet. Although I must admit that it is nice to look. On the other hand, Isabella Leong plays a more appropriate role as a lost, sad, pathetic, unusually restrained figure. Overall, I think this movie is a disappointment.
