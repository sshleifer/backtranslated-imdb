I heard for the first time about White Noise when I saw a TV commercial. Earlier I did not even know that it existed. I watched the online trailer and decided that I would go and see him. Being a fan of movies like The Sixth Sense, I thought that this movie would give me everything I want. He's got Michael Keaton and he's rocking. Unfortunately, the movie did not bring. He tried to be the next Sixth Sense or Mix Echoe and suffered a defeat. It has a very promising beginning, but the measure simply repeats itself and ends with a completely poor turn of action that any monkey could have imagined. Unfortunately, like most "frightening" movies, it's based on loud noises and bumps to jump into the audience. This movie could have been much more. It's a pity because it was a good idea.
