The head of obsession with sexuality leads a two-faced life: one as a "happily" married man with a ten-year-old child, the other as a sex devil. Most of the documentary follows him for five consecutive days and is told in retrospection along with Nastassja Kinski as a clinical sex therapist, listening to his story and intelligently studying it. The role of Nastassia is very restrictive and is the only major adult figure who does not take off his clothes. If she did, I would rate this movie as a fat "F." At the moment she evaluates F +, which means she is still a failure, unless someone likes to get bored. Probably much more interesting is spending ninety minutes in the garage. "Diary of a Sex Addict" falls into the category of films that, once you see them, wish that it would not be.
