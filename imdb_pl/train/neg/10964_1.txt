I was unlucky that I saw it at the Sidewalk Film Festival. The pavement as a whole was a disappointment and this film was the last nail in the coffin. Being a keen fan of Lewis Carroll's Alice, I was very excited about the premiere of this movie, which made watching it much more uncomfortable. I am usually enthusiastic about today's speeches if they are well treated. It is usually interesting to see the similarities between past and present in known history. Unfortunately, this film was a less contemporary story and a more perverse pop culture. The adaptation of the original figures seemed a minor and usually turned out to be terribly annoying. Probably it also did not help the actors. Most of the performances were ridiculously exaggerated, which I think was due either to the wrong direction or the effort to make up the wrong script. I did not laugh for the whole duration of the movie. All jokes were obsolete references to not-so-current events that will lose their importance over time. Indeed, the only climax of the film was the opening sequence in which the white rabbit is on her way to meet Alice, but even then the result was a fake imitation of Danny Elfman's work. I must also say that converting croquet to rave dance-off was terrible. Undoubtedly, it was the lowest point of the film. <br /> <br /> What a joke. Do not watch this movie. After it was finished, I was really angry.
