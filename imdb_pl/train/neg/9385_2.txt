The "Trivia" page on IMDb claims that the filmmakers protested because the film was converted by the studio into "simplifying the story". If so, this effort was a total failure, because it is one of the most inconsistent narratives I have ever seen in a movie - I would not like to see it before the plot has been "simplified". <br /> <br /> It's sad to see Warren with such a small character that even he can not do anything with inept material. It is interesting to see Caron in the 70s instead of her sexy outfit and personality in the Hollywood style, but it is sad that she is unhappily wandering after doing what she does for her husband. In fact, later she merged with the director and married him - who, as you will see, never directed anything, but from then on he did exactly 1 or 2 A.D. in TV. That should tell you enough. <br /> <br /> I call this "interesting" because I have an automatic passion for American films from this period, and this role adds perspective to Oates, besides the fantastic 1971 (Two - Lane Blacktop, The Hired Hand). But "a detective from the 1940s as a fish from water in the 1970s". the subject, which is the only thing the movie really has to say, is sold in a way that is too heavy. A similar topic would be much more effective two years later in Altman's "Long farewell". And as for Oates playing a hard-bitten man in a doomed task, three years later, he gave his definite performance in Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia. If you have not seen them, do not waste time!
