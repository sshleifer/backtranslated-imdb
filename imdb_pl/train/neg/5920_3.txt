Unusual? Yes! <br /> <br /> A unique setting for the American war movie, New Zealand. <br /> <br /> Unusual subjects, four sisters and their relations with American soldiers, one dead son of a senator carrying an illegitimate child, another living with seven marines (one at a time) before being murdered by a recurring POW New Zealander husband. <br /> <br /> Remarkable to see how Paul Newman is doing so poorly soon his unforgettable role as Rocky Graziano in the brilliant "Somebody Up There Loves Me". <br /> <br /> Unusual for two great "Stars" Joan Fontaine and Jean Simmons to leave so little on the film. /> <br /> Unusual that I could worry about writing a review of such a bad movie, let it miss it!
