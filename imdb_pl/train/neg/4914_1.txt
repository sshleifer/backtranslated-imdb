I love a good love story (and I'm a guy), but when I borrowed "Love Story," I prayed that the end would come as fast and painless as possible, and vice versa for the character Ali McGraw. <br /> <br /> Ali McGraw as Jenny abused and irritated me in the first 15 minutes. When we find out that she was diagnosed with a life-threatening illness, I could not help wondering if her death would be such a terrible loss to poor Oliver, would anyone who watched this movie be interested. If she had not died, her sarcastic personality would probably push Oliver to the edge and eventually end up in the divorce court. <br /> <br /> People love this movie, but this is one of the worst 70's.
