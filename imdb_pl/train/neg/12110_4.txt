The most striking in this half-musical plan from the 1920s in Berlin are the great pictures and editing. This is the highest line from First National in these departments. The story is slightly addictive and similar to the feature films of two other Miller films (SUNNY, SALLY), in which the working girl is afflicted by a rich boy with family disapproval, complications and the final capture. All four musical numbers are collected at the beginning of the movie and we go for a long episode without further musical buoyancy. Miller sings parts I THINK OF BABY and reprises OF YOU. There are also DO NOT EVER BE BLUE and THOUGH YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST. Sad that she is not dancing, because this is her strong side. SALLY remains her best film, with the second, or rather weak SUNNY, much worse runner. Her life was tragically interrupted by the infection of the sinuses before the times when hospitals and antibiotics managed to prevent such tragedies. It is worth visiting these films to see the Ziegfeld star from the 1920s.
