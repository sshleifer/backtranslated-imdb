This movie is simply bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Now that I've done it, I feel better. This movie is poor from beginning to end. History is bad. The 3-D segment is really bad. Freddy is the worst of his cartoon. Thank God they killed him. Who wants to see the scenes with Roseanne and Tom Arnold? <br /> <br /> The only good thing about the movie is a little bit of history, which we give to Freddy. We see that he once had a family and we see his abusive father alcoholic (Alice Cooper). <br /> <br /> Besides, everything is wrong. There are some good actors here (Lisa Zane and Yaphet Kotto) and they do everything in their power, but the end result is so bad. An hour and a half, which I spent watching this movie, I can not return an hour and a half.
