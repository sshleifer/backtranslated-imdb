It is difficult to criticize this film because I do not like the story itself, and no amount of good acting would save it. Think "Raising Arizona" with a medium passion. Acting is passable, but Jennifer Tilly is as usual at the top (though not enough to make a nice camp movie out of it), going somewhere between "Misery" and the sarcastic DMV employee. The rest of the cast has eyebrows that are constantly knocked out of horror, or from the stress associated with their parts, or from the stress associated with the vain exercise. Really humiliating a few hours of the movie. Darryl Hannah spends most of the movie crying too much to understand him. I would like to tell you how it ended, but I left, I'm sorry.
