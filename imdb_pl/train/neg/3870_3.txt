The amazing art and skills of Ichikawa Somegoro shone under the thick green of computer graphics. Unfortunately: he got lost in the whole massacre. Old Edo scenes - with a courtesan, drifting on Sumida, rehearsals and acting in Nakamura-za - were exciting and engaging, moving you back into an interesting and rich era. Action on the stage of Kabuki, in which Somegoro excels and excites, was more enriching than any absurd high jinks that followed. Skills, audience energy, colors of sets were much more satisfying than all nonsense that took over the plot and performance. What a missed opportunity! One of the best living kabuki actors, and gets lost in ruin.
