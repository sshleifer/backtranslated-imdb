First of all, I am not an American or Middle East. Second, I have no religion. The closest religion is sport and movies. From now on, I think that it would be best to serve the opinion of neutrality and free from prejudice. <br /> <br /> Most of these short films are a complete disgrace. This horrible event should be used to commemorate all those innocent people who were murdered by "some" barbaric and uncivilized morons. Instead, the majority of what I saw in these short films were conceited attempts to get different political points. Examples: <br /> <br /> 1) Ken Loach Segment. Of course, we are all sad that this guy had a hard life in his country, but what does this have to do with the innocent victims of 2001? Two mistakes are wrong ?! Anything! This film should have a subtitle for those who have trouble listening to a partially inconsistent Chilean-English accent. <br /> <br /> 2) The Youssef Chahine segment is the most disturbing. It is obvious that he has problems with logic. He justified the murders because America is a democracy, and because some Americans voted for politicians in power, all Americans are ultimately responsible for the actions and decisions taken by their leaders in the Middle East. Hey! Is this guy real? Some Americans do not even vote! Some Americans do not even know where the Middle East is; some do not even know what religion is practiced there; and most do not know the real political issues that are taking place behind the scenes. ### Mr Chahine, the reason we have all these problems in the world is that there are too many people with such logic. The innocent victims in Twin Towers came from all over the world. Murdered firefighters, rescuers, office workers, guards and passengers of flights have nothing to do with politics. And yet we must not deal with our lives because "some" people think that everyone has to choose a party or religion. We are seen as an honest game for extreme politics. <br /> <br /> 3) The Israeli segment showed its bombed victims. Another filmmaker using this event to push his own political agenda. Sometimes it's not about you. Some people always think about "me, me, me". Sometimes it's about other people. <br /> <br /> 4) Idrissy Ouedraogo is a joke and another point to gain political points. Of course, they want money from the international community, stressing their poverty. Bla, blah, blah. <br /> <br /> This film denigrates the memory of the victims of September 11, 2001. <br /> <br /> The best thing is TRASH CAN.
