Billy Crystal is a co-author, co-producer and star of this extremely safe and comfortable comedy-drama about fathers and sons, adult irresponsibility and aging. Billy plays a cardiac surgeon who has a heart attack (ha ha), which means that he is looking for his father (Alan King), a filmmaker who considers himself a big star. The scenario is sub-Neil Simon nonsense with lots of one-liners, flat, non-expressive Henry Winkler (stuck in sitcom mode) and family conflict at the ready. Crystal and King try their best, but King is too eager and often exaggerated. JoBeth Williams has one of the ungrateful roles, but she manages to bring her innate class to the proverbial girl character. I think it's a comedy, but one that blinks tears ... shamefully. ** with ****
