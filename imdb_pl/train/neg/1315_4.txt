Oliver Hardy wakes up with a hangover and soon finds out that his uncle is coming to his new wife and child Ollie. The problem is that they do not exist - Ollie apparently invented them! So it's up to him and his buddy to locate a woman with a child who will agree to pose as his family. <br /> <br /> This is not a particularly unique story idea, as I have seen at least a few other quiet shorts with this exact story. The best of them was Bobby Vernon's DO NOT KID ME. It is much better than ONE TOO MUCH - probably a lot of it comes from the fact that it was created ten years later - when the comedy became a bit more sophisticated and depended less on a pointless slapstick. Now I am not against physical comedy, but in some slapstick movies people start shooting at a wild pace, copy and strangle each other, etc. With little provocation. Unfortunately, at the end of ONE TOO MANY exactly do it. Nothing makes sense, and it looked as if there were no ideas for history. <br /> <br /> In general, this is not a milestone in entertainment. It just does not have enough payouts to watch it, unless you're an obsessive quiet fan like me.
