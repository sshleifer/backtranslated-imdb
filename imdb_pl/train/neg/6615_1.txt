From time to time, a movie like Sholay appears in the Indian cinema, which changes the way the public perceives a good movie. And only once in a while (hopefully) we have RGV ki Aag, who breaks all standards and creates one of them. Standard so low that it can not be broken. Varma Ram Gopal manages to collect a pot of talents and create a dish so old that you can feel it from a distance. Taking a classic like Sholay and murdering him is completely unforgivable and I can not believe that he almost called RGV ki Sholay. Although Sholay had many elements of folklore, the film managed to develop its plot, defining the heroes so clearly that they lived forever. What Aag does is take these characters and spoil them so much that you will need a competition to pick the worst. The element of realism is missing, and the film ends with the creation of a group of "actors" parading less and seemingly unrelated events in the story. One star for this movie is a funny loss of voice. The time has come for the RGV to wake up to the reality of its failure and conjure up another "different" story that can be classified in the cinema.
