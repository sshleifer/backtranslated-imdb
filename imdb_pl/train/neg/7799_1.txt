What, God, happened here? How to deal with creating a practically cheap knockoff from Redneck Zombies? Did Zombie '90 ever have to entertain someone ... or even make a dollar? But above all, what happened here? <br /> <br /> Zombie '90 Extreme Pestilence was directed by a madman named Andreas Schnaas who specializes in gore-shaking movies such as Goblet of Gore and Anthropophagus 2000, some of which contain explicit titles. In the gore section this one does not differ much from the rest. Although the level of ineptitude ... well, shaking the earth. <br /> <br /> Zombie '90 Extreme plagues are as bad as Peter Jackson's dead life is bloody, think about it. <br /> <br /> Too detailed statement of history would be a waste of time. An accident involving chemicals causes the dead to come back and live. The concept has never been treated in this way. The gore effects are whole, new low. It's just a Z-class nightmare. I can not say if it was fun at first, but I doubt that English dubbing is very faithful to the original script, but stranger things have happened. The whole thing reminds me of the introduction of the video Tromes, except that it lasts a lot longer. <br /> <br /> I only saw one movie that was worse than The Chooper. <br /> <br /> As proof that Andreas Schnaas is a real director, I highly recommend Nikos The Impaler. If you think that you have no standards in what you are looking for in a bad movie, try Extreme Pestilence, but you have been warned. It takes nerves of steel to go all the way. But if you're here to be gore, you may be able to stand it. Besides, there is no atmosphere, and I mean NO budget, no entertainment value, but above all, no pride. Show me some pride, Schnaas. 1/10 <br /> <br /> Updated 7/5/09: After a few more Zombie '90 reviews, I changed my mind, or I just just got it. Zombie '90 is hilarious, so do not forget about harsh words, although Extreme Pestilence still deserves only one star.
