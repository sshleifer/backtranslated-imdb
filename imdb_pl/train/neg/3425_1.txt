I intend to spend as much time on this review as writers on the script. It is easy THE WORST sequel EVER made. <br /> <br /> PROHIBITED Navin Johnson. Not only the performance of Marek Blankfield GOD-AWFUL was like every elses !! The physical comedy was forced, flat and predictable. It seemed that the script was written by Mongoloid monkeys using the names of the pen Ziggy Steinberg and Rocco Urbisci. As the producers managed to squeeze such vile cinema droppings, it is beyond me. They even managed to make the veteran Ray Walston look like an unarmed buffoon. Director Michael Schultz should be ashamed. <br /> <br /> I want to spend 96 minutes of my life watching this stained memory of a great comedy so that I can try to convince everyone involved in this film crime.
