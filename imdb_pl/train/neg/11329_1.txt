Elizabeth Taylor could never act at all, and she was just her usual irritating, not talented me in this film. It was before it became so fat, but it still looked very short and squat. Rock Hudson was okay as Bick Benedict, but apparently an actor with greater reach like William Holden would have been better. James Dean certainly proved that he knows how to mumble in the film. The whole movie is incredibly slow and takes too long. The actors were too young and light, and none of them was aging convincingly because of bad makeup. Hudson looked ridiculous just kicked out, and Dean and Carroll Baker were of course the same age. <br /> <br /> 0/10.
