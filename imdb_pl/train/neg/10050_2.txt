A huge disappointment between writer Hamm and director Dante. Their previous collaboration in the first season of "Homecoming" was twisted and darkly funny in all the right ways. This poor service of the intriguing assumption left me stunned. The supposed "payoff" showing the generic aliens extracting something from the brains of infected psychopaths was completely unsatisfactory and did not explain anything. If the purpose of the story was the extraterrestrial "cleaning up" of the human planet, why did they undertake it in such a selflessly sadistic and misogynist way? Why not release the completely lethal virus Stephen King's "Stall" instead of the male butcher population? I was hoping that the episode would improve when I looked, but it became more pretentious and ridiculous. The religious subtext seemed simply forced, but it was clear that Sam Hamm must have thought that he was deep because of the weight he gave him. I really like both Dante and Hammer's work, but it was simply impossible to observe.
