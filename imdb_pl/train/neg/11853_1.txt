Let's face it, romantic comedies are considered light compared to dramatic films (just look at Oscar nominations each year). But still good are really a form of art. Look at "When Harry Met Sally," "Insomnia in Seattle," and classics such as "Roman Holiday" and "It Happened One Night". I like the feeling of well-being seeing two people who are supposed to find happiness. <br /> <br /> This movie tries to construct something that resembles a romantic comedy. But no one believes in the romance between the main characters and there is nothing funny to make up for this serious flaw. Modine is a thing of the past, being a leading man - especially a romantic leader. I am sure that I am an executive producer, he had the resources - but not good sense - to quit. And Gershon ... I see the potential of some comedy talent, but it did not have a script and a poorly developed character. And whose idea was the English accent? No sense. <br /> <br /> Others have said, but I want to repeat: this story is badly conceived, badly made; the actors are terribly misunderstood; and characters, well, we're just not talking about them. <br /> <br /> This is not a form of art. Go rent the "Moonstruck" again.
