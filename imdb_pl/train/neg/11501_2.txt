A romantic and completely false vision of unemployment from a middle class "artist" with comfortable upbringing ... It is clear that the writer-director has never suffered directly from unemployment and certainly has no personal experience with it. If you had to believe this totally absurd story, unemployed men of all ages behave like teenagers, have no anger, fear, frustration, etc. All characters live through the day, carrying pranks, boyish jokes. They never look for work, hardly ever experience rejection or anguish, etc. Life on benefits is almost like a summer holiday from school ... Funny. Especially if you compare it to modern masterpieces such as Ken Loach, etc.
