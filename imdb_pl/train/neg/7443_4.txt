There were a few scary scenes that I always liked more than just gore, but otherwise the movie was rather weak. There were too many questions left unanswered, and when they tried to explain something in the film, it was still rather unclear. After watching this movie, I still seemed lost in many ways. It reminded me a few years ago of Silent Hill. This film was also unsatisfactory, but still better than this because it tried to act, and history did make sense. This one, not so much. <br /> <br /> Acting for the most part in the Forsaken was decent, but the film continued and never gave any kind of satisfying ending. As I said above, there were some scary scenes, but otherwise the movie was a mess. Sorry, I can not recommend it.
