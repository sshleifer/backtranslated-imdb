I am a big admirer of Lon Chaney, but writing this movie simply did not work. The story jumps strangely (since then I've learned that the film lacks parts) and the characters appear and disappear with irritating suddenness. Some subtitles are too explanatory (eg "Why, you are no longer a child!" - go back to the image for a long, slow rhythm - "you are a woman!" Yes, we have it the first time), but there are several speaking sequences that beg for explanations that never appear. (Let's listen to Luigi and his blond girlfriend, please!) The plot that includes incestuous desires (figuratively, if not technically) was disturbing to the point that it was difficult to see. According to the author, this problem has been treated as a problem, and the match from May to December is not presented as good and good inevitability of some of Mary Pickford's films (eg "Daddy-Long-Legs"). Chaney gives a good performance, as usual, but I think he was better focused in the past - he overreacted several times here, IMHO. I enjoyed the sequences of clowns and I was very impressed by stunts. Loretta Young was adorable, though surprisingly young. The film has its moments, but so far it's my least favorite photo of Chaney.
