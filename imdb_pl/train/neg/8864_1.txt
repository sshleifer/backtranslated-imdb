After seeing this, I lost some respect for Christopher Lee (a long time has passed). This movie was a complete trash. First, they tried to recreate the ending of the first "Howling" with incredibly bad makeup. Then they try to turn it into a sad excuse for a werewolf porn movie! The plot sucks and the whole movie is just AMAZING !!!! The victim's werewolf brother from the first film (because it was Dee Wallace Stone), joined forces with Lee and another woman to destroy the werewolf group, led by Sybil Danning, who seems to be naked all the time. <br /> <br /> It is not even worth renting (unless you want to waste time and money watching nudity). Try to catch him with a cable. It would be so cut up that it could make sense.
