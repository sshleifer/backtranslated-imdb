The only reason I rented it was an article in the Fangoria magazine. This article made the movie look interesting. Well, it is not. It was a very boring, amateurishly written and directed movie. All the actors in this movie are horrible, with the exception of Faye Dunaway, who always enjoys watching. But too much time was devoted to Gina Phillips and her funny encounters with the crows and Duilio Marzio. Marzio has such a thick Argentine accent that you can only understand a few words she says. Also in the hand is Nicholas Pauls, who plays a very amorous interest in Gina Phillips. The main thing: this movie is not terrifying. There is only one good scene and the last five to ten minutes of the movie. I would give this one star, but I gave her three just because I like Faye Dunaway so much. But even she was not so great at it.
