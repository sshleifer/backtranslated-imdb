When I decided to watch THE BARBARIANS with the twin bodybuilders Peter and David Paul, I thought it could not be so bad because the film was directed by Ruggero Deodato, who has a reputation as a creator of poor movies, but well-made poor movies. Well, THE BARBARIANS is an extremely kitschy action / adventure movie that wants to be the next CONAN THE BARBARIAN and fails on every level. The movie's appearance is bad. Some of the scenes were well shot, but the tone and the dressy, tacky "disco" look of the clothes and hair people wear, just does not make any sense, even with a low budget like this one. <br /> <br /> Richard Lynch looks like an old woman with this funny hairstyle and costume. It should be dangerous, but it turns out to be a buffoon. The funny thing is that Eva LaRue Callahan, one of the stars of ALL MY CHILDREN, appears in her first film, wearing a skimpy fur bikini. I'm sure he wants that murmur to disappear from the face of the earth! The so-called barbarian twins are fine, as the muscles bind the heroes, but it is almost impossible to construct the proper criticism of their actions, because their roles are, like everything in this mess, really badly conceived. The only way the movie tries to distinguish the twin from the other is to wear one twin in a loincloth that covers his butt, while the twin loincloth barely covers his muscular butt. I am not joking! Do not ask me who is who. <br /> <br /> Deodato had to be really desperate to agree to make this movie. And his desperation is perfectly reflected in this kitschy movement. Just bad.
