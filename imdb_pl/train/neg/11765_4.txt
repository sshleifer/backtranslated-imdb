You know what you get after buying the Hallmark card. Juicy, banal verse and it will be 3.99 USD, thank you very much. It's the same with the Hallmark movie. Here we have a ninety-year-old Ernie Borgnine coming out of retirement to let us know that she is not really dead, as we thought. Poor Ernie, she is a poor soul who married Ethel Merman a few years ago, and the marriage lasted for several weeks. In this movie, Ernie jumps to her feet first and introduces her grandfather, who joins his long-lost grandson. We have seen this before. You can enjoy this movie, but do not say you were not warned.
