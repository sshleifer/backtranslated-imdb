"National Lampoon Goes to the Movies" is the worst film ever made, surpassing even the meaningless "Plan 9 from space". At least this movie was simply unsuccessful; On the other hand, Lampoon's film is both inept and mean. Once upon a time, movies respected the audience's intelligence. This one, however, keeps a fetid, rotting corpse on our faces - and then tries to rub our noses into them. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer on this site wrote that the only good part of the film are naked scenes; I agree, Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry are flashing a bit of body and it is a very nice body. But the directors seem to be unaware that even T & A needs a good story to surround it. There is nothing here. <br /> <br /> Perversely, the filmmakers save the worst at the end. The third of the three segments is the ugliest of the three. In this vignette Robby Benson plays a young police officer, willing to beaver, applying for service on the first day of work. It is connected to a weary, cynical oldtimer played by Richard Widmark. We hope for a moment that this film will end triumphantly. We certainly think that the brave attitude of a young man will rub against a cynic and change him for the better. <br /> <br /> Destroyed hope! Instead, the cynic wins the day - and the spark of the young man is extinguished forever. "National Lampoon goes to the movies" and goes straight to the toilet, asking us to follow her in the mud. Nominally, it's a comedy. But where is the humor?
