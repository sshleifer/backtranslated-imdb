It was a complete disappointment. Acting is not bad, but the production was so bad that sometimes I felt I had to stop it, but unfortunately I managed to finish it and I managed to embarrass it with the whole bad film. This is ok. if you are o.k. with cheesy moral threads and do not worry about watching a movie that interprets Whitman very badly. If you want a cheesy fictitious story to contribute to it.
