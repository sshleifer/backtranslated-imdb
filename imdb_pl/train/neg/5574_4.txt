"Godzilla vs King Ghidorah" is a perfect example of how a great idea can be ruined by pathetic topics such as pseudo-patriotism. Here, travelers from the future are trying to ruin Japan, replacing the local hero Godzilla with a puppy monster, a three-headed golden dragon King Ghidora. However, they fail and eventually Godzilla fights Ghidorah. The battles between two ghouls are very cool, but the plot of the movie is full of holes, and everything in "Japan is great" is really stupid. The creators of this film did not even threaten the enemies of Japan with respect, making them stupid big blondes who are easily outfitted by a clever Japanese. The good thing is that in the end Godzilla and King Ghidorah almost destroyed both Japan and it is absurd enemies in one (actually two) spectacular battles. But for the battle of Royale the film was really boring and pathetic.
