Many days after seeing Conceiving Ada, I'm still impressed that every group of people would spend so much time doing such a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> No one should watch this movie in the hope that he will learn about the consequences of Adie Lovelock, her associates or the products of her ventures. <br /> <br /> Similarly, no one should watch this movie in the hope of entertainment. <br /> <br /> As a science-fiction movie, it would have been a terrible failure. Somehow, the main character manages to bring the past back to life and interact with it on his personal computer - with the advice and encouraging words of Timothy Leary. I doubt anyone would suspend their disbelief enough that it would not seem absurd. <br /> <br /> As a dramatic film, it would undoubtedly be a terrible failure. Somehow the writer / director manages to fill eighty-five minutes with a continuous, unnecessary, irritating and trivial drama over nothing. I doubt anyone would feel that the whole drama in the movie serves only as an annoying distraction. <br /> <br /> I can not fully express my level of contempt for the Ada Conception. The circumstances in which I saw it forbade me from leaving the theater, but there is no doubt that it was not. I'm still angry that I wasted my time to see it. Only that I could criticize the film more effectively, I would like it to be more articulate.
