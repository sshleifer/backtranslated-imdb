I can not say I really liked this movie. He has some fun moments, but he seems to be unable to decide if it's a comedy or a drama. light in tone to be a drama, and funny moments are few and far between. it also does not make much sense. things seem to happen for a reason. and it is also very complicated. If only they had some time to explain things, it could have been a better movie. I would say that the ending was anti-climatic, but that would mean that the rest of the movie really developed into something that he did not do. it just sorts out and it is. It was not boring, really, but as I said, it just does not make sense. and weak 3/10
