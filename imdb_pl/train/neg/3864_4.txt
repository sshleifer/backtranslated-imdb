Just an ordinary movie by Jason Lee. Some parts of the movie were fun. In the middle of this movement is life on the edge, I think. These are the types of movies that I think 14-year-old girls watch at parties. It was a good movie. This is one of those movies that you have in the back and you watch from time to time when something catches your attention. I think that Julia and Selma Blair are a good combination and would like to see them in a movie with a good story and story. It's just a boy dating a girl. This is an excellent movie that they would show in the Central comedy. I'm glad I did not see this movie in the theater, I would be angry. But I think that's why I did not see him in the theater.
