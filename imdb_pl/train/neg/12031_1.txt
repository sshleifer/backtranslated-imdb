First of all, this movie is not a comedy; unless you really force yourself, you can not laugh. Second, the movie is slow and boring. Acting is not bad, but not exceptional. There is a comic book by Lucky Luke about two families (one with big noses and one with big ears) fighting each other in a small town ... you'll laugh a lot more if you read this instead of wasting time on this movie. Religions and dogmas are not the best source of good comedy, and this film does nothing more than just confirm this rule. There is a similar thematic comedy "Home Teachers"; it had good moments. My last comment is: do not waste your time and money watching this boring and boring movie.
