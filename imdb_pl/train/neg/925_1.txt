ok, this movie f * ck in 'rules. no doubt it is one of the most technically inept pieces of cinema ever made. absolutely horrible, but you see it. Rent it to your buddies and come up with a game or just have fun, it's fun. and behind the scenes it proves you can do everything with paper plates and finger paint. incredible. good, I'm lending it only for this one scene: two characters actually go to the PLACE for about 3 minutes. the director (in the commentary) says "yes, the tracking was so smooth that it looks like ...". Yes, the right man, they walk around completely. it's so funny.
