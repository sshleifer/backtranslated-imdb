Roy Rogers and the company are trying to bring Sintown back to life - it's a ghost town that can flourish if silver mining is successful. Andy Devine (as "Cookie") is bumping. Jane Frazee (as Carol) loses a bit of a bitch to Mr Rogers' sharp snout. Foy Willing and Riders of the Purple Sage stand-in (or is it sing-in?) For A.W.O.L. Bob Nolan and the Pioneer Sons. James Finlayson (from the films Laurel and Hardy) adds a "slapstick" look to the "Grand Canyon Trail". A loose floorboard ensures a winning comedy performance. Mr Devine's mule digs his heels. There are also energetic performances of people - but the material is not Grand. <br /> <br /> ** Grand Canyon Trail (1948) William Witney ~ Roy Rogers, Jane Frazee, Andy Devine
