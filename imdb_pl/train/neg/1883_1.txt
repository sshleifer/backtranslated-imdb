I did not think it could be done, but something has changed and replaced Open House - a low-budget horror about someone killing a high price of real estate - as the worst movie I've ever seen in my short but sweet life. <br /> <br /> It was considered the best movie in the newest Montreal film festival, which leads me to believe that every other entry must consist of empty walls accompanied by people reading grim poetry. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie was like a small piece of hell. He comes from Austria and tries to come across scenes of short pieces and blue velvet of various forms living in the suburban area with a dark conk. There is a fat dog owner and his fat maid who striptease for him, a skinny divorce whose wife still lives with him at home, which includes the untouched peace of his dead child, an ingber-annoying hitchhiker who recites ten letters. . And so on. Forever. Like two hours plus I spent in this theater. <br /> <br /> Yes, characters interact, but not in a clever or interesting or even appropriate way. I could not say if they were good as actors, because according to the subtitles they received lines that were the Austrian equivalent of "You are so lame!". Certainly they did not have to learn many, because everyone repeated their lines at least three times in the scene. <br /> <br /> This is not Gummo or any of the above-mentioned movies. There is no art to discover and nothing to resist later, except maybe you should change the "never go out during the movie" rules (every few older couples did during an accidental orgy scene - and if it sounds appetizing, not is, unless you are one of the few who do not think that your parents have sex - and with a few middle-aged middle-aged couples, to rebel). <br /> <br /> This video was offensive to me. No flaccid nudity, no repulsive soundtrack, and no stress-free scenes with guns. I was offended that someone actually spent the money to do it when there are talented writers and filmmakers looking for funding. I was upset that someone outside the city could go to Dog Days and wonder if it was the best that Montrealers could find. First of all, I was offended that somehow the people involved in the festival had betrayed everyone to believe that the Emperor had a wonderful and mesmerizing new outfit when it was painfully clear that he was as naked as a fat maid doing striptease. <br /> <br />
