I understand that Diehl's character is supposed to be a microcosm of America itself - seeing Arab terrorists under every rock, only to find out at the end that it's his own actions all the time bring him to a state of siege and really, if he practices good will to all people everything will be rainbows and lollipops. I apologize to you that you have made amazing films in the past that remain neutral for politics and for good reason, polemics are your weak point and weaken this well-made, incredibly filmed movie with absurd characters, dialogues and conspiracies. Better luck in your next move. Another thing that tugged my crank was a homeless spot in LA that was there because of hunger, these people do not have enough food. Really these people do not eat royalty, but the real hunger of these people is spiritual hunger, emotional hunger, mental hunger. They need respect for themselves, their own worth, dignity that you can not give to man. Yes, these people are hungry, and if they need it, they are available. Less as a center of famine in America, I would say that it is more a center of alcoholism, drug abuse, mental suffering and economic devastation. Dealing with hunger, although a noble undertaking is to help in a more systematic, social and eternal human homelessness problem. Bill Diehl was good, however, and Michelle Williams was lovely as a young, elderly soul.
