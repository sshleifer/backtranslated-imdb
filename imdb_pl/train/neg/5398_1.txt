This indulgent mess could have put a kibosh on Mr. Branagh's career as a Shakespeare adaptation to the cinema. (Released 4 years ago, not an adaptation since then.) I just finished watching it on the cable - God, it's terrible. <br /> <br /> I agree with the sentiment of the reviewer below, who said that browsing something so obvious and unfortunately horrible is a naughty act that appears as penetrating. That being said, I will take risks, if only because * Love's Labor's Lost * is the perfect reward for those who in the past hid Mr. Branagh's directorial skills. Branagh has always been a bad director: very blunt; hit by a star; inexcusably indecent to his fellow actors (he loves his American stars, but he loves himself more, making him damn sure he gets all the good lines). <br /> <br /> Along these lines, the sad fact remains that * Love's Labor's Lost * is barely worse than the endless, spooky, bloated * Hamlet * of 1996. In fact, this movie can be better, if only because it is about 1/3 of the length. Branagh decided it would be a good idea to update this evil early work of Shakespeare into the environment of Cole Porter, George Gershwin, Fred Astaire, yady yady. So it sets it in 1939, leaves about eighth of the untouched text in favor of the glaring interpretations of the 1930s standards (wait until you see that the actors raised themselves to the ceiling towards the ceiling during "I'm In Heaven"), and throw actors unknown your dancing or singing (including yourself). The result is a catastrophe so surrealistic that one is stunned that after seeing the first dailies they simply did not cause terror. I do not even blame the cast. To paraphrase Hamlet: "The script is a thing!" NOBODY can not run well in this breeding: the excellent RSC graduate is no better than Alicia Silverstone. Who could act in this matter? <br /> <br /> The first mistake of Branagh was to think that * Love's Labor's Lost * was an art worth filming. Trust me, it is not. This is an anomaly in Bard's canon, written clearly for the educated coterie of courtiers - NOT the ordinary public he wrote about. Hence, there are many valuable (and TEDIOUS!) Verbal games, references to modern scholastic nonsences, parody * Euphues Lyly *. . . in other words, it is not a material that could appeal to a wide audience. Hell, that does not appeal to the public already predisposed to the Shakespearean comedy. The game can not be exposed without drastic cutting of the text and desperately "updating" it with any catch that comes to hand. What raises the question, why bother? <br /> <br /> Branagh's second mistake was to think that the Shakespeare cream cake could be served with the addition of Gershwin marmalade. Apparently, the idea or hope was to make the incomprehensible Elizabethan exercise pleasant to modern audiences by feeding nostalgic American pop culture down their throats at the same time. But again the question arises, why bother yourself <br /> <br />
