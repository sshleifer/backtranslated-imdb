"Salaam-e-Ishq" is a beautiful, but superficial comic soap opera from India, which captivates us with six intertwined stories about romantic love (at least four stories in my opinion). ). <br /> <br /> Filmed like a cross between MTV video and Super Bowl beer advertising, the movie is a huge mish-mash of exotic settings, dazzling colors, sexy dancers, high-class songs and dances. Numbers, dream and fantasy sequences, blinking figures to the side, cursed dialogue and comic performances at the highest level - all this is quite typical when it comes to Bollywood events. It's a grueling work, trying to keep all the characters straight when they dance, dance and break through the incomprehensible story. <br /> <br /> There is plenty for the viewer to enjoy - not just all dead dead women - but he will need Job's patience to go through it.
