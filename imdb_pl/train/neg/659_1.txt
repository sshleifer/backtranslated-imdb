This film is a good example of the extreme lack of good writers and directors in Hollywood. The fact that people paid for this piece of rubbish shows that there is a lack of original ideas and talents in the entertainment industry. The idea that the audience paid for watching this movie (and how the idiot rented the movie) is also daunting. <br /> <br /> An obsessive teacher (3 years earlier) kills a teenager's family because he wants her. For no reason, he kills his mother, father and brother. For the first five minutes you see a wrong action and direction. Many years later, an obsessive teacher breaks up from prison. HMM - ordinary bad writing - no one in the city he terrorized knows until the last moment. The obsessive teacher somehow becomes a Navy SEAL and can sneak around, sniff out people and the knife is a super killer. Sure !!! Now the obsession with the teacher kills the hotel maid for no reason, harasses the race for fun and starts tracking the teenager's friends. Now is the perfect way for the girl to love you. An obsessive teacher sneaks out of the hotel --- he is stupid again, always a policeman knows his face - but he is walking next to them. Now he kills two cops in front of the teenager's house and somehow sneaks into her bedroom and kills her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> There is not one positive thing in this piece of trash. If any other profession releases a poor quality job, it will be released. However, these idiots earn hundreds of thousands of dollars for writing and managing this trash.
