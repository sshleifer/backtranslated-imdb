If you ever hear these three words spoken to you ... "Joe Don Baker", be afraid ... <br /> <br /> Final Justice is a low-budget action movie based on the sheriff in the Texas city of Geronimo (pronounced as Heronimo). It is an ugly, slimy, naughty figure who hunts for a criminal in Malta who killed his partner in Texas. His partner actually spins two times in the film. Very bad edition. Joe Don Baker (Geronimo) goes to jail 4 or 5 times in this movie, which makes the plot go nowhere fast. Plus, he shoots everyone like the wild west. I do not think anyone told him that it was the 20th century. The female police officer is assigned to show him in Malta (who looks like Elaine from Seinfeld) and is the only one who can endure red. It must be crazy! <br /> <br /> Strippers in the bar are the most entertaining characters in this movie. Their dance is shown throughout the film and I began to be associated with miserable women. Well, at least it was better than to watch Geronimo trying to get out of something stupidly. The ending is flawed and quite predictable, and I was happy that it finally ended. You will never forget the last line of Joe Don Baker from the movie. <br /> <br /> It's hard to imagine how he was in THREE Bond movies ... very strange! In any case, if you want to laugh, see it once on MST3K. I have also heard his other bad movie (among many), the "Mitchell" version of MST3K is released on DVD by Rhino. I can not wait to see it!
