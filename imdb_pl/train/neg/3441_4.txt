What the hell it was. Someone, of course, read Stephen King and Sartre in the same semester. We get existential anxiety mixed up with cheap horror. There were moments that were disturbing, but each of them was canceled by horrible music, CGI or acting. <br /> <br /> The problem with strange narratives, such as this, is that he is lazy. Even the work of David Lynch sometimes seems like his interesting shows and films, it takes far too long. And unfortunately it is only 98 minutes. <br /> <br /> The cast was attractive and that's the limit of it. I suppose that this applies to the feelings of teenagers and the fear of loneliness that we all have, but it simply does not make heroes so friendly that we care about their fate ... whatever they were. The final scene leaves an ambiguity.
