When I heard the story of this movie, I just had to see it, I mean whole cities erased by deadly tomatoes! Unfortunately, the title is as much fun as possible. <br /> <br /> It is run by detective Dick Mason, a special military team and scientists (including Greg Colburn, who never removes the SCUBA costume and the Lieutenant Finletter, who is never in the picture without his parachute behind) "Attack of the killer tomatoes' is a parody of B movies, in particular the Japanese horror of the 1950s. The film begins with the woman discovering a standard tomato in the kitchen before we're in the middle of the crime scene when the tomato allegedly murdered this lady and let me tell you that there is nothing healthy about it as the film progresses! To be honest, there are some funny moments, for example, every time a Japanese scientist Dr. Nokitof says his voice is called an American accent, or when an expert on dressing up Sam Smith gets into tomatoes, hey, can anyone give you ketchup? . This movie was probably a lot more fun in 1978, and the whole thing was so good that it was a good idea. Unfortunately, the films "Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes", such as the series "Airplane" and "Naked Gun", have been released and have made this kind of comedy much better than. <br /> <br /> Acting is terrible; there is no continuity of editing and it feels really slow and devoid of energy. For the parody of the movie to work, you need many things at once, one gag after finishing. Singing in the movie seems pointless, and the advertising of the furniture store, which flashes on the screen, is damn right, even with this film. Ultimately, however, you can see why this movie is iconic; I do not see many people indifferent to it. Unfortunately, it would be scary how I would sum it up.
