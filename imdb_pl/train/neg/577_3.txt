First of all, Jon Bon Jovi does not seem to be on the spot in the vampire movie. Along with other not very interesting characters and a bad story, the whole movie becomes predictable. If you remember this and are a fan of vampire movies, you can have fun with a few scenes. Do not expect any Tarantino-style chapters or Anne Rice's story. (I expect to forget the whole movie tomorrow;)
