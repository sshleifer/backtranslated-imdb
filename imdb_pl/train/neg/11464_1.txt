Although I am not saying that I am an expert in marine life, I must say that anyone with a little intelligence could not believe that a whale (and even a mother!) Has a vengeance because he witnessed a forced abortion through his dead partner! Really! It's basically the whole plot. Richard Harris had to be extremely heavy to accept this trash. This is a movie that is so bad that if you pay 50 cents to see it, you will want to request a refund.
