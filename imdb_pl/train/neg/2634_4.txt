It should not be confused with the above-average supernatural thriller "The Sentinel". Sentinel was a big bore for me, not providing a cohesive action, as several critics promised. It seemed to everyone that they were doing it, only there to make some cash, because it was very similar to a television movie. Sentinel is a remix of a few better movies, such as "In The Line Of Fire", which has no originality, and watching Michael Douglas runs, in my opinion, stupid. The main problem, apart from irrelevance, had to be a bad pace. I often got distracted when trying to watch this movie, watching how much time remained, more than once. Not only a bad approach with Eva Longoria, who could not convince her of value for licking. <br /> <br /> Performances. Michael Douglas is usually a reliable actor, here, of course, go through movements. He does not convince you as a man on the run or a secret agent. His chemistry with Bassinger was also turned off. I am a huge fan of Kiefer Sutherland, but here it is only fine, nothing more. He tries to look harsh, but he has been more bland than anything else, and to be honest, he did not seem interested. Eva Longoria Parker is quite average. He does not convince in his role and was a pure candy. Kim Basinger is terrible like the first lady. She looks bored with tears, and her role is to throw away, more than anything else. Martin Donovan finally has a big role, but not enough to be important to me. <br /> <br /> Conclusion. Sentinel is yet another political thriller that bored me to tears. It is too old, too tired, and most importantly, no effort. Not recommended. <br /> <br /> 4/10
