Do you like to get up? So stay away from it ... <br /> <br /> In the first rounds are really good comics, but if they do not have lovely features, they have a chance for snowballs. Any controversial material, and you're outside! ... and I think I hurt myself the same as the ejected comedians, when I see who the damned referees let in. <br /> <br /> 1 of my 4 best went further than eliminations. Half of the finalists gave me 0 laughter. Some of them picked up their material somewhere else, something that the judges do not seem to have problems with. <br /> <br /> It's more fun than many other things on TV, but it's incredibly hard to see without thinking what could have happened. <br /> <br /> If the producers changed the name of the competition to "Last Clown Standing", all my criticism would expire. Maybe an idea?
