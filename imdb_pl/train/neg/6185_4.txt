My first review from 2010 is "Into The Blue 2: The Reef". The story is about two divers played by Chris Carmack and Laura Vandervoort, who love to discover hidden treasures at the bottom of a local reef. One day after a day of sightseeing, the couple played by David Anders and Marsha Thomason approach them. They tell young divers that they want to hire them to explore the reef and find a rare artifact about the hidden treasure of Columbus that is reported at the bottom of the reef. <br /> <br /> The next day four dives to the bottom of the reef and thick after a day of diving, they find nothing. A few days later, and two hired divers, they learned that they were part of a serious deadly intrigue in which they could not escape, otherwise they would be killed. They were hired to find two large containers. One contains a nuclear reactor and the other contains a core. <br /> <br /> The film also has a story behind someone else (the main character brother) trying to fix the matter with his girlfriend. history was a waste of time, it also includes a very steamy scene of sex between the couple, which for me is a complete loss and did not need to be shown. <br /> <br /> However, apart from that the film has a good underwater photography, and the colors match well, that's why it gets 4 stars. Into The Blue 2 is a continuation only from the name. None of the original actors or heroes returns, has a stupid plot, stupid characters and a boring climax.
