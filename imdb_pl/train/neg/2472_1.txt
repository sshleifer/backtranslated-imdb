Anyone who really could sit in this movie and leave, feeling that it's a good movie, underestimates high-quality movies. This movie was an insult to watch, the direction is the quality of the school movie class, as well as photos. The Blair Witch project had better pictures and I hate this move with passion! The plot had the potential to be a very intense, very good movie, but it fell flat from the first 10 minutes to the end of the movie. Someone mentioned that this movie was about the child's imagination, everything is fine and good. But they could still do better with the script than what they did. I mean, Indian in the store. Did the kid look at the little god and suddenly imagine the Indian and the whole story of an Indian spirit called Wendigo? Which mention the store employee and she casually says she has no one but me who works here, so you think everything is okay, a terrifying ghost script, but then she just exchanges money for the idol and we forget about the little child who He sees this guy. It was so bad that it went beyond pathetic. Finally, you wondered not only what happened to Otis in the hospital, but also to the feeling of OMG !!! Why the hell I just wasted my time watching this !! This is a movement that I do not recommend watching, there are definitely better quality videos that do not offend your intelligence! Thank God that I never had to pay to see this movie, I would demand a refund! For those who have had a good time in this movie ... it is very sad that you have lowered your standards to this level of film making, to say that it's a good movie.
