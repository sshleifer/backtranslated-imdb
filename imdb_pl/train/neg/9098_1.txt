There is a reason why some films go straight to the video and of course the obvious reason is that if it's too rude to the theater audience it immediately releases the movie. Of course, it would not be fair for the films to be good and at the same time to be published directly on the video. This is no exception, although the movie has good actors or at least the actors with the potential: Amy Adams (I am nominated for an Oscar and a talented actress), Robin Dunne, who deserves a better or at least better agent, and Sarah Thompson, who deserves roles that there is a departure from teenage melodramas. The film is also distorted: this movie takes place in front of Cruel Intentions, which is why this movie is actually a prequel and rather stupid. It was a waste and really a movie that is on the same level as soft porn cores and pay-per-view masturbation videos. Fortunately for the actors, hopefully they will be able to remove it from their resumes. So if you want to see something rude, but you dare not buy porn, rent this movie as an appetizer.
