The Hollywood attempt to transform Jack London's life into an adventure film "Jack London" is not a bad idea; he certainly led an interesting and sometimes adventurous life. This film, however, becomes flat and unsatisfactory. Most importantly, he lacks integrity. Michael O'Shea (as London) has several London speeches; and it's nice to see his bearded Jack receive "The Call of the Wild" after spending time alone, in the snowy mountains, with the dog "Buck". Virginia Mayo and Susan Hayward are very pretty. The film draws the unfortunate parallels of the "Yellow Peril" between the life of London and the Second World War, which are both tense and offensive. <br /> <br /> ** Jack London (11/24/43) Alfred Santell ~ Michael O'Shea, Susan Hayward, Virginia Mayo
