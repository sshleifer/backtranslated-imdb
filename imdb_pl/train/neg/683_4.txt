Lulu (Louise Brooks) works as a typist and lacks something in her life. She enters the Miss France contest against the wishes of her boyfriend Andre (Georges Charlia), and she wins. He sets off to the title of Miss Europe, leaving his boyfriend behind. He wins again, but returns home to Andre, because he asked her for it. After returning to life, her life again becomes mundane, so one night she writes a note to him and goes out to experience the fame awaiting her as the Miss of Europe. Andre follows her ..... <br /> <br /> This movie is a silent movie with all piano music. It's also accelerated, so everything seems fast. Then a limited dialogue was added and it is very false. The cast is fine, remembering that it is a mute movie. The best part of the movie appears at the end, but the story goes a little bit too long. After seeing this, I'm not quite sure what the big problem with the look of Louise Brooks was - she has a terrible hairstyle that makes her face look thick. I do not have to watch it again.
