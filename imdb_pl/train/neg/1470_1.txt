I watched our DVD tower yesterday to see something. We were between NetFlix shipments and it was a quiet Saturday night. I pulled out one that I had never heard of before and realized that he had been borrowed from a friend. From the jacket it sounded like a rip off "The Big Chill", but with a star cast I felt that it was worth watching. The boy was wrong !!! Not only was it "The Big Chill", but it was a rip off almost character by character. Bill Paxton's character was a copy of William Hurt ("where have you been all this time") - a warning about the engine - and, behold, he remains behind to take care of the old place (cabin / camp). Kimberly Williams = Meg Tilly; jerk womanizer Matt Craven = Jeff Goldblum etc., etc. I was wondering why I even look at these people. There was not enough character development for me to be interested in them. How did "Unca Lou" even find these characters after 20 years? Besides, it was not even fun, except when Perkins fell, err "jumped" out of bed the first morning, it was a sign and I missed him. After I finished, I asked my wife, "Were there any charming characters in the movie? ... Are you sleeping there? "She said," No, I'm still thinking ... No, I can not think about anything. "
