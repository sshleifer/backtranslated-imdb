Screenwriter / director Peter Greenaway gives his title to the title of President of the High Lord of Art House with his latest exercise in unbearable indulgence, 8½ women. The film tells the wealthy Englishman and his son in their common pursuit of sexual satisfaction when they entice and blackmail women (guess how many) to join their personal collection of concubines. <br /> <br /> Think about how this assumption can be offensive, and the chances of Greenaway doing it. Female characters are little more than a catalog of fetishes for two heroes. Is Mio obsessed with Kabuki, always pregnant Giaconda and Beryl, who has something for farm animals. Giulietta has no legs and uses a wheelchair, she is a "half woman", do you understand? Greenaway violently denies all accusations of misogyny, but if it is not, what is it? <br /> <br /> The film continues the eroticization of everything that has to do with Japan, the continuation of topics from his snoring (but less sexist) 1996 The Pillow Book. But where the Pillow Book was erotic and graceful, 8½ women simply become horny and exploitative. Greenaway's work is distasteful and arrogant in her fetishism, and the only person who can enjoy watching is the author himself.
