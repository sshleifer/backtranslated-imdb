Only Robert De Niro's film, which I really hate. It's a stupid movie with horrible acting (of course not De Niro). For me, Brian De Palma must do his mafia movies, as always Scarface (1983) or The Untouchables (1987). I also loved De Palma's Mission: Impossible (1996). De Niro also collaborated with Palda twice, Greetings and Wedding. I thought The Wedding Party was OK too (I did not watch Greetings). <br /> <br /> The script is really bad and indecent. There is no scene where I could smile even once. The film lost the chance of being a funny style even in the "Be Black baby" scene, and I also do not like the scene in which the sexual organs of the guy appeared. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! simply the worst. I hate this.
