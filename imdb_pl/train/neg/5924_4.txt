Diana Muldaur appears on Star Trek for the second time, but this time as a different character. Nobody notices on the board - maybe it was hair. Regardless, this time it is not a container for god (see the previous episode), but is a very famous lady with magical powers that allows her to communicate and watch Medusan without madness (standard human response). Unfortunately, the man who is the most in love with her are several cards with a full deck and he tries to kill the Medusa ambassador (who, oddly enough, lives in a small crate - it's a bad way of traveling). And unfortunately, Muldayr alone is not so well wounded. What happens next is a bit stupid, and by the time the episode ended for the first time, when I saw it, I felt relieved. Watching all the men on board who had passed Ga-ga over Muldaur was quite stupid, and Spock's behavior, when he was crazy, was quite camp. Do yourself a favor - if you have not seen the show yet, choose another episode.
