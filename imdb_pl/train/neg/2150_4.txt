You will recognize the story immediately. Daughters of a divorced couple trying to reconnect Mom and Dad. Yes, it was about The Parent Trap in the 60's, 80's and 90's. But here is a terrible thing. Although Deanna Durbin was younger than 21-year-old Hayley Mills playing the role of daughter (daughter), Durbin looks much older, as in adults. And so are all the so-called siblings. <br /> <br /> And this confusion between an adult and a child goes through the whole movie. The girls are dressed in the charming costumes of the sailors, but they look funny in them, because the director seems to bother to point to their wide peaks and carcasses throughout the film. So you are constantly torn between thinking about them as children or women. When Ray Milland and others start to "hit" them, you feel like they were pedophiles, and you too can be one of those who notice these stuffed animals and the tops that the director pointed out. Teens, temptresses, little girls or little foxes, you're never quite sure what you think of them as. <br /> <br /> Parents also seem very old, and the whole movie seems very old. <br /> <br /> This is a rusty version of Parent Trap and you should avoid it, or at least make sure tetanus shots are up to date, if you do not believe me.
