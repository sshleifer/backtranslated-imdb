I read the book "7 years in Tibet" from Heinrich Harrer and I was fascinated by it. then I immediately grabbed the DVD and started watching the movie. I remember seeing it for the first time in '98, I liked it. Well, now I looked at him again in full knowledge of the book on which he relies. and soon I realized how wrong it all was: <br /> <br /> when they enter Lhasa, people start to stick their tongues out of their mouths, and Thewlis and Pitt have the impression that it's a way to say hello, so they welcome back ... in the book that Harrer explains that language exposure is a sign of absolute humility and loyalty in Tibet and they can do it before the Dalai Lama, but certainly not for these two Europeans! not only the mother, but even the Dalai Lama himself wore glasses in public. in Harrera's book, he mentions that no one in Tibet wore glasses until then (sorry I forgot the reason, but it was also explained in the book). the young Dalai Lama did it, but only if he was alone and no one could see him! what about Mao tse tung lookalike, destroying the mandala from the young "living Buddha"? childish ... and the tailor made the Tibetan clothes of Harrera and Aufschnaiter not European suits! Why so many events really happened to fill this time with a fictitious love business (a female tailor ...) that is completely unimportant? like the whole story about the sons of harrers, rolf. not one word is mentioned about him or even about any member of the Harrera family in the book. but it was fine for me because "7 years in Tibet" is not a harrers book. it's about tibet. I am very disappointed with this "adaptation" of the famous book. and I bet that heinrich harrer was also ... 3 stars, only for cinematography.
