This movement is just as bad as they are. However, I was forced to give him 2 for the scenery. There are many great shots in the Southwest, including many in Monument Valley, one of the most breathtaking places in the US. It is also, starting with John Ford, one of the most filmed. In fact, one scene with Kris and the girl was filmed in a place called John Ford Point.
