Do not waste time or money on this movie. My roommate rented it because she thought it was the second movie called Descent (a film about travelers who were trapped in a cave). so we decided to watch it and think it could not be that bad. It was. I can not believe that this movie has been produced and publicly released. It was so terrible that it was almost like an accident scene in which you want to look away, but you just can not bring yourself to. Honestly, I feel emotionally cut. It started with being a semi-low-budget movie in which a college girl is attacked by a boy she meets with a porn movie. And it really is not good. I went from hating a woman's rapist to almost feeling unwell. Almost. In general, a horrible movie that was definitely rated by NC-17 for some reason. Do not waste your money. And do not let your children watch it.
