For some reason, TV Guide gave two and a half stars, plus Faye Dunaway is in it, so it definitely looked like something to see. Mine, oh my, it could be the worst movie I've ever seen. Always. From his horrible action (every time a girl asks a boy what's happening to him, I shouted at the TV "I can not act!" When she asks what she needs, I shout, "I need an acting lesson!" For an incredibly bad dialogue ("Give me back" mi moje organizm! "). <br /> <br /> And Brian DePalma will end too, everything was just awful, I wanted to like it Dunaway is one of the best actors in history and the production values ​​were pretty good. <br / > <br /> But wowzers, it made me laugh, LAUGH !, most of the time. <br /> <br /> Do not even bother with curiosity, it was my first mistake. Being with him was definitely my second, third and fourth .
