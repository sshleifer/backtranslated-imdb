With the cast of unwavering British character actors and pleasant UK photography from the 1950s, I was hoping that this movie will be more entertaining. Unfortunately, I found myself stuck to it for the wrong reasons - I could not believe how terrible it was. I had to watch thousands of old movies and I'm always ready to be products of their time, but it was really difficult. <br /> <br /> As others have pointed out, the main problem is that it does not seem to know what it wants to be: a delicate romantic comedy, a slapstick comedy or a musical. I was a bit dazed when Jeannie Carson suddenly stopped the song for about 15 minutes! It is not credible at any level, neither the story itself, nor the fact that Daisy never seems to have a gram of danger in it. Other aspects that contradicted credibility included filling the courteous Donald Sinden as the songwriter (author of songs for God's sake!), The fact that he has Diana Dors as his fianc√©e and does not seem to have the slightest interest in her (that is, Diana Dors! he!) And the ridiculous scene in the song publisher's office. The whole thing is stupid in the worst possible way. <br /> <br /> If I had to choose a favorite scene, it would be the one from the very beginning with this great actor Wilfred Lawson - then everything went down in a big way.
