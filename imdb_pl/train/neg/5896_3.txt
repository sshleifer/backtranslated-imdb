One missed call, another Asian horror based on a mobile phone. I recently rented a Korean horror based on a mobile phone called "Pon". One missed call was as boring as it was. Maybe the phones are not just scary, but the move was boring and colorless. No tension and emotion for me, and the last monster was disappointingly tacky and distrustful. The film dragged on in various parts and felt too long. I did not pay attention to myself. It seems that the phones are difficult to be frightened, it's a bit like a spooky slot machine. And it's ridiculous to compare it with "The Ring", it looks like every Asian horror is compared to that and so far I have not seen any of them that would at least face it. For horror film directors - take your phone off the device as a horror movie.
