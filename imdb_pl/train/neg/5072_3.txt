And self-proclaimed to take off. At some point, the doctor's assistant refers to myself as Igor. <br /> <br /> Working with the more and more likely idea that computers can be used to replace or reconstruct brain functions, this movie does not devote enough time to study the assumption. Most of the time on the screen is divided between a domestic quarrel with a girl in a coma and the pursuit of the brain donor killer. He tries to be a sci-fi / drama / thriller, but he fails to do any of the three. <br /> <br /> Frankenstein's remake lacks everything that made the original good. Nobody calls a crazy doctor, and even threatens to throw him out of the hospital. The transformation scene consists of the victim of a coma opening one eye, and the amazing computer that triggers it is not even shown. When the experiment works, there is no praise, and when it starts to go bad, there is a small reaction. <br /> <br /> Any uncertainty about who the killer can be is smashed by gradually showing him in the same room with all possible suspects. Finding the killer is as easy as opening one file and hearing one person. <br /> <br /> San Francisco as an environment is both overcrowded and unused. The opening sequence shows that this is happening in SF, the cableway plays a significant role, the leaders live on the Victorian hill, Pier 39 appears, and the final game takes place at Golden Gate Park. Specifically, ten feet from the cliff in the park - it is enough for the bridge to be always visible in the picture. When the obvious bases of the scenery are rounded up, no other attempts to explore the city are made. <br /> <br /> Acting is the only saving here. Keir Dullea shows good coverage and performs some really emotional scenes. Suzanna Love is good at recovering from a coma. Tony Curtis gets only a handful of lines and twice as much evil guy stares at most Frankenscience explained by his assistant. This little blond also goes quite well with his tips. <br /> <br /> I also gave him one more star for the scene where her husband travels south of the bridge, crosses the unbound car park, and then returns immediately to the northbound bridge. It takes a lot of things - courage, ignorance, deadlines - to try to slip through the viewer during a single car chase.
