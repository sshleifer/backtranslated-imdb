I went to see the movie in cinemas and was shocked when I walked into the room. There was only me and my girlfriend! It screamed to me that this movie is not very good. <br /> <br /> To my surprise, the film was tragic. Ben Affleck plays a guy who buys a family for Christmas. It is a very predictable story in which he falls in love with a girl who hates him. His acting is OK, but for the comedic aspect of the film is not very good. The story is weak and the comedy almost does not exist. <br /> <br /> However, there are some good points. For example, the family is falling apart and the mother is very funny. <br /> <br /> I hope this review will stop other people from wasting their money. I was very embarrassed when I left the room !!!
