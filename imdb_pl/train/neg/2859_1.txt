It was produced in 2007, and CG is bad for a film made in 1998. In one part of the movie there is a dinosaur shot that actually looks good, but it makes the extremely amateur work on the CG material look even worse. <br /> <br /> Writing, acting, directing and everything else in this movie is simply awful. It's as bad as no worse than Raptor Island and 100 million BC ... pure shit! Again, as with other movies, the only frightening part of this movie is the fact that it was produced and is currently being broadcast on the science-fiction channel. <br /> <br /> I still do not understand how to somehow get people who have some acting skills to act in these movies, and then somehow force them to behave as horribly as everyone in the movie. <br /> <br /> For those who are not sure, the second poster is of course sarcastic in his review ... or is one of the people who have worked on this movie.
