Col, a space prisoner in the cosmic death cell, manages to kidnap a space shuttle and escape to the forests of America, where, together with a new found friend, he tries to escape from the "Alienator", a female machine for killing cyborgs. The best film about Fred Olen Ray's career, "Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers", this film can not resist the impression that he is a little disappointed, as cheap as the previous movie, but not as funny as me. None of the actors really stood out to me. The film is fine for a non-discriminating viewer on a rainy Saturday afternoon, but it's all good. <br /> <br /> My class: D + <br /> <br /> Where I saw him: Showtime Thriller
