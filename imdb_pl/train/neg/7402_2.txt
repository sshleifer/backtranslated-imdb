This is a typical example of highly qualified video / advertisement directors who are trying to make their first full-length feature film. On the one hand, images, camera, lighting, CGI and even sound are very polished and have a truly "expensive" look. Even actors have a certain potential - to the extent that even the best actor can not hide the bad plot. <br /> <br /> In this case, this is not a bad plot, but it is not a story at all. <br /> <br /> So 50% of the dialog box consists of "What the hell was it?", "What was it?" and "What the hell was it?". In none of the cases, none of the characters or the audience has even a bit of an answer. In the majority of other dialogues one can get the impression that there never was any form of a dialogue book, and the actors had to freely improvise to a story that was never explained to them. <br /> <br /> The only reason why Skye Bennet's Performance may be so good that her character as an autistic girl did not let her give these tragically awful dialogue lines that other actors had to deal with. In this way she was able to show her acting talent, which the rest of the cast could not even bring closer. It means that there is not one actor in the world who could compensate for such a dialogue: <br /> <br /> Ben: Is it true, huh? Emily: Stop it. Ben: Mass psychosis, eh? Jon: Someone must take control of this situation. Ben: This situation can not be controlled. Not by you, not by anyone. Emily: Neither because of you. Ben: Nie <br /> <br /> I have goose bumps. But not for horror, more for a terrible attempt. At some moments I was ashamed that the actors added it to their vita. <br /> <br /> 2 stars for excellent technical work.
