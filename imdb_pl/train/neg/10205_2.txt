So I wonder if the producers of this movie could not save on Sandry Bullock's wardrobe while watching this film, pulling clothes "before" from Miss Congeniality? Did Miss Bullock also sleep on this role, directing "to" Gracie Hart? As many reviewers have noted, the film is very formal. Let's add that the deja vu viewer experiences Cassie Maywether as a slightly darker Gracie Hart with more history and quickly becomes a nap. <br /> <br /> Two of the bad serial-boy murderers have been made (and better) in other movies. Like "a good partner who tries to protect his partner, despite the evidence", he was already seen earlier. In fact, none of the characters in the movie ever go beyond two dimensions or try to be anything but a trivial stereotype. <br /> <br /> Last rage - using the serial killer term is a false ad. The murder of one person - even if it is a premeditated murder - does not make you a serial killer. You might have the potential to become a serial killer, but you're not a serial killer or even a madman killer.
