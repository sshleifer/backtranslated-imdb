Did I miss something here? This "adaptation" has everything that Brookmyres's first novel had. Everything except history, laughter, black humor, political intrigue, characteristics, plot and semblance of sense. <br /> <br /> Spoilers; <br /> <br /> Godamnawful, from beginning to end. They ridiculed the plot, had an affair between Parablane and cop, and that was what it was all about. Dr. Slaughter was presented as an observer, who the hell was Annette Crosby? /> It looked like they did a three-hour adaptation and then chopped it down to 90 minutes. (Although 90 minutes seemed to last forever.) Please, do not do this in any other book from Brookmyres (especially "The Country of the Blind").
