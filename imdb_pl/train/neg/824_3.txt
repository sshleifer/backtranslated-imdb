Gene Hackman is thrown out of jail by a nameless government agency that wants to kill him. Obviously, this is obvious that Hackman has proficient skills to complete the task. <br /> <br /> Nobody tells him anything, it is given, because the audience receives fragments and information. It should be full of tension, but irritating and boring. <br /> <br /> Hackman goes through the mission, but the escape is collapsed, and the guy at the top of this mysterious creature orders everyone to die to hide it. So everyone in the cast is dying, and in the end you do not care. <br /> <br /> One of the other reviewers noted that the film was originally twice as long, almost three hours and was cut quite a bit. Maybe something really got lost in the translation, but I think it was an act of mercy in the audience. <br /> <br /> A very talented cast who had people like Richard Widmark, Candice Bergen, Mickey Rooney, Eli Wallach, and Edward Albert is so wasted that it's a crime. <br /> <br /> And we'll never find out what the federal agency, the FBI, the CIA, DEA and even the IRS are doing.
