I was a little tired of the fact that people abuse the name of God to consolidate their own bigothetic view of the world. Well, I do not disregard the idea of ​​Armageddon, or the coming of the antichrist, I reject the idea that only some people who live a really good life (they seem to be mainly white Christians) will go to heaven, the rest of us must suffer for millennia of hell on Earth, just because that we were not good enough. God can be a judge, but I do not think he will measure any level of goodness. Give the Creator a loan.
