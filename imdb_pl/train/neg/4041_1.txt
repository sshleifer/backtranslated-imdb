Like in a hair shirt. Positively, absolutely, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the worst films ever. Pure torture. Zero stars out of ten. One long, boring, hard-working, pretentious, conscious, theatrical and artistically leading scene on the other. Intended to be phenomenal and impressionistic, the soul is bare, it is rather gloomy. <br /> <br /> Half-naked, father and son struggle and whisper to each other like lovers. "Homo-erotic" is a loud and clear point. Ok, and what? <br /> <br /> Repeatedly repeated by her son, she is a line, supposedly abolished from "Żywoty świętych", "Crucified by the father of love. A loving son lets himself be crucified. " Parallelism with God and his son, Christ, is hard, unimportant and bombastic, like everything else here. <br /> <br /> Some references indicate the subject of Russian sonship: "Matka i syn" (1997); "Return" (Andrei Zvyagvatsev, 2003); "Little Odessa" (James Gray, 1994); Turgenev, "Fathers and sons"; and, of course, Dostoevsky "The Brothers Karamazov." <br /> <br /> Loans in English indicate the intended international distribution, which means that you can not use an excuse to be Russian to understand this mess. <br /> <br /> Nowhere is this as perfect or convincing as Sokurek's last "Sokołek" (2003). <br /> <br /> As in "Mother and Son", equally powerful, the soporic, some scenes are filmed from distorting mirrors, though not as interesting. The film is almost monochrome, captured from the beginning to the end with the help of beige filters, making it as visual as dramatically numbing. Haze with soft focusing only increases the feeling of drugs. <br /> <br /> Annoying soundtrack drums, never closes like a loop on the tape. The old radio is constantly playing in the background. Russian romantic melancholy swells endlessly as "topics based on Tchaikovsky." The presence of "sound designer" (Sergei Moshkov) means of course that all these annoying little sounds, radio interference, noise, distortion etc. are "designed". <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that someone (Sergei Potepolov) actually wrote this thing. Everything seems as arbitrary as street traffic, as if improvised by bored actors, jumping out of nothingness into nothingness. <br /> <br /> Contemporary art finally managed to mark a thing without being a thing, so what we see is the idea of ​​an idea, empty as a shell, but not even a shell, but only the idea of ​​a shell. Can you ask for a better definition of decadence?
