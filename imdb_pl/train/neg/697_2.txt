Two things are good in this movie are two unknown stars. <br /> <br /> First, Daphne Zuniga, for the first time in the film, young and supple, with looks that still embrace her body, steals the very beginning in which she is, and that's it. Apparently it is just beginning, because her acting has improved along with subsequent projects. <br /> <br /> Second, the score of the well-known composer Christopher (Chris) Young is what prevents this smelly from getting one star ... yes, I know that one star is not much, but in the case of this movie is much. <br /> <br /> The rest is just a stupid, meaningless horror of a pair of students who try to clean up the dormitory to be torn down, dropped one by one by unsuspecting assassin, blah, blah, blah ... we all know where it's going It is happening. <br /> <br /> Watch the first eighteen minutes with Daphne Zuniga, then turn it off.
