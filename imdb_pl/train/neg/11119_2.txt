Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes merge as hustlers on the basketball court. Okay, that sounds good. It leaves a lot of space for a good comedy and a good story. But such an event did not take place in many of the next boring minutes of this pathetic film attempt. This movie became superfluous, delayed and ridiculous after the first twenty seconds. Woody Harrelson played one of my favorite t.v. characters, Woody from Cheers, and I could not wait to see him in this movie. But after watching his "acting performance" I came to the conclusion that there should be playing stupid natives who are bartending. His acting was as boring and as poor as a movie. Another actor in this unreal movie was Rosie Perez. I liked films with Perez before, but I decided that the reason I liked other work in her career was that she was not the main character and did not have so many lines of speech (Do the Right Thing). But now in "White Men Can not Jump" he has become the main character with many lines, which means that the audience has to put up with his incredibly annoying and whining voice. So after watching this movie (the term used loosely) and listening to Rosie Perez for much more than appreciated, I can now say that I am a white man and I am preparing to jump. . . from a twenty-story residential building.
