I feel like I am the only child in the city who was irritated by Branagh's performance. He is a great actor in most relationships, but he just could not tear himself away from the southern accent. It was regrettable. It looked as if he was trying too hard to become a Janker. One of the previous reviewers questioned why the American actors were not cast in this film. I give up this concept. It's great when actors / actresses want to broaden their horizons, but the next thing is trying too hard to make the performance tighter. Maybe it's Altman, but he's a great director ... <br /> <br /> Well, I really do not want to figure out Branagh for his absolutely hideous accent. Everyone deserves to break down here. But it's hard to see something so annoying that you prefer to choke a chicken bone or eat a bucket full of shit than to sit in a Gingerbread Man.
