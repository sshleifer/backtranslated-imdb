Honestly, I heard it was pretty bad before I decided to watch it, but I will never let others influence my viewing, in fact I'm more likely to watch something out of rebellion! Bullwhip still had one thing in front of him, the fact that Rhonda Fleming and those wonderful eyes were in him, he was interested in me right away. The picture is not very good and is in fact very morally dubious, all characters are corrupt and changeable in one shape or form, all motivated by greed or egocentric victories, everything is good and good if the surrounding movie can do justice to a bunch of wicked people and create tense climax, shaking image. Unfortunately, this is not happening, and because the finale fills your eyes with sugar, you can not stop screaming that you've been cheated, watching a pretty bad movie, no one in the cast, and Guy Guy, the main guy painfully wooden in extreme conditions. <br /> <br /> Even the lovely Rhonda can not recommend it to anyone, 3/10
