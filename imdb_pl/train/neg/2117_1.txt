The brides die at the altar and their bodies disappear. Everyone is concerned, but it seems that no one is able to find out why and how it is happening, nor can it be prevented. Hang with me. Bela Lugosi is responsible for this because she is extracting the spinal fluid from these young women to transport her old wife and keep her alive. Do not stop with me. Finally, authorities learn that someone has to design death and disappearance, but of course he can not understand the unbelievable motive. Ignore the ridiculous pseudoscience and move on ... If you manage to survive the first twenty minutes of this mess, you will be treated Lugos, who whips his laboratory assistant for disrespecting one of the brides he murdered, explaining that he finds a much more comfortable sleeping in a coffin than the bed and other foggy parodies of real horror movies (such as budgets and storylines). In any case - the journalist follows the perpetrator with his nose (and the unsuccessful police are nowhere to be seen!), And then the fun really begins. <br /> <br /> Photos and acting are fine. There are a lot of well-dressed, very good-looking people in this film. Directing is honest, and the script is a bit better than well-deserved material. Nevertheless, this movie does not keep everyone interested, except for the most hardcore fans of the movie b. The best thing is ... It ends, but not soon enough.
