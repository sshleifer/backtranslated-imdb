Clich√© tells the story of an upcoming divorce - or is it? - through the eyes of a 6-year-old child. Simple dialogue, cardboard figures, stock market situations, sub-story of the red zombie from herring and, worst of all, absolutely no payment, neither emotionally nor dramatically. <br /> <br /> Does nobody teach creative writing anymore? The true sign of a weak narrator - when you can not create any satisfying solution - just end the story. I am forced to ask: "what made you think that this story is worth telling above all!?" <br /> <br /> Good, but wasted, debut of the child actor Anthony De Marco - the rest of the cast was at best forgotten . And they wonder why nobody is watching indie movies! That's ninety minutes of my life I'll never come back.
