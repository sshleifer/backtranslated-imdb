The subject is undoubtedly convincing: a group of people loves to keep playing, creating a fake medieval world full of warriors, kings, princes and castles. Wargaming is an interesting phenomenon that delves into our collective need to "escape" from reality and sometimes the mundanity of our existence - something that almost everyone can relate to. The heroes are a predictable mix of the Lord of the Rings suckers and Star Trek enthusiasts. That's enough for most people to watch. However, very soon the movie changes into wargaming with an almost stereotypical nose for viewers who "do not understand". The creators of the film seem to be interested in the theme of lip cutting, and this particular one, wait too seriously, than once in a while, recognizing the humor and joy in filming about adults shaking in medieval equipment and crumbling into foam swords. This is quite difficult for anyone who does not sit on their computer for 7-10 hours a day playing games or designing the latest celebrity destroyer to understand what characters are saying and why we should care. However, the filmmakers themselves do not seem to care about the choice of focusing solely on the theme of the game itself, instead of building a strong narrative with a clear story that everyone can understand. What's more, the characters themselves are not so attractive and you will quickly get bored with them: a big no-no, when you try to get people's attention for 90 minutes.
