I was so disappointed with this concert. After hearing and reading the whole hoopla about what it was like to be a "breakthrough show" and all kinds of wild promises, if I tried quality, I tried to watch it. <br /> <br /> What a job !! Acting was very forced and exaggerated. This story had very little sense. As for any kind of allusion to what is said about the "praised teenagers," I only saw a poor attempt that had as much reality as the reality show. <br /> <br /> Some people wonder why there are so many negative comments about this program. The reason is that it is not really that good, and overcoming drums over the quality in this series only serves to draw attention to how poorly it is.
