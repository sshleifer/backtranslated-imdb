I'm surprised that this movie is so highly rated, although if I were to go with a typical 71 scale c- or d, then maybe it's okay, but this movie was just a typical thriller, with the exception of slow and unrealistic boring. It's not that the typical thriller is realistic, but it seemed to be a rehearsal, and yet the woman who was raped did not prosecute because she did not want to be interrogated in court, even though she would put a man who broke his arm, beating her and raped her for life, but also protecting the lawyer for whom she had feelings, and his family, not just random people she did not even know. There were other similar film issues that would be fine if there was a moral way to remove the movie, but some moral questions were about whether it was right to try to kill / defeat Kady before he did something illegal. he introduced himself a little one-sidedly, because Kady ended up as a mad bastard, geared for revenge, so the lawyer was right to protect his family, because he waited for Kady to actually rape her daughter so that he could do something legally would be a bit absurd. So now I just spent more of my life on this stupid movie, so please do not look at it, or at least your life will not be shrunken and that's how my 2 and a half hours meant something.
