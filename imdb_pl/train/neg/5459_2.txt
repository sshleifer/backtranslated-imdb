It was a very short episode that appeared in one of the "Night Gallery" shows in 1971. The episode featured Sue Lyon (from the famous Lolita movie) and Joseph Campanella, who play the babysitter and vampire respectively. The vampire hires a babysitter to watch his child (which seems to be a werewolf or monster) while he goes out to blood at night. The babysitter is completely unaware of the vampire's appearance when he first sees him and only begins to put two and two together when he notices that there is no reflection in the mirror, he has a strange collection of books in the library about occultism and hears strange noises, while the vampire goes to talk to the child. He realizes that the man who hired her may not be what she originally thought she was. He jumps out the door, the vampire comes out surprised and the episode ends. I do not know what purpose it was to have such a short episode lasting only 5 minutes. They should simply expand the previous episode by the same 5 minutes and skip this one. Total wasted effort.
