It was nice to see all the famous characters again, but the story disturbed me. We loved Ariel in the first movie, so why the other is concentrating around her daughter? The new characters were annoying and I did not like it. What's worse, Christopher Daniel Barnes did not come back as Eric's voice! Disney, stop rewriting classic movies with those cheesy imitations.
