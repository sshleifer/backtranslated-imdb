The problem with this title is that I'm not sure if the director is trying to produce a document or movie. The combination of these two species simply does not work and leaves everything suspended in the middle of nowhere. This is all the more so because the director chose the most extreme elements of what is going to happen in our everyday life, which makes it an unconvincing document. If it is to be a thriller / drama, it is too boring and monotonous. In both cases, what is the moral or message that the director tries to convey to the audience? That there are people around us who ill-treat others who want to be treated badly? That there are many crazy madmen around us? So what?
