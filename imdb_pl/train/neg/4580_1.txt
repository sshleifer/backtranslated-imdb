I'm still trying to decide if it really is the worst movie I've ever seen - A very worrying problem with this movie is that real scientists are being interrogated, but their video material is edited to look like it supports the ideas of many BSers who populate this movie . The ratio of BS to the interview signal is about ten thousand to one - at the end the interlocutors seem to say, "We want you to think !!", but they themselves are too lazy to do simple research on what they claim as fact. <br /> <br /> If you feel that you are open and you want to expand your consciousness, be open enough to read some real books about quantum theory: "The Einstein Universe", Nigel Calder (small volume, not a challenge) , "The Cosmic Code" by Heinz Pagels. If you can not force yourself to read the book, please do not complain to the reviewers that they are "open". <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this movie is simply incredibly bad. <br /> <br /> Do you know what a really good movie is that challenges the nature of reality? "Thirteenth Floor" directed by Roland Emmerich with Craig Bierko, Gretchen Mol, Vincent D'onofrio. Intelligent, sexy, thought-provoking.
