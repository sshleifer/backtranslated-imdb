Honestly, I can not worry about writing about this cinematic incompetence stone - life is just too short. I will only say that Alone In The Dark succeeded in only three things: 1. It will make you laugh, but for all the wrong reasons. 2. He manages to throw some useless threads into the air, but he drops them all. <br /> <br /> i <br /> <br /> 3. Completely disgraces the classic PC game, which apparently is based on a complete failure in all aspects of filming. <br /> <br /> Dr. Boll, if it really is what you are (I'm thinking about proctology here), what are you doing on the director's chair in the world?
