The first 30 minutes of Tinseltown had a clenched finger on the remote, ready to turn around to watch something else. The founding of two writers, for their luck, life in the "chest" with their own magazine was slightly funny, but painfully bland. <br /> <br /> The introduction of the character played by Joe Pantoliano - a great movie guy who lives in the park and sleeps in the toilet, offered hope and decided to give him a few more minutes. And then a few more, until the introduction of Kristy Swansons as a novice director and nymphomaniac on the border, added a bit of spice. Her solid performances have raised her presence above and a very welcome intrigue. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the obvious, low-budget impact on the film with poorly shot scenes, difficult pace and slapstick support moments. Some of my favorite movies of all time were bad, Whithnail and I am one of those who also deal with two guys sleeping, but luckily. <br /> <br /> However, for my money, the actors save Tinseltown from the archives of "The Scary Movie" and almost poke him in the archives "could be a cult movie". I was laughing loudly on some scenes involving the character of Joe Pantoliano. In particular, the penultimate scenes in a terribly stereotypical, but still funny, rich, but twisted house of a character in which history develops towards the final moments. <br /> <br /> I see how Tinseltown was great on stage and while the creators of the film did their best to translate it to celluloid, it just did not work and while I was laughing out loud with some scenes and one liner, I think that the first 30 minutes dulled my senses and expectations towards such a degree in which I would laugh at everything. <br /> <br /> If you are not stuck on an innovative coffee stand, do not choose it if you see it in a bargain container.
