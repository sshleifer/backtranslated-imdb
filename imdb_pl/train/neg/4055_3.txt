I have read the reviews that apparently must have been a student at a very harsh British school in the 1960s to understand this. Maybe it's true, if it is, then this movie is outdated. <br /> <br /> ************* ALERT SPOILER ************** ************* ************* The end is just as sensible as all children who are anti-government and anti-corporate, not having any better solution that does not ignite society on the Mad Max slag. <br /> <br /> Yes, the main characters could leave, but they do not. The reasons why they do this make no sense. There is not enough character development to explain why. What is meant to shoot a group of innocent people is never explained or even suggested. It is mentioned that war is the ultimate creative expression, perhaps the only revelation that any form of this film has, and it makes no sense. <br /> <br /> Characters that commit murder, do not fight the institution, just kill people. I thought they could use all the explosives to blow up this place, or at least the sanctuary at the end, which would have more symbolic meaning, but they did not. <br /> <br /> tl; dr - This movie is a teenager's dream of fighting the authority that harasses them, but in reality they need it. There is no moral, symbolic truth or meaning in it; this movie just plays out the fantasy of killing teachers and people in the "power" that annoys you. <br /> <br /> If you think that a murder / schooling like columbine or virginia tech is a rational and reasonable way to deal with teachers and institutions that you do not like, so I think you'll love this movie. If you're like me and you're working on creating a life for yourself instead of blindly (very blindly in this movie) rebelling against "man," this movie is youthful and boring. <br /> <br /> It can also be said in parts that funding was lacking, and history seemed to have a little distraction. <br /> <br /> All in all, it seems to be a very rough sketch of what could be an okay movie, but no effort is put into dialogue, character development or morality, so it's just ... badly done . <br /> <br /> If ... I could only get back two hours.
