If you made a mistake watching a movie before reading a book, do not give up in the series. I bought the first copy of the book in May this year, and I almost finished with the book 10. I dare say that the film is a piece of garbage that does not give a series of even the judiciary. While 'Left Behind: Movie' only traces the history of 'Left Behind' (books) to a small degree, characters are not even close to accuracy. <br /> <br /> Some examples: Rayford never works his feelings for Hattie (he's going to be informed when he disappears); Buck Williams is a blond, writer of a magazine, not a television reporter; Chloe is in Stanford, and many books describe Rayford wondering if she "survived"; Buck and Chloe meet only much later, at a meeting in New York, founded by Hattie; Irene and Raymie are never "in the book," rather in Rayford's retrospective thoughts; the roads are as crowded as wrecks after delight, that Rayford and Hattie have to take the helicopter back to the suburbs ... etc etc. etc ... <br /> <br /> And this is only from the first movie; they intend to issue a third. Please, even if you did not like the movies, give a chance to a series of books.
