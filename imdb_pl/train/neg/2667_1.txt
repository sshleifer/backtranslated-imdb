California is disturbing. I believe that there is no reason to tell this story. It is neither entertainment nor social. Technically the film is very well made, the performances are first-class and first-class. History develops in an intriguing way that interests you. But in the end this film is sick and is repulsive to decency. I do not recommend California to anyone.
