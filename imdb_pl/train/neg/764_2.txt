The screenplay for this film Columbo seemed to be taken out of a juicy soap opera from the 80's. Deeply filmed films are great, but only if the characters are attractive. In this film the only attraction was my desire to change the channel. Dialogue of the villain sounds like it was written by a novelist. Lieutenant Columbo himself is not near his famous, beloved, modest, crumpled self; and the victim of kidnapping a fianc√© is a whining, one-dimensional lady in danger (he's spinning in fear of a tiny scalpel held in the hand of a kidnapper - come on! I could tear the scalpel out of his hand and kick him in 2 seconds). In any sense of reality, this character would at least feel like fighting or at least fighting a little. And speaking about reality ... history revolves around a kidnapping that is carried out and solved by the police. Police?? Give me a break. Everyone knows that the FBI is taking EVERY kidnapping case. It was NOT Columbo, just a shallow and completely predictable crime drama with our well-known Columbo lieutenant written and stretched for 2 hours.
