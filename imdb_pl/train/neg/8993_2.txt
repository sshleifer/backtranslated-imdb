In the 70's, when I saw for the first time, I was in high school. It was cool then. Now, as an adult, I look at it and tell myself ... yes, good. What was so funny? He has his moments, but they are few. It is so outdated that jokes do not arise any more. Show it to the younger crowd and they will be completely lost. If you like this kind of humor, you may want to stick with Kentucky Fried Movie or Amazon Women From The Moon. Tunnel Vision and Groove are too obsolete to be watched today.
