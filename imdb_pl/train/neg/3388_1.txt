I admit that I was a fan of the original stage production. I've never seen the movie version until recently on cable TV and watched it with impatience to see my memories revived again because I loved the original program. Imagine my consternation. <br /> <br /> This must be the worst Broadway translation for a movie ever made. They changed history, changed songs, lost their soul. I was expecting to travel down memory, singing to extremely touching music and mirror, ballet and Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen. No! They not only falsified the music to an almost unrecognizable point, but they mixed up the story, adding songs and external motifs (Hi Cassie and Michael Douglas) absent in the original and injecting "drama" where it was not necessary. The original had enough pathos on its own. If you've been a fan of the original Broadway show, do not worry. I am sorry that I wasted my time and diluted memories by watching these tripe.
