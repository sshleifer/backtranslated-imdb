Let me start by reading a few reviews before renting this movie and I knew what to expect. Still, I was surprised how bad it was. <br /> <br /> I am a huge fan of werewolves and got used to the great forgiveness while watching. Most of them have partial effects, weak acting and weak plot lines (at best remapped from earlier movies). So far, with the exception of some of the later films in the "Howling" series, this is the worst of many. <br /> <br /> First, the story. He is quoted several times in reviews on this site, so I will not go into details. However, it is very obvious that the writer had absolutely no affinity with the lycanthropic monsters. As is often the case when the horror is passed to the writer who considers himself "above", they tried to come up with a new spin on the werewolves myths. That's good, but a non-horror fan who tries to do it usually disregards the intelligence and sophistication of the horror audience and ends writing to them. The plot resembles a parody of films about werewolves, and the presented events are so false that I felt that my intelligence was seriously offended. For example, television materials never move away from the reporter to get closer to someone in the crowd behind them. Give the characters and viewers appreciation for being able to see the evil guy in the scene without using a flashing neon. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. <br /> <br /> As for the effects, I've NEVER seen a less-believable werewolf. I would be happier with Lon Chaney Jr. in crepeed hair. The beast they used looked like ... well, like a guy in a cheap rubber suit, with sticky hair and really horrible animatronics. And I know that many people already criticized CG, but my God, it was terrible. One scene depicts a woman who is changing and starts with a completely actress, nude, but for some reason without nipples. My first thought was: "Hey, why does one of the characters from" ReBoot "turn into a stupid, looking Werewolf?" <br /> <br /> In any case, I like to look for positives in every film and it was not enough. The photos were satisfactory (the movie was filmed completely digitally, which is interesting), and some performances were not terrible. It was also interesting to see Tippi Hedron as the most thought-out homeless woman in the world and Kane Hodder as the title bad guy. Besides, the Yellow Power Guard grew up and ... well, damn it. And if you're looking for skin, there are some very tasty examples. This ends the male segment of the review. <br /> <br /> In general, if you want a good werewolf movie, try "An American Werewolf in London", original "The Howling", "Dog Soldiers", or even "The Wolfen" (though it has more wolves than it was). If you're a complete lycanthrope, take it. Otherwise, miss it.
