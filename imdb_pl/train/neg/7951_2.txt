I gave "Kôhî jikô" a low score, not because it was a bad movie, but because it does not do anything worth praising. <br /> <br /> I have not seen any Hsiao-hsien Hou work before, but for the uninitiated (including me) "Kôhî jikô" is advertised as a tribute to Yasujiro Ozu. (Japanese director, whose last film was in 1962). The film is an extremely rare work ... containing very few dialogues, stories, music or emotions. <br /> <br /> Yo Hitoto plays "Yoko" and an unemployed, itinerant character who spends time in his local cafe or freely examines a Taiwanese composer he likes. Tadanobu Asano plays her friend who works in a CD shop and, from time to time, devotes himself to his interests in trains. And that's all. <br /> <br /> We watch Yoko drink coffee herself ... walk ... wait for the train ... catch the train ... fall asleep on the train. That kind of mundane reality everyone sees in Japan every day. Hou records these ordinary moments of heroes' lives, but irrelevant to these vignettes is a completely pointless movie to make or watch.
