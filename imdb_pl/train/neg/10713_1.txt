Come, let's be real. Knights of Christ, Ordo Templi or Knights Templars, as they are commonly called, did not even exist until the beginning of the 12th century. The story is so funny that it is pathetic. Dolph Lundgren looked bored. And besides, if you would like to have a real Templar, why not just use the Christ knights who still exist in Portugal. At least they should consider history. The only salutary feature I could find in this movie was that the artifacts looked authentic to go through medieval or gothic elements. Acting was bad, the plot was terrifying, the action was terrible, and the props were all right.
