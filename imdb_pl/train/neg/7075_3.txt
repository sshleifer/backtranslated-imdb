This is at least a third remake of this movie, so if you watch it, there is a sense of deja vu, do not be surprised. All they did was change the story setting and tell it differently, but the differences are not significant. And there is nothing better, because the plot is faulty at first. It never works. And like his predecessors, acting is mediocre. <br /> <br /> The plot has a unique ending that will surprise anyone who has never seen a movie before, but the ending does not fit the story. If this movie ended ten minutes earlier, it would work and it would be very satisfying and I think it would be worth it. But here is a spoiler and that in the end the crime is paid because the criminal is not caught. I never like this message from the movie.
