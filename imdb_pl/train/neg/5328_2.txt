Susan Seidelman seems to have had a decent career with some of the best points on the account. I'm sure I'm glad that she came back from this movie that seems to have her admirers. I'm not one of them. <br /> <br /> I've seen better acting in high school plays than in Smithereens. This plot includes young Susan Berman, who is ambitious to do it in the world of music and is ready to do anything to get there. He even rejects the sincere progress of the young artist who lives on the Brad River van from East River. <br /> <br /> Young Mr. Rijn has the worst performance in the film, in fact one of the worst acting acts that I've seen in a long time. No wonder he has not gone anywhere. <br /> <br /> I will say that Seidelman's eye for the camera is good in capturing famous East Village locations, where the film was mostly shot. But her work with her performers did not live. I'm not sure if she had so much raw material to work. <br /> <br /> See quickly and you'll see a very young Christopher Noth before Law and Order and Sex in the City as a street trader. <br /> <br /> If you like punk rock, you can sit on this soundtrack. I will stick to Bing Crosby.
