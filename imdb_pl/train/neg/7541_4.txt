big secret, but the movie comes down from here. The beginning is promising when the car wreck and the woman and her daughter are burnt alive in front of a police officer, Edward. It is therefore traumatically seen and sees popping pills. A mysterious letter from an old girl asks for help in finding a missing daughter. So Ed travels to the island on the island, mainly women. They do not like strangers. A lot of filler is with Ed, who showed the girl to look around the city. This made the film too long. In the end, it becomes a bit better at the end when we learn about the crazy rituals a woman does, and finally about the evil plan that awaits Edward. <br /> <br /> In general, this is not a well-written story and too long. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: Skip it.
