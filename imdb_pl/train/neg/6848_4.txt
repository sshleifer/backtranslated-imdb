I must say that I am quite disappointed with this "horror film". I did not even look once. This is also not too uncertain ... I managed to guess the end of the movie in the middle ... So ... what's left? <br /> <br /> "The Ring" is a really scary movie. ... I would like other films to stop copying (eg Trademark: long hair). Give me some originality. <br /> <br /> I will not recommend this movie.
