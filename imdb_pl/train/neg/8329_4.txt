I am questioning its importance to Queer Cinema, because it seems to be a homosexual encounter with aggressive behavior rather than explicit statements about homosexuality and violence. <br /> <br /> Three stories are tangled in a rather messy way. I tried to unravel this chaotic narrative in the first 15 minutes, which in itself did not suit me. The weak points of the plot were repeated endlessly, as if we had not received it 10 times. <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie there was a feeling of a padded dialogue. More like a 45 minute short Boy's Brief, not a modeled full-length movie. It had some erotic talent, male nudity and sex appeal, but overall the sum did not equal its parts. <br /> <br /> The first part: the Boxer / Stalker story was the strongest and at the same time too similar. pulled thin. Bob has been following Tim for four years and only now is he standing in front of him? I felt like their cat-mouse game was not developed enough to deserve her conclusion. We needed more information about them and less parking scenes / caches where Tim kept saying, "What do you want?" <br /> <br /> Second part: Danny wants his buddy, Tony, to beat him while he fights. Tony does not seem to mind, but does not even seem interested in discovering the implications of his homosexual hobby - even after they do it naked. This story lacks a comprehensive transition from "I am a simple boy who turns my friend around the wheel to have fun", "I think I can be gay and hit him because I would like to spread his ass and make him S / M style." important thing to skip. <br /> <br /> Of course, these stories could pass their points in the middle of time.The third part with a man and a woman patting each other, adds to this thought.In addition, it was unnecessary and did not add anything to the movie. Yes, the actors did a great job under these circumstances, and the four men were very sexy.Makeup (bruises and cuts) was on par with the gymnasium talent show. <br /> <br /> There was not enough meat in this story to affect the gay policy, the film did not make any statement, it wasted its time and is not engaging enough or worthy of thoughtful investments. an amateur approach that ultimately can not be taken seriously.
