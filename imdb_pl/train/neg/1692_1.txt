Okay, if you saw The Ring, you basically saw The Grudge. He tries to be frightening simply by the bizarre work of the camera and loud sounds, but he fails to do so. The plot, if you can call it that, is weak and rather full of holes, for example, how would the care center know that Yoko did not show up at work when there were no people there who lived at home? And it's not entirely clear what Bill Pullman's character has to do with anything. He just came out of nowhere to develop the story. It made no sense what happened to the original family. Who hung in the room, a little boy or dad? And whether Yoko lived or was dead when a caregiver found her? There were too many unanswered questions and I was too bored to think about it.
