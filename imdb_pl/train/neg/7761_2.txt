After a series of power outages on a distant island zoo, the genetically modified sabertooth tigers are on the loose and destructive inhabitants of the island. Man, the science-fiction channel did some bad "original" movies, but I think it might be their worst ever! This ill-written and directed "Jurassic Park" rip-off offers all the usual stereotypes (crazy scientists who think that people killed by monsters are "losses that can be lost", characters walking along long dark corridors, dead characters of teenagers who only function is to die a terrible death, etc.), and, surprisingly, there is no tension. Special effects are terrible? Puppets' heads in close ups of the title beasts are bad enough, they look like stiff plush dolls, but CGI ?, which makes computer-generated dinosaurs in "Walking with Dinosaurs" look like life for comparison? they are simply awful. There is some blood, but most of them look quite unconvincing. Oh, and the death scene of the scientist at the end is really one of the worst things I've seen in years. I could not even laugh that it was so bad! <br /> <br /> Do not waste time, this one is just bad. <br /> <br /> 2/10. <br /> <br /> Oh, here are some interesting points of interest: this movie borrowed music tips from the 2003 science fiction movie "Alien Hunter", which was much better than this piece of nonsense.
