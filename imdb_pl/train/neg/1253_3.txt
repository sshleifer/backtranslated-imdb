I read somewhere that Hollywood should concentrate on making bad movies and leaving the classics alone. We can only hope. Although this remake was not a total waste, I would still like to have six bucks to go to a DVD with the original. A lot of violence and one of the worst endings I've ever seen. This version does not add anything new. He only repeats why Hollywood should leave good things alone.
