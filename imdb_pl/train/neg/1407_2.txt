After life is a miracle, I did not expect too much. It's hard to believe that these movies were created by the same man, for example Do You Remember Dolly Bell. Zavet is two hours of stupid tomfools with no history. Wild and unbridled humor Underground seems to degenerate into a pathetic buffalo here. It looks like Kusturica has been going down since he started making life-giving comedies, starting with a Black cat, White cat, which I think is great, but he already had some disturbing signs of dementia. I liked his early films so much and that's why I'm particularly disappointed with something like that. Let's hope his next one will be great.
