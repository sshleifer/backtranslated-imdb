If you expect to see a lot of bathing in Altıoklar, as promised by the tag tag, you will be very disappointed to see that the movie consists only of the populist style of Altıoklar on the best known issues such as sex, marriage and cheating. For a large nudity that seems to appear out of nowhere and has nothing to do with the storyline, it proves that Altıoklar has "tried something new" unsuccessfully, as he has already quoted. Many jokes focused on sex seem to show that Altıoklar fell victim to the famous saying, which is "sex sells". I was hoping to see a very good story told with a very good narrative technique. In the end, however, I sat down for 90 minutes and watched the experimental Altıoklar, but I still focused on the work of the popular.
