I saw this movie a few days ago ... what the hell was that? <br /> <br /> I like movies with Brian O'Halloran, they are fun and enjoyable. When I saw the name of this title and genre, I thought great, this one can be really good ... some parody for motherfuckers or other movies upside ... but ... then I read the preview and thought it could be good ... but that there was ... <br /> <br /> my opinion: if you like movies that look a bit like a documentary, with a bit of comedy try Moore's films or Alien autopsy, they really are about something. this one was empty. <br /> <br /> and put a comedy to the title ... no comment ... a really bad joke
