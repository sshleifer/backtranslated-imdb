Me and my friends rented it from Blockbuster because we saw the name of Nana Visitor on the box. This movie is a parody, I hope it will reject your CV. <br /> <br /> The "plot" was lost and limp, the acting was mostly dry and unbearable. The film made no sense. The rough thread of an alien species of parasites that infects people has been repeatedly made with films with much better scripts than, for example, the invasion of body and department catchers. <br /> <br /> If you have ever had the misfortune of meeting this movie, I suggest you burn it. <br /> <br /> How it is classified as a horror movie when there was no fear, tension, anger, horror or any ordinary horror techniques I do not know, but if you still want to watch this movie, I suggest you have a lot of sugar before hand, so you can find its funny parts.
