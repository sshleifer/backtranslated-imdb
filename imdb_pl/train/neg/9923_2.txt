When I write this review in 2008, we are immersed in the remake culture. Film studios seem determined to ruin as many classic films as they can, with totally meaningless updates such as "King Kong," "The Wicker Man" and virtually every movie that Michael Caine has ever performed. This lazy remake of mentality is not a new phenomenon, because it proves a "cake to do". The completely pointless, colorful version of Bob Clampett's surrealistic masterpiece "Porky in Wackyland", "Dough for the Do-Do" sucks life from the original, breaking the color of the entire original Clampett material and adding some lame new material overseen by Friz Freleng. Freleng was a totally inappropriate director who manipulated the source material of Clampett, although in reality no director could have hoped to get close to the inspired madness of Clampett. "Dough for the Do-Do" is inevitably nothing more than the raping of a classic with a terrifying new title. For cartoon fans like me, the equivalent of coloring "Casablanca".
