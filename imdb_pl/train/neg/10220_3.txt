First of all, this film can be divided into three segments. A promising opening with an ambush for a cavalry over Cheyenne. It follows something that can only be described as a long boring middle section, with completely unsuccessful Candice Bergen and "Soldier Blue" traveling together to achieve the security of the army garrison. Miss Bergen spits out the wrong four-letter words every time she opens her mouth, and it looks like she just came out of Jack Nicholson's movie from the seventies. I mean, it keeps zero interest, with zero credibility. The third and final part concerns the completely free slaughter of the Indian village. This is of course so exaggerated to put on anti-war propaganda, that it is simply long, scandalous and invented. Do not recommend. - MERK ................................ Jacobe (comment above) Here's the idea. Why do not you actually watch the film you're commenting on, instead of tweaking your liberal nonsense. This is not a political party, it is a review of films. - MERK
