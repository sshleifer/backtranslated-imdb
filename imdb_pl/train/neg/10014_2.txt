I saw this movie on the drive-in in 1959. Up to "Howard the Duck" I thought it was the worst movie I've ever seen. This movie tried to combine all kinds into one; comedy, horror, teenage fear and a hot rod that had to be "My mother, the car". Maybe he deserves a second look to see if it's an accurate reflection of his time.
