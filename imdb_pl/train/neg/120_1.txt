When I saw this movie for the first time, I quickly noticed the actress who played the role of Lucille Ball. Lucy's portrait at Rachel York is absolutely horrible. Lucille Ball was an amazing comedian with an amazing talent. Thinking about a legend like Lucille Ball, which is presented in the film, is terrifying. I can not believe all the actresses in the world who can play much better Lucy, the producers decided on Rachel York. She may be a good actress in other roles, but playing the role of Lucille Ball is difficult. It is difficult to find someone who could be like Lucille Ball, but at least he can find someone similar in appearance and talent. If you've noticed the portrait of Lucy in York in the episodes of I Love Lucy, such as the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar - its expression, voice or movement. <br /> <br /> In addition, Danny Pino who plays Desi Arnaz is terrible. Pino is not eligible to play as Ricky. He is small and thin, his accent is unreal and once again his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. <br /> <br /> In general, very horrible casting and history are badly told. If people want to understand the real situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest you look at the biography of A & E Lucy and Desi, read the book itself Lucille Ball or American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see docudrama, "Before laughter" would be a better choice. The cast of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in "Before the Laughter" is much better than that. At least a similar aspect is shown than nothing.
