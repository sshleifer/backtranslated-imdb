I usually like zombie movies, but this one was just bad. <br /> <br /> Good parts: girl swimming in topless with thongs, topless Sonya Salomaa and tits Ona Grauer fluttering on the skimpy top as she ran. <br /> <br /> The bad part: too many video cuts, too much slow-motion Matrix (drags on the action), too little blood and guts, bad acting and no history. The only person in the theater was smart and left just after the topless swimming scene. Total loss of $ 6 and time. I give him 2 out of 10.
