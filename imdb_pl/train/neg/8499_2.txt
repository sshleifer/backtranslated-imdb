This is something that just now is captivating movie eggs. In the end, Feierstein's Flex Crush will make you know that Real Men are not watching anything from Truffaut. <br /> <br /> It would be interesting if Truffaut had something to say - here. The motif of the camera as a voyeur was nothing new. Have we all forgotten about "Deice Bike Thieves"? Or anything from Hitchcock? <br /> <br /> So all we get is a prolonged metaphor of a juvenile as Truffaut, who spends all his free time on "spanking" in films that destroys school discipline, is accused of plagiarism (many petty thefts) and ultimately eludes social restrictions to create "your own film". I'm sorry ... I was there, I did it too many times to make it matter.
