There is high expectation when you sit down to watch a comedy starring Cary Grant, Jayne Mansfield, Ray Walston and Werner Klempere. These expectations are even greater when the film is directed by Stanley Donen, whose comic accent was so visible, among others, in DAMN YANKEES !, BEDAZZLED and CHARADE. For the first five minutes it seems that these expectations can be met and then ?? Nothing. What is supposed to be a light comedy is plunged into lead, heavy melodrama, and there is no giggle. <br /> <br /> The relative newcomer Suzy Parker has often been criticized for his performance or lack of one in this film, but in a film in which even the great Cary Grant often appears flat and wooden, attacking Parker seems unfair. Even such a bright light as Audrey Hepburn or Doris Day could not change the fate of this meandering, grim and completely meaningless script that stretches behind and draws the spectator's interest and patience behind it. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast, especially Ray Walston, is still trying to breathe life a bit, but the horrible scenario goes beyond resuscitation. A desperate, inept attempt to drag a bold laugh from a numbed audience in the last moments of the movie only serves to add an insult to the injury. <br /> <br /> This movie is just a big disappointment at all levels.
