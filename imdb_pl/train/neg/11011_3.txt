A series of painfully unpleasant skits that seem to last forever and one day. Not as terribly unpleasant as saying "Freddy Got Fingered" or "Lost Reality", but in NO way it is not support in ANY way, sense or form. It contains the worst rhymed clown in history. Most if it is not offensive to anyone, but the most prudish or politically correct. He also has the worst parody of the song you've ever made in the film, the worst personification of Arnold EVER (not only the worst film, literally the worst EVER). I have no idea why Karen Black, Micheal Clarke Duncan or Slash would play (the reasons I watched it first). The only thing that was fun was Dickman. To sum up, I do not recommend this movie to anyone, but people who make it his mission in life to get it downstairs at 250 on this site are pathetic. Do something remarkable with you, live people. Plus, if it's true, the Researcher's Church hates him, he can not be ANYTHING wrong. <br /> <br /> My degree: D
