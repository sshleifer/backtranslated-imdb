The "Screaming Skull" opens with a warning and offer of free funeral services if you should die watching it - Now there is a hook! The story itself has quite an interesting assumption for a horrifying horror: an intriguing husband marries a wealthy woman with a history of mental illness, and then tries to convince her that she is crazy about the penetrating noises, the mysterious knocking and skulls that appear in bad times. Add to the formula a terrifying enough gardener who still cherishes the memory of the first wife of the man he was devoted to. Perhaps this is because the 1950s did not have the technology that would allow them to break away from the scary scenes needed to make this film, the techniques used here seem elaborate and mundane. But then, when I saw "House on Haunted Hill" for the first time as a nine-year-old, it gave me heebie jeebies in the same way I'm sure this movie did for young viewers of the same era. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, the movie is not scary, sometimes it seems to be cumbersome. But in the huge but unfurnished house of Whitlock there is great atmospheric tension, and the gardens and swimming pool are a nice touch. For me, the best-performing scene includes Eric Whitlock (John Hudson), who is crazy at the pond, trying to recover the hidden skull, simply wading straight into clothes and everything in a shapely contrast with a mentally disabled gardener (director Alex Nicol in a double role). It makes you wonder who the real fool was. <br /> <br /> In your own good way, maybe the most shocking thing in the movie: what about this neat roadster that Whitlock first appeared in - the gulls in the door in 1958! That at least made me jump right out!
