There is no doubt who is in charge of cadet training in this movie: Major Chick Davis (Pat O'Brien). O'Brien plays an officer who adheres to military discipline in creating a new kind of soldier from his cadets - a bombardier. But it is not so stiff as to be unjust or unfriendly. In fact, it even changes its opinion on the value of women working in the army. It is difficult when it has to be, but sometimes it is a clear combination of the trainer and the pastor, and the roles he has perfected in other films. His character is the basis of action around which everything revolves. O'Brien seems to be natural in this role and plays it well. Two things help this film: O'Brien's performance and spectacular special effects.
