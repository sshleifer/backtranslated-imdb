I remember the title so well. For me, it was a film by Flory Robson with Olivier and Vivien Leigh in supporting roles. And he had Vincent Massey's voice from behind his mustache. Well, Flora Robson was great. Her next signature will be "55 days in Beijing" for me. The same role, but with various sumptuous dresses. And the same voice. As for Armada, it was a subtext. I like black and white movies. Was everything done during Elizbeth's time at night? Sometimes it was talkative and difficult to understand. I could not say what was the interest in love. Was it a Spaniard or Vivien Leigh? And I do not believe that El≈ºbieta I would be a genius strategist who would recommend sending ships against Armada. Apparently it worked for the Empire, but not for the script. It could have been more accurate, historically, but Bette Davis had more engaging scenarios. And I missed the daylight!
