Look, it's the third one, so you know it's bad. And "Maniac Cop" was not good enough to guarantee a second installment, so you know it's even worse. But how much worse? Horrible, approaching God terrible. <br /> <br /> When Maniac Cop begins to go crazy, the reporter says: "What happened here can ONLY be described as a black rainbow of death. /> 1-- Rainbows are not black and can never be. 2- Rainbows are harmless and can never cause pain or death. 3-- A news reporter, one valuable for his agency, can find a different way of describing the consequences of deadly madness. The "black screen of death" is not ONLY a way to describe a given situation. <br /> <br /> This is it.
