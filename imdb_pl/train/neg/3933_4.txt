A huge hit after the release with the Australian audience can still be fun, but his incorrigible political incorrectness and dumb, non-subtle humor can make it a bit strange. It takes far too long; some of the <br /> <br /> content could be saved for follow-up, Barry McKenzie Holds His Own, who desperately needed new things. It is true that his Aussie attitude in Aock is fun but annoying when the film stretches. Some say that Crocker's songs are the best songs, and they are certainly original, but "fun"? Barry McKenzie's adventures will be a turning point in Australian cinema, but we should do our best to ensure that foreign audiences do not see most Australians as Barry McKenzies (or in this case Micka Dundees!). Rating: 5/10
