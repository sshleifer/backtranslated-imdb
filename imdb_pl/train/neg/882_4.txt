There is a reason why it went straight to the movie - the story is distasteful, Nick Cage plays Johnny in a sordid way - sex in churches, and other scenes bordering on taste (like a scene in the laundry) destroy this movie. Judge Reinhold as a cuckold is okay - but the film itself is not well done with themes of degradation and vengeance. But it's a good movie for contests with curiosities - because so few people have seen it.
