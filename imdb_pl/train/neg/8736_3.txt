The film had a good idea, but the performance simply did not meet it. <br /> <br /> What is this concept? Well, historically speaking, this "Dirty Harry" meets "M". The child's killer began to terrorize the city. The main detectives (Dennis Hopper and Frederic Forest) have never dealt with a serial killer before. The mayor and police chief, in desperation, secretly rent a local mafia to speed up ... to go to places and do things that the police would not be able to end this mess as quickly as possible. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this movie really has some good things to offer. <br /> <br /> In addition to the concept, I liked the look of the killer's hideout. Norman Bates has a basement. This guy has an amazing channel. In some shots, light reflects from the water and creates waving reflections on the walls; often giving these scenes a frightening quality. <br /> <br /> Also acting was good. Dennis Hopper is one of those actors who get better with age. <br /> <br /> However, after it has passed, it becomes more or less bent. <br /> <br /> The movie is too fast. The actual investigative process of both teams seems very violent, in contrast to the complexities and fascinations. This could be fixed in two ways: either make the movie longer, or cut out some of the many threads. Each of these things would allow the crew to spend more time on the real secret. <br /> <br /> An example of bad is one of the key tips that helps them find the right suspect. This: at some point in his life, the suspect went to the pet shop ... That's right ... I'm completely serious here. It's like going from point A (first tip) to point Z (suspect) and skipping all the steps "between". <br /> <br /> Then there are the characters. The only thing I liked was the two pockets you meet in the middle of the movie. Considering that these are small characters, I would call it a bad sign. <br /> <br /> Finally there is an angle of mobs. This is what pisses me the most, because that's why I went down three dollars to buy a DVD. I mean, what a hook! Over the past 10-15 years there has been an absolute surplus of serial killers films. The mob's angle was a grip that He could help him rise above the rest ... but he did not. <br /> <br /> I thought gangsters' methods would be brutal but also fun and exciting; a bit like a movie of guards or something like that ... maybe even throw some elements of the movie heist. In the end, we're talking about criminals. Instead, we get one of the most repulsive heroes involved in celluloid. Detectives question witnesses. What does the mob do? They interrogate and kill them. It's not even that these witnesses are really even that bad. I think criminals are less sympathetic than the killer they hunt. <br /> <br /> Unless the good points I mentioned are enough to interest you, I would say that I miss it. Maybe one day they will re-use the same idea and do it LAW. I hope. I hate to see how such a good idea is wasted.
