It is a film that tries to tell the story of Thailand, set in the ancient city of Ayutthaya. I decided to watch this movie because I thought it was compatible with many films from Thailand, which I watched and liked, such in which Thai actors speak Thai madness and martial arts. Well, that's none of it. This film is made entirely in English, is full of Anglo actors and has such terrible production values ​​that it is ridiculously bad ... but not funny! Who can we blame for this trash? Acting, dialogue and most of the sets were very bad. Some battle scenes looked like they were choreographed at a local drama club. The special effects were also mostly bad, but a few of them were just a cheap animation imposed on the screen, which provided a particularly tacky effect. It has one big epic outdoor battle scene in which several thousand additions can run through the field in a costume, but when we see that two armies collide in battle - HA! What a joke! There are several beauties in the film. It is a pity they did not show more skin. At least it would be something that the guys would appreciate. Do not worry.
