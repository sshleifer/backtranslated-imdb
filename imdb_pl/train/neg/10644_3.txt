Well, here's another movie that reverses the role. There were many worth seeing, despite the tired plot of the sex reversal. However, this one is not. In previous reviews, I think I have raised the issue of the overall decline in satisfaction with Haim's films that followed the late 1980s. It's one of them. <br /> <br /> "Just One of the Girls" talks about high school (Corey Haim), who tries to avoid his pursuers by dressing up as a girl and attending another school. He joins the cheerleading team and befriends another cheerleader, Marie (Nicole Eggert). Of course, he can not keep up with the charade for too long. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was a complete shit and it was not even funny. But judging by most reviews, it looks like the fans of Alanis Morrisette or the teenage sex queen, Nicole Eggert, are the only ones who would like to see it. If you're looking for a good Haim feature (or role-changing comedy), look no further than in 1989. The point is that Haim's career sank.
