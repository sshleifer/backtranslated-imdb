I really hoped it would be a fun program considering all the noise and clever preview clips. And let's talk about the noise, I even heard an interview with the creator of the series on BBC World Today - a program broadcast all over the world. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this program does not even come close to delivery. All the jokes are obvious - those that sound funny for the first time, but then they seem bad - and do not receive any new surgeries or surprises. All characters are one-dimensional. Acting is - well - average (I'm nice). It's a classic CBC recipe - one that always fails. <br /> <br /> If you're a Muslim, I think you would have to be stupid to believe in any of the white characters, and if you're white, probably be offended by the fact that almost all white figures are portrayed as bigoterie, ignorant or both. It's not that joking with white people is a problem - most of the better comedies are rooted in it. It's just a problem when it's not funny - like in this program. <br /> <br /> Canada is full of funny people - so many that we regularly export them to Hollywood. So why the producers of this program could not find any?
