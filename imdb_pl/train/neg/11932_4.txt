Oliver Gruner is completely unknown to me. My friend showed me this movie because he saw Gruner, who called a pretty good science-fiction movie, Nemesis. So, when we watched it, we found ourselves in a fast movement through the BS drama parties just to get to the unbelievable sequences of actions. Gruner loves digging, digging and digging. And kick! haha <br /> <br /> Gruner's character is a graduate who is forced to stay in the ghetto close to the one in which he grew up. He thinks that he is watching over a boy who lives with him because he really wants to join in a Mexican gang that is constantly tormenting his family. Instead of joining, Gruner tells the boy to fight (against the gang, too crazy). Gruner plays the typical character of Van Damme, who kills everyone (or harms them pretty well) and tries to get rid of blocks from these gang members. <br /> <br /> The plot was very cheesy and easy to think about. Gruner is probably not very well known because of the choice of scenario, if this movie is to compare possible choices. This ghetto is a pure hell, and I liked the fact that a motley crew of heroes passes through them, as if they had a chance to face Gruner's character. The music was typical action music (striking pianos and boilers, swelling guitars), which actually was not as bad as I sounded. The director really needed action, instead of taking a break every 5 minutes for a tense family moment. <br /> <br /> I finally gave her 4/10, because I really tried to be an average action movie for Oliver Gruner, but the overall look of the movie makes you want to have more closures than what you just saw.
