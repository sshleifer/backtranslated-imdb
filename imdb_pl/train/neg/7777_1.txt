This can be a charming movie for children. My grandson watched him once. he was watching it a second time, watching it with him. <br /> <br /> When a little bear gets lost on the ice rink and he is in the water, he tries to get to a piece of ice saying, "Go back, stupid asshole." <br /> <br /> I do not want my 3-year-old grandson watching movies with words like this. <br /> <br /> That is why it is rated for children. He should be child-friendly. That's what I would expect. released by the warner brothers and G, I expect that there will be no cuss in it. Words do not even match the movie in most places, because it seems that they will be added later. And the film extends in many parts.
