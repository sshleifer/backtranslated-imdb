It's a badly made, bad remake of the classic Parineeta Bimaldy. The story is based on Sarat Chandra's book of the same title and is a distortion of the original. Well, you can appreciate a certain degree of creativity, but not seeming creativity. The influence on everyone is affected, and the whole movie is apparent. The choice of Shekar's words about the abuse of Lolita (Balan) sounds cheap and morbid and destroys the spirit of the original story. Again, the scene in which Shekhar (Saif) strikes Lolita, is out of place due to the movement of the film and the character, is quite shocking for the senses and could easily be avoided. Similarly, the sex scene between Saif and Balan is quite inappropriate for a movie and cheap gadget to attract the audience. When creative work is not faithful to the original and destroys its spirit, the work falls apart. The song "piyu bole" is quite OK. Another silver lining in the dark cloud of this movie is the scene in which Saif favors himself and rebels against his father. It is a positive departure from the original and deserves recognition. The movie deserves 3 stars on these numbers. Rekha's song and dance have an artificial character and are imposed. The song is melodious, but I remember that somewhere I heard it and if I am not mistaken, the melody seems to be plagiarism. <br /> <br /> Well, we agreed that times have changed from then until now. But this film is not even a reflection of modern times. <br /> <br /> This is happening when contemporary Bollywood filmmakers are more and more obsessed with the impressiveness of NRI and the capture of the lucrative NRI entertainment market. Such films do not go to India or any other part of the world.
