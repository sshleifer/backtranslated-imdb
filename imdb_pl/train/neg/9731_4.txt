Others have already commented on the "downfall" of director Tobe Hooper, but what about Brad Dourif? He was perfectly capable of choosing good projects (as he proved, appearing in the same year in "Exorcist III"), so why he agreed to perform in this project? Sure, it gives a dazzling performance and the film is not bad; it's simply uninvolved, uninteresting and unattractive. That's three "too many". (* 1/2)
