It seems to be one of those movies that we think we should like, but I did not do it. It seemed that he was trying too hard to be "artistic". Everything flash, no content. It has several beautiful scenes, and each of them is nice to watch, but pin them all together and it becomes a tedious task to just sit. I hired it because of great reviews on the video carton and the fact that I'm a big fan of Shakespeare, but I was very disappointed. I just found it a bit pretentious and sometimes boring.
