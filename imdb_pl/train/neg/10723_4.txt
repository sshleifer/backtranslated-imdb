The soul of the ancient mummy is transferred to one of his followers so that he can punish all those involved in desecrating his grave. Moving the soul makes the young man get older at a great pace until he looks like a mummy. In turn, the blood is removed from those who participate in the excavations. <br /> <br /> To be as short as possible, the Pharaoh's Curse is a fairly vague matter. While the movie presents some good, original ideas (mummy sucking blood, soul transfer, interesting makeup effects, arm ripping scene, etc.) And a few atmospheric moments, direction and tempo are the definition of plodding. To make matters worse, the first 15 relatively short 66-minute films consist only of the padding. I usually go to these moving mummy movies, but Pharaoh's Curse checks even my patients. The staff helps very little. With one exception (Ziva Rodann is the only bright spot I would like the film to focus more on its mysterious character), the cast is as boring as the script. In the end, I do not know whose idea it was to put a servant looking like a mother in pajamas, but it's a ridiculous, funny look at a creature that is supposed to arouse fear in the audience. <br /> <br /> Despite my mostly negative comments about the Pharaoh's Curse, I will rate it on 4/10. This is not a good grade, but generous, taking into account all the problems I have with the film.
