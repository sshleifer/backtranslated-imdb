I once used the name of Wesley Snipes as a clue to go ahead and watch a new, untried movie in which she appears. So now, for the first time, my Snipes recommendation method has failed. Completely. First, I should come here to see these reviews. <br /> <br /> The scraps should be ashamed if they allow their sincere efforts to be so wasted in The Contractor. <br /> <br /> One of my worst fears has moved to bitter fruit. I was afraid that the shaky, indistinct, pseudo-documentary, "thoughtless" style of directing and editing (for the first time returned to my attention by "Bloody Sunday" directed by Paul Greengrass) can spread to other films. The disgusting style of Greengass was then triggered by nauseating new heights in the last two films of the Bourne trilogy. My fear has come true. In my opinion, these films are very bad thanks to these methods that cause motion sickness, which causes a mistake in smudging to "improve the action". But "Bourne Franchise," as Greengrass loves, he calls his cash cow, apparently convinced others in Hollywood to go unprofessional in search of fast, big money. <br /> <br /> Read my lips, you Hollywood. Activities must be clearly photographed and presented, not only suggested by weak, lazy cinematographic techniques. <br /> <br /> And the "performer" goes so far as to imitate "The Bourne Ultimatum" in intangible repetitions of sound, in the hope that their juvenile (seemingly judged) viewers can not sense them. For example, if I hear the sound of the Yankee-Romeo radio again, I will just scream. Chances are good I will not hear it again: I will definitely never see "The Contractor" again. <br /> <br /> I recommend those who have not seen "The Contractor" yet: just be content with the quietness that this lack gives your life. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10; I am tempted to lower it to 1.
