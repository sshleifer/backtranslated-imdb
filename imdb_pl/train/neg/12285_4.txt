The plot is absurd and bad, also sucking on performances and dialogue, it is difficult to open your eyes. I advise you to have a friend with caffeine on hand to wake you up for a few Gore effects. Why bring Alcatraz? In this case, it becomes more and more difficult to swallow. All the time I was wondering who this movie was meant for? Wedge full of frail threads (such as US Army Captain Cannibalism) This is low quality in every aspect.
