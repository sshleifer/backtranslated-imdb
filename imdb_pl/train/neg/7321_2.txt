Perhaps not my genre, but the story was awful, as did Nancy Allen and Linda Farentino. C. Thomas also seemed uncomfortable as a seducer here (while on marijuana? Why should this be taken into account? This weakened plot greatly). Also the Farentina charac. it would be better if she had more respect for the relationship. Will the movie try to say? little.
