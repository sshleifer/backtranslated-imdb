Already in 1967, a director had no idea about the galaxy, distant or close. He tried to finish the movie with the title THX, etc. This shortcut is a regenerated story of a George. I am sorry that she has only the cuteness to defend. It's only an advertising promotion for the director, actors and others. aluminum. It has little internal artistic value. This is a brochure. George's lead is very good, as is Leia's character and Darth's character. Everything else is just a commercial slag. What a loss. Even so, the task was done. The rest of the movie is simply treading water to kill time, I think. only brochure.
