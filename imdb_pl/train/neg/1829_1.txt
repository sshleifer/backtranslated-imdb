Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! I can not stand Ben Ben any more. How this man can still make movies is beyond me. I do not understand how it happens when I performed at work in the way it plays in a movie. I was fired and I am the owner of the company .... MR GOD! This movie was an ordinary, steaming, smelly POO stack that, if possible, must be evaporated. I have to say something else that the guideline regarding the 10 lines of text in the commentary is idiotic. What's wrong with saying a few things about the movie? I will never understand why pages will require a short novel written when sometimes a short comment is enough.
