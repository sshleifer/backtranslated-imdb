This movie is something like a sequel to "White zombie" because it was created by the same man (Halperin) and contains zombies. Halperin, George A. Romero from those times, however, fails to meet this condition. <br /> <br /> We have a man who can control the minds of people in Cambodia and seek to destroy the source of his power, so zombies can be sent for free. Also, interest in love for the evil man. <br /> <br /> Where this movie really stands out in the pictures. Cambodian temples and dancers are very nice, and the zombies look very powerful. Unfortunately, we do not see many zombies in action, and the love story seems to play a much larger role in horror (although this is an important reason for the story later). <br /> <br /> I would like to see some of the zombie from the thirties attacking a defenseless urban group, but this movie simply did not bring. And no strong black character (like Bela Lugosi) waited for the fight with our heroes. And the use of Lugosi's eyes? Nice effect, but confusing, because it is never in the movie ... why not recreate it with the eyes of a new actor? In general, a movie that could be a great movie with a small script that could be reworked and which could someday become a powerful remake (especially if they keep it in the same post-war period). Heck, if they can fix The Hills Have Eyes, this movie hopes.
