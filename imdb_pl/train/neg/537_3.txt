I went to see "The Evening" because of the cast. For this reason, I went to see "Norman's Room" - this movie features Diane Keaton, Leonardo De Caprio, and also Meryl Streep - and loved every minute of it. The same applies to "The Notebook", even though it was chick-flit lite. And my feelings were that everything offered by Vanessa Redgrave, Meryl Streep, Patrick Wilson and Glenn Close would be at least as good. It turned out that sometimes even the greatest actors can not overcome the banal, simplified and - at one time - truly offensive materials. <br /> <br /> Now I had no problem with the way the movie was constructed. In fact, I like movies that intersect in time and tell a story ... as long as one epoch lights the other and imitates a poem. But while Vanessa's character was on her deathbed and remembered a past event she considered a "mistake", it was riveting, sometimes the part showing what a "mistake from the past" was, doing nothing to explain the matter. In fact, it makes it seem pointless in the most stupid fashion "girl meets a boy, girl gets a boy, girl loses a boy" and in the most incredible, stereotypical, bad way possible. <br /> <br /> And from Oto spoilers, so keep that in mind if you keep reading. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, Claire Danes was brutally disregarded. Not only does she not even begin to resemble Vanessa Redgrave as a young woman, but she is not around when it comes to acting. Do not get me wrong, it can be good in the right role - just not in this one. And Patrick Wilson was unsuccessful, although he has actresses to almost draw him away. He would be better suited to the role Hugh Dancy played - the rich were confused by WASP - and he was not the object of sexual attraction to one and all; there is a bit too WASP for this. Hugh Dancy? One remark - "I am a tortured drunkard and I am waiting for you to find out why." And "why" (I am a case of wardrobe in a world sexually repressed, so I have to drink with excess and make a fool of myself before everyone I know) was so offensive to me and the way he died (as you knew it would be, because it was the only thing that could happen to the pedal in the fifties), so absurd, misdirected and inappropriate, I almost threw the candy on the screen. <br /> <br /> Regarding the modern part between Toni Collette and her sister, her fear of involvement, jealousy about her sister's "perfect life", her sister wondering if she made the right choices, her pregnancy and her too-good boyfriend (which could be more interesting and meaningful if Patrick Wilson played it, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach could be more interesting Harris, considering his sleepy eyes) - all this was broken in the 70's and 80's. And for a much deeper depth. Do we REALLY need to present it again and everything as if it were fresh and important? <br /> <br /> And in addition, Meryl Streep does not even appear in the last ten minutes of the film, everything in the makeup of an elderly lady who hides many facial expressions. It's still good, but only because it's Meryl, and Meryl can find a way to get rid of even the stupidest dialogue under the strongest make-up. <br /> <br /> So, to put it simply, this movie has all the stereotypes in a movie book "really meaningful", and adds a few that really did not have any interest to be crossed again. After two hours and the music "Lifetime Movie-of-the-week", which guarantees you a raw sound, it is a complete failure in both "significant" and "film" aspects. I give it "3" only because of Meryl and Vanessa. <br /> <br /> Now, if all you need from your movies is twadd le, then please set my comments on "Evening" aside and have the time of your life. But if you want real-life people to be served by great actors and filmmakers who know what to do with a simple story of life and death and all the nonsense it brings, rent "Norman's Room" and find out what really is a great game.
