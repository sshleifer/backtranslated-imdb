If you care about the true story of the early Baroque painter Artemisia Gentileschi, you will be disappointed - but if you're looking for a sensibly made artifact with a motive, you've found a movie. <br /> <br /> This film is such a fundamentally inaccurate representation of the life of Artemisia Gentileschi that he almost made me cry. (Enter the inaccuracies of Artemisia in Google and check out some of the facts in comparison with fictitious articles). From a purely technical point of view, the film was fine: sets, costumes, and especially chiaroscuro lighting helped create an engaging 17th century; although the above-mentioned inadequacies regarding GLARING failed him a bit. <br /> <br /> I wonder how the director / co-author Agn√®s Merlet defended her film then? Perhaps she refused to present Artemis as a victim, which would be unfortunate, because let's face it, she was.
