The film is a collection of clich√©s about almost everything. There is no focus, no goals, no real message. Symbolism is pushed up and stereotypes are abundant and outrageous. This film can not resist the temptation to create a drama where it does not exist. Every little exchange of words immediately turns into a long, unjustified dialogue, so typical of an actor's attempt. Where this exchange does not make sense, the actors (no matter how good they are normally) can not help but compensate for this with exaggerated emotions, also known as "raising rates". Over acting, simply speaking. Directing here does not help. Nothing can save this non-narrative. It is forced, faked and boring to tears. Inaccuracies in the portlanding of punk rock with The Who, piercings and flashy costumes of the 90s. Characters wander without a role, detail and motive. Locations are optional. To Boogie Nights cum The Good Fellas cum Saturday night fever, with torn meaning and art. <br /> <br /> Good DP. I will give it. <br /> <br /> Some movies have disadvantages. This movie is Lee's fault. He sold out like the rest. It did not matter. There is nothing interesting to say. <br /> <br /> I do not want to see anything more from this guy (which I will refrain from naming from now on).
