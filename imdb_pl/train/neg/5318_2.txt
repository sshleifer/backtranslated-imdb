Well, I had to be generous and give it 2. This was mainly due to the free holes in this woman's shirt, where her breasts are. I found it a bit funny. Besides, this movie does nothing more than a few good laughs with a friend. It's funny if you want to comment on a "mysterious science theater" but it's not better than the 2nd and the 2nd sucks.
