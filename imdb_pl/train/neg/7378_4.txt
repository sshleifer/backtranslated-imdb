Steven buddy, remember when you said it: <br /> <br /> "Try to find the path of least resistance and use it without hurting others. Live honestly and morally, not only with people, but with all beings. " <br /> <br /> you did not do it, you hurt your fans and their morality with these "movies", I would not even bother if I did not know that you are much better than me, I saw movies with your teachings, you are about much better than why why brother why ... <br /> <br /> productions steamed steal I promise my brother that I'm not afraid I'll tell you the truth on your face so that we can fix it. <br /> <br /> Well, as some fell asleep 90%, but to be honest, I was tired and had a big meal just an hour before Sensai's hand, what are you doing. 12 million? really? do you have any idea what we could do with $ 12,000,000 It could have been in theaters and hit the blockbuster, if you wanted, we could transfer money from a huge homeless shelter gain or something like that. These post-production people are upsetting you, choreography does not exist, we can make a better man, blinking eyes come from men in the black film, I expected that the blacksmith will appear, or tommy lee Jones will say that this gills no eyelid. <br /> <br /> Seagal, you are a master of Aikido, why are you doing it for yourself, for us? when you appeared on stage, you had such a fresh, direct style and it was obvious that you were a teacher because the way your movements were so clear and sharp, watching the first three movies, I felt like you were teaching me something, now you feel that you are simply cheated or something that I feel I must save you, this time you have been killed, and I will go and take revenge for you, helping you create the best movie ever. bro I know who you really are, I know the truth about Nico's film. let's talk. <br /> <br /> contact me man I have some fresh ideas I'm a rivet collector, I swear you will not be disappointed with my attention to detail and we will do it for fans of fans, your fans deserve better, we stick to, but a strand it's already falling apart. I swear I will not let your movie get out of this single error, I'm still trying to find out if it was the worst dubbing or you have laryngitis, but I promise I can make a better impression from your voice than lame **** that does not even he tried. I hope you kicked it nuts as payment. I can come up with a story and a story that can be matched to your revenge on the death of your student / daughter / wife / dog / house niche and I promise you that we will bring you back, I promise, I also want to go in a direction that makes people they think if you let me in, I promise to make a movie that people will leave and they will have to talk about it, seriously provocative, changing their perception. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal This is my official written permission to share my contact details with IMDb in order to resurrect one of the best martial arts heroes I have ever seen, because he is not an Italian, he is Irish and a Jew, so You call it bad, acting, I call it a great game, because you believed for 20 years that Seagal is Italian :) a bit changing your perception.
