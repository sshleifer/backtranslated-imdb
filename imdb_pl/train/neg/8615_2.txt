This movie was so bad, outdated and stupid that I had tough times to watch it to the end. I saw this Rodney at Natural Born Killers and thought it was funny as hell, but this movie was nonsense. "Jokes" were not funny, the actors were not funny, nothing was funny. Do not waste time on it! The only positive things were beautiful wives :) and Molly Shannon, who certainly tried her best, but the script was too horrible. That's why I rated it on "2" instead of "1", but it's definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
