This movie was so predictable that all the time you hope that the obvious suspect is innocent, and there is another big turn. However, no. He just still works terrifyingly, and she still ignores him. Mary found very weighty evidence in his place, and she still trusted him? And what was the "bait for the trap"? There was no trap. She faced him, he said, "I'm sorry. I need to kill someone. " He left and it was the end. They try to use other suspects (such as this one older carnival girl at the end), but they are completely underdeveloped. Actually, all characters are poorly developed. They have no depth, and the environment is just weird ... who is hanging in a recycling plant? His agitated and nothing is well developed. For example: when he leaves a beer after drinking a beer, and he finds the photos, and she runs away, and he catches her and ends up having sex in this car ... what was it? Her reactions were not presented. She was frightened in the car, as if it might be rape - but then we only see her shower the next morning. booooooooo It could have been much better ... sooo much better.
