This film is about a young scientist who creates a serum that revives the dead. For the first time he uses it on his brother when he is shot on the way through. His brother then infects other gang members. In some scenes, you can see that the zombies walk very slowly, and in other scenes run quite fast, which makes no sense. Acting is mediocre, but history does not help the movie. Make-up consists of blood on the face of a zombie. The budget of this film was definitely very limited. I believe that the movie could be better if the story was more original and had a better budget. If you do not want to see a good zombie, do not see it.
