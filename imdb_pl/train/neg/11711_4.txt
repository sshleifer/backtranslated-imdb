A good movie with a beautiful, leading lady, but a terrible leader. Stephan Jenkins, who plays her husband, is a really bad actor. Joyce Hyser, on the other hand, is the saving grace of the film. He is the group's best actor. <br /> <br /> NOTE * the first comment that praised the video (and, according to his IMDB.com account, he wrote only ONE Review - and guess what movie?) is of course a plant. While the film is nicely filmed, it is neither subtle nor magnificent, nor any other hypobolic descriptions used by the reviewer. <br /> <br /> "Art of Revenge" is an honest film, but it is a big annoyance. It offers all possible sexual situations, but never goes through them. Just like watching Skin Flick on Cinemax, but all the "naughty pieces" are edited. <br /> <br /> The film as a whole is a bit out of focus, and the end, and most of the third act, is really a big mess. Of course there is an ending, because every movie today considers it necessary to end the action. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 <br /> <br />
