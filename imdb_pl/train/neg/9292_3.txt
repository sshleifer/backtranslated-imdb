First of all, I also expected another Hero - a fantastic work of art for the action genre. I only saw fragments of the hidden dragon tiger, but I can imagine it is better than HoFD. <br /> <br /> The basic elements of Hero can be found in HoFD: Great landscapes, mesmerizing photos and honest acting. I mean, if you can not understand words that speak without subtitles, but you still care - it's a good thing ) <br /> <br /> What went wrong? What begins with political intrigue enters the love story. What is worse, it is a love triangle in the style of a soap opera. You have three characters who, I think, fall in love with each other - without good reason. This film basically falls apart after escaping from prison (I fell asleep about forty minutes). It's almost as if they were changing the writers at the moment. The rest of the movie is about how the character is "like the wind". Ick. In addition, you must really suspend your disbelief to believe in the elements of the action. This is not unique to this genre, but because the story is weak, you can not wait for the action, and then when the fight breaks out, it really was not that good. The beginning catches you, but then the gas will end in this movie.
