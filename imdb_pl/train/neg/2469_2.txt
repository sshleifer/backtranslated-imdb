I suppose if you like an endless dialogue that does not shift the story and the camera's impressive effects, such as the scene transitions in the _Angel_ TV show, you'll love the movie. Me? All I wanted was a pretty, tight little story that was not there. The pace was practically backward, the plot points were buried beneath the sea of ​​unnecessary dialogue, and there was absolutely no sense of fear, tension or EVERYTHING. Is this Wendigo? No, it's the speed operator. This is not terrible. It does not generate a single note of tension or atmosphere, unless you are afraid of MTV. Like previous reviewers, I noticed that at the end the movie evokes a mocking laughter from the audience. <br /> <br /> A horrible movie.
