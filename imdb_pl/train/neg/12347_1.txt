This is Ridley Scott's worst film. Ridley Scott is a great director. But this movie is a black mark in his career. Demi Moore and Viggo Mortensen, both completely inept in an overly aggressive film about a girl going to the army. Very stupid. And there's never one scene that's convincing in any way. It is really not difficult to create such a movie. Everything that the crew creates could be an idea for everyone. Writers also did not have much inspiration; many stupid dialogues that made no sense at all; and some thoughtless action. I definitely recommend staying away from this junk. I hope that many talented people involved in this project are aware of this type of film that does not deserve their attention, and in the future will work on more honorable and smarter films than this useless mess.
