I was clearly unhappy that this morning I watched the two worst films of 2004: first, the inconsistent CGI-controlled emptiness The Chronicles of Riddick, and then the embarrassing vanity project known as Greendale. One cost millions, and the other cost pennies, but both are bad. Really very bad. <br /> <br /> I should say in advance that I am not the biggest fan of Neil Young in the world, but he contributed to his participation in classic melodies: from Buffalo Springfield (whose best recordings were young compositions) to Rust Never Sleeps, Harvest and Mirror Ball, the man wrote some really great songs. Unfortunately, Greendale does not have great songs and a few good ones, and the film around which they are built is truly embarrassing and simplified by the political slogan. Completely without merit as an art and not impressive as a polemic, Greendale is best to forget. Buy a book if you feel obligated to contribute to Young's bank account.
