Definitely one of Eddie Murphy's smaller films about a funny man is the nonsense of a kidnapped mystical child, three hundred year old dragons and "Chosen One". <br /> <br /> Murphy is "Chosen One" and the opening song suggests that he is "the best man in the world". The discoverer of missing and missing children is approached by a mysterious Tibetan woman (Charlotte Lewis), who tells him that he is the "Chosen One" and that his destiny is to find and save the "Golden Child". If a child died, compassion would die with him because he is a carrier of compassion. <br /> <br /> If all this junk from the hocus temptation has not ruined it for you now, it will surely be the beginning of the movie. Suffice it to say that the plot is repulsive and destroys the whole movie. If you want to be the next vehicle for Murphy's egoistic genre of humor (the comedy is not too big for you), the movie fails on many levels. Even Charles Dance as a bad Sardo Numspa can not do much to do. Very stupid and disappointing. <br /> <br /> Sunday, December 12, 1993 - T.V.
