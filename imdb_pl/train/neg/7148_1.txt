Before watching this movie I had very low expectations and went to see the cars. In the end, I even regretted that I was driving for that reason. The plot almost does not exist. Character development does not exist. There were so many stereotypes and so many stunning flavors in the film that I could only stare and wonder how it was even released. If it were not for exoticism, I would not even rate this film as 1. The attempt of a coherent plot is destroyed by the very absurdity of this elite race of cult and the funny characters that make up its members. In fact, the plot of the film is so predictable and simple that the average child can predict the majority of the plot. Bad acting, bad plot, bad jokes, bad movie. <br /> <br /> Do not look Play Gran Turismo HD and satisfy your thirst for fast, sexy cars without leaving a bad aftertaste.
