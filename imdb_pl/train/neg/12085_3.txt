You really do not need to start this little review from the plot summary. I mean, Shakespeare's Hamlet for God's sake? probably one of the best-known pieces ever written. I am not ashamed to admit that I came to this version of Hamlet, like most people on IMDb? by Mystery Science Theater 3000. Although the show may not be the best place to judge a movie, in this case I can not imagine trying to watch it without comedic jokes. In a word, this German version of Hamlet created for television is grim. 152 minutes? No way! It's too dark and depressing to be anything I want to spend almost three hours. I've said it many times, but entertainment is for me. And this wrist is not funny. I will give you a few points for what I thought was quite good. 3/10 sounds good to me. <br /> <br /> Although I like MST3K, their comments do not help to make Hamlet more enjoyable. There are some good riffs here and there, but in general, Hamlet is just a bad movie for MST3K. Shakespeare is too talkative so that the comedy could have any rhythm or flow. Although it hurts me, I have to give Hamlet 1/5 on the MST3K scale.
