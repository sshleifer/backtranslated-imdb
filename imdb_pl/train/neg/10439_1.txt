I'd like to consider myself a fairly open guy and I need a lot (!) To dislike the movie, but this one is undoubtedly one of the worst, worst movies I've ever seen! > <br /> I have no idea what's wrong with people who have rated it so well (imdb is usually reliable when it comes to ratings) ... the only thing I can imagine is that people had to vote during one or more conditions: <br /> <br /> 1. While being shit / stoned 2. They received heavy cash for votes 3. Under fire <br /> <br /> I can not believe I've wasted a good 1 h 45 min of my life a pathetic excuse for a movie.
