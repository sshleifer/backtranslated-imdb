"Phantasm" from 1979 was a very atmospheric, frightening, frightening and very original horror, and in a word, a cult. The first part of 1988 was bloody, witty, action-packed and very funny. However, after the first follow-up, the creator of "Phantasm" Don Coscarelly apparently had no new ideas. "Phantasm III - Lord Of The Dead" from 1994 is certainly not a complete failure, it is even quite funny, but there is no more originality, and desperate attempts to introduce something new are sometimes tiring, which makes them quite disappointing compared to predecessors. <br /> <br /> - SPOILERS - <br /> <br /> Quite at the beginning we present the mystery of the mysterious sentinel spheres (brains sucking silver bullets) are unraveled. Since then, many unnecessary and annoying new characters (such as Tim, a small child in the style of "Home Alone", who is great at shooting, Rocky, hard and super cool black nunchaku with a crew crew) are familiarized. The film also has its advantages - Reggie Bannister is again very cool like a pony playing Reggie's guitar. Angus Scrimm is still quite scary as Tall Man, but the fact that Tall Man says a lot more in this movie makes him lose some of his horror. Mike's character is again played by Michael Baldwin (he was replaced by James LeGros in part 2), which I think is of little importance. Gore keeps the movie interesting enough to be watched, but it's still a disappointment, especially since trying to catch up on ideas quickly gets irritated. <br /> <br /> All things considered, "Phantasm III" is an acceptable time, but it is definitely disappointing compared to its predecessors. Fans of the first two films "Fantazji" can try, but I recommend not to set your expectations too high.
