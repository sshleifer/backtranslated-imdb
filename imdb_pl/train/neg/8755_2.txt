This movie was at least scary. I counted a lot better after seeing "High School Musical". The whole movie was a complete rip off of The Simple Life, but it was not a reality show. <br /> <br /> Acting was not good at all. Amanda Michalka had her moments when she was not so terrible. On the other hand, Alyson Michalka was angry all the way. Chris Gallinger, who played Amanda's amorous business, played a French guy, but he had a terrible accent. The good thing about this movie was the totally charming Michael Trevino who played Alyson in love. You just have to remember that if this movie were to be broadcast before "High School Musical" it probably would not seem so bad. But it was not a comparison. <br /> <br /> Generally, I give him 2.
