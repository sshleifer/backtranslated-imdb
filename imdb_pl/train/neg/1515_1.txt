I watched the movie "The Flock" because of the cast of Gere and the Danes, and the summary of the story sounded interesting. It was one of the WORST movies I've seen for a long time (and I've seen a few turkeys.) I've never written online before, but this movie was so horrible that I had to do it. I suppose the problems start with a script that was so amateurish and unbelievable. History does not make sense, and dialogue is so banal that it is nauseating. Poor Gere, she deserves a lot better. As for the Gere / Danes on the screen, because of the terrible writing, no character is believed for one minute. I bet Gere would like him to buy back a negative if it was possible. It is a pity that I wasted my talent so badly, not to mention that I would like to regain my 2 hours. (I know what you think. How do I really feel?)
