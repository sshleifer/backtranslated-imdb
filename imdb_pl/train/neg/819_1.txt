"The Domino Principle" is without a doubt one of the worst thrillers ever made. Almost any sense can not be made from an intricate plot and halfway you will want to raise your hands in frustration and shout "Poddaję się!" <br /> <br /> As Gene Hackman and director Stanley Kramer ever engaged in this mess, he must be summarized only by their payment. <br /> <br /> I hope they spent their money well.
