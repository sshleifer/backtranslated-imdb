First of all, let me say that the first 20 minutes are great, the monster looks great, and CGI is actually done. It is a pity that the rest of the movie is such a disappointment, <br /> <br /> ******** SPOILERS BELOW ******** <br /> <br /> From the opening scene, which we see it is anti-American, usually these kinds of stereotypes would not bother me (we, the British, got enough from Hollywood), but here it is not subtle to make Americans dead morons. He goes beyond the limits of realism, and your left wonders if Yank raped the director's mother. <br /> <br /> The scene of mourning was really weak, and part of the movie in which it starts to fall. <br /> <br /> Here we present the Olympic medalist aunt and drunk uncle who enter the monument and start blaming father for daughters death and then hitting him before everyone starts to roll on the floor crying. It's hard to realistic tying during a crisis! <br /> <br /> All additional virus is ridiculous. If Americans know that there is no virus, why do they waste time, money and resources on research? An American government agent orders the unfaithful Korean to drill the brain, making Americans evil (or stupid), but it did not help him that this guy was squinting at the comic effect. <br /> <br /> The movie tells about the hunt for a monster. US and Korean special forces are tasked with finding a creature, despite being invisible throughout the film. The only people hunting for a monster all over Korea is the main family and some random hobo that appears at the end to save the day! Of course, several US / Korean agents are trying to stop them along the way. <br /> <br /> The sister was included only in the movie so that she could make a valid shot at the end. It was trivial, you knew it would happen, but to make it worse, you would not tease this part! and my last irritation, how the hell did this kid survive at the end? the monster swam with his head under water for about 5 minutes! why the monster did not eat the children?
