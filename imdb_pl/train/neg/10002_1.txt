I apologize to everyone, I know it's supposed to be a movie of art, but wow, they should have been giving away weapons at the show so that people could blow them up and not see them. Although the set design and direction were excellent, this story is too painful to watch. The lack of soundtrack was brutal. Long shots were too long. How long can you watch two people sitting and talking? Especially when dialogue concerns two complaining people. I really had a hard time going through this movie. The performances were great, but how much of this dark, dreary, boring thing can be done? The only thing I liked was Maureen Stapleton and her red dress and dance scene. Otherwise it was Bergman's rip off. And I'm not his fan. I think that everyone who says he liked the hour and a half, is ... well, he's lying.
