One of the previous reviewers called this film "pure visual joy". I wonder if he saw the same movie as me. "High Art" had to have the most ruthless depressing interiors from "Seven". You can almost forgive Sheeda and Mitchell for the stereotype of going to a B & B for the first time. Of course, before they do, you have to watch opium events hosted by people who apparently are not employed, but can somehow support a flourishing drug. Not to mention the icy looks of these famous types of movies, Girlfriend / Boyfriend At Start, who know well that they will be kicked out in about 100 minutes. The film also states that Sheeda's character has gone from professional photography for ten years. What did she do when she retired at the age of twenty?
