This film is so bad and gets worse in every way possible. It's not just about weak acting and the script, or about bad and perverse time wasted watching. What really puts this film in my hall of shame is the seeming struggle writers and producers make with the film to try and entertain. Actress replacing the descendant of Jean Reno is old and learned the lesson in the first film, so she adds a new girl who is supposed to be a wife. Almost all the original accessories and gags come back this time, however, that I want to take my eyes out of the nests, because it is a waste of a perfectly good movie. Torture of continuous camera cuts and shots in every scene in this movie can lead the viewer to violent shocks. This second film takes the successful original and takes it out of the coffin and parades the body on the public square and perversely degrades not only the original idea and its heritage, but also our intelligence. This film, unlike the spruce geese, could not fly because it did not have a story in the books returning for the "necklace". No script because it apparently was written and added daily. Do not pay attention to the camera or shots. Poor lighting and special effects have been done for this purpose. This film will not even go to the student film in the basic movie 101. How this stack has passed, no one can say. It was a big investment that lost and it seems that no one had the strength to throw away this unnatural cruel mistake of our misery. This movie has one good part ... its END! This movie is my worst movie of all time, in the end "Howard The Duck" is no longer a goose.
