When a small globe of cosmic stupid mass lands on the ground, it soon begins to eat Earthlings and gain weight. The only part of this senseless nonsense that I enjoyed was all the cool classic cars. This dog had so many holes that it could be cut and sold for Swiss cheese. This thing did $ 20 million? And McQueen's salary was 3 thousand. Everyone was very overpaid. The "monster" looked like a large bag of beans, and the "teenagers" looked like they could have children approaching the age of teenagers. And those explosions from the shotgun; it sounded like a pellet rifle with a silencer. The ending was pitifully banal; of course, the producers left the door open for the sequel .... and there were many of them. Thumbs down.
