Raising the victory of Vargas is simply a bad movie. No amount of denial or ad-dollar has supported advertising with the change of this sad fact. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Peter Sollett saw that he did not have the money to make the movie he wanted to do, and decided to do it easy by making a bad movie that cynically apostatizes the current "sharp film" rules. Maybe he just does not know better. Hard to say. <br /> <br /> What is difficult to say is the result. With the exception of a few viewers who intellectualize the wrong creation of films to the test of pseudo-realism, few will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I know not. <br /> <br /> do yourself a favor and pass this video.
