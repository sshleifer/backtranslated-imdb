Given that I wanted to pick up a new movie from Jet Li to see a few but kicking and brainless battles with my hand to hand, I grabbed the title. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie contains more battles with weapons (ala Chow Yun but nowhere is as good) as Jet Li and acrobatic fighting of the company. So it was a profession. <br /> <br /> Fighting with the tap was interesting, and even fun, considering that it was something completely unexpected in the movie Jet Li for me, more on the line of saying Jackie Chan. <Br /> <br /> But unfortunately I would recommend Fist of Legend, Tai Chi Master and even Enforcer due to this disappointment. <br /> <br /> Rating 4 for martial arts Rating 3 for the overall score of the movie
