The year 1914 was amazing for Charlie Chaplin. It was his first year in movies and he appeared in over 30 films! While most of these films were not particularly good, they gave him a chance to slowly evolve his character on the screen. However, in this film, the famous character "Little Tramp" was still in development. Sure Charlie looked like a role, but his character still lacked the sweetness and decency that he later developed. Instead, Chaplin often hit, kicked or did other nasty things to people, seemingly without reason. <br /> <br /> When it comes to this very small movie, it's worth watching it in the cast. Although they are not known today, Chaplin plays along with Mabel Normand, Chester Conklin and Mack Swain - all the hugely popular stars from Keystone Films. The problem with this movie is that although it has a few nice scenes, the plot seems very vague and incorrectly developed. Chester and Mabel reached the racecourse (a very popular theme in Keystone's productions - they had to be near the racetrack). Charlie and Mack appear and sneak in. Mack is being chased by the police for it while Charlie pats Chester and steals his girlfriend. Eventually, for no apparent reason, the cops take Chester and Mack - leaving Charlie with Mabel (which, oddly enough, did not seem to discourage Charlie's prostitutes). <br /> <br /> Unless you are a huge silent comedy lover or film historian, this is a very forgotten movie that is only important in the evolution of Chaplin. What he and the other actors really do on the stage, though not unusual for Keystone, is not particularly fun when he is seen today.
