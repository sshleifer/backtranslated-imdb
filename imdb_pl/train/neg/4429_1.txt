What stupid tripe. <br /> <br /> I will not even waste time evaluating program points. It is not worth the time. The only comment I will make is: why is it worth having such DUMB, unsubstantial supplies to be a star? that FOX said he would NOT bring back John Doe (decent series), but SLOVE to restore the dead brain like Joe Millionaire to the next round of brain cell killing for the American audience. <br /> <br /> I lost my FOX, IMHO.
