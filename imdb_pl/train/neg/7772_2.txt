This is one humble movie. There is no real story. We are never privy to motivations other than wealth. Heroes are one of the worst actors ever made on film. The threat seems supernatural, but then it is controlled by these three older people. Why they do what they do; in order to fear other members of the group? I do not know. There is fog from the fog machine that rolls in the corridors and everyone is afraid of it. Does he do something? I do not know. Nude is for myself. I'm always surprised to see it in movies so old. In fact, these days have gone away. In any case, people run like chickens, ready for an ax. They have no plan; lack of resources; No, nothing. There are about five stupid moments in the film. Who are these people and "there is" a ghost or demon there. What happened to other people? I challenge everyone to tell me for sure. What a mess.
