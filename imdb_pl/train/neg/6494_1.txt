I love Anthony Hopkins as an actor, so I really wanted to see him do it as a screenwriter / director. I could not be more disappointed with this move. The film was so chaotic that the photos were so remastered that I wanted to pull the plug from the wall. The actors were very good, but it was a waste of talent. Not all actors are cut out for writers or directors, and apparently Mr. Hopkins falls into this category. Of all the films I've seen in the last 50 years, this is absolutely the worst movie ever. Please, do us a favor to Mr. Hopkins and stick to the acting where you are great, and leave writing and leadership to those who are talented in these areas. If I could give the film a rating of less than one, I would definitely do it.
