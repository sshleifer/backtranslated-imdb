This movie was fine, but it certainly overcomes the claim that homosexuals "are born this way", especially when a woman can leave an unhappy marriage and simply fall into the arms of another woman. It seems that Kate's sex preferences have turned on and off like a switch, making this movie a bit simpler. <br /> <br /> In addition, as is usually the case with films that try to push through the program, it was unfortunate that those characters in the film who had questions or disapproval of the homosexual lifestyle were called "bigots". And there was no happy medium. It was the fact that Kate's friends and relatives had accepted her or completely avoided her. This is not typical of the interaction between gays and non-homosexual relatives and friends. Usually it is a mixture of emotions and values ​​that come into play. You can love people and treat them with respect, not necessarily accepting the choices they make. Unfortunately, the film did not show any of these types of interactions. For a film that tries to portray tolerance and acceptance, it seemed to me to be a very intolerant movie! After all, Kate apparently decides after all these years that he wants to be with Mac, and everything is noisy - is what really gay really concern? Come on!
