I saw this movie in the cinema many years ago and one thing surprised me so badly that I could not see any of the virtues in the movie: Dennis Quaid was cast as a policeman who never smiles or smiles, and his smile two of his trademarks. Danny Glover was cast as a bad guy, but - again - the imagination of most viewers could not go far enough to believe him in that role. In addition, Jared Leto was not credible as a former medical student. There was no tension because the killer was known very early. The finale was neither dramatic nor tight: no one around me cared about what would happen next. We could wait until the end of the movie. All in all a disappointing evening spent in the cinema.
