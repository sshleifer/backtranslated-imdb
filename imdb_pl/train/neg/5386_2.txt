being one of the "stars" of this film does not necessarily give me an insight into the sage, I know a lot about what was first there ... and what ended up on the screen. I remember seeing the original slice of an "incoming first year student" and was very pleased. it was funny, sexy, lewd, all the main requirements of the drive-in movie. you must remember that it was shot and released before the rest ... home for animals, pork, etc. ... so in a way, this movement was really ahead of its time. for whatever reason the film was handed over to the main distributors who edited half of the original film and then edited (should I say "shuffled") the most random scenes in history. Fat man, people with goat heads ... what the hell was that ?! I'm sure he was introduced to an additional R & A, but he was so slow that everything was happening in front of him to grind to a screeching and painful stop. but in general, it's a funny memory for me ... especially since I can say that the worst movie I've ever seen ... I'm in it!
