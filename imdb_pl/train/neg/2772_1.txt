Spoiler warning. . . I have to agree with you, it was almost there. It was such a bad movie, about such and interesting real history. She had such a promise, but acting was ridiculous at best. Some sets were beautiful and realistic. Others are something outside the theme park. I noticed that I was laughing when I watched what serious scenes were meant to be. I really wanted to like this movie, but I could not. The best part was the fight between friends, which ended with the death of the "King". I liked the queens' punishment. And the last shot made a beautiful picture. There are so many better movies to watch. I do not recommend this.
