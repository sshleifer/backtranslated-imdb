Someone had a great idea: let Misty Mundae make his own version of Lara Croft with an R score - by shooting two pistols not only in scant costumes, but also topless. It was a really great idea. The problem is that people who had it could not come up with any script or budget to handle it. That's why we get a "movie" that barely reaches the average length, reproducing many of its parts (often in slow motion), and apparently it was filmed entirely in the garage. The attractiveness of Misty Mundae is still obvious: it is unbelievably sweet and has natural beauty next to each other. However, her two girlfriends, with whom she shares a long lesbian scene, are not near their league. If "Mummy Raider" was presented as a movie on Youtube, I would rate it higher, but as a "movie" intended for DVD consumption can not get more than 1/2 a * out of 4.
