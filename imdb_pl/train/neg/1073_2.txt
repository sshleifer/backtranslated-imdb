I can not believe that so much talent can be wasted in one movie! The Gingerbread Man starts on the right foot and manages to build great expectations for the end. But at some point the film turns into one of the worst stories I've ever wasted my time on. It is as unbelievable as the enchanted Mallory Doss manages to attract Kenneth Branagh's character by the nose. The climax of films is as uninteresting and flat as beer, which has been left in the sun for too long. Gingerbread Man is probably Grisham's worst film ever and does not change the fact that talented stars suppress this film. Do not waste time here!
