This movie may seem terrifying in commercials, but the real movie was a reason for vomiting. It is below average, (even lower) and there is no plot. I mean, every home can make you feel scared and sure that a dead Japanese woman will scare you with a pile, but so what? Create a movie that will appeal to observers, not just show pictures of terrified people and some hair (a dead Japanese girl). Can you say "horrible stripping Samara (The Ring)"? Do not start with a "dead child". Not even that scary! So what? He has a cat and can imitate him, a big freaking deal! Just bury poor zombies and save lives that can be hurt by Grudge! 1/10! Yuck! >. <
