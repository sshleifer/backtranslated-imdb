It is a fairly low-budget film, created for television, whose aim is to use the success of the original. I am a fan of b movies, and this one could be good if it were not accompanied by the name "Cube" because, as it is, the director and the plot of the original were better, and this film almost spoiled the taste for the whole series. The heroes are annoying and stereotyped, there are continuity problems and a few overt production speculations. History has no chance for development due to unnecessary dialogue and suffers from this. To a lesser or greater extent, they use the same horror tricks throughout the movie, and because the first one was so good, it turns out to be just a disappointment. <br /> <br /> If it was an independent b-movie, I would probably give it about four. The "1" rating I gave was largely a statement of how completely paler in terms of effects and intelligence compared to the first.
