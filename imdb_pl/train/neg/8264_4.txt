It is a movie in which actors are fine, especially Brigitte Bako and Erik Palladino, in a movie in which each of the three couples meets in a situation that feels compelled to be either charming or to run the story. In other words, it seems that they are imaginary film scenes, not real life. Even if women working in peep parlors ever meet one of their clients, it just does not seem realistic, as it is written in this film. In addition, when one of the characters meets an overweight woman in the movie, she feels artificial, as they look at each other after an argument. Again, all the actors are good, and the moments in this movie are nice, but generally one more indie that could have used the rework before production.
