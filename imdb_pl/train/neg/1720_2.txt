A handful of unprofessional actors are terrorized by a prehistoric creature. This creature appears in about thirty seconds of marginal stop-motion animation, but oh, how long do you miss this margin when the animation will be replaced by the production assistants waving their teeth on the inner tube for the rest of the movie. There is no time for horror when this movie is taken away by those doofuses who suddenly become heroes; but again you have to admit that looking at how they try to be funny is better than wandering around the sheriff. Only at the end one of them is eaten, and the other one stays on the rock and weeping tears of loneliness - it is not fun!
