Do you want to know the secret? This movie sucks. Actually, I do not know, because if you allow indulgent versions of original movies, you may find this movie amazing (this movie is a plagiarized copy and I know what you did last summer). The first 30 minutes of the movie is based on a typical story setting; a group of so-called cool teenagers enjoying Florida vacations and being themselves, behaving very much like juveniles. The only insight we get at this moment is the degree to which the director has managed to visualize the pretentious sense of decadence of the teenagers in the characters. The second half of the movie picks up pace and begins to illustrate the beginning of unprecedented killings. The third half hour of the movie will definitely remain a mystery to me, because I turned it off before I could fool myself, thinking that the movie might still have something interesting and original to show. When it comes to history, it can be easily explained in a few lines. A group of teenagers go on vacation to Florida. While they are busy partying, they slowly (and I mean SLOW) start to die because they know some stupid secret. The only thread of homicides is that all victims were students of a joint high school. One thing that amazed me in this movie was how much betty (I'm not sure of her name ... a blond character) looks like a reese witherspoon. Another thing that surprised me in the movie was that I jumped up a few times. Does it make it a work of art? absolutely not, because my 12-year-old niece told me to drop a glass of orange juice because she "booed" me when I was about to go through the door of the guest room ... what distinguishes the director from my 12-year-old niece ?? <br /> <br /> Do you want to know the secret? I'm not sure about you, but I do not ...
