I would give this movie 1 in 10 if it was not for ms. Performance by Claudine Barretto. and this time I will not notice that Kris Aquino is here. the end. <br /> <br /> I really avoid watching Pinoy horror movies because the stories are not original and I really think that (some) writers do not pay enough attention to the characters (and their progress) in their stories (unnecessary ??). it was as if they were "pushing" the movie when their story stank. and my goodness, creative exhaustion led them to rip off other films. why?? Why did this movie have a good review? I would not give her so much merit. the film was frightening, but the movie seemed more bizarre because it deals with Filipino folklore ... it falls on my list of categories "most likely will happen". I just wanted them to spend more time improving the story and fixing these flashing sequences, no matter if the lighting is sucked, it does not matter if the content will blow you up. Sayang.
