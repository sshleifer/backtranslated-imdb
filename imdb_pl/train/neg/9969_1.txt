I joined this site to see what people would do about this absolute movie crash. I have not been drawn in even for a second. All characters were one-dimensional. They threw every topic that they could come up with, hoping that something would stay alive. I bet (and I hope) that everyone involved in the Teacher looks back with embarrassment. There are some great actors here, but you would never know it. Thank God it did not destroy the careers of Morgan Freeman, Judd Hirsh, Nick Nolte or Laura Dern. There was no vision here, there was no work of love, only a terrible effort went wrong. BTW I do not think a writer ever set foot in a real school.
