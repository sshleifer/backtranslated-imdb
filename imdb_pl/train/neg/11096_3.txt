I had high hopes for this movie because I thought CLEAN, SHAVEN (Kerrigan's first movie) was absolutely great, most likely a low-budget movie movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> But most of CLAIRE DOLAN are completely pointless and flat. The scene after the scene seems to be randomly thrown into the mix, without much thought for the narrative or character. <br /> <br /> Is Claire trying to get away from being a prostitute or not? Hard to say. Why does he approach the trick at the airport if he wants to escape this life? Why is not he taking tricks when he needs money in Seattle? Why do we have to see how she dyes her hair to the same color? Why does Claire accept some underpants and not others? The filmmaker probably does not know. <br /> <br /> I feel like everything has been improvised (although I understand that it was not), and the filmmakers just kept the camera on it, as if they were making a real document. <br /> <br /> After the show I saw, Kerrigan defended his lack of narrative choices, condemning the film narrative as politically conservative. It sounded like learned rhetoric. I think it was a scam. <br /> <br /> I am sad that the creator of a film as exciting as CLEAN, SHAVEN would have made such a lame movie like this, and then defended it with tired old "political" clich√©s.
