I started watching this movie with my girlfriend. And after 5 minutes I was alone. <br /> <br /> I managed to stay to the end. It was a painful experience. <br /> <br /> I liked jean hugues anglade, but I think he had to eat just like us, and that's why he agreed to play this movie. <br /> <br /> There are only 5 characters, and the rest can be called "art" or something that I could not express, but I did not understand at all. <br /> <br /> The only worst movie I've seen is a catastrophe, but now I'm sure I have enough experience to see it again. <br /> <br /> good luck !! ; about)
