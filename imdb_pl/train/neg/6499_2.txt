What a confused mess. I saw it with a friend some time ago and we both consider ourselves open to many wonders of cinema, but this is certainly not one of them. ideas / concepts and there are certainly some good results (under the circumstances), they are all buried in random nonsense. Sir Anthony is far from the same gene pool as Natural Born Killers, U Turn, and similar films when it comes to editing, and maybe he was looking at Nixon for inspiration. Say what you want about David Lynch, but at least he's more likely to have madness. <br /> <br /> His quote stating that he made the movie as a joke, says it all. It is not worth your money, bandwidth or time.
