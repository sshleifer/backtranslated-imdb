As a great fan of films and plays by David Mamet, and especially his first movie House of Games, which also starred Joe Mantegna, I was expecting great things from this movie. Instead, I was irritated by the superficiality and lack of credibility of the film. Racial insults are thrown away without any feeling and meaning behind them, in the hope of establishing racial tension that has never materialized for me. Identity is completely overvalued and men become "heroes" for no apparent reason. Because of his oaths adopted as a cop, the main character firmly refuses to perform one relatively small action, which does not hurt anyone and can save his life, and yet performs another action, which is very violent and VERY illegal, but still refuses to minors action. In addition, a very unbelievable partial story involving the man who killed his family was introduced only for the sake of the plot, which was only advertised by distance writing, and the cop's reaction to this incident extended to credulity above all reasonable limits. Needless to say, expecting David Mamet's next thrilling thriller, I was disappointed at least. 3 out of 10.
