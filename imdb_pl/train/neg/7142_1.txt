It's definitely the WORST movie I've ever seen. I expected a cheap movie, but at least with cool scenes / car races. What I got was nothing. The racing scene is so low that it accelerated to make it look like cars were "running fast." In one scene, the Mercedes SLR goes from over 200 to 0 in 4 seconds, turning on wheels. It's just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a real movie about cars, see the fast and furious series. They can be a bit tacky, but 100 times better than the movie can hope for. It's better to watch the Mischief 3000, the best car film ever made.
