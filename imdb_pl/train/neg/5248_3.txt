"Die Sieger" was highly recommended as one of the few good action films produced in Germany. I watched it last night and I have to admit that I'm deeply disappointed. If this is to be the "last hope" for entertainment and the challenge of the German action cinema, then there is not much left. <br /> <br /> "Die Sieger" tries to be sexy, bold and furious, but that's nothing like that. The heroes are wooden and stereotyped, and when they do something unexpected (which does not happen too much), the action contradicts their nature. This makes it difficult - almost impossible for me - to follow them and even to identify with them. <br /> <br /> First of all, I think that the film is very bad. There is no one character I believe in. Maybe a superior in the SWAT unit - but that's it. Those people who try to look or behave like special units like elite cops - I do not believe them. Not for a second. <br /> <br /> In the end, the story is not so bad. But I think it is wrong. You do not recognize a bad guy - for example. And when, after the "very dark" show, Karl Simon (a good guy) asks his already dead opponent "why? ... what for? "I asked myself the same question, knowing that Dominik Graf would not have an answer. <br /> <br /> I sincerely hope - no - I believe that Germany can do better, even with action movies.
