Do not waste 90 minutes of your time on "Fast Food, Fast Women". This annoyingly episodic scenario with three lines of threads joined together is ridiculously bad because of predictable writing, frightening acting, and even bad music. I noticed that the anxiety of the main anorectic hero was observed every time she was on screen. SHE needs junk food. <br /> <br /> Take 90 minutes to devote this turkey to something more exciting ... like nail trimming. You would have more entertainment value. <br /> <br /> The only advantage of this movie is Louise Lasser, but she deserves a lot better than this tired scenario. He's as powerless as the older guy he's shooting in the movie. <br /> <br /> THE BROWSER BELIEVE IT!
