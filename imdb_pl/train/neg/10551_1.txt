Apparently The Mutilation Man talks about a guy who wanders around the country doing self-harm shows as a way to deal with his abusive childhood. I use the word "apparently," because without listening to the commentary of director Andy Copp (which I did not have at my disposal) or reading the film before watching, viewers will have no idea what's going on. <br /> <br /> Gorehounds and fans of extreme movies can be lured to watch The Mutilation Man with the promise of a few sharp scenes of splattering and disturbing real recordings, but unless they like pretentious, painful, experimental art cinema, it will be for them real work. <br /> <br /> 82 minutes of ugly images, accompanied by unruly sound, horrible music and incomprehensible dialogue, this awful mind, terrible nonsense is a great way to check your mental health: if you still have all the balls, you will turn off this garbage and see something decent (I watched the whole thing, but I'm aware that it's barking!).
