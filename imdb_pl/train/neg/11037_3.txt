I love the episode where Jim becomes Greenman. It is wonderful! When Jim throws this little person through the window, his face is priceless. And then when he starts addressing the priest on behalf of his wife, just to find out that she has been Pee-Woman? Great writing and great casting as well as great acting make it necessary to see it. I'm trying to find a specific photo from this episode. I would like to use it as my avatar on the forum, because I think Greenman is funny. Does anyone know where I can download Jim's photo as Greenman? Can anyone direct me in the right direction to find such a photo?
