I can summarize and say unequivocally that for all my 51 years on this planet this is the worst (probably childish) movie I have ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> I took it for three, even they were struggling with a smile during the winding 90 minutes. The sexual releases that I set out for the next day were as tasteless as a movie. They should pay you not to watch them. It's really scary, there's no other way to describe it. People who created this movie should be faced with the task of collecting money under a false pretext. <br /> <br /> Aplogise for my spelling mistakes, but I am so upset that it ruined my grandchildren's time.
