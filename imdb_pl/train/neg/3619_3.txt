Basically, there's a family where a little boy (Jake) thinks he has a zombie in his closet and his parents are fighting all the time. <br /> <br /> This movie is slower than a soap opera ... and suddenly, Jake decides to stay with Rambo and kill the zombies. <br /> <br /> OK, first of all, when you're going to make a movie, you have to decide if it's a thriller or a drama! As a drama, the film is watched. Parents divorce and argue as in real life. And then we have Jake with his wardrobe, which completely spoils the whole movie! I was expecting to see a similar BOOGEYMAN movie and instead watched a drama with some pointless thriller spots. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 only for good parents and exit dialogs. When it comes to shots with Jake: just ignore them.
