The screenplay for the movie "Scary Movie 2" was simply not ready. It is a problem with a film that is clearly visible to both actors and the public. Director Keenan Ivory Wayans and many actors are funny people; so the film is not completely devoid of humor. In their opinion, the film has some funny moments. But as a whole, "Scary Movie 2" is not even as wise and funny as the original. <br /> <br /> The first "Scary Movie" was a laugh with a minute movie. It turned the smallest subtleties of the movie genre into comedy gold. Humor in "Scary Movie 2" is as heavy as it is unoriginal. They lack even the obvious possibilities of a parody. Two movie stars are former cast members of "Beverly Hills 90210" and it was a program that begged for a parody! In the end, "Scary Movie 2" is like a beautiful bottle of wine that was opened too early. The script needed a lot more time to grow old. 2 stars out of 5.
