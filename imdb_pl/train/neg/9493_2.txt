This ridiculous movie offers a standard "hippie mentality" from the '70s in a nut shell and bores us in this process. It is an attempt to rationalize the absurd marriages of young, innocent women with old sexists and car washes. The naive young hippie played by the Waif style hook (Kay Lenz) rides and sleeps with all the bad guys, and one day he meets a funny (Holden), already in old age, drinking strong alcohol and washed out as an actor and decides that he is from "in love". If you think it's superficial, the whole movie contains such scenes. She keeps repeating how much she "loves" him and she only met him, she wears thin and really fast. I could not help laughing in the whole movie. It is obvious that he uses it as a meal ticket, but the director is immature enough to think that we will buy that any kind of love actually takes place. The disgusting scene is where both of them are naked and have sex, so I had to speed it up because it almost inspired me to vomit. The film also offers a wide range of music from the 70's. Avoid this if you can. Degree D.
