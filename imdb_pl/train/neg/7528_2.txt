This is even worse than the original death game. The confused, incoherent plot leads to the fact that "Billy Lo" falls from the helicopter to the ground, killing him, because we are to follow his younger brother Bobby Lo. So not only do we start to follow a clone of Bruce Lee, but the movie kills this one and makes us follow another thirty minutes in history. The main reason for watching this is that Bobby Lo fights the lion, who is a fairly obvious guy in a lion costume. Jang Lee Hwang is also a villain who is usually very amazing, but his time on the screen is much smaller. Mostly I watched this and the original death game, because they are part of the Bruce Lee box set. No wonder they are attached to Lee's completed work. Nobody would buy them differently.
