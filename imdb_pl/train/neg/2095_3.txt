Battlestar Gallactica was so great because it had strong writing, great looks, great actors and interesting stories ... And yes, hot men and women ran around and left the uniform. just lazy. Lazy writing. Actors burning a storm to give them a "character". External sequences that destroy the feeling of being somewhere else (yes, this is a Ford Focus sitting in the background). A lot and a lot of teenage anger. A lot of spinning naked women (but in the background, I'm sure they will be cut in a series) and a symbolic view of some men in towels. None of the actors except Polly Walker paid attention to me at all. Within an hour and a half I was still wondering when it would end. <br /> <br /> So what does this bring me back? Science fiction? It's very bright. Actors? In addition to the great corner of Polly Walker, there are not too many interesting things. There are not even "hotties" in the cast, except perhaps Esai, although for the younger set it is quite old because it is over 25 years old. <br /> <br /> I loved BSG. I was skeptical when I heard about Caprica and unfortunately I think I'm right. I predict a very short period for this series, unless they really sharpen their pencils in SciFi and start working, doing it more than OC on another planet.
