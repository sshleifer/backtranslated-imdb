Scary Movie 3 (2003) was a bad idea at first. The last film was an average effort. Put it next to this load, it's a comedy classic. While the second part was filled with a lot of outdated humor and cheap shots, at least it was fun. There is nothing funny in a forced mood. Jokes, pratfalls and sight gags are naturally fun. Hitting the viewer with tired jokes is not cool. The humor in this movie was intended for underage imbeciles who will laugh at everything. When they satisfied the needs of the middle school crowd, every sense of self-respect was thrown out of the window. Ring parodies are not funny. I have watched them in comedies since 1998. They are so old. Michael Jackson's jokes are not cool either. Worse, she laughs at two spoiled "performers" whose best times have NEVER been. <br /> <br /> The death of the American cinema was slow. Such films are nails hammered into the coffin. What happened to real humor? I have not laughed at the cinema for a long time. Too many bad movies are spoiling the brain. Do you want proof? Go to the local video rental from the mega network and see what is on the shelves. This movie is bad. Do not believe in noise. I'd rather watch Scary Movie 2 in a continuous loop than suffer through this bad excuse again! <br /> <br /> I definitely do not recommend (unless you have a handful of brain cells).
