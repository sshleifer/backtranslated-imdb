Poor acting, no script, no plot, no convincing killer, no tension, no original settings, uses the same cabinet / tactics bed / person behind you in the mirror, which makes it repetitive and boring and NOT promising, and the fact that NO ONE is "really" killed (at least not on the screen), which in turn undermines all the tension that can cause it and makes everyone feel cheated on Christmas Eve to spend money on the admission ticket .... it's horror without LMAO horror. FREQUENTLY See what someone who took a bottle of ketchup looks like and sprays it with a plastic sheet. <br /> <br /> You have to be a teenager who was sitting there shouting in the theater and got scared to enjoy it, or you were tall then / drunk. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I have a life and I do not bother writing reviews that I often do, unless I really hate something, or I am very happy about it. <br /> <br /> But this movie is AMAZING and I feel that I have a duty to warn NOT to give Hollywood money and encourage this kind of filming again! <br /> <br /> One thing is to rent a "bad" movie in a hit from Weinstein, his second when you have to sit in the theater. <br /> <br /> Also in case you want a little nostalgia, forget about it! This is NOT a remake, nor is it a re-image. It is not scary, neither addictive nor satisfying to be "funny", as others said on IMDb ... it is simply out of date and booooring. <br /> <br /> Here's what you'll get from this movie: remembering the scar on Brittany Snow's head, which stands out more than the plot, the fact that Jonathan Schaech MUST have an affair with JS Cardone from "The Forsaken" got another killer role (because it is as frightening as my poodle, and too sweet to kill almost everyone) and that for some reason (duh) everyone who returns to the apartment never returns. What kind of man would NOT be worried at the ball when he would decide to announce the candidates for the king of the ball and the queen, and the fierce, competitive girl will not appear? This is my warning. DO NOT waste money, like me. The "original" sucks too, but it's more of a pleasure for Jamie Lee Curtis fans, though not as close as this shit (sorry to sound vulgar or rude, but when you see it, you'll understand why I say what I say).
