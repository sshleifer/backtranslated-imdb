Hood of the living Dead is about a young scientist named Rick, who lives with his brother in the city of Oklahoma, where drug dealers and prostitutes fill the streets. One night, Rick's brother is shot dead by a gang riding down the street that has previously fought him. Desperate, Rick calls on his scientist to collaborate to bring the latest formula they work on that brings health to blood cells. The formula has not been tested on man or even on the dead body, but Rick is determined to bring his brother back to life. It gives the body a double dose of formula, but nothing happens. So Rick calls 911 and the body is taken away only to return to life and feast on the human body. Now Rick must find his zombie brother before the whole hood changes into the neighborhood of the dead. The hood of the living dead is one piece of garbage. The plot is a direct rip-off from Resident Evil, the acting is just terrible, especially since Rick's false crying for a brother, the weapon is so false, because every time the weapon is fired, it sends sparks, and the makeup is only lame. It's just artificial blood covered with the faces of the actors. Zombies are also modified. They run, growl, and have to be shot in the heart to die! Zombies should only shuffle, moan and have to be shot in the brain to die! This movie is so horrible that it is the only real moment of this film. Hood of the Living Dead gets 3 out of 10, some entertainment here and there, but it only works as a low-budget festival.
