"Leslock" Leslie Sands becomes a poor choice vehicle for Bette Davis and Gary Merrill, just after their joint success in "All About Eve." After killing your spouse, the intriguing woman is visited by her husband's best friend, who gives herself as her husband when others start to stay at home. Irving Rapper, one of the best directors of Bette in the peak years, unfortunately is not able to pick up this absurd material, in which Davis is strangely restrained and restrained until the scandalous finale (where he luckily pulls out all the stops). Production and support are strictly secondary; only for compliments by Bette Davis. * 1/2 of ****
