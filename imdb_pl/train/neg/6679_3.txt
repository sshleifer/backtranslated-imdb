Manoj Agrawal after the failure of PARDESI BABU (1998) returned with this film <br /> <br /> In the film Govinda has 8-9 roles, and his father, mother, grandfather, sister, and later also costumes <br /> <br In short, he is a useless detective who sends a case through his friend to get evidence against his wife, whose photo loses at the airport while flirting with Rani. <br /> <br /> He dresses as Sardarji on the plane and again as a funny girl the part is how easy it is to do it in a short time? <br /> <br /> Then he disguises himself as a French singer and enters the TV to get evidence lol, and then as a maharashtrian (just inside the television itself) <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie has the same wrong identities and ends with a predictable note There are some funny scenes, such as Govinda, who is stuck by an African, and many other portions <br /> <br /> Direction Manoj Agrawal is fine. Music is fine <br /> <br /> Among the actors, Govinda again proves that he is one of the most-watched actors. As usual, he is a tastic fan, although he has performed such roles before he again matches all the ups and downs, although the overly large 6-7 roles do not really fit the movie, that Rani looks like fat, she works well with Govinda thatz it She is Nirmal Pandey is, as usual, Johny Lever is sometimes too loud and funny in places in one role and gets upset when the older Tinnu Anand is in okay Satish Kaushik is funny, Paresh is okay Tanaaz is ok
