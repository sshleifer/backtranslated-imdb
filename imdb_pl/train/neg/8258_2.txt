I was lucky to read a book before watching the movie. It was an epic of puberty, a dream about summer years, a great potential indie film or a big budget drama. Somehow he got into the hands of a burglar who clearly took notes watching Boogie Nights and Rushmore, learning nothing. The scenario loses the power of books for forced emotions and boring gags. I felt sorry for the actors because the characters in the book were rich and textured, but were limited to embarrassing characters in the film. Mason Gamble is great when it is possible, like Dylan Baker, but the skeleton that remains from the story plays out how bad after school is unique. Poor people = GOOD, Rich people = BAD. <br /> <br /> Although it is worth seeing a beach in southern California, where Gary Sinise parked a trailer, which is to go to the bay in Delaware. <br /> <br /> It's a good book, but an embarrassing turnaround for the first director Mills Goodloe. <br /> <br /> K.
