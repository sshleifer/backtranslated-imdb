Cabin Fever is the first full-length feature directed by Eli Roth. Roth and Randy Pearlstein co-wrote the screenplay of Roth's story. It's a zombie movie that owes a lot to George Romero and his earlier "living dead movies" as well as the original Texas Chainsaw Massacrenot, to mention Sam Rami's "Evil Dead." there is nothing original here, and the story is not convincing. acting is almost identical with this genre, history just goes wrong. he said that after achieving commercial, if not artistic success in this film, Roth decided that he was a director and went out with a terribly horrible, deceitful, senseless (though much more ambitious) hostel. he should leave when he was behind. The cab fever is not a good movie, but it is a work of art compared to the Hostel. I hope someone (preferably a psychiatrist) convinces this guy that filming is a bad career choice. Cabin fever, poor 3/10 for not being smal like Hostel.
