I've read the comments that it's the best Chinese movie ever. Perhaps, if the only Chinese films you have seen did not include dialogue, long distances and silence and editing hacks, then you are in place. <br /> <br /> A complicated story? Hardly. Try juvenile and amateur. Excellent moods and haunting memories? Hardly. Try boring and trite. <br /> <br /> It was terrible. I could not wait for it to end. Especially when the best lines in the movie are "How are you? I feel good. Are you sure? Yes". Wow! What depth of character. I think that continuous smoking was to speak for them. <br /> <br /> As a big fan of many Chinese, Japanese and Korean films, I was totally disappointed. Even the sentimental hell of Zhang's "Way Home" was better.
