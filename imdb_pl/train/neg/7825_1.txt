I think that this movie is an appropriate tribute to the first Superman movie, because it is as small and painfully long as the original. <br /> <br /> After the opening scene consisting only of turbid intergalactic images, the subtitles pay homage to the even-looking, futuristic films of the original Superman movie. <br /> <br /> Then there are some dark things. Ma Kent sees some dark noise on the farm and spends a large part of my life slowly approaching the debris on the cornfield. Then Superman sneaks into her and faints. <br /> <br /> Then he will catch up with Lex Luthor in the scene of many dark close-ups of an elderly lady who dies. We do not see Luthor's face until the end of the scene, an early case in which the film refuses to reject any trite stone. Lex Luthor is a guy who does not like Superman because he's not human. He probably does not like people either, because in the movie sometimes there is a conspiracy about Lex Luthor, who plans to kill the majority of the Earth's population. <br /> <br /> After some time Clark Kent appears with him an old robot (I forgot to mention, he was on a five-year journey, where nothing happened). Then he learns that Lois Lane has an illegitimate kid and meets with Cyclop. It annoys him so much that he loses control over his super power to such an extent that he accidentally breaks the frame. <br /> <br /> At this point, we see that Miss Lane is on some kind of jet attached to some type of space shuttle. This is an important event because of television. Then we find out that there are people monitoring the event in the control room. There are also people watching him on TV and pilots in the cockpit. The film reminds us then that these people are involved, sharing them for most of the summer. <br /> <br /> When events leading to the inevitable catastrophe began to build, I apologized to get soda. I accidentally returned to the wrong theater and watched a movie about Al Gore showing the slides in their entirety. I tried to find my way back to Superman Returns, but somehow I went to the Prairie Home Companion, which I watched twice in a row. Then it's time to stop playing. <br /> <br /> I went back to the first theater, found my seat and looked up to see that the approaching disaster of the Lois Lane shuttle was almost upon us. Despite this, it seemed that it lasts forever, so I wandered around the theater, met a girl, got married, raised my son and sent him to college. While attending my son's medical school, I remembered that I should probably check myself in Superman Returns, so I apologized and returned to the theater just to find out that there was no need to hurry. It still took about half an hour before everything went wrong with the space shuttle. When they did, Superman saved everyone, which was pretty cool. <br /> <br />. Then there is a hint in which Superman becomes really frightening and begins to persecute Lois Lane and her family thanks to his x-ray vision and listening. Then he tries to persuade her to reveal Cyclops, who seems to be a good guy. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Lex Luthor participates in a competition to show all possible behavior of villains before the end of the movie. I forgot to take my score card with me (they give you one at the door), but I think he got a damn near a hundred percent. I hope he will win a million dollars. <br /> <br /> At this point, everything begins to prepare for the dark finale. I think maybe the projector was broken, because of the movie it seemed to be in some loop for some time. I remember that dark things were emerging from the water, Superman was ill, Superman was getting better, he was returning to the dark things, he was sick again, he was not waiting, he was ok again. <br /> <br /> Then Lex Luthor unleashed his bad move: shouting at his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Then Superman died and came back to life. I thought the movie was over, so I left. <br /> <br /> Ninety years later, the nursing home where I lived was a bit cold. I realized that I had left my sweatshirt back in the theater and went to retrieve it. When I did, I was a bit surprised that Superman Returns was not over yet. I tried to ask some spectators what I missed, but most of them were just skeletons with long gray beards. <br /> <br /> I sat back in my old chair and watched Lois Lane spin around her house for a moment. Then Superman appeared and started quoting the beginning of the movie, and because I've seen the part, I thought I could leave. <br /> <br /> So this is my review of Superman Returns. <br /> <br /> Oh, also, if you like jokes about people eating dogs or joking about a dog eating another dog, you'll love this movie. Because of two such jokes.
