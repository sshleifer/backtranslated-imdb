Yes. I'm sure I saw this movie years ago when it came to Supremes. <br /> <br /> Another revised plot took on the Hollywood style, borrowing scripts from better movies from the music industry. br /> <br /> Nothing original here. <br /> <br /> More make-up, glammier costumes and choreography = more money for the doubtful "talented" fate of Beyonce. <br /> <br /> If, as with the throwing style, you should appreciate the actual groups that fought (without having digitized voices and the Hollywood empire). <br /> <br /> Beyonce's involvement makes this hypocritical rubbish.
