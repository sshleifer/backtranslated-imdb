Do you know that you feel joy when you watch a movie that tries so hard to be a serious, thought-provoking piece of cinema and pitifully fails? When can not you refrain from laughter from the pure terrible nature of rubbish trashing your screen? "House of the Dead" tries to achieve even this low level of cinema. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end, "House of the Dead" manages to recreate the feeling that you have just woken up to find out that the cat has put a curled business on your forehead during sleep. From the very beginning, it's clear that the actresses have been cast because of their fission (which they shamelessly use), while the males are for their hardcore attitude. I really did not care about any of the characters at any point in the movie and I really wanted them dead to save me a good hour of torture. Uwe Boll should consider displaying two hours of footage from the real game. At least we will work better? However, not all guilty parties may be burdened with actors, because it is certainly a challenge to create a convincing film in the face of the script. This is most likely the worst part of the movie and it actually contains such lines as: "These are zombies, clean and simple" and "Without cap'n, we can not go there! That `s bad!". <br /> <br /> We all know that Zombie movies will never be particularly thought provoking or meaningful; at best, they are harmless two hours of action, blood and terror. Garbage, yes, but fun junk. This is not the kind of garbage that pops out of the garbage bag while carrying it through the room and strangle shoes in cartons of sour milk and decaying peel of bananas. According to IMDb, "House of the Dead" received such bad reviews that no Danish cinemas have bought a movie. If we could have the same privilege. <br /> <br /> Final result: 1/10.
