It can not be denied that the first Azumi movie was a commercial product; it was an adaptation of the popular manga and was filled with young, attractive actors and certainly did not run out of it in the budget department. However, what was there was more than fun and I can not deny that I enjoyed it a lot. <br /> <br /> "Azumi 2" has almost everything that makes this original so great. The first thing that should trigger an alarm bell is the lack of wonderful Ryuhei Kitamura at the forefront. With him, he seemed to take not only his own visual talent and kinetics, but also original style, beauty and most importantly his heart. While the first had a simple hitlist story, it has a corkscrew mess with a story, and too many boring characters stabbing back each other so many times that the potential for any sympathy or pathos is faded. There is no longer effective interaction between the heroes; Azumi and her cohorts are often reduced to a group of teenagers who argue in the woods. Characteristics does not exist; if someone looks at who cares who lives and who dies, I will be shocked. The same applies to villains here. The last battle - actually all battles - is completely devoid of any tension. The fact that they are poorly choreographed and poorly directed - not to mention a few and very distant from each other - becomes a side line thanks to their pure senselessness. The villains themselves are trying too hard to be camps, and even if everyone was connected, they were not in the miles of the country with Pete Burnsian's antics from Jo Odagiri in the original. <br /> <br /> ## ## Major Spoiler at the end of the paragraph! ##### <br /> <br /> Aya Ueto tries to say the best and also managed to keep her hair in good condition between the movies. Azumi is now a full-fledged killer, which means he can wave the sword in slow motion; Unfortunately, now the character is fascinated by the mysterious style of the Untamed man, the Ueto model looks even more inaccurate. I know that this is what it is all about, but in combination with the ineffectiveness of all others in the film, foolishness of the story and the general incompetence of the film in general means that this time you can not stop your character. Less said about Chiaki, "Remember me with Kill Bill." Kuriyama's performance the better; suffice to say that her "turn" from good to evil is as subtle as napalm. <br /> <br /> In general, it was simply a colossal disappointment. All merits are done ten times better in the first movie. Lazy, unsatisfying - and generally boring - mess.
