So I'm looking for a DVD rental and I'm meeting this movie called "End Game". It features James Woods and Cuba Gooding JR and contains a summary of the scientific political thriller. It's worth taking a look then. Or I thought so. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> The end of the game has almost the most absurd story I have ever had dissatisfaction with because of durability. Now, being a kind of eccentricity, I can not really tear it apart, as I would like it, without "ruining" it with those who have not experienced this monstrosity yet. But questions like "Why did he / she / they did it?" And "Where did they get the money to do it?" Are too rich after the unintentional funny ending of the movie. <br /> <br /> When it comes to acting - do you know those movies where you almost feel that the actor realized that he made a terrible mistake by logging into the movie, and that shows their performance? This is one of those. Accompany this with a funny script and a seriously flawed, irritating direction, and you have a recipe for cinematic poison. <br /> <br /> Of course, it did not go to the cinema and for the same reason you should not put it in your living room; It's horrifying.
