Ok, for the first time I saw this movie like at 9:00 on Cinemax a few weeks ago and I thought it would be rewarded, boy I had 180 days. This movie was a bit larger. I mean, the mother of monsters shows their true form only at the end of the movie. I'm going "This is it? Why not show it for a short time in the movie. "The conspiracy of being a mother and son celebrates the blood of young women. Would not it be better if they just continued the killing madness of killing like two young women, and then, when the sheriff or cop finds out about it and goes into the old, find a way to kill the monsters save the young woman / woman and kill 1 or 2 more ? I think that would be much better in this way. It also sucks because the son is the main character and is killed first. Why not get rid of your mother first? Plus, how does she have that strength at the end of the movie when she starts killing people? She said she is too weak. What the hell was this time with Stephen? I never, never can break away from playing any movie from any actor, try their best. If it were not for good acting, I would give this film a 1/10. 3/10.
