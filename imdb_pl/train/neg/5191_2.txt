Ahh, boring t.v. shows and pilots who were slammed together in the '70s to do equally boring t.v. cinema! Some examples are Riding With Death (the most hysterical trashy of many), Stranded in Space (confusing and uninteresting), San Francisco International (terribly boring and incredibly confusing), as well as this sharp piece of glamor Quinn Martin. <br /> <br /> Shot in Hawaii (although you would not know about it from the outside), it's apparently a failed pilot on a lame spy show. The real problem is that you do not like most characters, including the colorless main character of Diamond Head, who seemed to fall asleep throughout the movie; his boss, Aunt Mary, who had a really strange supply of his lines and shelled white hair, and a tan that looked as if she was stuccoed; Diamnd Head girl / colleague agent (hell, I do not even remember her name) a thin, wooden woman with a flat way of speaking, which is not just sexy or interesting; and singing Zulu midfielder (again I do not remember the name of his character), which was not bad at small doses. The most interesting character in the whole production was Ian McShane, who sucked as a bad guy, but he still proved his chops. As with make-up, the so-called "chameleon" used to dress up was just ridiculous. I have absolutely no idea what he was doing or what he was trying to steal from the lab, which caused him to dress up as an American dictator from South America. I do not care. The plot was simply not interesting enough to focus attention on ten minutes, let alone an hour and a half. Call it simply - Hawaii Five No!
