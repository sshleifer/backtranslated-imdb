It's hard for me to believe that this indifferent, turbulent and badly staged film is the work of a filmmaker, whose work I liked a lot. The experience of enduring the SPIRIT AND THE MOON (and not the other word, but "permanent" will do it), left me in a foul mood, condition only relieved by reading IMDb's commentary by ali-112. Rohmer has not only tried (and successfully) to force us to see the world through the art of 18th-century France, but, as Ali pointed out, it showed (at the expense of alienating its audience) the effects of both class consciousness and the revolution it inspired with the eyes of an infamous elite woman of your time. The director has done something undeniably difficult, but I wonder if it was worth the effort to do it - or watch the boring effects of his work.
