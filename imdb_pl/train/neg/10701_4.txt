The merry madcaps in London organize a treasure hunt with one young woman who accidentally gets her married politician with a strong, independent airman who has never been in love. The intriguing early vehicle of Katharine Hepburn, who plays the avant garde of Amelia Earhart, who was too involved to devote herself to any man. The director (Dorothy Arzner) and the screenwriter (Zoe Akins, who adapted Gilbert's book Frank) were obviously assigned to this project to get a feminine point of view, but why are all old stereotypes intact like frozen artifacts? Billie Burke plays a typical, tearful wife who goes to bed when something goes wrong, and the last scene of Hepburn is another bummer. Interesting artifact, but not classic for Kate observers. ** with ****
