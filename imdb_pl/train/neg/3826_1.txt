Shit, I thought I saw some bad westerns. However, I can not include it. Hell, I think I would prefer my eyes sewn together to get the Trinity Triple Feature for shouting out loud. I do not think I will be able to watch Ben Hur again without laughing at the ass. Just very bad. <br /> <br /> But hey, if you like stupid Westerns with renowned stars, take a look at Shoot Out with Gregory Peck. It's just as bad but much more fun. 1/10
