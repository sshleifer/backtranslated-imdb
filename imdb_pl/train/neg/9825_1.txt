This movie seems to send the wrong message. There can be morality without the use of Christ. I believe that people of other religions can get to heaven. I am a Catholic who goes to church every week, but I do not agree with such Christian arrogance. It's the worst movie about time travels I've ever seen and seen Timeline.
