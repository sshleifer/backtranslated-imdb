Generally, I do not take downs and if this page could give this movie -3 out of 10, I really hated this movie. I thought that Uwe Boll is alone in the dark was the worst I've ever seen, but at least I gave him 2.5 out of 10 in my belief (shooting Stephen Dorff did not make me laugh at all, so I raised my grade a bit). Hell, if it was against bloodrayne, Bloodrayne would win an Oscar for the best movie if they competed. <br /> <br /> Now, in the storyline, this movie tells the story of a BTK killer who's okay, but I could have done better. The beginning looked OK, but I had to fast forward because death is boring. I like killer movies, and even if they suck, they will still have cool deaths. I'm not an outstanding film expert, but believe me that he would have shot himself if he saw it. I am sorry for wandering, but there is nothing good to say because it looks like someone took a camera and filmed it ... it's something from a catastrophe. Uwe Boll Your videos are no longer on my list of the worst movies ever made this cake. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, I could not explain the story (if it was), but it was the best I could. Now, if you do not mind, I'm going to crawl into a corner and move back and forth and remind me how bad the movie has scared me into my whole life ... OK, not for life
