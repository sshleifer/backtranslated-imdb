I saw this film twice in the pentecostal church, in which my family participated in Nanaimo in the '70s. I was 6 years old, my brother was 4, and then when I was 8, my brother 6. This movie frightened my brother and me and shaped the way we look at the world with distrust. It was not just a movie, but also a philosophy that absorbs so many "Christians" of the "mark of the beast" and delight. This film, church and impermanent, neglected upbringing lead to serious paranoia towards the future. For years I have been influenced by the illusions of the Church and the fear of being forgotten by Christ. I am 40 now. He went through counseling years. I once explained to the psychiatrist this film and belief system in the church and family. I was associated with a delusional disorder. Actually, I started to believe it, my brother reminded me that this cult philosophy actually happened. I am not afraid of the future, I have reconciled myself with the fear of the Church injected by its members. I have taken this experience to achieve my goal, I am approaching obtaining a license as a psychologist specializing in the trauma of childhood.
