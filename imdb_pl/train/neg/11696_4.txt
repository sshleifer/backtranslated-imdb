I started watching this movie with low expectations, in fact I noticed it just because it was an adaptation of S.K. novel (a novel I have never read). <br /> <br /> I am glad that my expectations were low because the film was not good, but he manages to interest you. What really drags on this story is the work done by the director and the actors. The film is exaggerated, there are no "cool" photos and horror, the dialogues are stupid and the special effects are nonsense. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is good is that, as I said, it keeps the People interested (unless the book must be good) without using a film of horror. <br /> <br /> My vote 4/10.
