Words can not begin to describe how awful this movie is. I would like it to be "so bad that it is good", but it is not. It's just boring, lifeless and boring. It's so bad that I could not even laugh at it. <br /> <br /> In response to other posters, Anne-Marie Frigon is not the highlight of the movie. The only less charismatic person is the director Brett Kelly, who as a true statement about vanity lunged at the male leader. They both look like inbreeds, sister and brother. <br /> <br /> Gal, Sherry Thurig, is an observer. The complete opposite of Anne-Marie - attractive. This girl is tall and slim and able to act. Although you can say that he is holding back. <br /> <br /> It looks like all the actors are holding back, especially the supporting man, Mark. I've seen less wood in the rainforest, but it's still better than Kelly. Why would Kelly stop the actors from acting? Is there really such a bad director? Everyone else summarized the story perfectly - there is no such. The children are kidnapped, and Kelly falls into a pile to solve the crime. I know how he felt when he came in, I felt like that after watching his movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, I tried to get money from the rental company. This is a home movie that is best left to watch by the director's friends (and if you search them, you'll see the same friends who gave the film positive ratings).
