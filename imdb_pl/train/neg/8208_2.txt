"Hey, everyone! I have an idea, we found this object in the shape of an egg from space, so why do not we thaw it and open it? "" Yes, I know it would be the stupidest thing a scientist could do, and it could be filled with polluted bacteria or viruses unknown to Earth and potentially destroy the human race, but hey, I want to know what's in it. " "And no one will tell NASA, they can take it away from us." "Wow, this thing is vibrating!" "Yes, really strong in touch, so do not touch it, but you can cut it." "Hi, handsome, check my nip". (Later that day); "DO NOT OPEN"!!!!! We have to run to the lab and tell them not to open it, because we do not have telephones, radios or intercoms, although we have other equipment worth millions of dollars here. "I've never seen such organic technology!" "Yes, lemme, take this stick and stab it." "I'm leaving, I do not care if I kill the other 6 billion people on Earth, no one is a nukkin" me! "Look! They are friendly aliens from the "Abyss"! They want us to come with them. " END
