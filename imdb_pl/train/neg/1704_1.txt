You would not expect such a film to be good, and it is not. This is not a budget, very brutal movie about a zombie filmed with a bad handheld camera ... and it's fun. Actors have apparently never acted before, as can be seen in their horrible funny readings. You can not see any conspiracy. It seemed to me that the small conspiracy was that the government experiment had escaped, and a group of zombies appear to terrorize several families. The gore effects are in fact one of the most troublesome I have ever seen. It seems that people from upstairs have invaded a butcher shop on all parts of the body, and many scenes involve zombies that dismember people and eat their organs. It's a fun and disgusting movie that's as bad as any movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 90 minutes.
