There are movies like "Plan 9" that are so bad that they have a charm, they are like "Waterworld" that have the same inexplicable fate as a car accident, and they are like "Desperate living" that you hate to admit that you love. Cowboys do not have any of these buyouts. The assembled cast has enough talent to make almost any conspiracy observable, and from what I've been told, the book is nice. <br /> <br /> So how can this movie be so unacceptably bad? First of all, it seems that the director has collected a set of names with no other tie than what will bring 20 things. Then tell them to do their best Kevin Costner imitations. Open the book at random and start photographing everything on the page, making sure that the wide spaces of America are of no interest. Finally, give editing to your brother-in-law because the meat packing plant just released it. He has twenty years of experience in cutting. <br /> <br /> This movie is now a basement for me. It's so bad that it's not even good at being bad.
