This movie was slower than the melas in January ... in Alaska. The man who placed the togeather in the preview should receive a management reward for each of the 30 seconds that entered the preview. Several times I had to wake up the people I watched. After all this, I felt bad that I woke them up. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie is taken with the hope that something will happen, but nothing happens. It was easy to lose the motives of people, and the figures were flat and did not bother. At the end of the movie, you hoped everyone would die. Everyone runs around or is contemptible, petty or pathetic, and usually all three. <br /> <br /> And what's worse, we watched a minute or two of added features, just for kicks and giggles that you understand, and all we've seen is people happy about how socially conscious they are. If they spent time on a movie that they patted on the back, it could be worth a look. <br /> <br /> I was brought in, expecting excitement from '24. I gave a lecture on social awareness through the black eyes of a Sandman.
