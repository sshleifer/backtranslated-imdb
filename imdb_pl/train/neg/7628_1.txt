Black and white film. Good photography. Reliable characters. <br /> <br /> Just awful. <br /> <br /> I wasted another perfect evening watching a movie that another rated as "worthy" and "very good". There is some good action here, and setting the plot for the story is good (more should be done with it), but it grows very slowly and never develops. It's completely based on sex without much affair with very unnecessary nudity. More could be done with the main heroes. If you're looking for something that you can watch with your family, it's not in the movie, and if you do not, you'll have trouble sitting. Although this movie is long, it is only 1 inch deep!
