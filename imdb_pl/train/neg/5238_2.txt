I do not understand the positive comments about this film. It's cheap and nasty at all levels and I can not understand how it happened. <br /> <br /> Abounds in cartoon characters - father's foul Sue, alcoholic, layman, Irish father. None of the characters is nice - except, in short, Asian boy Sue, but even he turns out to be capable of domestic violence! As desperately unattractive as I am, I have no idea why Rita and / or Sue would have jumped on a perfect crawler like Bob - but given that this is happening, why should I worry about what will happen to them? So many reviews still care about how "realistic" it is. If this is true, it is a sad reflection on society, but there is no reason to put it on film. <br /> <br /> I did not like the movie at all.
