It's funny that I'm forced to review the movie, but here I am. <br /> <br /> I'm looking at it because recently I had the opportunity to witness the revival of R.C. Sheriff's "Journey's End" on the stage in New York, in the Belasco Theater, with the participation of Hugh Darcy, Boyd Gaines, Jefferson Mays and others, as well as the masterly director David Grindley. <br /> <br /> I left the theater broken. I'm not exaggerating, I was stunned. After almost two and a half hours of the reconstructed and very claustrophobic representation of the life of a soldier in Sommy trenches (I speculate), during the First World War, animated live, by all involved, I left the theater with shakes. <br /> <br /> Remember that I am not easily shocked, nor am I too sensitive. I am a stage actor and director myself, so I know that the buttons are pressed to achieve some effects, both emotional and psychological. <br /> <br /> But what I just witnessed came alive so much that when I left I had chills in my spine. <br /> <br /> None of these emotions came to life, watching "Aces High", a movie based on this play, and even adapted to the screen, in collaboration with RC Sam sheriff, shortly before his death. <br /> <br /> Film adaptation takes place in the sky over France. So moving away from the claustrophobic atmosphere at the beginning. <br /> <br /> The only benefit of the film are air battle scenes that look outdated in their special effects, compared to today's standards, but are still very important in the tactics of flying adopted on the screen. <br /> <br /> It was admitted that there were several screenings of "Silent on the Western Front" by Erich Maria Remarque, which takes place in trenches, not in the sky, but it was a "German" vision of things, if someone would like to be picky in such matters. <br /> <br /> "End of the journey" is just the other side of the coin that would make it a great movie if they left it alone and intact. <br /> <br /> The DVD transfer is weak, although on a widescreen and adapted to 16: 9 TV screens, the quality of the movie itself is like that of a movie. Nothing more nothing less. Sport has various disadvantages, such as minor scratches and dots, although the rest is clean. <br /> <br /> If you want to have another World War I movie in your collection, especially for those who like to watch the air battles among the elderly, this is a photo for you. But I would rather suggest that "Von Richthofen and Brown" as an alternative, though, and this is a film full of inaccuracies. <br /> <br /> For the rest of you who love good acting and drama, I would like to leave this one. Buy a game. Go see the play if you have a chance to have a decent rebirth in the vicinity, but stick to this would-be adaptation. <br /> <br /> This is an anti-war movie, awarded, but the weakest I have never seen in my life. <br /> <br /> The presence of actors like Trevor Howard, Ray Milland, Richard Johnson and John Gielgud is just a bluff because they are seen very weakly and very short episodic roles throughout the film. <br /> <br /> McDowell, very talented Christopher Plummer, Simon Ward and Peter Firth, all have very poor results, not because of lack of skills but because of their lack of truth and solid direction. <br /> <br /> There are too many gaps in it and, as said earlier, it stretches to a dubious end. Doubtful, because in the original art none of the men we meet and sympathize with are dead. They all died in a deadly and futile mission. In the movie, everyone dies, except for Malcolm McDowell, who somehow manages to survive another day, being the commander of the unlucky group's wings, just to get another three pilots to fly and die for another lost case. <br /> <br /> The end of the spectacle leaves the naked scene in total darkness. You just hear the roar of cannons, the rattles of machine guns and grenades hit the theater. Then suddenly, total peace and quiet. The curtain is coming. Light. And here everyone is. Stacked, standing straight and stiff. Posłuszne zwłoki ... <br /> <br /> Much more interesting and much more shocking than the final "Aces High", which is also dragged through the hair. <br /> <br /> It's up to you to score. <br /> <br /> For me, if I had money and contacts, I would take the game and develop it, just as it was supposed to be. Adding here and there some action scene in the field, just to imagine "external" horror and slaughter on "wide fields of France", around the people involved, but then, strictly focusing on what is happening, this tiny " szałas "na skraju rozumku i świata ... <br /> <br /> Do you want such a movie? <br /> <br /> Then ask for it. <br /> <br /> That's not it.
