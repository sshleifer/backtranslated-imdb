Frenetic shotgun lead by incestors with vengeance looking for truck drivers and obsessive control disorders "Daddy raped me when I was 12 years old, wearing handcuffs", all latex wearing prostitutes are just some of the characters who will be introduced to you in this complete disgrace of the movie that you can easily watch on any cable TV station (IE: Skinemax) at 4 am on Sunday evenings. (? Yes, I know it was the whole sentence, but the people exposed by me, this is a long-lasting review of a short aimless movie). <br /> <br /> Filmed in "somewhere" in Canada, with almost no budget, the plot of this bizarre show is banal, the police in it apparently never heard of "State Jurisdiction" because they finally chase both Miya (Hookers) as well as Trent (an idiotic, anal retentive, generic, insecure student) USA (and I thought only the FBI could do it). The camera is shaky, the sex scenes are mediocre and the acting is so bad that it can cause unintentional acidic retrospections of films like "Ishtar" and "Leonard Part 6". <br /> <br /> When it comes to scenes with skin go (which is the only reason to even borrow this movie, do not even think about buying it) are two of them. The first one is the only one worth watching, which is the Dominatrix Sex scene with Kari Salin and ____ (put in an unknown actor here, apparently did nothing worth noticing) in the dingy, disgusting Motel room (such as the broken sink that drips, and the machine to carbonated drinks outside, which has only blue tonic water). It's all S & M (horses, handcuffs, hot wax and underwear licking), and eventually he stays in the motel room, without the money and cops waiting at his door (it shows you guys, do not let the prostitute tie you in the middle of nowhere in the motel). Unfortunately, Kari does not show any skin, which is worth remembering, and the same can cause deep traumatic experiences for some gentlemen, so it is definitely worse in relation to this movement. <br /> <br /> As for the ending, * Snicker * Snicker * I know you probably would not mind if I told you, but I will not do it, you should spend your hard earned money on it. In total, I give him 1/5 for the action, 3/5 for the skin (see last paragraph) and 0/ for acting, character development or complicated twists. <br /> <br /> - Laughing Man
