This movie started out fun, but it quickly deteriorated. I thought it would be more "adult-oriented" humor based on the first few moments, but then the movie went into a bad mode like the Disney Channel, especially the go-kart racing scene, which was incredibly long. Alana De La Garza is great, but she has a really fake Italian accent. The film looked and sounded very independent and on a low budget. There was one very sweet moment, which I call the serenading scene, but generally it was a yawn. Laughter is very few. The final surprise for "Mr. Fix It is so absurd that it's more crazy than anything else. Maybe you should watch it if you can catch it for free or on TV, but do not waste money on buying or renting this movie.
