It would have to be one of the worst, if not the worst, movie I've almost seen. (I could not see it). Purely and simply unjustified violence only because of this absurd plot adds only weak and incompetent filming. Sick. And it is only suitable for those who love maniacal mutilation. After murdering a few hundred men, women and children, Seed is finally caught after trouble-free killing several more policemen who finally get a tip about where to stay. He was sentenced to death by an electric chair and miraculously survived! Buried alive, digs up and plots revenge on those who pushed him away and switched the switch. Needless to say, there are more macabre murders ...
