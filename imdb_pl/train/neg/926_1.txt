This film is about Tyrannus, a gladiator who was brought down from the dead, to summon Tyrannus, a gladiator who must be brought back from the dead. Tyrannus, who we learn after about an hour, is also called Demonicus. This gives the scenario much needed depth and puts into question our assumptions about identity, psychology and ourselves. <br /> <br /> The spirit of Tyrannus reaches its small list of things to do (killing people and repeating Latin phrases in Latin), having the body of a guy. For this he uses a magic helmet that controls the mind, which a college boy eagerly puts on his head, and then starts and returns at several points in the film. <br /> <br /> Maria performs oral sex in a case of Sean Willian Scott from a poor man, and Tyrannus wears a ball glove. Tyrannus has his own green backlight for no reason, and apparently he has been sitting next to the CG fire in an ancient concrete tunnel for centuries. Total misfortune. <br /> <br /> This movie is empty and will hurt you. Look at this.
