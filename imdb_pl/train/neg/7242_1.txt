Pallbearer is a disappointment, and sometimes extremely boring with a love story that just does not work thanks to the cast of Gwyneth Paltrow (Julie). Gwyneth Paltrow goes through the whole movie with a confused expression and it's hard to say what David Schwimmer can even see. <br /> <br /> Pallbearer is, however, sometimes funny, especially the church scene and group scenes with his friends are laughter, but that's basically it. Watch The Pallbearer only for these scenes and scroll forward. Trust me, you do not lack much.
