A phenomenal achievement in horrors. This is really fun. <br /> <br /> First ... Nicholas Cage must now get to the final in the Over-Emoting category in his acting class. Wearing new hair plugs and raising your face so many times that his ears are at the back of an effort to touch from behind, he exudes not only a sick rage, but creates a character of a "hero" you are not interested in. <br /> <br /> I do not know what it is with Neil Labute and female characters. It makes women completely perverted and bad ... and pays them, ordering Cage to hit some of them directly in the face and call them all "b **** es" several times. I liked the early LaBute movies and a few of his plays ... but it's a strange fascination. <br /> <br /> I would give this movie 2 out of 10 only on the basis of Ellen Burstyn's performance. Before he finally appears (brave soldier through his scenes with a clearly visible line of wigs on his forehead), it seems that all hope can be lost. He deserves Oskar here and now for telling her with straight lines, and when he appears in the white mummy and blue, white and gold paint on the face of the Wicker Man, you know that working with Scorcese and Friedkin really prepared her for this role she did well . <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad and cuckoo that you have to believe it. <br /> <br /> The most important is: Nicholas Cage runs away from the swarm. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage steals a bike and looks like Mrs. Gulch from The Wizard of Oz riding on him. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage runs around the island throwing the door in search of a missing girl. <br /> <br /> Leelee Sobieski TRACKING with a promising acting career in the "fight" with Cage. <br /> <br /> Ellen Burstyn dances in said during Mumu. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage screams "Who burned him? Who burned him? Who burned him? Who burned him? Who burned him? Who burned him? "For no reason. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage in a bear outfit (I'm not kidding) I'm running through the woods, I'm taking off my costume (but I'm leaving bears on my feet), and then I'm doing some karate moves to some <br /> <br /> And you're dead until you see the last 15 minutes of the movie and its horrible epilogue that looked like it was filmed yesterday in your cousin's basement. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, if you manage to go through this movie without loud laughter, you deserve a medal. In the movie there was a moment when I stopped laughing, wondering if it was not a complicated movie of "hysterics" ... but remember when Cage shouted / shouted / whispered his dialogue that he really took himself seriously. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is supposed to be a cult movie from scratch ... just because it's so scary.
