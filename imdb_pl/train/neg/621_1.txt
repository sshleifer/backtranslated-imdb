Holy @ #% and this movie was still warm and juicy from the stack from which it was made. I tried to watch this pile of festering wastes, but it was easier for me to cut my wrists and knock down the Lysol floor cleaner, than to withstand half the crap on the screen. I rate it much below anything I've ever seen in a movie or TV, and it says something. I once witnessed cow's nonsense in the field. For an hour and a half I watched the steaming pile, who knows ... could move or something. It was a better time to watch these guts. Acting did not exist, the plot was somewhere else than in this film. I think I saw a cut seen earlier, when the story managed to escape and rode in the background on an old pickup going to Portland in the hope that Steven King Shi77er would stay. Please tell me that the director gets the medicines he needs so badly. It is quite clear that he needs heavy medicines, and I would like to direct the money needed to reverse his lobotomy. Bah ... I can not give this review the full blow he needs, because nothing so painful can ever be done just in the written word itself. Let me just say that if you are looking for a move to pass some time and see this Chilton on the stand, approach the car, start the engine, then push both fists straight into the fan until you feel your bones vibrate. Make sure you have a wallet in your hand because you're going to waste your cash anyway. You might as well have the privilege of wasting it on your own. <br /> <br /> By the way, I watched it after my "buddy" sent his girlfriend to see her. HE did not come in, she too. What's worse, she had to watch this $% & @ two thing! I heard their wife and he can visit his balls once a month. I hope it's because of this movie.
