It was one of the most absurd and ill-targeted movies I've seen in a long time. I never liked Spike Lee, but I thought I would try it: a bad mistake. The film is to show how the murders of the Son's life hit the countryside in the summer of 1977; what really happened was focused around the most boring people who doubt that anyone would care for their drug problems, marital problems, etc. Scenes depicting murders are just that and nothing more; shooting, and then return to the fever of Saturday night! What's even more absurd is the choice of Spike Lee to appear as a reporter in the movie: Spike, trust me, you're not Hitchcock, stay away from the movies, it's even worse. The most stupid scene must have been a dog who spoke in a dumb voice, which was presented on the stage in front of him, where he was supposed to be shot ??? Spike, what did you think when you did the movie? I guess I do not think at all. People who think they will see a crime drama, take my advice and do not waste time or money on this loser. It will be better to watch Jerry Springer in this case! Loss of the film, I gave him 1 in 10: a terrible dud.
