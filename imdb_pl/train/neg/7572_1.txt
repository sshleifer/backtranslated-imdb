I felt like I was watching this movie a thousand times before. It was absolutely predictable. Whenever history tried to spin a little, every time I expected something interesting, I saw nothing but what I expected. Like "The bread factory opened another object, because there was not enough bread." In two words: A flat story that became a clich√©, bad acting, bad special effects ... Only a stupid Russian policeman, Vlad, was a bit funny when he punished bad guys. The pile of muscles was so stupid STUPID that I laughed at him for a moment. I wonder why I'm wasting my time spitting on this shame from the movie ... It will not be worse (because it's not possible): D
