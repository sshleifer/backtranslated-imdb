- Let me begin by saying that I understand that the Star Wars Invasion was supposed to be a parody of science fiction movies from the 1950s. I understand that none of this should be taken seriously. I have a problem with the fact that none of them work. A parody should be fun, and it simply is not. Not once during the entire work time I did not make such a big smile. In general, it's easy for me to have fun, but I could not find entertainment anywhere in the Star Wars Invasion. <br /> <br /> - I knew I was in trouble from the very beginning. Two "stars" look like screens with one of the worst gags you can imagine - a water hose that they can not control, which makes them both wet. These two are like the Bowery Boys. Why would anyone want to imitate the act and character of Boys from Bowery is beyond me. After the not too-significant beginning, the films go to comical chase sequences, dancing Indians, herbivores, decoder rings and other various hilarious pieces. It is only a complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> - I bought it on a double DVD with Invasion of the Bee Girls. This film is an Oscar-winning thing compared to the Star Invasion.
