First and foremost, let me say that I am LDS, or rather I am a Mormon. So when I watched this movie, I automatically took advantage of the doubt. Usually I can find something that can be used in every movie I watch. And this one was no exception. He has his redeeming moments. But they are few. <br /> <br /> One of the first things I noticed worried me a lot because it seemed that Halestorm was ashamed of our Church! In the LDS church the congregations are called "branches", and the basketball court is in the "cultural hall". NEVER mention any of these two names. The Church is never called a name, and "standards" are as far as she remembers what our Church believes. <br /> <br /> I wonder if the directors are really LDS or LDS seekers? This movie had so much potential! This could really show our church in a positive light and help the public see not only what we have to offer, but also what we believe in. Instead, he was only slightly playful and left much to be desired. If I were not LDS anymore, I would have thought that Mormons are stupid, idiotic and ashamed of their beliefs. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie that I recommend to my nieLDS friends. <br /> <br /> I apologize to Halestorm. You can do better than this!
