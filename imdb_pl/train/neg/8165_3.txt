It's a ghost story. This is a story of cannibalism. This is a story of revenge. This is a very badly made movie with a lot of violence. I suppose he follows you according to every movie you've ever seen. He usually has a secluded place, conceited campers heading for the desert. Of course, there are some very intense scenes. It's so boring. Bad edition and the whole works. There are ghost children who sound like they're talking in a trash can. I'm not sure what rules the ghosts and psycho are playing with the cap. It also has a thick scene in which a man eats a piece of meat, actually what was left of his wife. A friend of mine once asked me why it is necessary to demonstrate this kind of unjustified, sick violence. I am afraid that this is just another step in our desensitized evolution. Three are not cunning, there is no cheek, only a sad waste of time. A lot of blood; a small plot.
