It was just a terrible movie. It hurts to watch me. Almost every action was not motivated in the context of the film, the acting was really poor (P.Diddy was the best actor who really says something about the film), and the plot was generally predictable. Some links to the Way of Carlito were fine, for example his dream of moving to Carribien, but overall they were weak. Interest in love in my opinion was wrong, but hey, it's debatable. In any case, I really did not expect much before watching the movie and I think that even those expectations were not met. I feel bad with Jay Hernandez because he is a decent actor (Friday Night Lights). He's lucky because I'm sure there will not be too many people watching this movie. Generally, I give films a decent rating if they arouse my interest at all, so I'm going to go ahead and give it to the two stars. More luck next time. And yes, I was enjoying the way Carlito.
