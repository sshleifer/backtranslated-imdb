Jean Rollin artistic nonsense about vampires, aliens and the quest for immortality. <br /> <br /> Women are beautiful and the photo is stunning. The dialog window is inactive. It's a funny mess. It's great to look at, but like any appearance of horror or thriller it's totally awful. I am trying to find out whether we should be afraid or not. At the same time is it turned on or not? This is a strange mix of artistic film and horror, which is never complicated enough and although it is nice to look at it, it never seems to "mean" anything, and it is by no means terrifying, even if occasional shots or sequences create moments of despair pretentious talk. Something that can be left in the background as a living wallpaper for those who like naked women.
