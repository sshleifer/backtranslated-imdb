I rented this movie thinking that it was a sad version from 1959 that I saw as a child. There was no. So I was very disappointed with what I felt, was a marginal action, poor development of the character, and above all the lack of emphasizing the relationship between the boy and his dog. In this version ... "Flanders Dog" is just a sweet "side" to the film. Download the version from 1959!
