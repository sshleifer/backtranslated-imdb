There were more interesting Polish documentaries about breeding worms in Brail_ !! The competition (worm breeding) had a better plot and more interesting characters. I was physically sick after watching this movie. The fraudulent husband (I think that dougray_scott_) was a joke in every sense of the word. Poor Jennifer really needs a job and what was an accent !! Locations and random encounters reminded me of a high school joke and showed the humbleness of a 10-year-old in cooking class. It was so bad that I think I will write a sequel called "this is not loose". Thank you for listening, it was a great burden of my consciousness.
