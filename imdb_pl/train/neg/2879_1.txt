It was the worst movie I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of bad movies. First of all, I'm from Kansas, but there is not a bit of truth in this movie. It's as if they took the name BTK and completed the rest. Besides, it looks as if someone only has $ 20 dollars, take it and make a movie and oh yeah, do not worry about researching btk, just think of something. seriously clean, no one should watch this movie. Slaughtering scenes of cows and making his victims eat and describe the slaughter of animals, BTK did not do any of these things, but the movie does it out of love for God, never see this horrible movie of God. Created for televisions they are much better and more accurate
