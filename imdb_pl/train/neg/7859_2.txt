My God. This movie was terrible. I can not complain about it too much. I went to see it just to get lost. It was enough. It's funny that the most disgusting part of the movie was at the very beginning, when a woman is extremely lively forced to give birth to a terribly mutated child. <br /> <br /> I also think it's funny that the most notable actor in the film was a Latin soldier who was a supporting actor on the following Friday. Everyone in the movie did a terrible job of acting. These were some of the worst acts I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I also expected that it would be much more macabre than the first one. There was no. I was expecting it to be more gruesome because it's a sequel and a horror game whose sequels are usually much less successful than their predecessors. I expected it to be more gruesome, because gore and violence usually sell horror (Grudge 2, Saw 3, Jeepers Creepers 1 and 2, Dead Silence), but in reality it was not as gruesome as the first, which was another disappointment . <br /> <br /> The mutants in the first were a bit disturbing, but the filmmakers tried so hard in this one to make them terrifying that they were absolutely hilarious. <br /> <br /> I also hated the whole concept of showing a soldier's son's clip on her camera phone saying "I love you, mommy" FOUR TIMES. It was stupid to show it first, because they tried to make us feel worse for an unarmed mother than the rest of the soldiers, and it was even more stupid to try to make even the HOT one feel for her, showing it three more times without reason. This movie was a joke.
