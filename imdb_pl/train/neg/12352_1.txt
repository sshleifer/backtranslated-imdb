<br /> <br /> How this movie won the 6-star average is beyond me. The script is so trivial and, to be honest, an insult to people on whom life is based. Pictures come straight from the world of advertising, and talented Ridley Scott should be ashamed. Demi Moore, however, does not surprise taking part in this movie if you look at her song list. In general, a movie in the style of a "high concept" that Don Simpson would even be ashamed of.
