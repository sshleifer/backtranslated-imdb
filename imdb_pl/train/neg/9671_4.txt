Perhaps I would give 6 or 7 of this propaganda film, because it shows when and how the propaganda film is successful. If there are people who watch this song and think that "well, the Jews had to do something to be treated as they were treated in the Second World War," the film is very cleverly created to hide "why and how", and also mix correctly and false observations about people's lives. What can a propaganda film want? The part where the American film about the Rothschild family is located is again used here, for example. One never asks why a Jew keeps his property away from the officer. Nobody mentions the system of taxation in this particular social layer. <br /> <br /> In addition, the level of excitement (or the level of disgust) in the film grows slowly, and a solution reminiscent of the end of the film fits the purpose and necessity of doing propaganda. The audience will leave with joy and gratitude to the coming times ... well done. <br /> <br /> In the film there is a kind of simplicity, which refers to the most basic emotional perception of recipients. Film is a kind of history today, so there is no need to really talk about it. However, in this simplicity of words of ethnic degradation, a careful observer can find meaning for today's cultural hatred, violence, civilization, as well as integration problems. Overall, great rubbish.
