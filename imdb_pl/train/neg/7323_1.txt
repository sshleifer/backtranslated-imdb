Well, unlike other comments I've written, I must say that the only advantage of this movie is that one guy in it looked a bit like Jason Donavon, who reminded me of my youth. I have no idea how he won any prizes, and although I am sure that a lot of effort was put into his creation, everything was fruitless, because the final result is one that screams about foreign soap operas from the 90s. The story did not exist, the pictures were hopeless, and the acting was on par with the performance on the level. Unfortunately, it was not long, and the subcategories were incredibly unreal ... for example ... if your best friend slept with an ex-boyfriend for 6 years after only 2 weeks of breakup, not everyone would be the best friends. It was all fantasy. That's all! Oh yeah, and the indie house / soft core of the strange 90's was a paralyzing mind!
