I did not expect much after this film, but boy-o-boy, I did not expect the movie to be so bad. Chris Rock does not show good behavior here, you can not feel that his caracter is real, I think the movie would be a bit better if it was a drama or romantic scenes that would be a smaller part of the movie / better humor was involved. The film is such that the filmmakers had a bad hangover. In "creating" they do not show a single smile. It's a very bad movie! I gave him three to ten because of the few smiles he gave me, but I never dared!
