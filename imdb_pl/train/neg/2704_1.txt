I do not understand why people would praise this rubbish. This is bad, stupid, unrealistic, horrible and almost everything else. The film is a picture of life, racial issues, prejudices and everything that is strangely happening at the College. It fails there. There is no embrace of reality. From many questionable stupid scenes in the movie, such as, for example, <br /> <br /> a black man chasing a white man with a gun, a black man and being arrested by handcuffed guards and executed while the gunsman runs right next to them. <br /> <br /> The same white man who snipers people on the roof topic, who is stopped and beaten by the same black man, is stopped and beaten in the style of Rodney King, while the man works for free, and the moment later he is hunted back only by one of the four guards. <br /> <br /> As noted by one of the previous reviewers A few men weighing 230 pounds were beaten by several black men weighing about 160 pounds, including 105 pounds Bust A Rymy <br /> <br /> Another disadvantage of the film there are shallow, uninteresting main characters. From frightened and confused white people and vile, evil, and full-fledged (?) Black people. It's almost as offensive to both black and white people. I am a white man and I know many black and latin people who agree that this movie is wrong, presenting characters and giving them these qualities solely because of their race. <br /> <br /> The story, which I now explain, revolves around three characters. One black athlete, the other a confused scared white girl who challenges her sexuality, and the third is a white man who is also confused and scared, and then blames his problems on black people in which he becomes a Nazi later in the film. Everyone has problems and adventures, including sex, rape, fighting, love, hatred, prejudice, racial war, and yes, do not forget about education. Which finally comes down to deadly shooting. In which after returning to boring lives and think that "being white is bad." Does this sound sound like your years of study? I did not think so. I do not think the director would go to college, especially if he was to do this terrible mess. <br /> <br /> Generally, this is a really bad, bad, ugly movie. If you want to see a more detailed view or racial issues, go to American History X. If you want to see a more detailed view of the Porkys college rental. Just avoid this mess.
