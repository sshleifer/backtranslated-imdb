I recently saw this film at a film festival. This is the affair of a former unemployed alcoholic who has just emerged from a great depression and a lonely middle-aged woman who works in a labor office (INEM). The story was very simple and full of stereotypes, taking on the theme of "social" film and transformed it into a romantic comedy. The main actor did a good job, he definitely looks like an alcoholic, but Ana Belen is not credible as a working-class woman, looks, works and speaks very much like a "high-level" woman. I mean, Ana Belen is playing alone. And so he does it in all his films. The entire film scene was very poor. Photography is ugly, not making good use of all panoramic proportions. In most cases, the dialogue sounds completely like a script and is boring. Comic situations are typical of Gomez Pereira, but in this case they are not funny and poorly solved. In my opinion, this movie is not worth watching. Only if you really love previous Pereira movies, you can enjoy it a little. In any case, I left the theater because I felt that I was wasting my time. The filmmaker was at the door. I wonder what the director feels when he sees someone coming out of one of his films, especially one that is to please everyone.
