What is this ? A comedy about a low budget? In any case, he perfectly describes people in Spain. They could have come up with a better idea, that is, they have been making these kinds of movies since the '60s and people like them! This is not a comedy for teenagers or family (you can not let your 12-year-old boy watch 2 guys kissing in bed, he will never want to go to Spain). This should be rated as "R" because only people 35+ seem to laugh watching: S I'm really disappointed, maybe I do not like gay (which is quite an important part of the movie). <br /> <br /> Foreign humor is awful in movies (except for Kusturica), hold on to making dramas! If you want a new comedy, try Talladega Nights
