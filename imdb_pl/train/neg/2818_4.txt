Genie (Zoe Trilling) arrives in Egypt to visit his hypocritical, quoting biblical archaeologist (William Finley) and draws the attention of a group of cultists headed by the descendant of the Marquis de Sade (Robert Englund). Englund also plays de Sade in flashbacks, talking in his cell. Genie is led astray by Mohammed (Juliano Merr), who rides naked on horseback, and Sabina (Alona Kamhi), a bisexual who introduces her to smoking opium, which leads to wild hallucinations involving topless harem dancers, a woman simulating oral sex on serpent, orgy and her proclaiming father in the background! Meanwhile, black members of the cult with a hood decapitate, pop out eyeballs and cut their throats. When Genie pours drugs into the tea, she imagines that De Sade was hanging from the cross, a golden woman in a deciduous string, and herself bleeding on a bed covered with snakes. That's all because he is the reincarnation of de Sade's lost love. <br /> <br /> This typically poor production of Harry Alan Towers is unnecessary, dingy and quite pointless, but the sets, costumes, photos and localization work are excellent and at least something is always happening. <br /> <br /> Score: 3 out of 10
