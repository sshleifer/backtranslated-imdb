Even with a cast that can boast such credible names as Val Kilmer and Lisa Kudrow, Wonderland gives no impression of the depth of the film. He hardly surrounds the surface of the incidents that occurred on the July night of 1981. Kilmer simply goes through the movements because John Holmes and Kudrow and Kate Bosworth hope they are poorly manned in the other two main roles; respectively as Holmes' wife and a minor girl. The rest of the cast has such small roles that it is impossible to get any dimensions from them. The film also features Carrie Fisher, Ted Levine, Franky G, MC Gainey, Dylan McDermott and an episode with Paris Hilton.
