After seeing this, I thought, there are too few good writers and directors or many producers. <br /> <br /> In any case, it's a horrible movie. It's horrible that it's not fun, but it makes you clench your teeth and tremble. It makes you shout "it's bad" in the movie. The draft is zero. Until now most of you are probably used to the terrible mistakes / quirks in movies where hackers are located, etc. This movie is so in every way. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about the film is Emily's little girl, greatly played by Eliza Bennett. I hope it will become big and that it will ... at least be worth it. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor. Do not watch this. There is not even a proper action in it. Total waste of time.
