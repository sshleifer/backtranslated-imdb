This excuse for television is the most horrible piece of trash that has ever hit Australian television. Roommates are dumb, uninteresting, ridiculously unintelligent, and chosen based on the fact that you'll probably try to murder them if you have to live with them. As far as I am concerned, Big Brother is the downfall of Western society, showing how we as a society are on a steep slope to become dead morons. Whatever happened to television, which was not addressed to the lowest common denominator of society as an audience? This can not be considered as entertainment. I think it's true that Ten's Channel can remove your soul. It happened to Rove McManus, once a respected comedian who, after moving to Channel 10, became terribly unpleasant. Except for The Simpsons, who is very intelligent.
