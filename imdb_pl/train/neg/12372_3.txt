I had high expectations for this film (the translated title is "How we got rid of others"). The concept is wonderful: in the near future, in which the ruling elite took the consequences of the persecution of right-wing government by right-wing so-called supporters and left-wingers, they just decided to kill everyone who can not prove that he brings something to the establishment (the establishment is called "the common good" "But in reality means the interests of the ruling capitalist ideology). <br /> <br /> Very nice idea! Perfect for chewing satire! Only that this movie completely blows your chance. Satire appears only in a few scenes and performances of the absurd, but this satire is not sustained; it is neither sharp nor witty. And for the alleged comedy film has almost no funny scenes. I suppose comedy is in an absurd situation, but situations are largely uncomfortable and too serious, instead of inducing laughter or thought. <br /> <br /> The scenario is full of grave errors in disposition. The action should focus on the political aspects and how bad it would be to do such things, but instead the time is spent on a young woman who has written new rules for play and who is trying to save everyone by organizing resistance that sends people to Africa. It does not matter! A movie like this should not pretend to be so serious! It's satire! Political statement. But he does not even begin to deal with the problem he is about to be. Maybe he was afraid to go too far? Like cowardly. This is not art. This is not even a real satire. <br /> <br /> SÃ¸ren Pilmark, a very serious and currently one of the absolutely older actors in Denmark, was very good. To a large extent, he wore the low-entertainment value of the film. Everyone else: nothing special (well, except maybe Lene Poulsen, who provided a convincing performance). <br /> <br /> In fact, the problem with most films in Denmark is that language never sounds natural. Neither formula nor delivery. Why is it so difficult to sound correctly? Why must it be so stiff and artificial? I hope that when people watch these films in fifty years, they do not think that's what people in Danish society say. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
