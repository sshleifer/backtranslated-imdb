If this book remains true to the book, we can only assume that the author did not know the story. Mark Anthony never died because of injuries sustained in the battle, as shown. He died a coward's death by committing suicide, and even then he asked his slave to do it for him. The slave decided to kill. In true history, Mark Anthony was ashamed of the great bravery of a slave and decided to copy him. But even after his death Mark Anthony was a failure and suffered a suicide defeat. He called for Cleopatra and was taken to her, bleeding. She pulled her litter on the ropes, and Mark Anthony died a moment later. If you want history, do not watch this movie. If you want a romantic drivel, you'll probably like it!
