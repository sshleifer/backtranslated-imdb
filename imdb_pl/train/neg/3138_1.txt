I see people writing about how great this movie is. That was awful! Acting was below the norm at best. He made a lot of money because teenage girls went to see the movie 7 times in cinemas because of Leonard. Where the hell did they get the money? In any case, I wanted to learn more about the Titanic; why he sank, which ran through many human minds; maybe even a bit of a plot. Does anyone realize that some people did not even board the ship because a fire broke out on board before it even took off? No, no, because you see that a rich girl falls in love with a poor boy, and he paints her naked (will this dingy garbage at least tell you that the movie was stupid?). However, in one scene I cried. The scene when they showed the water that filled the ship. It looked like water in the pool! I think this movie has earned all this money and could not even make the ocean water look real? unbelievable ... <br /> <br /> Ohhh the band played when the ship sank ... Just ridiculous. It was the worst movie until Pearl Harbor overtook him in the "Nothing to do with reality" section.
