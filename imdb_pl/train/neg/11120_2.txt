You know that the movie is bad when the main attraction is the opportunity to see the short moment of "Jeopardy!". <br /> <br /> The saddest thing about White Men Can not Jump is that it has huge potential. For several years I lived in an area similar to the one shown in this film; racial tensions were high, and basketball meant everything to everyone. The film about the members of this "basketball culture" could have been very interesting, but the mediocre actor and poor scenario in White Men Can not Job left something to be desired. <br /> <br /> The sequence of events in the film is cyclical. First, Billy wins or loses money playing basketball. Then he returns home and rests with his girlfriend; and the process is repeated. Most stories have a climactic character, but the "climax" I saw was the next sequence of this repetition (in this case "Billy wins or loses playing basketball"). br /> To solve the plot, solve the dilemma; and this dilemma must be interesting if the film is also interesting. Apparently White Men Can not Jump writers have forgotten this principle, because the plot can be summarized as "Billy has to pay bills." I appreciate the change of pace from other sports movies, but - sorry - it was just awful. I could care less if Billy gets the money to pay the rent for her apartment. <br /> <br /> Despite this, White Men Can not Jump is a good movie. Apparently, some relentless sports fans reject terrible writing for a few scenes with basketball in them. I'm sure others have been lured by big names playing main roles. I wonder if if the cast was completely replaced by previously unknown actors, and the topic of basketball was replaced by lacrosse, would anyone bother to watch this movie? I really do not think so. <br /> <br /> I will give this movie two stars out of ten; an additional star is "Jeopardy!" a scene that would not let me fall asleep for a few minutes. Thanks, Trebek.
