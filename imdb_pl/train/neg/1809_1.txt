There is nothing I hate more than complacency of pretentiousness. Kevin Smith deserves to be caught by his toe nails for inspiring every white middle-class marauder to make a film about why you can not put them down. I do not mind inexperience and low-budget productions, but when writing is so obvious and depressing, it really burns my potatoes. The money that was put into it could be passed on to a real filmmaker who has a chance like John Gulager. If you view the Greenlight project, you will immediately recognize a talented visionary who is fighting the system. Everyone can grab the camera and make a chatty image that does not say anything at all. When will we be saved from the Smithonites and Whedonettes of the world? The revolution can not come fast enough. Go see the real first time, buying Desperado or looking for friends with benefits. Thank you and good day.
