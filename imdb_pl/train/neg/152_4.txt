You can consider several facts in the discussion as spoilers. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but Spielberg did not deserve to win any Oscar for this song and I think the Academy was right to vote. (Other Oscars for nominations for the best actors and ... I do not know about, but it would be difficult to justify what they were told and what they see in the final product.) The way Spielberg manages this is so invented, so nosy. While watching this film, the distinction made during the Film as Art course screamed at me: "The sentiment is a sincere emotion sincerely devoted. Sentimentality is sweet and unreal, a false view of life. " This is exaggerated sentimentality. When in real life two people begin to read aloud synchronously, how do Celie and Shug Avery sit on the bed, looking through Nettie's list they found? There are examples of this type of false behavior throughout the movie: all people crow around Miss Millie's car, then jump in unison like a flock of birds taking off when they leave; Harpo falls on the roofs of various buildings he's working on (a tacky slapstick); the whole party of revelers is moving massively from the chapel to the chapel, as if magically delighted with the choir's singing ... over and over again. Nothing is real. I even wondered if the name Harpo was chosen on purpose, because it is the real name of his wife Sophia, "Oprah", backwards. Spielberg is not over such a "pretty girl". <br /> <br /> It's not that Spielberg is not capable of honesty and emotion. Schindler's list was amazing and deeply touching for me, and I also admire Saving Private Ryan for his realism, even if the story is a bit invented.
