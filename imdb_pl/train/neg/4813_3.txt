I quit trying to determine what version I'm watching. The copyright at the end indicates 1983. And although this is not the most important part of my opposition to this film, I will say that watching the movie apparently made in the Aquarius Age (including long-haired hippie chicks and ugly carriages), but with a synthetic soundtrack from the years 80. is worrying. Extremely disturbing. <br /> <br /> My main complaint is HOW ACHIEVED BY FILMMAKERS THAT THE PALELIES ARE MOVING THE FRANKLIN ALIVE PATIENT. HOW TO ACHIEVE YOUR. <br /> <br /> Seriously, she is cute and similar, but in the two movies where I saw her - in this crapfest and the perfect Legend of Hell House - they kill her. > <br /> I would like to draw the attention of the film industry. Pamela Franklin apparently withdrew from business, but if she ever decides to take another movie and some cursed director of the director tries to kill her, ASK FOR AN EXTREME STEP. <br /> <br /> No one beats PAMEL FRANKLIN AND HAS BEEN WITH IT. I AM A PERFECT CROSS. FURY WAS EXTENDED. <br /> <br /> For fans of movie B looking for shit, you can do a lot worse. On the plus side, this is not a film that links Satanism in a peripheral and cautious way - this film is a hardcore satanic movie. <br /> <br /> Wonderful satanic ceremonies, baphomets, hallucinations, the absurd attack of rats - what else can you ask for. <br /> <br /> This wonderful work is almost ruined by the surprising, inoculated soundtrack of a 1980s synthesizer that is as unmatched to the movie as possible. The soundtrack reminded me of something you hear in The Equalizer. It's really bad. <br /> <br /> They also made Pamela Franklin crush her charming English accent, which was also quite rude, if not cruel cruelty (in relation to the viewer), as would be found in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I say we have the right to hear how Pamela Franklin speaks with his own voice. Who is with me? I could forgive everything else in this film, if they did not abuse Pamela Franklin. And so I throw the gauntlet, sir√≥w - EVERYONE WHO HAVE MESSAGES WITH PAMELKA FRANKLIN MESSES WITH ME. <br /> <br /> EVEN A FICTUAL CONTEXT. <br /> <br /> GOOD DAY, SIRS.
