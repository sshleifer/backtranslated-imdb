Have you ever had a nice picture in your mind that seemed nice to you if you were in the movie: how would seeing a detective peek through the fissures of the broken fence of an abandoned house? Is seeing a woman walking down the street that looks cold, intense and awfully vigilant? Yes. Imagine that you are extending this image to the whole movie, actually you have an idea for Broken, although there are no detectives in this movie, I use it only as a visual example. But an intense-looking woman is here and filled almost 99% of the time on the screen. I have nothing to complain about this woman, she is the perfect choice for this role. <br /> <br /> I consider myself an open-minded person who can enjoy all kinds of artistic expressions and can really enjoy some really moody things. It would be really fun if I could frame one scene from this movie and hang it on the wall. Let's be honest, acting is great. Some of the actors' facial expressions are what makes me watch. <br /> <br /> Now a problem with this movie. There is nothing more besides the mood here. The director basically got an idea and went beyond what was worth it. I do not think it's a spoiler if I say that the obsession is a "mirror". Let's face it, this unique idea is in the whole bloody place and all that the director had to work with. Of course, there are several phrases and phrases here and there. If you pay attention to it, eventually nothing will surprise you, pushing aside the obvious role-playing holes. <br /> <br /> Now I do not choose bones with this style of art because I enjoyed them most of the time. I still think that we should evaluate the art base on the medium she uses to express what artists want to express. The film is not a music track, an image, a picture, or even a poem, and certainly not just a nice image in the head. That's all plus a good story and character development. I consider Lynch's film style to be cheating. He is irresponsible and cheap and he is wasting a medium. For good reasons, we gave films 2 hours of film work. Therefore, we should evaluate this differently than by evaluating a single frame of images, such as photography or image. <br /> <br /> This movie is not entirely Lynch-like, thank God. It has linear development and finally came to the conclusion. There is not much history or character development. He presented himself rather seriously with characters composed of ordinary people, and thus distancing himself from other fantasies at least from the surface. It does not offer any explanation of the fantasy element or try to build a cohesive world around it. This strangeness came from nowhere and seems rather isolated and accidental. Maybe the coherence remains in the director's head, but from what I see, he did not put much effort into realizing it on the screen. <br /> <br /> What did he put in his effort then? It seems that he devoted a lot of effort to building the mood and enriching it with music. Music often built tension, which eventually turns into malice. It was only in the further part of the film that fear and tension materialized. <br /> <br /> In the end I felt that: OK, I know what you are trying to say here, but is this the point where you try to do, spending two hours building all these tensions? It is rather irrelevant to who the characters are and what life they have. We have very little information about who the heroes are. Everything we have is the circumstance that has just taken place. Disappointing, but I think the director did not have much material for work and it shows.
