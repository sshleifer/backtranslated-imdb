It was the worst movie I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> Not only does it have almost nothing to do with other American Pie movies, the story is obvious, flat and absolutely not fun. <br /> <br /> However, the girls are nice, but spending time watching cheap soft porn would probably be bigger than watching this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to be a very bad sex advertisement, created for an audience that is no more than 12 years old. <br /> <br /> I have never visited an American college, but I seriously doubt that anyone who did this really laughed at any stage. <br /> Save time, do something else.
