Probably the worst Bollywood movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> No plot line. Very small character development. <br /> <br /> Full of stupid and senseless humor. The whole film was chaotic and non-directional. There was no proper ending of the story. The airport was filmed in a shopping center. <br /> <br /> The same story is chewed over and over until you say "please, just move on!" Even the song and dance were pointless and badly directed. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie is that there were hot bods everywhere ... but then most Bollywood movies have it these days. <br /> <br /> Btw Nie jestem z Indianina <br /> <br /> 2/10
