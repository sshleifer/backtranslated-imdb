For those who decide whether to watch this movie and read these comments for insight, I first introduce these four words: Do not waste your time! "Chungking Express" was filmed, quickly hit and it looks like it was created entirely by someone standing in the queue of Hong Kong Burger King. I do not remember ever watching a movie with an assortment of such one-dimensional characters who tried to go through the mundane scenario! It is an absurd effort with a philosophically absurd dialogue (a man wanders into his flooded apartment and offers a stunning revelation that "tears can be dried with a handkerchief, but the water needs time to wipe"). The same figure is also seen in leading deep, meaningful contact with your towels, soap, stuffed animals, dirty underwear, etc. Trembling, wandering, manual work with the camera was another annoying feature that I could do without. And if that's not enough for you to vomit in your popcorn, we hear the ode of California's 60s Mamas and Papas, tearing the soundtrack over and over again during a particularly long sequence. <br /> <br /> Quentin Tarantino was responsible for bringing this loser to America through Rolling Thunder Productions, though I can not find out all over my life why a man with his talent will care. He was known for noticing: "I'm glad I love the movie so much." Many of us, however, hope that he will concentrate on making his audience satisfied with more valuable discoveries in the future.
