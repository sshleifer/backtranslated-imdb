I want to explain a few things. I do not know Ming-liang Tsai movies and I know art cinema well; I grow up in the seventies in the days of Goddard, Fellini, Bergman, Bertolucci and many others. <br /> <br /> Then the artistic films were really ART; like paint. People did it to express their inner feelings, without worrying about whether other people understand something. They were outside of commercial values; just look at old Antonioni (or early Picasso) and understand. <br /> <br /> Tian bian yi duo yun (The Wayward Cloud) has nothing to do with it. It is an opportunistic film aimed at deceiving judges and critics of the festival, playing many things without speaking. <br /> <br /> This story does not make sense. The lack of water causes the government to promote the use of watermelons for hydration. The girl in despair steals water from public toilet toilets. There is also the beginning of a porn (neighbor) who is trying to make a movie with an actress that he does not feel comfortable with. There is a romantic awakening between a girl and a porn star. The mess ends with a sexual (non-pornographic) scene that many people shake, but I believe it is less provocative than you can see in American Pie or History of Violence. <br /> <br /> Two main characters never talk. Sometimes the musical style number 60 appears and explains (through a song) what is happening in the minds of the character. These video clips are really welcome, because the previous scene, without a dialog or music, only people looking at each other, sometimes takes 4, 5 or even more minutes, which in the film times is TOO MUCH. <br /> <br /> There are also a few songs about "difficult to do sex without love", "selfish mind of the porn industry". <br /> <br /> It is obvious that this movie was aimed at (escaping) to cheat jurors and critics of the festival. It has several pseudo-shocking scenes (within the limits of Taiwan's censorship) and many topics are open, but nothing is completed or going anywhere. <br /> <br /> These tricks, got in the film a few (contentious) important prices at film festivals and made the film an undeserved commercial success (I see a movie in France and the theater was packed). <br /> <br /> Please, do not be fooled. In this film there is nothing new or original or even originally told or filmed. It is boring and empty; really a scam to the public. Boogie Nights (which I did not really like), Intimacy and 9 tracks are much better films.
