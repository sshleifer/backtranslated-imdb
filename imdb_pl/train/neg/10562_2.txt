This very low-budget comedy film successfully achieves only a low budget. The dialog is stupidly stupid, the chase scenes are equally boring, and most of the money on the screen seems to be written for a series of accidents and explosions in the parking lot during the last five minutes of the movie (short port-a-pot) at the beginning of this scene will certainly be destroyed and spits out nonsense to the main villain of the movie - no target is aimless here). The whole movie is depressingly reminiscent of those that occasionally left the studio of Rodger Corman when he gave the director a few bucks and a camera for the first time - but without the discipline Corman would impose.
