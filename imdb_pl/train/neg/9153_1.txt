I have never published a review before, but I had to do it for this movie! This movie is SO BAD that I tried to justify how bad it is, trying to think of it as kitsch or parody. But it's not. It's really, unknowingly BAD. This is a serious test that is brilliant. Other reviewers have pointed out many flaws in the movie, so I will try not to repeat them, but I encourage you to watch this movie. All the time I was either speechless, I literally panted in disbelief, or hysterically wallowed on the floor. I have not dared to watch the movie for years. In fact, I'll try to let all my friends see this because it's the kind of movie that needs to be shared. <br /> <br /> My favorite parts: - When Arthur's interrogations are to take place - a boy (his dance is unbelievable) - unpaid nudity (the director / main actor just had to shoot a naked picture) - a preacher's office with cardboard and chalk interpretation Christ - of course, the famous wedding scene with palm trees and forgotten rings (what narrative function does this game play?!?) - wrestling wrestling of his ex-wife with Ben in order to get her weapons - A detailed sequence in which Arthur kills the preacher; apparently burns him with this incredibly poor match - yes, a homosexual religious-fanatic brother with his bleached hair and WeHo fashion - And my favorite is to use "The Entertainer" by Joplin as the initial soundtrack and "Canon Pachebel in D Major" as closing soundtrack! - the list is long - MUST SEE !!!
