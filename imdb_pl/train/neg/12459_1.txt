Given how much money was allocated to this movie, you can expect more from the whole story. This may be the most worthless movie I've ever watched. There was no real progress. Character development, minimal. Perhaps the promotion of the story. Pleasure, none. I'm not sure what they even tried to do. If you want to see a movie where terrorists are good guys, the US CIA bombards everything that disagrees with our opinions, all capitalists are corrupt, and you like to see something reminiscent of storyboard development in the company of death. For those of us who realize that you do not have to kill a good guy to say something, we'll stick to other movies. In conclusion, it was a horrible attempt at the movie "Ocean's 11" in the hide-the-plot-so-person-has-think style, because you do not just know what's going on, but nobody has done it either. Home Alone 3 was a better movie.
