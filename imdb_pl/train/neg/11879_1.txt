I rented this movie with my wife because some people created similarities between him and the "office space". Blockbuster and IMDB even had the "also recommended" option if you liked "Office Space". <br /> <br /> Now I've seen office space probably 15 or 20 times. I love it. This is probably one of my 10 favorite movies. Witty, humorous and depicting people who have worked with me for years. "Haiku Tunnel" is similar to "office space" because both are films. The similarity ends here. We've probably sat for the first 50 minutes of HT, giving him the benefit of doubt, hope, no, * praying * that it would be better. No. We could not stand it anymore and we stopped the tape. Thank God it was a free rental. I would be nervous if we paid for it. We should be reimbursed for the fact that we have to go through this. Now, because we have not seen the end, it may miraculously meet and redeem. I doubt it. <br /> <br /> The Haiku tunnel is so bad it's hard to believe it's ever been made. The film is so indecent that it is painful. Just write friggin letters !!! The premise is asinine. The jokes are awful. We've come as far as the "printer does not work" scene and we had to stop. We could not take it anymore. This movie is an EMBARATION for Josh Kornbluth. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of office space ...... do not waste time on this turd. 0/10
