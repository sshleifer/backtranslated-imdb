This cowardly and offensive film intrigued me at first. The heroes are known, expropriated young men who are often seen as bored in a coastal city. Robert is an outsider, but he has his own music that could be his soul. Instead, Clay makes Robert a freak who goes on a trip to marijuana and ecstasy and goes into the wrong crowd. Clay seems to believe in "reefer madness" and Robert ends the film as a murderous rapist. One wonders how much real-life experience this young director has. No one can save poor Robert. Clay leaves us with the message that young Britons are out of control. A very inadequate connection with the Iraqi insurgents was established; during unnecessarily graphic rape we are subjected to explosions and images of war. The film shows the extremism of the male peer group pushed to the limit. Young bombers in London refer to the hateful image of Clay's contemporary man. Clay means that people simply can not refrain from inflicting terrible violence. It is strange that the British film industry allows you to invest money in films that are in favor of such divisive propaganda, when in London we are still shattering from recent attacks. This is Clay's first film, I would be delighted if it was his last film.
