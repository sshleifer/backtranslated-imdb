It was a nice attempt at something, but it is too pretentious and boring to rise above low budget traps. The use of virtual sets almost works, but at some points it fails. They probably used a small budget well. I just want this story and most of the acting to be better. There are many parts in which you see what they were aiming for, and it would be great if they actually hit those signs, but no. A tangled and unbelievable story. Bad DVD transfer too. Watching a movie at one time does not require much. I had to turn it off. It was too boring. I can make free films. But just make them attractive in some aspect. Visually, story telling, acting etc. This was missing in all departments, so it has never been an immersive experience. Maybe the next attempt of the filmmaker will be better.
