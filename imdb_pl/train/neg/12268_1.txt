I saw four other Japanese horrors and they were not very impressive. However, I could sense that there was a reasonable script on the way. <br /> <br /> Not here, no way. It's about a detective who is trying to connect similar murders that took place. When he finds out that the suspect is questioning, the suspect is annoyed because he still sees the ghost. Then the ghost begins to follow the detective FOR A REASON WHICH IS NEVER EXPLAINED AND IS TAKING MORE THAN OUT OF THE FILM. <br /> <br /> Bad enough? Oh no. The film still changes perspectives on various characters that have little to do with history. I've seen it before in other movies, where it shows a different perspective. Not in this case. <br /> <br /> What's more, what happens on the screen is properly tolerated, it ends quickly. For example, there are several scenes with a light instrumental score that grows and ... then moves to a different scene. I know it can be a dramatic effect. It's definitely not the intention here. It's just a bad assembly. <br /> <br /> Finally there is a "ghost" that just screams in a way that is not frightening or involuntarily funny. This is annoying and it happens very often in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> All the horrors have been done before, in a better way, so you can see that all are coming. Then after one of them the film ends. At that moment, a wave of confusion overwhelmed the audience, because I felt that we all felt we had wasted our time. Someone made a fake clap and laughter broke out. It was better than the whole movie. Simply put, UNIKAJ.
