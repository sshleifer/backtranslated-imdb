I'm not saying that Twister Night was terrible, but it was not great. On average at best. It seems to me that every time one type of film is released, the second must be at the same time. (Think about Armageddon and Deep Impact, Volcano and Dante's Peak). Night of the Twisters is just Twister, except inferior and mundane special effects. <br /> <br /> I do not mind actors who played in it, even if they were not great, it was the film itself, the direction, the special effects, the whole story was too strange to interpret. A series of tornadoes hits the city and basically the film is about people who try to find family and friends and deal with damage. <br /> <br /> I really do not know why it seems that duplicate disaster movies are released almost synchronized with each other, but this one would be better with Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt.
