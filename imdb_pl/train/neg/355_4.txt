Just Cause is one of those movies that at first make you wonder why he was so arched when he appeared - nothing special, but competent enough and with a great performance supporting Ed Harris. Then you hit the last third and everything starts getting stupid until you get a killer with a flashlight tied to your forehead, threatening him with filleting Sean Connery's wife (typically raised and unconvincing Kate Capshaw) and kid (very young Scarlet Johannsen) in the alligator hut . <br /> <br /> The type of film that is best seen on the plane, or even only once.
