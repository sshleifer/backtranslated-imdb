I honestly want to recover the last 30 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> The only person who is able to watch this movie is Helen Keller. I kept telling myself that it must be better. br /> <br /> Finally, there were zombies and they were wearing some raccoon paint. <br /> <br /> They talked like ordinary people. <br /> <br /> One was driving a car. <br /> <br /> Some voodoo woman asked what one of the "Zombie" wants, and "zombie" said (I want to dance) <br /> <br /> (IT WAS IT) The movie came and I could not do it any more bear Can I sue for half an hour of my life ?????
