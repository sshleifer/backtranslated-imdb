I like Fulci movies, I really do and not in a boring, ironic way, but I realize that they seem hopelessly inept and distorted by many people. <br /> <br /> Conquest is a place where Fulci tries his strength in an epic fantasy genre and really fails. Structurally, it's like most of the Fulci movies you've seen. Something happens, more things happen and sometimes one scene can be tangentially related to another. It's really like Conan with no sets, no script, no real actors (yes, Arnold Scharzenfartz is not an actor either), no budget, stupid looking soldiers and a group of gore. <br /> <br /> This one was hard to beat and I could live without a lot of Vaseline smudged on the camera to give it the look of a Metal music video.
