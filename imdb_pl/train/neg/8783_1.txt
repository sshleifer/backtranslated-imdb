I do not think I've ever been so enchanted with the pure absurdity of a movie in my whole life, like when I left this nonsense. Nothing makes no sense in this. none of them is smart or well thought out. due to the lack of really tense moments, they repeatedly use this complete cop-out trick in which you build the music before the character does something like opening the door or pulling away the curtain and then there is nothing there. it can do it once, maybe, but I counted three times. there are things for no apparent reason, characters, half-formed lines ... the characters were not well developed. the end was ... bad. bad, bad, bad, everything, every component of this movie is terrible. and I'm here just to warn you.
