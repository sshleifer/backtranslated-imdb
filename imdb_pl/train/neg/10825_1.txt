What made this movie so attractive is the hope that it will be in keeping with the brilliance of Charlotte Bronte in the original classic story. I was deeply disappointed to find that this movie, which seemed to be written or filmed in great haste, did not have the features that made the original novel so powerful. A lot of witty back and forth between the main characters, Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester, seemed either to be absent from the script, or the cutting room remained on the floor. Also missing was Jane Eyre's charismatic sense of self, which enabled her to suffer through turmoil and triumph over everyone. The original Jane Eyre was a hero. The woman in the movie did not have much to say, including one of the biggest parts of history when Jane is running away from Thornfield and Mr. Rochester. Her struggle to find food and shelter, her shame at pleading for bread, the threat of freezing to death in coldness, everything to escape from the man she loved, was in my opinion the moving parts of history that were simply omitted in this film. The title character seemed dry and devoid of inspiration. The story was unattractive, and for those who did not read the book, I can not imagine that this story would be the least interesting. The script and director contributed little to the creation of classic history.
