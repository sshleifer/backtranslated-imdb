I do not think this movie will be rated correctly. I took my copy and darkened the PG rating and wrote R. I would not recommend it to anyone under 17 or 18, regardless of the limit. <br /> <br /> Why? Includes a scene in the jungle with several topless Indian women. I do not know about you, but it is not something that small children can watch. It is true that this may be a traditional "dressing style" of African (?) Indians, but ... I think that partial nudity should give the film a rating of R. <br /> <br /> I have not seen the movie lately, but I think otherwise, it was fine.
