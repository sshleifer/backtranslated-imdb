A great cast wasted on a worthless script. Ten or more adults meet in the summer camp, which they attended as a minor. Could this happen in a million years? It's just fantasy and boring. Are they becoming teenagers again? Do they play their pranks, games, good times? They can try, but the answer ultimately is: No. Is there any intrigue? Any tension? Terror? Comedy? None of the above. How anyone can be entertained by this nonsense is beyond me. I wanted to like this movie; I tried to like this movie, but my brain refused.
