A person who wrote a great review of this erroneous project must be associated with the writer / director / star - or in fact the same person who contradicts rational thinking that the film would be attractive to anyone who is not bound by a closely woven inner circle. What would you say for that? You want to make a movie - tell a story; entertain; pull me with live characters. Sure, you can do it deftly without bowing to commercial elements designed for mass appeal. However, one should not refer to elements of artistic expression in a vacuum, in which the audience constantly tries to capture scant narrative threads. If I am to move a dreamy psychological thread, make it easier to buy concrete fabric.
