The film starts slowly when we got to the cinema, we thought it looks pretty good, but after about 5 minutes everyone got bored with our mind and we wondered what movie we came to see, I do not like this movie and would not recommend it to anyone, the best part of the night it was the return of the alarm and the lights because the project broke down because we thought we could all come home. it must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen, all of them bored, or minds, and most people in the cinema finally get out of the door because it was so junk. I am surprised that no one left earlier. if you go and see, make sure you have something busy, better still Do not go at all.
