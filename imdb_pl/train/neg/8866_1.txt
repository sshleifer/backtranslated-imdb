Theoretically, the Director's Commentary should work. The talented Rob Bryden plays Peter DeLane, a former TV director talking about his experiences from behind the camera. Among the programs he allegedly worked on are "Bonanza", "Flambards", "The Duchess Of Duke Street" and "The Bounder". His comments are not the least informative because of his habit of moving away from the subject. <br /> <br /> But in practice it failed him. This is a performance with one joke, and the joke is not particularly funny. Scripts are completely missing, and Bryden is not convincing as old. Whenever he gets stuck with something funny to say, which is like every five seconds, he makes hissing laughter. Instead of laughing at DeLane, you want to shoot him. If old people think you're funny, it's for you. <br /> <br /> It did not help that the shows were ridiculed, except for "Mr and Mrs" and "Crossroads", rather good. To make the joke work, they had to be really frightening, like Charlie's Angels, OTT, Telly Addicted, Neighbors, and New Faces. <br /> <br /> The show filled up with time, so fortunately we saved the horror of future releases. Would not it be wonderfully ironic if the director's commentary were once a lousy thing?
