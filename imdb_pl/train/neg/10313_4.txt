This movie was hard to come by, and when I saw it, the disappointment was overwhelming. This is one of the great stories of the 20th century: an unknown man uses the unsuspecting aerospace industry and STOPs millions of ransom without hurting anyone or trying to let it happen. With all of this built-in interest, how could anyone have made such a bland, full of flicks of this real life. While Williams is always interesting, the screenwriters assumed that D.B. Cooper persona was stereotypically heroic like a movie star, what we get is a kind - without engaging details or insight into the mind of a person brave enough and clever to pull her away. Harrold practically steals the film with his bold and pure beauty, but the real disappointment was the handling of the plot and the bad direction. Shame on this movie that even exists.
