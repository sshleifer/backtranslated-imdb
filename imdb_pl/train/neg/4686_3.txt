There were good performances by Robin Williams and others, but the film was generally boring and very disappointing compared to positive reviews. <br /> <br /> I thought Sy could become a serial killer who bored people to death. ugly clothes slip through his victims after food courts, quoting Oprah and reciting his medical history, begging him to shoot them. <br /> <br /> I think the movie mainly appeals to egomaniacs who think that strangers are interested in their photos. I expect that most retail workers want to take a break from their clients.
