very good story, good thrill ... but last 10 seconds destroyed the whole movie ... what happened? very well made and good story destroyed in the last seconds ... I am sorry to say, but 1 in the vote ... it deserves it, I thought Chris Shadley could have come up with a better end ... but maybe next time :) all this senseless blood gore for nothing? end would raise history to 10, but not ... end destroyed the whole story, I think most people are not lame, and when they go to the cinema, they want a good end, even if it's complicated ... but the only lame is the end .. . excuse me
