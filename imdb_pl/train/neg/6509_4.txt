Sean Bean is great, as are photography, locations and costumes. However, the plot is a bit confused, and the conclusion is flat. The story has changed dramatically from Cornwell's novel, not for the better. Unfortunately, this adventure is much better than watched. Sharpe was too narrow here, in contrast to his literary alter ego, which seems more intelligent and determined, despite fears in the new role of the officer promoted from the ranks. I really liked the short scene in which Sharpe is stumbled over by a "real" officer, and after a short pause and piercing gaze, he pushes off a surprised and cowardly officer. This sets the tone for his later attempts as commander. <br /> <br /> Rating: "4" from "10."
