SPOILERS. Strange people with generous tastes are reviewing this film. Let me add balance by pointing to the following elements: <br /> <br /> Script: Dreadful. Because Tom and Dan "get to know each other" when talking about films, the conversation is synonymous with one person's conversation and I suspect that the director carefully refined his words to make it sound intelligent. At some point, Dan asks: "Have you heard about HIV?" And it sounds as natural as the question: "Did you communicate with nine foreign races?" <br /> <br /> Acting: White teeth and carved face are not sensitive performer. I suppose Speedman was doing well with what he was given, but Marsden was terrible - unpleasant, unbelievable, and quite pleased with himself and insolent in all captivity. There is emptiness in his performances (see also Interstate 60). <br /> <br /> Plot: Save me! The moment of escape was not exciting, but irritating and weak. Remember, Marsden pretends to try the keys in the door and then throws them: "Do not work, man!" Tee-hee. And watch out for half-black and white flashbacks that are initiated by some schlocky sound taken from CSI and other crime dramas. <br /> <br /> The most important of all, the most dangerous, bad and offensive, is homophobia (external or internal, which you decide) in a movie in which HIV is considered a weapon. Tom says Dan could take off the condom or not use it at all - sorry, where was Tom during sex? There is a certain character of the wickedness of a partner who takes on the form of a wicked man in general. <br /> <br /> In total: watch out!
