When I saw the cover of the movie, the first thing I thought about was that it was made for video. The second thing that occurred to me was how similar it looked to another horrible movie, "The Fall of Darkness," the story of this stupid witch who killed people in the dark. Unfortunately, Darkness Falls was quite a masterpiece compared to this pile of rubbish, and this movie should not have been done. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a little story for a witch, or more like the aimless introduction of two young children who intend to meet with a tooth fairy in the hope of giving them a new shiny bike to teeth. The opening is filmed poorly and, like the rest of the movie, it is certainly not terrifying. Nowadays, the film is about Peter (Lochlyn Munroe). Peter rents his house and his ex-girlfriend Darcy (Chandra West), and her daughter Cole come to stay there. Cole meets a neighborhood child and talks about the Tooth Fairy and about how you should not lose a tooth, or else it will come for you. Unfortunately, seconds later, it looks like Tooth Fairy steals her bike and throws her tooth (Ironically). Will Cole survive the Tooth Fairy's anger and whether her mother and Peter will be able to save her and rekindle their romance ... it's a bad movie, you could probably figure it out. <br /> <br /> One of the main problems of this idiotic movie is how undefined Tooth Fairy is. They say it kills you if you lose a tooth, but you do not. More like a serial killer who kills randomly, and if you lose a tooth, you will definitely go. He's stealing a bike, so apparently he's also a thief. I said earlier that the idea for this movie was based on Darkness Falls, but where did they get inspiration for the appearance of Tooth Fairy? Let's see. It looks like a burned victim, and earlier she walked around, murdering children. Hmmm ... it's almost like being a rip off of Freddy Krueger from the movie "Nightmare on Elm Street." And this is not the worst part of this terrible mess, the peak is. This movie may have the funniest climax (not literally funny, because I found it more nauseous than funny) I've ever seen. I can not see it. <br /> <br /> Just some curiosities. Lochlyn Munroe was in Scary Movie, and Jianna Ballard was in Scary Movie 3 and they were both in it, so apparently Horrible movie stars are forced to end their careers with evil horrible movies. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/2 out of ****. 80 minutes. R for violence.
