It is quite an outdated film that aims to show the youth's longing for freedom in some inhuman British school. Oh yes, it's like in the army, you learn to listen and do what you've been asked for. Yes, young people dream about something else, but they break their dreams and lose optimism on the threshold of their lives. Excellently. <br /> <br /> Essentially, this way you can sum up your intentions in If ... Nice intentions that do not raise any cinematographic challenges: the effect is a declamatory film. Do you see what I mean? <br /> <br /> At least this old man helped Kubrick in casting McDowell in A Clockwork Orange, a movie about a truly powerful social satire and the lack of indulgent sentimentality.
