It's just a joke from the movie, they've lost me on the opening scene (Spoilerwarning) a dangerous creature is killing another creature in his cage, it's watched by a scientist who works on the monitor and guesses what he's doing, well, we're going in a cage to check things, if stupid writers think that people come to the same as jumping in an aquarium with a big white shark, because he ate your goldfish ... Pretty useless and even stupid. And I will not even talk about the cast because they are not worth the effort. why they did not release the guy who wrote it is a mystery to me ..... And this kind of stupidity continues the whole movie. The only good thing is that cgi, which is better than average for those low-budget movies. <br /> <br /> If this does not bother you, go, look at it, but warn if your IQ is above 60 you probably can not take it.
