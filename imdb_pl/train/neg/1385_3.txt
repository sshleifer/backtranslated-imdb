"Hak Hap" or "Black mask" (in English) was a disappointment. I was told that this is a kind of "Japanese version of the Matrix". Imagine my disappointment. The film was badly called or the soundtrack was not good for the movie. Another thing is that the dialogue was very bad. There was not much thought in the English version of this movie and refers only to the genre of "meaningless action". Not a movie that I would like to see again.
