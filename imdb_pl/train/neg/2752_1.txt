No matter what it is called (writer and director), it should be closed in the hope that such rubbish will never happen again. This one is in battle with the worst movies of all time. Sometimes movies are bad in a way that they are really good. Not this one. It was so bad that I got angry. Seriously. A drunk 10-year-old could come up with a better script. What a loss. ALL actors were totally reluctant to work, CGI was barely acceptable, sequences of scenes were completely delayed and hurt a bit of history, as if he had just decided: "I want this to happen and it will happen, but I do not care how we got there after we just shoot him and put him on. Whatever, I come back to my trailer to take my nose away, if someone calls me, I'm not here. Shame yourself, your name. Shame on you.
