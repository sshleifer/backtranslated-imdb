Yes, this movie has children who go to a space camp and it starts well because children meet and learn ropes. Then they introduce Jinx, a robot that could not exist in 1986, because they now have nothing of this kind of artificial intelligence. The kid becomes a robot buddy and the robot repays the kid's courtesy by shooting at him and a group of other children in this space camp with a very limited supply of oxygen and radios that have no signal to reach out into space. This camp is also not a great fun, because these children are subjected to real training, and the instructors go through them because of unsuccessful missions or misconduct. Have a rest, are there for fun, not to become astronauts, just give them space flight experience, not a military camp. However, you see Joaquin Phoenix in a fairly early role. So in the end, a movie that tries to be realistic in some areas, but with the introduction of Jinx and other factors, it might as well make kids fight alien aliens beyond anything else in the movie, just like it would the film is a bit more enjoyable at least for me. Probably also for a few others, who else would like to see how Kate Capshaw's face was torn apart by some strange super-foreign being.
