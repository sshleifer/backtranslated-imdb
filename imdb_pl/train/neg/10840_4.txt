It so happened that I loved adolescent program, as well as millions of others. So, I tuned in to this movie, thinking that if it's not good, it can be at least a little dazzling and funny. <br /> <br /> WRONG! At the end, I just have to wonder if Charlie's Angels were really boring? I do not remember it as such. But this film, as bad as the films of this type, was not similar to the emotions of that period and the show. I saw it all, despite the negatives, you could not watch them. But it was very bland, for which I do not blame the performers, especially the women who played angels, because they really looked like them. The film simply was not so interesting. He tried to make each angel a "character". (One angel is pugnacious, one is a "good girl" and the other a husband ...), all characters have been presented with one main feature defining them and a small depth beyond stereotypes. Emotions related to the show were missing, and the dialog box is ... a dialog box. That's almost everything. <br /> <br /> Not terrible. Not the worst of TV movies. But missable.
