OK, so it was written in 1996, before September 11, so you can admit that you're worried about the terrorists and the idea that the director of the CIA is plotting to expel this doomed plane from the sky before prophesying the world is prophetic. this is it! These are good things. Acting ... honest. The plot ... stupid. "Twist" ... unnecessary. DOOOOOOOOOOOM It's not like nobody has ever thought about what to do when the plane gets tainted. Do not you think that bureaucrats have a "plagues" manual and how to stop them? The correct implementation of such a plan is always a problem, as we saw after Katrina. But they have a plan. It is not sending them to Iceland, and then to Mauritania. And if the virus is transmitted in the air, why were the open doors open, and the "shooters" stood there without protection? In fact, has anyone ever shot her legs? That would stop her. But not so dramatic. I'm a nerd. I always watch a movie to see the end when I start it. But it was a waste of time and, predominantly, predictable. I saw it using the recorder, so I did not have to watch all the ads, it was a plus. This is a good example of why I watch such a small network TV.
