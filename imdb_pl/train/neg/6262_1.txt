I agree with those opinions that I have read here and I have no words to define such a turkey in this way, but still, I can still find the reason why such films exist. Do you remember those lucky days in which video was a thriving business, and many films were made with the only reason to fill shelves in video stores? this film comes from this period and I can imagine that it was the only reason why it was made and the same happened with many, many, many other stinks. Do you remember imitations of "Rambo"? and so many class Z jumpers? I still feel a longing for this period. I can say that I was not wasting time watching this movie because I pressed the fast-scroll button after the first fifteen minutes just to find a funny scene where the guy pushed an ax against the heads that exploded because, as you've noticed, you were made of plastic. And finally, well, it was so badly filmed that I could not understand what had happened. The same, I did not follow the non-existent plot at all. But boy, video-age, was great despite such films.
