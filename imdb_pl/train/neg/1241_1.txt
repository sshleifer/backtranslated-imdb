This is the worst movie I've seen in years! It starts out funny and continues in the same way. And yes, when something happens in this movie, and the action is worse. The end raises it a bit and saves the movie from the entire flop. Mark Wahlberg is a bad actor in a bad movie. I'm sorry Tim Burton Batman was good, but he sucks.
