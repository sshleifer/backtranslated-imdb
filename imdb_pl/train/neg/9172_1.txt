When I go to watch a movie about zombies, I do not expect performances in Oscars or writing at the Godfather level, but I expect the actors at least will not look like their efforts to read their memory cards and dialogue does not sound as if they were written 10 minutes before the actor reads them in the camera. This movie was just horrible, I actually stood up and left for about 25 minutes, went to the door and watched Cold Creek Manor, which was not very good, but it looked like Citizen Kane in comparison with this pile of nonsense. On the plus side, the girls were very pretty, it's probably the only thing that kept me in place for longer than the first 5 minutes, in fact I left after the hottest died, there was nothing that could interest me after that.
