In a sense, this is a disaster in which Fellini worked all his life. The line between the absurd masterpiece and nonsense associated with free association is very small, and the category to which the film will eventually fit depends often on personal feelings. Having said that, "Casanova" left me in a cold delight for his sets and not much more, which Bukowski can not summarize more: <br /> <br /> "Casanova also died, only an old guy with a huge dick and a long tongue and lack of courage to say that he lived well, is true, claiming that I can spit on his grave without feeling, is also true, ladies usually choose the greatest fool they can find, that's why the human race is where it's doing today: we've grown smart and durable Casanova , empty inside, like Easter bunnies, which we support our poor children. " <br /> <br /> As far as I could understand, this is Fellini's position in relation to his subject; granted, with more empathy, but nevertheless indignant. <br /> <br /> Casanova's environment is made of humus and incestuous behavior, Fellini's themes have coped more in the "Satyricon". The success of the story is characteristic of soft porn, just without consistency; and Donald Sutherland is ugly and slimy enough to be distracted. <br /> <br /> However, there may be a goal in presenting Casanova as an ugly fool. And I urge everyone to form this point without being obvious; Fellini could not. More than ever, it seems like an old, dirty man - certainly a champion, but one whose impulses will be more satisfying than anyone else. I can not imagine an audience who likes this movie. This was not a story worth telling.
