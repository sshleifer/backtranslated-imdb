I recently saw this movie because a friend brought it with him from New York. After 30 minutes I told him: "You're kidding. Is this a joke? "He thought it was good. I told him that I thought it was probably one of the stupidest films ever made. "What was it supposed to be?" I asked. "A propaganda film for children?" The story is stupid. Acting is the worst thing for most directors and, frankly, people who look at this kind of tripe and think it has something to do with life, love and even an afterlife that offers an incredibly stupid view ... they need psychiatric support. Please, if someone tries to convince you to put it in a DVD or video player, think about it as if the virus has been introduced to your computer ... it will not destroy your player, it will ruin your evening. If they did Razzies in the 40's, it would win in every category. (PS also approaches the dubious "Stairway to Heaven" sobriquet)
