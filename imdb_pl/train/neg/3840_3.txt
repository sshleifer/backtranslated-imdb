I've heard about this movie some time ago from a friend and recently got it on DVD. There was a lot of anticipation and excitement because we both heard it was a terrifying movie, really terrifying. How disappointed were you? VERY!!!! Apart from this one scene (we all know which piece) nothing happened !!! I expected that I would see a woman in black several times, and she would do a few more lively scenes, such as appearing in a window or going through a room or something. <br /> <br /> Almost all reviews here say what a terrible, thrilling, atmospheric movie. I just have not seen it, I'm scared. Perhaps there is a difference in what people find terrifying in the US here in Great Britain. <br /> <br /> A big profession after all these hypnotic reviews :(
