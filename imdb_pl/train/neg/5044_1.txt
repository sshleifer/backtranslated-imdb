I could not wait to watch this movie after reading the positive review in the New York Times. Besides, I'm also Shanghai, so the interest in the subject was not only transient. However, after seeing him I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> The pace of the film was incredibly slow and monotonous. The director waited too long with some scenes. There was no passion or chemistry among the lovers. There was almost no dialogue. Dialogue was very much needed to compensate for the lack of action. At the end of the movie you did not feel sympathy for the heroes. In this movie, everything was missing. The script was weak, the acting was weak, and the editing did not exist. The director tried to imitate certain styles of film noir, but he failed. A good movie is one that attracts your attention, keeps it and ends up without you, that time has passed. This movie had the impression that it will never end. Do not waste your money on this movie.
