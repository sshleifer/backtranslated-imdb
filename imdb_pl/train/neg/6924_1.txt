If this film was worse, it would be directed by Uwe Bolla. This nonsense mess makes Ed Wood look like Hitchcock. It's been some time since I've seen this steaming stack, but I remember that I wanted to do serious injuries to everyone involved. As anyone can give this film more than 1 star, I am amazed by the gratitude of everyone who has seen this bottle. I give him one star because there is no lower grade. All copies of this film should be burned on the ground sown with salt and reserved as a rubbish dump for the most toxic waste. No, one copy should be stored in very high security and shown only to filmmakers as an example of how not to do it.
