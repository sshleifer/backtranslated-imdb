Although it seems to be quite an old program (2002), I watched my first episode last night and I must say it must be the worst performance. . . never. <br /> <br /> I am not the person who comments, but I was so shocked that there could be a performance that is blatantly trying to get away, and I just assume it was their target group, children under 12 years old or people with less than average IQ. <br /> <br /> The episode in which I was subjected to the last night contained so many chaotic threads, I tried to include EVERY possible summary of the plot that you can imagine and keep trying to preach about friendship, family, religion and politics !!! . <br /> <br /> The basic story they described in the episode: Frat House badly went bad with too much alcohol - Death turns out to be the son of the Senators who wants to investigate the FBI. Death is actually a murder because of peanut allergies. Senator thinks that his sworn enemy and childhood best friend could do it because the Senator took money for his vote for legislation, but eventually he got a conscience and said "no" to to mean a millionaire. Everyone is suspicious, but everybody has an ordinary alibi (there was a student girl working with a married teacher, so she had to lie, a dissatisfied student who was reported by the victim, had a life-changing experience, an enemy of senators did not pay a desperate student to kill the son of a sworn enemy he freely gives money to many broken students). All the time the heroine of this dribbling is with her niece who is "in this age" and falls in love with a boy who finally has the courage to talk with the help of his aunt, but only to throw him because "W" girls say that he is not good enough, so to stick with them, he throws him. Do not worry, she returns with her boyfriend after learning the truth about life, and "girls" drop her "in", aunt explains also that God is the only one on whom he can really rely (at that moment I was almost sick). <br /> <br /> This "drama" gets even better when Sue and her FBI team find out who the killer is. . . You're definitely laughing at it. . . <br /> <br /> This is one of Frat's boys, who only a year ago learned that he was adopted and that his real father is an international terrorist, and he tries to impress real daddy, killing a boy and planting a bomb at a funeral. . . . . . . <br /> <br /> Characters are cardboard acting is cardboard continuity is cardboard history is cardboard Anyone who says they love this program has cardboard for the brain <br /> <br /> Why did the authors of this movie show try to pack EVERYONE eventuality in one program, which means that they obviously do not believe in character development or the ability of actors to perform a simple storyline. Watching this series is like watching "Last Action Hero" in which Arnie kills 5,000 people with teeth picking, with the exception of Arnie, who is a better actor (wow, I never thought there would be a day when I would say that !!) <br /> <br /> In the words of the Simpson's beloved character, "a guy from a comic book". . . . <br /> <br /> WORST TV SHOW. . . . . ALWAYS.
