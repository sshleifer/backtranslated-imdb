I love Morgan Freeman. Paz Vega is an attractive, attractive and talented actress. I'm sure it would be a good movie if something happened in it. He does nothing. It is short (less than 90 minutes). It was 75 minutes too long. After an hour of frustration, I looked through the remaining 20 minutes. Unbearable. <br /> <br /> Freeman plays an actor - who has not worked for some time - examining the part he could play as a cashier in a supermarket. He visits the supermarket in which he works. Nothing happens. He decides to go home and go to the Arby's car wash, Target. Nothing happens. They talk about their lives. Nothing happens. Always. <br /> <br /> I do not understand. But I also do not get Bill Murray's "Lost In Translation" and "Broken Flowers." If you like these movies, you may like it. Many people find movies like the whimsical, charming or - for reasons that avoid me - the dialogue is fascinating. A typical device in films of this type is having a LONG mute / silence after the actor delivers a line that is to be significant. We know that it makes sense, because after him there are two minutes of nothing on the screen. I'm sorry, I have to be a philistine. I do not understand this. For me, these kinds of films are not funny, charming or thought-provoking. They are simply boring. Why? Because there is no comedy. There is no drama. Without tension. No laughter. Without tension. No action. Nothing to watch. In short, for what I go to the cinema for. I can be bored for free. In real life I see bizarre / bizarre characters. I go to Target, fast-food restaurants and car washes. These elements do not make up the movie, even if the stars do it. I pay for entertainment. <br /> <br /> If you are crazy about Morgan Freeman and you just like to hear him wandering about, enjoy yourself. If you want to drool over Paz Vega, you can watch and listen to it. But nothing happens, I promise. Total snoozefest.
