Where to start here? Straightheads presents me with a dilemma. If this movie came from Italy in, say, 1975, It was directed by Ruggero Deodatto and played David Hess, then I would beat him faster than the Labrador drinks water on a summer day. Because while Tarantino and Rodriguez are occupied elsewhere in their tribute to the grindhouse cinema, Dan Reed produced his own picture in England in the style of rape / revenge, and apparently the same budget as if Rodriguez changed his foot Rose McGowan in a machine gun. Because if you want to play grindhouse bingo, let me call "numbers": <br /> <br /> 1. A rich, highly qualified woman in the career meets the unpleasant side of the tracks in an unbelievable way and, equally unbelievably, gets fever for him . Check. <br /> <br /> 2. Unjustified shots of the aforementioned highly qualified woman in various states of nakedness. Check. <br /> <br /> 3. A convergent and unlikely development of a story that creates characters that exist only to do what they do, and which can not be imagined to exist outside the scenes in which they are . Check. <br /> <br /> 4. An unnecessarily graphical scene of rape by a gang of men without the perceptible depth of personality or background, except that they are there to rape. Check. <br /> <br /> 5. Bloody and bloody scenes of murder and vengeance to end it all. Bingo! <br /> <br /> Plotto, Straightheads are pretty basic things: Dyer meets Anderson and invites him to a party in the village pile belonging to her boss. On the way home, three of the locals in Landover upset him, they took revenge, giving Dyer a good shoe and raping Anderson's gangs. The couple took revenge. So far, "Straw dogs", "Late night trains", "House on the edge of the park", "I spit on your grave" etc. Etc. So why did not I think about this movie? There are many reasons: first, I think that having people like Gillian Anderson in the prima facie cast will lead me to a better expectation, but it is a total lack of honesty than the most blatant. <br /> <br /> Because when someone sits down to watch Hess and his companions, terrorizing women and murdering their men in these ages of the '70s, then they always know exactly what they get - a low budget of quick DIY designed exclusively for shock and appeal to the lowest common denominator. The villains terrorize and murder delicacies, delicacies divert attention from the evil and kill them, and all return home satisfied, their desires to see some nasty violence, extinguished and safe, knowing that the order of the world has been restored. <br /> <br /> However, as a screenwriter and director, Dan Reed clearly believes that Straightheads has much more to say about the state of the human psyche than this one, and desperately tries to assimilate his film with a philosophical depth that simply does not exist . For example, when Anderson and Dyer plan revenge on the attackers, they learn that one of the rapists has a fourteen-year-old daughter who is the object of desire for the two men with whom he spins. When Anderson finally meets him face to face, he confesses that he only raped her as an obstacle to let his two colleagues divert attention from their daughter !!! Accidental and bold the way Reed drops this little revelation into the storyline is simply stunning, almost as if he expected it to be a simple reference to pedophilia enough to cast a compass's moral compass into the audience and force them to leave the cinema with I just sat through something important. To ensure that we "get", at this point we show the sequence of rapes a second time, supposedly from the point of view of the assailant and his concern for the daughter, but Reed assures that we will get a lot more Anderson's shots with hardly celebrated and raped on the mask your car. It does not go unreasonably. <br /> <br /> After he was told why he raped her, Anderson ties him to the table, beats the end of the sniper rifle (complete with a massive silencer, in case someone is not afraid of phallic images up his jacksie, but he lacks the courage to pull the trigger, telling Dyer (who does not have such moral scruples) that "it's over." Dyer argues differently, and their moral dilemma is portrayed as something that Wittgenstein and Russell could discuss in their rooms in Cambridge over tea and cakes. It's almost unbearable in its absurdity. <br /> <br /> In fairness, Mrs. Anderson performs her guts throughout the movie. It's obvious that she wants to leave Scully far behind and bless her, he's certainly doing it, you wonder what Mulder would do with his old partner squatting down to make a leak at the side of the road and then sodomize a man with a gun? on the other hand, he does what he has done in virtually every movie that has been written so far - that is, a hot blimey guv cockney chappie with a mischievous smile, a brazen line and face that most people will never get tired of punching . This is especially true in the final scene, in which after murdering the attackers in cold blood, Dyer stares at the camera, which, I am sure, is supposed to be, an expression of existential suffering that invites us to compassion with the fate of his hand asked him and the moral dilemmas that he had to overcome, but more like Oliver Hardy, who looks annoyed at the camera after Stan landed in another great mess. What sums up this film quite nicely.
