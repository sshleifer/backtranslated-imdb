You have to admire Brad Sykes, even if it is not particularly desirable, a man who arouses budget horror after a budget horror for less than enthusiastic parties. But he still does it. Even the brazen praise, than the Camp Blood movies around him, are reluctant and I owe it to everyone. Brad can usually throw something interesting into the mix, a neat idea, a kooky character, whatever, but without funds that go beyond the base level, relies on the audience to cut some slack and appreciate what it is and what it can be. Joe Haggerty gives a thrilling and very funny performance as Ebenezer Jackson and it's thanks to Sykes, who senses that this strange turn will work as part of the movie. Coming to the multiplex nearby, somewhere in the parallel universe.
