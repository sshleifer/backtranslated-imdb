Anyone who could find the value of redemption in this piece of nonsense should examine the head. We have a compliant, heroin-dependent, part-time prostitute wife with cuts all over her body, cuts from repeated beatings by an abusive son. Now he spouts breast milk all over the kitchen floor, thanks to which the edition has gained something like Helen Keller, who puts his hands into the running water. We have a husband who starts patronizing a prostitute who is simply his daughter (he is angry with him because he came too soon) and ends up murdering his friend, having sex with his corpse and then chopping. We have a kid who is intensely intimidated by his classmates and who returns home and beats his mother. You see, everything is round. Deep, what? The only decent moment in this terrible pile of guts is the moment when Dad murders his son's tormentors. It's good that this turkey was shot on video, because otherwise it would be a waste of expensive film. If this guy who thinks artists should be interested in this slop, it's really serious, no wonder most people think artists are crazy. We've seen this bad movie, and then we've included "Zero Woman, The Accused." Oh my God, it was a toss, which was worse. What is happening in Japan today? Ill, ill, sick.
