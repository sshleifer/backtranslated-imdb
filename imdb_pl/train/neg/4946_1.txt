Admittedly, I watched the song with VERY low expectations. Dieter Bohlen is a little talented composer of parven, whose lack of talent exceeds only the size of his ego. <br /> <br /> It was the first animated film that I watched, 100% humorless. It's naughty, offensive, crazy and blatantly anti-woman. As such, it is a work that matches Bohlen, but the average viewer will rather discourage him. No wonder it was never shown in the cinema: it would be bombarded with BIG time! <br /> <br /> Even the cost of 6.5 MegaEuros could not save this complete shit. Save time ... and money!
