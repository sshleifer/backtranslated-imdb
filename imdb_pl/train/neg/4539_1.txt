I've never seen anything as horrible as this movie. The film was boring, long and horrible. Special effects suck like hell - it's like watching a movie in 1999. It is a total waste of one and a half hours of my time. Matthew Settle's performance was very bad. I saw him in the Band of Brothers playing Lt.Speirs, he was not so bad. In fact, it is not bad at all. But in this movie his acting was not convincing enough, it was quite bad and there was no chemistry between the rest of the crew. Besides, his eyes seem empty, as if he did not feel it. It really surprised me because he was good at the Band of Brothers. <br /> <br /> In any case, do not even bother watching this movie. It is a BIG waste of time. Even if you had to kill an hour or two, try to do something other than watch this movie. Trust me, you will regret it!
