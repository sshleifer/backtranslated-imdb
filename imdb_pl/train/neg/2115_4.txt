Only the glandular secretions of young virgins - and please, do not ask for more details - can make the fast-destructive body and mind of the crazy old amateur gardener's wife fresh and youthful. Because, like most people, except those who take part in medical tests, virgins rarely give up their secretions, Dr. Lorenz (Bela Lugosi) organizes their kidnapping and behavior. He'll do it himself. <br /> <br /> What a great cheese ball the premise for a low-budget horror movie. If The Corpse Vanishes turns out not to be Havarti horror, as an ordinary limburger leaves an interesting aftertaste. <br /> <br /> Sure, acting is almost terrible, except for the actors who are lucky enough to play the crazed dwarf (Angelo Rossitto, who later played the Master in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome); his crazy brute brother, Angel (Frank Moran), who grunts and has a fetish for the hair of virgins; crazy mother of two (Minerva Urecal); crazy wife (Elizabeth Russell) who sleeps in a plush coffin and, of course, a mad doctor (Lugosi). <br /> <br /> An enterprising young reporter, Patricia Hunter (Luana Walters), is tracking a doctor because of the strange orchid with the particularly sweet smell that the victim wore. When the doctor and his wife invite Pat to stay for the night, a raging storm explodes immediately. This tip tells us that raging violence will break out inside. Because it is well-known that in Hollywood at that time all unmarried young women were virgins, Pat may have unpleasant surprises. These include dark passages, a fragile laboratory in which almost a virgin virgin is kept, a mausoleum in the basement, and later a direct threat to Patricia's own glandular secretions. If she survives, what story will she have to give to her editor. <br /> <br /> If you try this damp piece of moldy Velveeta (and why not? Do not be better), do not judge Bela Lugosi from the company he keeps here. He had a huge impact on Dracula (1931), but my favorite movie is Black Cat (1934). As Dr. Vitas Werdegast is a sad, ironic man who protects his two young friends. When he finally takes the scalpel to Hjalmar Poelzig (Boris Karloff) and begins to strip a man alive, oh, well, it's a great scene.
