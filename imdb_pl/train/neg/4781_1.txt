This may be the poorest example of amateur propaganda ever created. Writers and producers should study German films from the 1930s and 1940s. They knew how to sell. Even a clumsy soviet-style leader, like God's godly figure, was better done. Disappointing. Losing faith, getting back in the church in the last second just in time for Dad to be "saved" by Hoover / God, was not bad. Unfortunately, it seemed hasty and not too melodramatic. A few misty, heavenly shots of angelic Hoover in the corner of a radiant screen and nodding would add a lot. The best aspect is that Hoover saves only a deserving family and children. WHO "proved" its value. Unfortunately, other poor homeless have been portrayed as friendly and even good - but God Hoover does not help them. A better approach would be the shots of their drinking spirits to show the justice of their state. Finally, bright and happy scenes of recovery (after Hoover saved the country from depression) should end at the end. We saw then that God Hoover saved not only this well-deserved family, but all deserving of it. At best, an amateur.
