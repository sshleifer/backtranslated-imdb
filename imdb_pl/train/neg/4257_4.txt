"Dracula II: Ascension" is the story of a group of medical students who came across Dracula's body. When a mysterious stranger appears and offers students $ 30 million to collect the body and steal his blood for auction, it is an offer that Barely students are constantly pursued by a vampire killer from the Vatican! "Dracula II: Ascension" is a bit of a funny horror movie that has many disadvantages. Characters are one-dimensional, and acting is quite average. there are some good gore effects, such as a really cool double scene of decapitation, but there is not enough violence for my preferences. The film quickly becomes boring and forgetful and there is absolutely no tension. So if you like modern vampire cinema, give it a look. atmospheric vampire chillers from the '60s and early' 70s, such as 'Lips of Blood', 'The Brides of Dracula' or 'Lemora: A Child's Tale of Supernatural', to name just a few of ten.
