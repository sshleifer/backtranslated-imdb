I've seen poor movies in my time, but it really takes away the cake! Why was this movie made? There is simply nothing here. Trust me, move the switch and destroy your copy of this movie. There is a conspiracy ... which can take about 5 minutes to show up in the camera. This is a key problem, the story "based on real history" (mmm ... whatever) is in no way suitable for being completed for 80 minutes. That's why we have to sit for an hour watching how people walk. This is it! Nothing happens in the first half hour, except watching someone go to the store ... and then 3 guys walking through the woods. This time could probably be devoted to character development ... but not. And so there is no connection with people on the screen, so when they start shooting, we do not care! In fact, I was finally a guarantor for baddie, so that the movie would end! In addition, the work of the camera is really terrifying! Ten reżyser / montażysta / screenwriter / producer Ti West is rubbish. I hate to hit a guy, but in fact his job is trousers! These dumb close-ups are still going on, and then the long single takes more people as they go - I'm sure he thinks he's smart, but the results are so boring that I just wanted to stop the movie and cut my wrists! How this man was brought in to direct another film about the fever in the cabin is beyond me! At the end of the acting is also pathetic ... which concerns the whole movie. Keep your sanity, stay away from this pile of total droppings!
