Okay, first of all, Seagal's voice is called by 50% of the movie ... Why? Because the script and plot were apparently being copied during shooting, and they had to change their dialogue to maintain the continuity of the story because they have many versions. From the very beginning you simply scratch your head, because overdubs are not only distracting, but they do not make sense. <br /> <br /> Having said that, history is still useless. When I reached the end, I was scratching my head because the film was so useless and the ending did not make sense. <br /> <br /> Avoid the scourge. This movie made me stop watching Seagal straight to the movies because they just get worse.
