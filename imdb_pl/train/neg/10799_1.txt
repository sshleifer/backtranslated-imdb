This movie is so scary that it makes the angels lose their wings. Shaq tried to make other efforts, such as his work in Shaq-Fu for NES and a lot of unbearable rap albums, and later an epic portion of terrible film production, which is Steel. <br /> <br /> There is nothing good to say about this movie. I saw it several times when I was very young, but then I had to be an idiot because this movie takes everything that's nice in the movies and tears them apart. It's fun to make fun of you. I saw it on the Disney channel some time ago and spent a few minutes on it. Although when the thrill mocks him, you do it, you are still overwhelmed by his horror. <br /> <br /> If you see him on TV, try this: consider how you watch the movie, removing all the scenes from it, in which Shaq uses his magical powers of genie. If you do, it will become a movie about a pedophile chasing a child and a rapist to seduce him. It's a bit funny and disturbing. <br /> <br /> A scary example of a movie. Do not watch this movie unless you want to mock it.
