Do you know those movies in which you're trapped in the cinema? You got stuck in the best place in the house, in the middle of the row in your own special sweet spot, which you exchanged three times before you got the right place - and after what you think 13 hours, you're still trapped there, uncomfortable and itchy, thinking "When F *** is this movie that ever END? "(You know this feeling - think about AI and The Village). <br /> <br /> Well, Visitor Q provides a strange variant of this feeling. I sat there for the first 30 minutes, wondering when it would start! It is infinite! It hurts "artistic". This is the first Miike Takashi movie that I watched. Apparently, he's filming a dozen movies, and if everyone is pretentious at @nk in this way, I suspect it will be the last one. <br /> <br /> I am not against Pretentious w @ nk. David Lynch is there among the top 10 directors, but Visitor Q is cheap, cheap and nasty pretentious at @nk. <br /> <br /> As you probably already worked out - I hated it.
