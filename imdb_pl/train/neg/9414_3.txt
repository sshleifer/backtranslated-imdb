Despite the release on the DVD cover of the version I borrowed, this movie was a disappointment. Yes, it is much more realistic than other war movies from the period of describing mud, boredom and frustration, but unfortunately one of them goes away from thinking that EVERYTHING is in this film. There is no story, and dialogue is monotonous. It's not like a good war movie must have a battle scene every five minutes. One of the best films from World War II "Twelve O'Clock High" has very few shares. But it compensates for the cracking dialogue and psychological tension. Exception from "The Story of G.I. Joe "is a short episode of the battle (titled" the city under siege "on DVD), which takes place in Italy. Admittedly, this is one of the most fast and convincing battle scenes in any war film. But unfortunately, the rest of the movie is not worth watching just for this event. The next exclusion is Pvt. Dondaro, played by Wally Cassell, who is supposed to be "Romeo", but falls out pervert. In contrast, Sergeant. Warnicki is a nice man if he is defective. As he says to Captain Walker (Mitchum), when he volunteered for another patrol: "Every step forward is a step closer ... home." But the last step? one patrol too much ?? it pushes him through the mental edge. It is a pity that the rest of the film does not do justice to some other minor accents. When it comes to the portrait of Pyle Meredith ... it's practically in a coma.
