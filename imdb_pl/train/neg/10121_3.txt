Bored Londoners Henry Kendall and Joan Barry (as Fred and Emily Hill) receive a down payment. They use money for travel. Their life becomes more exciting when they start their relationship with the exotic Betty Amann (for Mr. Kendall) and the lonely Percy Marmont (for Mrs. Barry). But they remain as boring as before. The probably bored director Alfred Hitchcock tries to revive well-titled (quoted in the film, from "Shakespeare's Storm") "Rich and Strange", ordering tricks from the camera. The main tribute is the homage of "The Crowd" to King Vidor. The highlight can be a couple with a Chinese cat. <br /> <br /> *** Rich and weird (12/10/31) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Henry Kendall, Joan Barry, Percy Marmont, Elsie Randolph
