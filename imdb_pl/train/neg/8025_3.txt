Yes, even as a fan of shows such as the survivor and student, this show is quite bad. I did not mind the first few concerts, but then I realized how pathetic they were all who went to the concert first. The antics of Alex and Aaron that gave men a bad name in the way they betrayed or dropped their choice at the first opportunity really was not a good look at the show. <br /> <br /> Ryan, you can have Trista. She had the most annoying voice I've ever heard on TV, and she was definitely not the smartest girl in the area (very media, but I doubt there's a lot more). <br /> <br /> I have not really watched any of the concerts since, apart from the occasional re-launch of the daytime television. I think the purpose of reality TV is to treat it as a "fun basket". See it as something you can laugh at and you do not have to wonder too much (I do not watch CSI, as it is on tired and stereotyped television, but you still have to think too much while watching). <Br> <br /> A few thoughts about some reasons why you should go to a concert. At the very beginning "a woman told everyone" A woman, such as Amy (who had a lot of class about her), commented that she tried to meet a guy in every scene known from the bar and club scene and it did not happen. Hey Amy, how about joining the club? Getting a hobby? Charity work? Changing to a job where you meet more guys, I only know that going to a bar is not the perfect place to meet a future partner. <br /> <br /> Amy and many other girls seemed to be obsessed with meeting "the perfect man". Tip for ladies: he does not exist. However, there are many great guys who would make great husbands, some might be for you! they can not earn six digits a year or be similar to JFK juniors, but they are great guys. The woman's shallowness in this concert is unbelievable. I am still a young man, but I believed that the woman gradually grows out of her shallowerness, getting older and more realistically approaching her future partner. This program proves that it is different. <br /> <br /> In general, this program has a lot in common with confirming many stereotypes about the perception of men in society. It's really a terrible program and I think that all such programs should stop being created. The best dates shown by the national mile are a blind date and a fifth wheel because they are fun. Between "pairs" there is nothing more than an ordinary night. The bachelor, unfortunately, approaches too seriously.
