My comments can be a bit of a spoiler, which is worth it. Stop now, if you care about it ... <br /> <br /> Saving Grace should be titled "A thin excuse for old British women to get a high screen." This movie is stupid. Accidental music is irritating, as are obvious, broken melodies that occasionally appear to comment on the narrative (for example, "Spirit in the Sky"). Oh, I understand! through her heavy English scenery and the overwhelming power of Brenda Blethyn to ask the audience's emotions using her voice. I could literally hear the High Times people taking their jokes over the huge "buds" that throw this picture away. The worst scene? Easy. Brenda is trying to distribute her illegal goods on London Street in a white costume. Not funny. Nieorginalny. Uninteresting. This is not a good movie. The rating of 7.2 is the result of excessive voting of enthusiasts. Do not waste time ...
