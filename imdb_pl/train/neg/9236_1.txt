I am among the millions who consider themselves fans of Cary Grant, but I can not come up with a single reason to recommend this movie. I do not understand the cast of Betsy Drake and it looks like no one else has done that. I think after a small number of movies in which she played later. <br /> <br /> Most fans will agree that Katharine Hepburn was great at chasing Cary Grant at Bringing Up Baby. Here, the director or writers try to convert the idea, but he does not succeed. I read the comments about how "frightening" Drake was, but I thought it was too mild. Franchot Tone went through this one as if he was a hangover. The casting disaster is one thing. This movie is a total disaster. <br /> <br /> This video does not deserve 10 lines of comments and I do not know why this is a requirement. This has been well-preserved when so many valuable films rot in the vaults. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to torture someone, give it a wide place.
