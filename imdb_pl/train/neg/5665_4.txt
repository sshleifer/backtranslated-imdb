This deliberately bizarre adaptation of Borges's story is typical of Cox. His strong visual sense is, as usual, withdrawn by the terrifying, half-baked acting of most actors. The film is definitely in the surrealistic tradition of the Mexican period of Bunuel and sometimes looks like a poor man for the elements of the crime of Lars Von Trier. Cox's apparent preference for single shots, lopsided cuts and recording of ambient sounds all work against the effectiveness of the film. It's worth a look, but ultimately disappointing.
