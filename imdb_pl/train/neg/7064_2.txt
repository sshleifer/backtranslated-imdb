"Son of John Hughes wrote a drama in high school! Wow! "I thought, checking the movie information here on IMDb, late Saturday night, after I saw the opening credits on BBC2. <br /> <br /> I just finished watching them and unfortunately it was down there. You probably can not spoil a movie so poor, but I will leave spoilers from this review ... <br /> <br /> There is a lot of style in relation to a very small substance: unfortunately, the style is not dated very well in the eight years since its release . As to the essence, the film attempts to present an interesting view of the nature of control in society through the microcosm of school life; but there is no significant or significant argument under the glossy veneer. Characters are painted childishly with wide strokes, falling into the kind of general stereotypes that the writer's father wanted to question in the breakfast club. <br /> <br /> Director Kyle Cooper does a decent job, keeping up the pace (perhaps relying on too much information that will soon become a tiring device, but at least push history), but his efforts do not diminish the weak scenario and the bizarre audition (if someone is to stand on the side of "Maddox", when Blake Shields gurns and shines his way, I just can not understand), not to mention the many gapers, make holes (I am for a creative license, but when the "bad" know the identity of "good" who make their lives a disaster, but they do not work in any way to stop them, you really have to wonder why this script was not reworked before production - did Daddy even read it?). <br /> <br /> I'm sure that the younger audience can enjoy this movie (and all the power for them), but it's really better to stick to the results of the Hughes Sr. school. and if the idea of ​​rebellion at school is what the appeals really are, the 1968 classic "If ..." is a much more satisfying study of the topic.
