This movie is a waste of footage. Do you believe that the map of the military mission plan will be placed on the easel on the patio in broad daylight for anyone who has a pair of binoculars or a camera with a zoom lens? It happened in this movie. Do you believe that a person from DEAF would be drawn into an army active in Europe during World War II, to serve in the unit "Negro" ... to cook, provide services, bury etc.? It happened in this movie. Do you believe that a black (and supposedly intelligent) officer would choose the same DEAF K.P. to be part of an active combat mission to protect the dam from destruction by the Germans before the allies appear? It happened in this movie. Would you be surprised that the DEAF soldier did not realize that the German plane was approaching from behind and would be beating him? It happened in this movie. Would you be surprised that a group of American soldiers stay in the barn in the country house where Germans came across, REMOVES your emotions at the sight of German soldiers who were only 50 years old? They did it in this film and left every possible entrance to the barn, which the Germans could check completely without protection. Would you believe that over the radio waves and a pure English captain he mentioned the rank of general, if not his name, as the person he talked with, and that the general, speaking in English about open radio waves, said that the dam must be protected the next day? Perhaps they should have sent an envoy to indicate the direction from which the American attack would come, to make the Germans somewhat easier. This so-called film should be placed on the list of 50 worst films. If that were the case, I am sure that it would work well. Observe this at your own risk.
