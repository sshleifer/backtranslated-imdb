If I could rate this movie by 0, I would have! I see ppl in IMDb, which says it's the funniest movie of the year, etc. Sorry? are you snorting LSD or ........? There is nothing funny in this movie N O T H I N G! Actually, I want my 27 minutes of my life that I spent watching this piece of shit. <br /> <br /> I read that someone sitting in the plane watching this movie stopped watching after 30 minutes, I completely understand it, I actually watched the snakes on the plane 2 times instead of watching this movie once! <br /> <br /> DO NOT watch this movie, do something useful in your life, do the dishes, go with the dog, hell ... everything is better than spending time in front of the TV watching hot rod.
