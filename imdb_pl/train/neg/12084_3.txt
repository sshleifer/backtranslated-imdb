Take: <br /> <br /> 1. gwiazdyna gra <br /> <br /> 2. the director with his own ideas, which uses <br /> <br /> 3. a copy of the set design of the popular theater production of the performance mentioned in 1 . <br /> <br /> 4. the actor at the head - who does not have a feeling for the role that I will play: "Hamlet, Prinz von DÃ¤nemark" <br /> <br /> I was listening to the radio show "Hamlet" with Maximilian Schellem as Hamlet and I were very disappointed. I was hoping that the filmed version would be better that Schell would at least have the body language to emphasize what he said - nothing. Then a set ... minimalistic design is not everyone's taste, but I usually like it when there is enough on stage to explain what the setting is and nothing more. Unfortunately, this is on stage, in the theater. It will not work in a film based on art that has reliable settings. That the idea for the set was copied from the theater production, in which Schell had already played Hamlet ... let's say it was the only complaint ... I ask myself how Schell could get a part of Hamlet in the first place and how everyone could let him play Hamlet a second time. If you have the choice to watch one of about sixty films based on the "Hamlet", do not watch this movie unless you're a masochist, really hardcore or you like to play with unreasonable actors.
