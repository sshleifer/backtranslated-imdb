Three years ago, Rachel (Therese Fretwell) was playing with her friends at the lake when her brother falls out of the boat and drowns. Rachel's friends think the time has come for her to stop fighting and blame herself for something she did not control. So take a brew and something to chew and return to the same lake that was in Rachel's constant nightmares. As expected, the bloodshed started already when two friends were stained before even going to the party. This move has the character of a high school game in which everyone has forgotten about their lines and "winged it" ... very bad! Writer Marcos Gabriel played the role of Rachel's leaner boy Leo. There are some poor actors besides Fretwell and Gabriel, and some of the characters you would like to strangle before being "thrown away". Paying attention to several other players who had the courage to appear: Erin Gallagher, Andrew Williams, Jasmine Trice and Derek Nieves. This is one DAY OF MEMORY which you will not lose.
