Such a long-awaited movie .. But he disappointed me and my friends who went to see the movie on the first day. With trailers he looked like an action movie, but it turned out to be a comedy out & out (bad comedy). But one thing that deserves recognition is the acting of those professional actors who have done their part of the film very well. Good acting, but I do not think it can save the movie. India has been shot beautifully. Kerala, Rajasthan (Ladakh?) They were fully saturated with color. Nevertheless, the way in which the inner beauty of these places was shot, made me want to know exactly where these places were and when I could go ;-) <br /> <br /> The action sequences were shot very miserable, no one could from head and tail stuntmen, they used Akki (akshay kumar) very well, but they could do a lot better ... <br /> <br /> Animation is the worst I've seen in recent movies (Movies from the 90's had better scenes an animation, probably (the initial scene in which the car falls off) flying should be a better word "way to the lake". <br /> <br /> And the name of the movie was exchanged almost every 20-30 minutes to be sure that the audience did not He will forget the name of the movie.
