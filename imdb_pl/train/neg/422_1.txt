A lot of death happens at large. You do not have to be a rocket scientist to understand that! But does it have to be the subject of a natural document? What is this fascination with macabre death? Do we really have to see an adult elephant torn to shreds by a flock of hungry lions? Or a cheetah grabbing the gazelle by the throat in slow motion, no less! I thought it would be a family-friendly nature movie! <br /> <br /> And why not have the courage to show macabre violence in film trailers? Did the filmmakers were afraid of losing money? <br /> <br /> Then, in a typical, comical way, we can see the wonderful Birds of Paradise, which perform mating rituals to the most annoying and stupid narrative possible humanly. It was surreal! It's as if the filmmakers believed that they were only turning to the first-graders maid on a school trip! Wow! From the middle to morons in the blink of an eye! <br /> <br /> If in the future, the film will see filmmakers documenting the future of nature, why not focus on: animals actually copulating; generating; laying eggs; bathing; sleeping; cleaning each other; sociable; game; emotional displays other than fear and anger; unusual behaviors, such as meditating in the mouth; migration; ability to solve problems; culture (yes, many species of animals have what people call culture); communication skills; parenthood, healing abilities, etc. In other words, stop focusing on violence or stupefying beauty, and why not be more rounded - instead focus on joy and inspiration?
