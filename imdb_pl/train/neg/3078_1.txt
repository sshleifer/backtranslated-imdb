I did not think that the comedy movie of horror would hang on both fronts ... really horrible. The fact that you do not take it seriously (usually it's a good thing) works against it, mainly because the actors are so wooden that you really swear that they're reading memory cards. As a result ..... the MST3K version, as always, has a few laughs ....
