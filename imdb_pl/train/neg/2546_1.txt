This movie is an idiot attempt of some action thriller. The tourist bus on the way to Las Vegas is attacked by a group of white buggers carrying buggies. They drive them out into the desert and then steal all their valuables. The plot is constantly changing. In an instant, they want to kidnap the daughter of a wealthy rancher, in the next they are looking for a $ 90,000 collector's stamp. Dialogue is terrible. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie.
