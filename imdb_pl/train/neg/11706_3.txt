Remarque's novel. A cast that looks great on paper. Leftist refugee fighting to stay in Paris between wars. A secret Gestapo officer. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that there is no synergy here. Fragments never connect. <br /> <br /> Stories about left-wing refugees in France do not have to be so boring. Read the diary of Arthur Koestler "Scum of the Earth" (if you find it). Or his chilling "Dialogue with death" (similarly). <br /> <br /> For me, the only interest in this movie lies in some random details. <br /> <br /> Pencils spend a lot of time drinking calvados, apple Norman brandy. I welcome every hint of having a tip of calvados. This certainly made the movie go faster. But according to the film, it is sold only in cheap, low-class stores. Vive le tabac parisien! I say so. References to intoxicating alcohols are numerous here; it seems to be preoccupied with scenarios. <br /> <br /> I like movies taking place in France, because it can be fun waiting for the inevitable full-size alcohol advertisement to appear on the wall in the background. I was not disappointed. This time it was for Byrrh, a very unusual choice. This film would be rated at 10, if we would rate it only on the basis of refinement of its alcohol paintings. <br /> <br /> Indifferent result of the film is Louis Gruenberg. Gruenberg is best known - if you can call it that - from his opera "The Emperor Jones", based on O'Neill's play. The premiere took place more or less at the same time as the film version with Paul Robeson. Opera survives today in a recording or two by Lawrence Tibbett. He should soon return to the surface; there were not enough market operas to revive. <br /> <br /> The opera seems to be the right topic to remember, because the character of Charles Boyer works under his "Czech" alias. Two of them are "Wozzeck" and "Gunther", both significant roles in the German opera. Is it just a coincidence? <br /> <br /> Shedding names seems to be part of the movie. Note that they call "Himmelstoss" on the phone. Himmelstoss is one of the main characters in Remarque's earlier song, All Quiet on the Western Front. <br /> <br /> Well, jokes are in place; I'm guessing that there was no time to develop any drama.
