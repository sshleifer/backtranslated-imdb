If you're not a learned filmmaker who has to see everything, this movie will not only be a waste of time and money and a huge disappointment, but it will also make you angry beyond faith. <br /> <br /> be a story worth telling somewhere in the middle, but Hopkins decided to hide it and encode it in so many unending chaotic layers of random audio-video chips, which will make the spectator's patience run out in a short time. <br /> <br /> Why Does someone like Hopkins choose such a hard, hardest and most unstable project as his first script, the first score and the third movie can guess. Maybe he played with it in his mind for so long until he became unrecognizable, how he became, even for himself. The result proves that he does not have enough experience or skills to achieve the desired result. <br /> <br /> Even the strangest films of Carpenter and Lynch, to name only two unusual filmmakers, were 90% more cohesive, 95% fewer heroes and 99% more stories. <br /> <br /> Sir Anthony pointed at the stars, but unfortunately a few light years passed. Stick to the action, in this section you are an unparalleled giant and no one should ask for more, even yourself!
