In the film, I feel that it should be more than just art. I think it should be something more, a way to tell stories on the screen. This shortcut from David Lynch tells a story, but not much. I felt it was funny, but it was too weird to be a comedy. It's a good movie, but there's nothing more. As I mentioned, I'm a big fan of David Lynch, but some of his work is frustrated because I do not see any need at all. It's definitely my least favorite thing he has done so far, but I know he still has a lot of talent and I'm excited to see what he has for us in the future. If you like Lynch, check this out, but do not be surprised if you do not like it.
