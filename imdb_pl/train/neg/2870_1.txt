Oh my God! Please, do not watch this movie for the love of all that is holy! This is the 82 minutes of my life I will never come back. Sure, I could stop watching half. But I thought it could be better. It was not. Anyone who really liked this movie is a seriously ill and twisted man. No wonder Australians / New Zealanders have a terrible reputation when it comes to making movies. Everything in this movie is awful, from acting to editing. I do not even write reviews, but in this case I will make an exception. I would just like someone to warn me before I hire this disaster
