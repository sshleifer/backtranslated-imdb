Anyone who saw the movie "Shine," Scott Hicks on the poignant but ultimately joyful life of pianist David Helfgotts; will I definitely realize that "SOLOIST" is very poor in comparison. It's as slow as a lullaby (I took five breaks, answering emails to wake up). Presenting the homelessness area above the summit and exceedingly indulgent, I am equally afraid of the terrible image of the battle at the beach in Joe Wrights, another attonment of the catastrophe. .Jepel Fox was a very poor example of action and lacked credibility due to offsets. On the other hand; although he is struggling with a bad movie, he can still be captivated, 9 Is it me, or maybe he turns into George Clooney in many ways?). Comparing both of these known so-called "STAR'aktory", this is not necessary, because the light that shines the brightest in terms of acting must be the light of "glittering" Geoeffry Rush, whose brilliant performance definitely brightened my sky. Both "Attonment" and "The Soloist" the written word gains much more awards for the empathy of the subject. Read the book and articles or wait for the DVD to be in the market basement soon.
