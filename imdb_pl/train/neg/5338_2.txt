Elvis Presley plays "half-racial" native American ("Indian"), who must defend his reserve against nasty business tycoons. Everyone likes to get drunk, fight and make children. Fighting, wrestling and "knocking out" replace one another with the stereotypical phrase "How"? <br /> <br /> Although he has makeup, it's obvious that Elvis is healthier than he did in previous movies; maybe he was preparing for the famous "return". It could not be because the script of this movie was something that you can get excited about. Joan Blondell trying to seduce Elvis and Burgess Meredith in "war paint" should be ashamed. <br /> <br /> The best song is "Stay Away" (actually "Green Sleeves" with different lyrics). The most embarrassing song is the love song Elvis to the bull "Dominik". There are some surreal scenes, but they never become monstrous enough to succeed in this genre; however, "Stay Away, Joe" can give you laughter if you're in the right mood. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, stay away. <br /> <br /> ** Stay Away, Joe (1968) Peter Tewksbury ~ Elvis Presley, Burgess Meredith, Joan Blondell
