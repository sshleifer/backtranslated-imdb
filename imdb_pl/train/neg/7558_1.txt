what are you doing, do not waste time making no sense. movie. A remake that did not have to be repeated. Everyone leaving the theater had the same comments. The worst movie I've ever seen. Save your time and money !!! <br /> <br /> Nicgolas Cage rode down the hills, swimming in muddy water and rolling down the hills, being attacked by bees, but still his suit was still perfectly pressed and the shirt was sharp until the last scene. <br /> <br /> Although a good cast from Ellen Bernstein and Cage, acting was just as unbelievable as the movie itself. It's amazing how good actors can make such bad movies. They do not receive a copy of the script first. If you're still interested in watching a movie, wait for it to appear on the DVD.
