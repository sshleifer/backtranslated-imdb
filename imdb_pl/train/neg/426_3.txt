Do not get me wrong, the movie is beautiful, the pictures are stunning and the material is dramatic. However, it was a huge disappointment and I was really angry about what Disney did. <br /> <br /> The planet Earth BBC was all above and more. It was subtle. It had a general sense of balance and showed a full circle of life and death. There was tragedy and triumph, loss and profit. It was balanced. <br /> <br /> Editing the Earth by Disney is none of this. They tried to make a movie about it that the Americans would talk about. They made it DRAMATIC. They put there the highest musical score to scare us. They made the predators bad. They made WALRUSES bad. They showed each meeting as negative. He tried to be tense and successful, but at the expense of balance lessons. The film was one and a half hours of a negative portrait and only about 10 minutes positive. <br /> <br /> I am in favor of preventing a global warning, but it was above the main political and environmental trash. <br /> This is another case, I went to see it on the big screen, but I was disappointed with the picture quality. It looked better on my TV at home. <br /> <br /> If you want to see something like that and download the whole picture, go out and buy, rent or rent a Planet Earth series from the BBC. Better lessons, better sound and (if you have Blu-Ray) better picture quality.
