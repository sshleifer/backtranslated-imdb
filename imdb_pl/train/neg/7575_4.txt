The retired diplomat, played nicely by Michael York, goes to Russia to take revenge on the Russian gangster who murdered the son of a diplomatic policeman. There, the diplomat meets an exceptionally strong and decent Russian policeman who helps him put the Russian gangster in court. <br /> <br /> I remembered old action movies from the 80s that always portray Russians as bad guys who undermine the just US government. It is interesting when this time the Russian hero will become a hero. <br /> <br /> This is not a great movie, it is usually an action movie "B". Michael York gives some class to this average movie. Alexander Nevsky, who plays a Russian policeman, is in a sense "bla", but surprisingly has chemistry with Michael York. Take a face, Michael York is such a good actor that he would have chemistry with anyone with whom he makes the stage. Unfortunately, handsome Adrian Paul is killed within the first 15 minutes of the movie. If Adrian Paul was in this film any longer, it would be an above-average movement of the "B" action. All I can say about Adrian Paul is that it's really nice to watch the first 15 minutes of the movie. The villain, played by Richard Tyson, is a typical bad guy. She is very blond and very vicious in this film. <br /> <br /> Rent this movie if there is nothing else to watch on TV. Fine. Not bad. Action scenes are decent. The action could be better, the story could move much faster, but hey, you can see what Russia is like today!
