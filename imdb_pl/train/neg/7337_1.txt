Painful. Painful is the only word that describes this horrible interpretation of such a funny and interesting Shakespeare play. I gave him a chance, but I was terribly disappointed and could not even comprehend him. For a person who wrote a novel about how wonderful this discovery of Much Ado was, I feel sorry for you and your bored brain. Let your grudges against young viewers be lifted without penalty. Please, do not bother with this devastating, disgusting excuse to perform the acclaimed Shakespeare drama. You will be forced to induce vomiting and you will need a chest of drawers near the TV from which you choose to watch this shit, because there will be an involuntary bowel movement.
