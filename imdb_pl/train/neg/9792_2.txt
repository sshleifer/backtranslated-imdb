PLEASE FIRST SAY THAT I READ MANGA AND THOSE MY ARGUMENT IS BASED ON DIFFERENCES. <br /> <br /> This anime really disappointed me because he removed the comedy and high quality manga and OVA action. What remained was just a slate of what could have been. Many heroes lacked the depth visible in the manga. Alucard is not a nice character who secretly wants death. There is no betrayal in Walter's story. And the Nazi villains who conspire around the world during the war are completely absent. Instead, the anime provides the villain of Gary Stu, Incognito, who is defeated despite what seems to be everything. <br /> <br /> My main complaint is not that the anime departs from the manga, but that it does such a bad job.
