If Mr. Cranky judged it, I would just be tempted to copy his review and paste it here. But like no, I have to give it a rest. <br /> <br /> The only thing that gives film 1 instead of 0 is that Malcolm McDowalel's acting is perfect. However, even he can not save this movie from disaster. The director had to be really distracted when he was working on it, because it is only a patchwork of scenes that were cast along with very little continuity - reminiscent of bad movies from the 70's. What's worse, both the actors and the director seemed to catch up, which probably showed how bad the original script was. <br /> <br /> It's not worth even talking about the plot, though it revolves around a futuristic corporation called Proxate Corporation, which created a crew of unnecessary people to carry a dangerous cargo on an old container / slave ship to Nigeria. The computer of this ship is a child kept in a glass jar and connected to one of the crew by USB 12 or something. The company should be called Prostate Corporation, because the entertainment value of this film is on par with the study of the same name. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I can not find a single scene that could be done well and done in the real sense in the context of the movie. I only watched it until the end because I had a bit of bird flu, and this movie reminded me that there are people who are actually worse than me - especially Malcolm McDowall. I will not oppose it because it is a great actor and every big actor has the right to one bad movie in his career, and this one is doosie. <br /> <br /> So if it's not the only movie Rent to work or you're a man, and your doctor does not do prostate research this week and you somehow feel that it's a bad thing, then give it a very wide field to of course, unless of course if you're really thinking about the community, buy a copy for Malcolm's support and then use it as a stand for drinks.
