Like all iconic TV shows, there is a group of people who like The Twilight Zone so much that they evaluate virtually every episode, as if they were the biggest EVER programs. Although a few of them are really great classics, the truth is that for every great episode there were a few that were mediocre and smelled at least. However, like die-hard Trekkies, Zone enthusiasts insist that all be golden. In fact, it prompted me to look at a few single episodes of the cult series instead of the films I usually watch. <br /> <br /> Although this is not the worst episode ever made, nor is it in the worst case, it is a weak any reasonable standard. The widow observes a long procession of Civil War soldiers passing her at home. In the end, a very unexpected turn of action is revealed and there is not much emotion or tension.
