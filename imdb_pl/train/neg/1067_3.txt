It attracts only a handful of segments. The segment with a garage employee from Nigeria is painful. One of Fanny Ardent and Bob Hoskins underlines, twists until the final shot. <br /> <br /> The problem with this movie is that only a few clips call Paris. Others are so scattered about the topic, tone, will and production that you might as well see "The Years Best Commercials, 2006." It's really everywhere. It does not develop during its duration and nothing reigns in directors. No structure successfully connects to pieces ... boredom enters. I am for an hour, twenty minutes and Elijah Wood is in some stupid, over - commercial, overproduced vampire shtick. It has almost as much in common with Paris as the older ladies knitting at Antartic. Fantasy appears, I think first in the Coen Brothers segment (Uh, thanks to J & E for ruining the next movie), and then she does too many performances. The point is that staying in Paris does not require pretend nonsense to make your days special. Why divide it into districts if the Quartier de la Madeleine is identified with vampires for a lost director? Have there ever been a more over-represented genre than a vampire movie. Every three years we get the same lame vampire stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Even worse, the transition from segment to segment is quite unimportant. Transitions are lost. It does not seem intentional, it is sloppy.
