What a preposterous story, the blackmail of murder, accusations of the sex of children, gays and the Catholic church ... absolute tripe. How is it that most British TV series, sit coms, etc. Must have mandatory gay, it really becomes tiring now. Everyone agrees that there are gay people in society, but there are also other minority groups, but we do not want to drown our throats (I pass this) in every single show. In addition to the above, the drama went from what could have been an interesting little story into a pantomime, the priest was a pedophile and there are gays running everywhere, yes, just to be completely PC, one of the gay couples was black. I'm surprised that ecclestone is even considering it when he read the script.
