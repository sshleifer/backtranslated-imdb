I never understood Garbo's attractiveness. He always appears in his films as getting stuck, not so appealing and the annoying voice that could drown out the tube section. She was also a very limited actress, for example Gloria Swanson, who left much better in a quiet era. In the latter film her performance is very average and even unwavering. He tries hard, but everything goes wrong, because the scenario is even worse than her acting. <br /> <br /> It would be a romcom screwdriver that is never credible and never breaks (even if Melvyn Douglas hover in the air on the ski stages, which are really the only fun thing here. <br /> <br / > There was potential, but the script fails in almost every department, wasting every actor in it, Douglas and Garbo had enough chemistry, but this one is not even a place on Ninotchka, which also turned out to be very overrated.
