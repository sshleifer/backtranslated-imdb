- = contains a spoiler from the original and film version = - <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of the Notre dame de Paris musical, I also read a book this summer and watched the movie today, at the beginning I was hoping to watch a good movie, especially when I saw 6.3 point IMDb. The first scenes were good, but actually I was waiting for the theater scene directly from the book, but it was normal, but when Esmeralda kisses gringoire I felt that something is wrong ... not even a kiss in the book, even in the musical ... <br /> <br /> and there was a huge abyss, why Esmeralda was judged by a wizard, in the book he teaches a goat how to answer the clock number or write the word "phoebus" .. wait, there was no phoebus? in this film, he is nothing more than a soldier, the creators made Quasimodo love to show and even cancel Froll's love ... but Notre Dame was frollo. his thoughts about the struggle between love for God and love for people in the movie, we can not find anything that we have, some villain who is really angry and kills people who clash with his thoughts ... and not to mention phoebus, not to mention about frollo love, not to mention jehana (brother frollo), not to mention Esmeralda's mother (maybe this is OK, the plot would be very fragmented) did not even mention a real story ... a cult member who is interested in alchemy, tries to make gold ... stuck in science and religion) <br /> <br /> in the end, I do not watch this movie, it's kind of a director's edition to a real masterpiece, and if you saw it before reading the book, God, have mercy on you. You have to read to immediately reserve ... <br /> <br /> this movie is worse than the hunchback of Notre Dame II animated film, spend your time watching the musical Notre dame de Paris .. enough to say ..
