The cavemen were by far the biggest load of bullshit I ever wasted on watching. This program based on Geico ads is less entertaining than the actual 30-second Geico ad. The make-up was at least semi-indifferent, it's hard to imagine a caveman with perfect white teeth even after going to the dentist. This program could have a fun series if he could get a cast from commercials, which is a bad program in itself. Perhaps if the writers were the same with Geico ads, it might have a chance, but the pilot lacked a good storyline. I give this show 1 in 10, I would like to put zero at 10, but it was not possible. I am praying for a quick death of this series, I would give him less than 5 episodes before dying a deserved death.
