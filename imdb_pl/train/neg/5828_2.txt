I could not agree with another reviewer who mentioned Jodorowsky. <br /> <br /> Barney seems to be completely boring and boring "in terms of content." He can produce sweets (and I like sweets), but his pretentiousness and basic artistic emptiness only diminish his joy. <br /> <br /> I am afraid that many people do not distinguish between similar (but really only on the surface) works by Jodorowsky or even more linear film makers such as Tarkovski or Kubrick (I love 2001 Odyssey and I have never been bored ending with scenes ...) This kind of art, like the work of M. Barney, adds confusion and scares away viewers who might otherwise start to appreciate the experimental cinema. Typical empty postmodern art "conceptual". And check out his interviews. I do not buy it, I'm sorry. And so boring. <br /> <br /> I have never been bored watching Alejandro Jodorowsky's films, while Drawing Restraint 9 was a complete disappointment. Especially when it offered the opportunity to be something to say something in a non-linear way (eg Beginning and great choreographic dance and preparation for the departure of a ship) Sends a "meeting" to the sea ... Ideas of faeces as a valuable object (if it was faeces). "Divers ... Anything could have created a wonderful surrealist movie with some content, but he did not do it ... Ceremony ... How vain and false and philosophically pretentious, but empty, can it happen? <br /> <br /> I have some wonderful, picturesque scenes, but the whole movie has become so boring and pretentious and completely empty and fake that I'm sick physically. <br /> <br /> And there is no good pace, I like movies with slow pace, but in some scenes it was after just boring - because it was pretentious and fake - so I was forced to witness a long-lasting artistic scene of vanity ... <br /> <br /> These kinds of movies simply kill art and spiri in my opinion. <br /> <br /> I want more Jodorowsky !!!
