"Arahan" does not add anything positive to the Kung Fu genre. It's a mistake to compare this mixed-up movie with the inspired madness and quality of Stephen Chow's films. <br /> <br /> First of all, the battle scenes are nothing new. Everything that was presented here was done earlier and better by people like Yimou Zhang, Tony Jaa and Jackie Chan. Fighting in intelligent motion Photos require logic. It seems that there is no point in giving blows that do not have any harmful effect, as in the sequels of the "Matrix". <br /> <br /> Attractive female advantage So-Yi Yoon captivated the screen, but never convincingly conquered the physical requirements of the role Ziyi Zhang did it easily in the "House of Flying Daggers". Having a martial arts background works well in Kung Fu movies. Manning inexperienced actors in these skills is a serious mistake (see Aya Ueto in "Asumi"), unless you're a very talented director who, as "Arahan", commands Seung-wan Ryoo not.
