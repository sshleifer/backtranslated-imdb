In fact, this movie, made in 1999, has quite good production values. The actors are attractive and reasonably talented. There is no group of clowns running around, throwing away hundreds of shells, but never hitting the body. There are also no wild chases / car accidents in which the useless destruction of thousands of thousands of dollars worth of machines is useless. <br /> <br /> The interiors look quite modern, architecturally, and the equipment looks like snuff. There is a modern computer room equipped with something that looks like the remains of an electronic laboratory from the 1950s. And the pancake makeup on the body broke me. Not pancakes for pancakes in the conventional sense, but what looks like a dried pancake batter spilled on their exposed skin. This is to support the idea that the body has calcified - although the way in which the virus will achieve this transmutation is an exercise left to the student (viewer). <br /> <br /> Ah yes, the virus. I would like to say that this is not the worst case of science fiction, a horror film I know, but I can not. A computer virus transmitted through the screen of a television (or computer monitor) and becomes a lethal biological pathogen? Give me a break. Warp a la drives "Star Trek" is one thing, but photons become viruses? It is so stupid that the desired "fear factor" is simply not realizable. The movie could use one of those awful dream sequences in which the living are dead, or have a cat jumping out of the closet, or something like that because a viral thing does not do it. <br /> <br /> It is assumed that Robert Wagner has the same excuse to play in this misfortune that Lord Oliver gave to some of his later shoddy premises. He needed money. However, no other comparison should be interpreted.
