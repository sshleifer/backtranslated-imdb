I agree with the comments of other users that the two main roles were well-preserved, that is, the guy who played Gary Gillmore and the role of Giovanni. It is a pity that the story was so boring. Without hearing about the story, I did not know anything about Gary Gillmore before the movie, so I did not know what to expect. I thought it would be something like Dead Man Walking or The Chamber, but how wrong I was. The whole movie just talked, talked and talked about his mom and dad. The only cool scenes were the flashbacks in which my father lost his temper. It was the only interest I got from this borefest.
