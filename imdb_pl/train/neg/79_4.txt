The original book of this set was made in the 1950s, but this will not apply to the TV series, because most people look at the style of the 1930s. Ironically, the train at the end of the tour was a train from the 1950s, which looked like a train from the 1930s, so Underground can play this game. Hanging the plot on the story about the Jarrow March was weak, but the 1950s version had pupils who started thinking about the world around them, so I suppose that thinking about marrying the marchers is the same. Everything that Japp had to satisfy was too weak, but they had to put something in to fill the time. It would be a decent half-hour show or they could film a book and make it a long, long show. It's obvious that this episode is a victim of style over content.
