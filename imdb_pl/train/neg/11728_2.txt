Previously, Wesley Snipes enjoyed several action films and expected much more, even with a 5.8 IMDb result, the film is not funny and although the story is thin and unoriginal, the acting is unfortunately thinner and follows the "worst-case scenario" of playing "strong" feelings with bad behavior ... Do not waste time making this movie fun, if you want to cry, that may be enough, though your tears will cry because of seeing Wesley Snipes in the tragic comedy from the action movie ... <br /> < br /> I give it 2/10, it really was awful, if you want to see a decent movie, go see a shooter or rent it, all this good stuff this movie is not.
