The Little Mosque is one of the most boring CBC comedies I've ever seen. They have a way of creating the easiest comedy programs for the oldest, easiest offending viewers, which for CBC means 85-year-old farmers in Saskatchewan. The jokes are predictable and so lame lame that I can not believe it. The performances are very noisy and interrupted, but I do not blame the actors, because this kind of one-dimensional stereotypical characters are probably exactly what CBC asked for. A very bad show with bad jokes that they tried to portray as "controversial" is less controversial than other boring CBC comedies like The Hour Has 22 Minutes, Royal Canadian Air Farce and Rick Mercer's Report.
