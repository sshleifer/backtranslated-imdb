First three words: READ THE BOOK! Really guys - it shows the difficulties associated with the real interpretation of esoteric matters. I loved this book and I was totally disappointed with the movie. It was ridiculous, with half a heart and a bad story explained. Novel - first of all! - it was not intended for an adventure! It's just a neighborhood. In the film the focus turns to this and the message takes up the back seat! Additional visual effects showing the energy of all living beings and explanation of the events at the end were economical! They screwed up! ... I never watch it again!
