I understand that I want to make a movie which is sharp and different. I understand that the previous reviewer comments that this is an undefined video. I mean, as soon as this movie is over, my first comment was: "This is what happens when a rich princess wants to become a movie star and has no talent" ... uses daddy's money to make a movie that she wrote, directs and pays for ..... of course, close to the movie, to realize that there is no character development and no directions, such as the beginning, middle and ending ..... the part of the voyeur was good and spicy, but what was the point? I saw a woman going home, finding a few photos, a screwed over caretaker, going outside on a very cold night (unbelievable) to check the noise and running over the caretaker's lover ... the movie is over ..... is someone training my ignorant ass? I really want to know what's going on ... what was the vision of the directors ... why is there no development of a dead lover? Why is there no background on the caretaker? What is the sense of night vision? What is the meaning of lipstick in the car? Why a dead caretaker? Why tell us about a fleeing mental patient / peeper? What about urn? Oh, and the lamp should mean who this house is? Territorial? Why? Why would the caretaker have the impression that it was his home? this aspect has never been realized ... as in the case of William Defoe ... I rented this movie because it was in it and known for its frightening characters ..... answer and tell me what I need to learn .... . I'm just a mom in Central America who loves movies .... Chris ....
