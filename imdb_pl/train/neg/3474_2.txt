This is terrible. The character Ben Affleck is egocentric and joyfully sadistic - a sadistic fratboy with a punch in his nose. And he is a romantic HERO! His drawing character does not change from beginning to end, but his money ultimately allows him to buy happiness. <br /> <br /> If I were a socialist, I would have scandalized beyond belief, but I am not a socialist. br /> <br /> Us, capitalists, from time to time we like a little Christmas magic. This is not magic. I do not know what is it. It's just awful. And this terrible waste of talents. O'Hara makes me laugh hysterically since the late 70's. Gandolfini. Applegate. All these people were underestimated. If Ben was not in the equation, these people could come up with something perfect.
