A cool, alienating adaptation of Rebecca West's book about the captain's army returning from service during World War II with impaired memory (now is the original idea!). It looks like he remembers the old flame of Glenda Jackson, but not the current wife of Julie Christie, which should be enough to cause emotional sparks. This extremely well-planted sapper brings together the leading man Alan Bates with director Alan Bridges and the starring stars Jackson, Christie, Ann-Margret and Ian Holm, but the burners are at a low level. There are some good scenes (especially when Jackson is on screen), but Bridges' tempo is extremely slow, and the subdued color of the film is energy efficient. It is best to forget about this "soldier" for a long time on the shelf. * 1/2 of ****
