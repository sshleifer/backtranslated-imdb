I do not quite get the rating for The Amati Girls and I think I was REALLY nice, giving him 4 out of 10. What would otherwise be a great story, in fact a set of more or less decent actors has become a total farce of my eyes. There are so many clich√©s in this movement that women's hair is simply awful, and most of the scenes are more than unrealistic or seem false. There is no real passion in this film, but a bunch of actors are exaggerating with any restrictions that hurt. It's not fun enough to be a comedy, it's too fake to really touch, so in my eyes it just is not good. Watching it, I could not believe how it came to my TV in my living room in Switzerland. But ... maybe it was still OK and just got lost in the translation? Who knows. Definitely one of the strangest movies I've ever seen, and it's definitely not in a good way! Excuse me.
