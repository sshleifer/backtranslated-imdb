OK, we all love the princes of daisies, but what's up in this cast. Let's start, Jessica Simpson as Daisy, there is not a single country about this girl, and Daisy was not stupid! Uncle Jesse was probably the closest to the original. No offense to Burt, but I've never noticed that Boss HOg is so high. It was part of Boss Hog's humor, which was his size. Did they even try someone like Danny Devito?!? OK, now get it, they threw Jessica Simpson or did anyone look at her husband? Matches Luke Duke to the tee !!!!!! Cleary these producers did not look at the appearance of the old cast members. The screen was never present on the princes !! This made the movie turn off from the beginning. It gives HUGE thumbs down.
