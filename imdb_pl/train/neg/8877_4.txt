"Major Payne" is a movie about a major who makes life a living hell for his small group of boys in the Marines. This film does not have much to offer, but it provides some fun moments to watch. However, do not expect that it will be an unforgettable movie. Just expect that you will laugh through the movie and at the expense of other people. Major Payne's confrontation with a plump boy was hilarious and that's all I remember from the movie, with the exception of boys wanting revenge on Major Payne. Again, this is not a great movie and it is probably best to watch it on a rainy day when you need some laughter.
