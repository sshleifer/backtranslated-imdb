A typical Liza movie that had limited appeal to the public thanks to its weak plot line, which was simply made to justify MGM Lazy's contract at the time. <br /> <br /> As reported by the Lastliberal member (above), Grayson could not bear Lanza, because of his indecent progress toward turning it off (and sometimes in the camera). In addition, his gut manners and the continuous smell of alcohol on his face during common scenes were unbearable. After making the second (and last) movie together, "Toast of New Orleans," normally quiet Grayson ran into Louie B. Mayer's office and told him in uncertain terms that he would never work with Lanza again. Dot. Mayer thought that Grayson was much more valuable to MGM than Lazy, so Grayson's statement stuck in place. Grayson played in many widely known (and much more profitable) musicals with Howard Keel and others. Later in life, when she was asked to compare Liza and Keel, her answer was: there is no comparison between them, and Keel was great at work and had much more attention for the "real people" in the audience.
