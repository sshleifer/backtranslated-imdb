I must say that I was very curious about watching this movie and was considered a loud catastrophe released by 20th Century Fox in the 1970s. He also appeared on several criticism lists of bad movies, and that only deepened the interest, because I just had to see what made this movie so bad. After seeing this, I think I have my answers. Although I will say that it has to do with interesting watching, acting, directing and the script are so bad that the alleged satire is completely missing. Racquel Welch seems to be trying to move the movie, but after the initial sequence of sex change operations, the film goes so far down that it can not cope with the task itself. John Huston as Uncle Buck Loner certainly does not help, because he licks and bends over the screen, sometimes looks like he wonders what he's doing there. Rex Reed jumps like Myron, Myra's alter ego, and even has her famous masturbation scene. Bravo on debut shows! Farrah Fawcett plays a stupid blonde; she certainly seemed convincing in that role. But of course the most famous role was given to Mae West. A view of a 75-year-old woman with a plastic face that made sexual innuendos seem more appropriate for a horror movie. I do not intend to refute this personally; but in this movie no one looks good. The direction seems so unwavering and non-existent that the film is not only bad, but also boring. Upload some old movie footage of old stars, and the movie will become even more disconnected. Anyone who liked it, and I was glad that at least I saw it, but Myra Breckenridge seems to be a catastrophe that has always been considered from the beginning.
