Dear God! I waited for this movie to start ... and then wait until it was done ... and when it did not work, I just sat, stunned, that: 1) it could be so bad, and 2) that I have just wasted a few hours on ordinary stupidity. I believed that Drew could not create this bad movie ... and boy, have I ever lost faith? Do not worry about it! Drew tried, but the movie was poorly written, it worked badly and it was just badly conceived! I can not believe that a letter so bad has ever been financed! He had a million chances to do something with this idea (the word "concept" is too big for the film to even qualify!) And it still has not happened! It's just pathetic! Where another reviewer came up with the idea that this is not the worst, it surprises me! Because believe me, if it was worse, I would cut my wrists before finishing!
