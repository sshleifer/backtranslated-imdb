I hate that this film has absolutely no creative contribution. I know that they are striving for realism, but to be honest, I do not want realism. Realism is boring. If I want to see everyday life, uhm, I live. Tell me an interesting story and we'll talk. I can deal with low production values, I'm a sucker of low production values, but at least I'm working on some good ideas. The direction goes as far as grabbing the camera and walking on it, but of course I have to dig it out, because it makes things much more realistic. Hitchcock used to say that drama is basically a life with blunt cuts. I can only say that this is not a drama, not a long shot. We see Rosetta walking somewhere, Rosetta working in the bakery, Rosetta eating waffles, Rosetta carrying bags from a distance, Rosetta returning home, somewhere Rosetta ... it's not so much fun. It also has no deeper meaning. I was so bored that I started to look for reflection on life in this film, but it is just plain realism, the most overrated quality in business. I think I should love it, but come on, there's nothing there.
