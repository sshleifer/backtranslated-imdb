It was a short disappointment. Definitely the worst adaptation of one of my favorite novels. The dialogue was terribly clumsy; I did not feel the feelings behind the words expressed by the characters. The lines were delivered too hastily and were rather out of place. They could also be quoted by statues. The chemistry between George C. Scott and Susannah York did not exist, and the observation of the American Rochester was strange. He could at least try to make a British accent. I like actor George C. Scott, but it just does not work. I felt like I was watching the most important parts of Jane Eyre, where the main fragments of history were randomly combined regardless of the course of history. The scenery and music were very nice, but I did not feel passion and love between Jane and Rochester, and the film left me completely unshakeable. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good version of Jane Eyre, I suggest you watch the BBC version of 1983 with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke or the 1997 version with Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton. Now these two are great adaptations.
