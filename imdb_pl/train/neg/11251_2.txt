Sky Captain is probably the best horrible movie I have seen in a long time. With amazing graphic effects and special effects, cast casts with A list (Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie and infinitely nice Giovanni Ribisi) and races with an overused, but told by Indiana Jones story, it should be a great movie to watch. <br /> <br /> "Should" be crucial here. <br /> <br /> Jude Law plays Joe the Sky Captain with an elegant accent and lots of exaggerations - a good, delightful little smile, but you can not do anything, and even his nonchalant delivery and boyish good looks can not save the stone dialogue of the movie . (If he hit Giovanni Ribisi in the back and said, "Good boy, Dex", only ONE more time, I could attack the whole guy in front of me.) Gwyneth Paltrow, like Polly Perkins, is nothing but a nervous network. Her nasal whimper and not too sarcastic comments grow old in the first ten minutes of the movie. Maybe she put too much effort into playing the stereotypical heroine from the 30's comics, who knows? I expected more from her. An example of how a similar character was played (and well played) is the flick from the late 90s "The Phantom" with Kristy Swanson and Billy Zane. Rent a movie and you'll know what I mean. <br /> <br /> Giovanni Ribisi and Angelina Jolie were favors in the film. (Angelina Jolie was incredibly hot in this eyepatch.) I admit it.) In several short scenes, both actors somehow managed to rise above the tired material and provide more riveting than their dry, two-dimensional buddies. br /> <br /> The plot and constant development of the story were an old, boring and simply monotonous combination of every good scene from the action movie in the last thirty years. The pace is fast in the first half of the movie, and the pace of the snail in the second, giving viewers enough time not only to guess the final end of the movie, but also to determine who is the key villain. Pairing is rather trivial, Polly Perkins and Sky Captain apparently combine after a few years of separation from a bitterly endangered romance, and their story is not as adorable and eclectic as annoying and unmatched. When they finally come to terms with their feelings at the end of the movie, no one is surprised and no one really cares. <br /> <br /> Props for the director to appreciate Bai Ling enough to dress her in a tight vinyl for the whole movie, as well as intriguing sepia shades that served as a coloring. But Sky Captain, despite all the important elements of being a great movie, falls flat on his face. Not even worth $ 2.75 I paid for the theater entrance.
