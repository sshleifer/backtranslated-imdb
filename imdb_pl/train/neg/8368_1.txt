Watching a small man, you will spend time trying to discover many holes. And this is not a good sign, because this movie is supposed to be a comedy! Your should laugh at it !! So good? Probably not. <br /> <br /> The main problem of a little man is his concept - it's too absurd to accept (even as a comedy comedy), so when loud, hardworking and timeless jokes start working, they form the whole thing seems ten times dumber than It's already. <br /> <br /> "But this comedy" some of you may be shouting. That's true, but that does not justify such a stupid plot. I mean, think about it, if you saw a child from the FACE OF A GROWING MAN, would not you be the least suspect? And if Calvin wanted to hide the diamond so much, why did not he put it on the nearby shelf instead of the random womans handbag? And how can a qualified doctor NOT recognize that Calvin is an adult man? I mean seriously ... what? <br /> <br /> "It's not about the storyline, about laughter," you can shout. Well, see you, there's almost no laughter in a little man, and that just makes this stupid plot even better. <br /> <br /> If you really want to watch the wayans brothers comedy with faith suspending the story, stick to the white chick, because at least he had some decent laughter.
