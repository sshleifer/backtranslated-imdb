I must say it's a horrible movie because the film itself is displayed in the guide and is documented. When I watched it, I began to laugh, thinking to myself, does this guy really expect me to believe it's true? I had to check it out, and now I see it's a movie, but now, because it's not a documentary, it's a movie with bad acting now. Yes, it's pretty bad anyway. Actually, I did not get to the end. I had to turn it off. I am a NYC policeman and I felt that someone is trying to mislead people who think it's a documentary, with the intention of making money for a terrible day for me and my colleagues. So I took it a little in person. Maybe I was blinded by it and it's not as bad as I personally think. Everyone has their own opinion.
