"Dutch Schultz", AKA Arthur Fleggenheimer, was a real person and his rather nasty life is quite well documented. This film, which is to portray his life, should have used a fictional character, because exaggerated events are too strong a departure from facts and chronology. What's more, he ignores some interesting details that included other versions, such as the public relations fiasco in the northern US and his religious conversion. It is true that he was executed by Luciano, Lansky and others. aluminum. but it's so far away. The explosive record scene, which depicts Luciano carrying out the execution of Bo Weinberg in his own home, supported by his own mother, is ridiculous. There is also a scene in which the Dutchman approaches his mother to pay for the protection of the Diamond Legs. It just does not work. The character of Mrs. Fleggenheimer does not work either. This film does not need a charming Jewish mother for comic relief. The lame representation of Diamonds Legs was humorous enough. I'm sure the man is turning in a grave. By the way, the Dutch actually killed personally, but it was not Rambo or 007. The scene in which the brewery is erased is absurd. I do not know. Maybe it was supposed to be a comedy, and I did not understand it.
