It really does not do justice to the blues. It starts wrong with images from the traveler's probe and Blind Willie McTell (or Blind Lemon Jefferson? Someone blind) and apparently tells from space (?) And tells the life stories of various blues musicians. Whatever it is, it can be the most visually interesting part of this document. Then the only thing to see are actors incompetently speaking classic melodies, filmed in fake black and white hits from the 20's with songs like Beck and Shemekia Copeland, who are raping the same songs. It's a good device to show us why the former great Blues were really great, but that does not provide an attractive viewing experience. There is almost nothing that could justify making it a movie, not a radio game. No one should be forced to watch these ill-made reconstructions. It's a pity Wendersa, Scorsese, and especially Blues. Avoid at all costs.
