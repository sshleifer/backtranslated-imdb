I am a huge fan of Stephen King. I loved Running Man. Of course I was very excited that someone did a film about it. And when the local network showed the movie, I was in heaven. I was ready for a fun night! <br /> <br /> The first indicator that something was wrong was that I noticed that someone had cast Arnold Schwarzenegger. I just could not believe that a man who became famous for films filled with "shooting" could play a more insidious role, as described in the book. Still, I was convinced that it would be a good movie. Who knows, maybe Arnold had some hidden talents? <br /> <br /> Well, he did not do it. I soon learned that the only reason he was even cast was that someone re-wrote the whole story to do it in the fight against "shooting." Yes, it was Arnold's standard film: the hero is badly made, the hero solves problems, bends powerful muscles and scares everyone, and the hero gets a girl. <br /> <br /> I was stunned. This is NOT what the book said at all. I know that books can not be literally displayed on the screen, but it did not even have a connection with the book. Stephen King should openly condemn all connections with the film and should prohibit the use of the title "A Running Man" for this shamelessly wasting film. I do not say that often, but this movie was BAD. If I did not watch at home, I would throw rotten tomatoes on the screen. Once again: angry. <br /> <br /> (Note that I used a lot of "someone." I did it because I'm sure that many people are ashamed to work and I do not want to embarrass them even more by naming them here)
