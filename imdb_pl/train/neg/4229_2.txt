I am a big fan of such low-budget horror movies, but give me a break! It must be the worst bit of the S @ # t monkey I've ever seen! I ignored the reviews posted on this site, considering that it would fall into my taste with horror, but I got bored and turned off. from the home magazine. The masks were made of something that looks like a tin foil. <br /> <br /> The Gore: Gore was pretty good, I have to admit it. But Ittenbach's Burning moon was better for a low-budget movie. <br /> <br /> Acting: it was awful! Dubbing did not bother me. I consider it humorous, as in Ittenbach's "Premutos" (great movie). The sequences of fights and actions were pi $$ weak. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Do not watch any of Schnaas's films. There are a lot of better directors like Jorg Buttergeit and Olaf Ittenbach with films of the same genre and subject matter. Check out Premutos, House of Blood, Schramm and necromantix.
