Usually I'm inclined to like gonzo movies with a low budget, but Darkman III is so horribly indecent that I do not feel anything but contempt for him. <br /> <br /> It looks and feels like a TV show, especially a tacky one in it. Sets are rare, flat lighting, score and disconnected effects, and the camera is a movie school 101. There is no conspiracy, characters are one-dimensional, and the actors are sleepwalking. Most casts look as if they should make soft porn cores ..... In fact, the only reward I got from this mess was seeing Roxanna Biggs-Dawson's surprising squint with face (B'Elanna from Star Trek: Voyager) without Klingon makeup . Her skin tone is two shades lighter than in Voyagera; either she was bleached for this role or she was darkened for Voyager. In any case, very strange.
