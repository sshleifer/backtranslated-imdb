Phew - I do not know what to say. This is a movie that can be really good with a group of staged viewers. Some of the acts reminded me of John Waters' early offers. Perhaps I should take it back - I do not want to insult Waters' ability as a director / storyteller. <br /> <br /> I particularly liked the lawyer accepting the "full faith and credibility" clause. Incidentally, it is "full of faith and merit". <br /> <br /> It also reminds me of "The Conrad Boys", where the main actor is also a screenwriter, director, editor, etc. many involved ventures, such as those probably best left to very experienced film professionals who would have technical skills (although stunts, some might say) to draw something like this.
