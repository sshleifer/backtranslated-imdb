I am the wife of a youth pastor and we took some young people to see this movie. Then we spent an hour trying to explain to them. They did not understand this and did not like it. It is based on a concept that has gone through all three major religions of the world (Bible Code, Torah Code and the Koran Code) and is so doubtful that it can be ridiculous. This is not a step forward for Christians in art, it is a step forward for those who believe that we check our brains at the door.
