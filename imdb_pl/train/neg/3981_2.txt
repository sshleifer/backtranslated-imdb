This film really has no beginning or end. And it is really VERY unbelievable. Mary-K and Ashley are to be interns working in a mailing room for an Italian fashion company. But for some reason they are placed in a five-star hotel (conveniently located across the street from the Coliseum), and all other interns with whom they work are just as abnormal as they are. One of the things that I found in this film is obvious, how one of the twins does NOT end with a guy. I think that they tried to twist their usual thread a bit. Nice try.
