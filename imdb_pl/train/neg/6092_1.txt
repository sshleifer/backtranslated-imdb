Someone had to seriously joke when they made the movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, it is absolutely impossible to make this movie in 1993. Fashion and music demand it to be seriously in the 80's. I guess it's been sitting on the shelf for a long time before some crazy distributor lifted it and released it into an unbelieving world. <br /> <br /> There is a conspiracy. Type. A strange loner meets an accidental bearded man who tells him that if he meditates, singing his favorite song, he will be able to turn into anyone he chooses. At this point, I feel obliged to indicate that the favorite song of the loner is London Bridge Is Falling Down. Why is this his favorite song? Because he is an idiot. We are only a minute in the film and the film has already reached a monumental level of stupidity. It's even stupid. <br /> <br /> The solitary is the nostrils collector. I can only assume that there are two scenes in the movie that show how he lifts his nose. This explains the title. He decides to change into a girl so he can get closer to other girls. And kill them. That's more or less that. <br /> <br /> Acting is generally terrifying. Every performance in this movie sucks. In fact, I would even go so far as to say that acting is the standard of a pornographic film. It's really scary. The probe nostrils appear to the audience as a sampler of the nostrils. The film's heroes see him as a girl who became by singing London Bridge Is Falling Down. Man, I feel like an idiot, even writing this. In any case, it is strange that I see a middle-aged freak who meets with school girls. And not in a good way. There is even an extensive editing of scenes in which the nostril collector is in a school with girls, and the song plays upstairs. This is probably the worst song ever recorded. I do not even intend to describe it. You'll find out when you hear it. And you will agree with me. <br /> <br /> There are certain scenes of violence, clear. And there is a sequence of Benny Hill chase in which a transsexual participates. There is even an immortal dialogue that may or may not have been taken from Shakespeare or John Milton, where the nostril gatherer says to the prostitute: "I have cash if you have wounds." Wonderful, I'm sure you will agree. <br /> <br /> Useless nonsense.
