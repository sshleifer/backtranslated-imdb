I'm not sure why Spike Lee made this wreck of the movie and went crazy Stevie Wonder to eternal combination of his beautiful music with this theatrical mess. I also regret that she uses profanity as part of the normal black prose. Abusing his power over viewers from ethnic films is a shame. Scenes that appear painted in blue and have nothing to do with the topic or sub-themes, play as if a college kid wrote it. I am particularly disgusted with the ridiculous scene in which the two conduct jokingly sparring for no reason, and the cops come in and attack Snipes sharply. Excessive conduct leads to the fact that Spike has no respect for its viewers or has no idea what the film is all about. The final scene seems to be thrown in to justify the use of the Saxon hammer to give a point. This film also supports the myth that all people of culture use the word F in casual conversation. I hope he realizes that the rest of his films are in the same pot as the one in which he does not develop as a filmmaker. I think his relationship with Scorcesee at Clockers was a wise move. He should stick to documentaries like Four Little Colored Girls. Films about shock are not the work of Oscar.
