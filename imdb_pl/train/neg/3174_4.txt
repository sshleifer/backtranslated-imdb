Jeff Lowell misspelled and directed the movie "Over Her Dead Body". The idea is primarily as old as my jokes, and the performance is just icing on the cake. <br /> <br /> Minus Eva Longoria Parker does not have anything appealing in this movie. Eva looks great as always and provides a nice performance. <br /> <br /> Paul Rudd looks tired and least interested. Lake Bell is a complete mistake. It looks masculine and provides strictly average performance. Jason Biggs is wasted, just like Lindsay Sloane. <br /> <br /> I was expecting more entertainment from this movie. Unfortunately, I did not play.
