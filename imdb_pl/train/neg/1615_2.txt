The same old man about Che. He completely ignored the really interesting facts about Che's real character. Sodeberg repeated the same boring story about Che. Stupid tempting story about an Argentine rich boy who was so shaken by poverty, he became Robin Hood fighting at the side of the poor, until he was finally murdered by the CIA. Yes, yes, I heard all this before, CHRISTMAS and AGAIN! The reality of Che Guevara is completely different and much more explosive! The facts show that he was totalitarian with the passion of a messiah who openly wanted to impose Maoist tyranny on the world. He was so fanatical that in the hottest moment of the Cold War he even begged the Soviet Union for atomization in New York, Washington or Los Angeles and led to the end of the world. CHe called on Khrushchev to start a nuclear attack on US cities. For the rest of his life, he said that if his finger was on the button, he would push him. When Khrushchev withdrew and literally saved the world, Che was furious at "betrayal." If Che's recommendations were followed, you would not read this review right now. As a deadly maniac has become a pop icon, he would have made a much more interesting movie. It is amazing that no filmmaker dared to show the real side of Che and his posthumous media transformation. WHO DID Oskar film! I thought creating an independent movie meant taking REAL RISKS and being GROUNDBRAKING! They only stick to "safe counter-cultural themes" such as "Che cool", "Wall Street bad", "Republican = Nazi", "Bush ex Hitler", "NRA is worse than KGB", "Christians are fanatics and fools", etc. ... nauseum ad. Oooh, how daring, how the mind blows. Tres anti-mainstream and spicy. I would like them to have some real kojon√≥w and deal with the Independent Film Oligarchy! That would be really bold!
