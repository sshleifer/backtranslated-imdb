This is probably one of the worst French films I've seen so far, out of over 100 French films I've ever seen. A horrible scenario and a very mediacre / unprofessional action causes the director to be powerless. with all this, it does not matter how cool the western French scene and fanciful music can add to history. <br /> <br /> One of the main weaknesses of this movie is that these two characters do NOT attract people, the audience I do not care what happens to them. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see how this film won the jury in Cannes, man, I love almost all awarded films in Cannes, but not this one. A big disappointment for me.
