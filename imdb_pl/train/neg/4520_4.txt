Irwin Allen was great. All of his television programs have had a great pilot or the first episode. the rest was basically a break from his other performances. Several episodes of Swiss Family Robinson were a rip off of his older television programs. One episode of the Swiss family is identical to the episode of Land Of The Giants, when a party member needs appendectomy surgery. The performance was high budget and too expensive to continue. Irwin lost contact with television programs after the 1960s. Acting is strong thanks to Martin Milner. The children's stars appearing there start with the show, like Willie Ames and Helen Hunt. the bright point is that Irwin Allen includes his catastrophic scenes, such as typhoon and volcanic eruption, dubbed him "Master of Disaster"
