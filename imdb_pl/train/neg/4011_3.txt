For each series that goes to television, 100 ideas are created, 50 scenarios are written, 15 pilots are created, and one, only one, actually goes into production. Thanks to this selection process, we are convinced that the final product must be the cream of this crop, for what other reason so many ideas can be rejected, to give us a single TV series. <br /> <br /> And so it goes with True Blood; all the stars were in one line and what started as a series of novels turned into an idea, a game on the screen, a pilot and finally a series. Unfortunately, it can sometimes be a long journey and there are many turns along the way that ultimately change what is good and clean, and show that people in production feel best for ratings. Oh, how often they are wrong ... <br /> <br /> Real blood is an example of a creative concept that has developed into one of the poorest plots, the worst acts and stupidest storylines in the history of the latest television. His international cast of relatively unknown actors fights to find their voices, but stumbles over their false south accents. Not so secret Alan Balla's desire for Ryan (Jason Stackhouse) gives us new naked shots every week, although they often have nothing to do with the plot. The characterization of Tara's angry black woman is not connected, and you are secretly hoping that the vampires will take her quickly before going on to the next speech with white suppression, during the ceremony of the Glorious Dead Confederacy. He himself discovers the suppressed love for Sookie and suddenly we have to believe that he must watch over her in the morning, at noon and at night, despite years of working with her and avoiding such relationships. <br /> <br /> Regarding Bill Vampire, his moral basis is quickly surrendered at the first opportunity to make love to Sookie and there is no problem with making her a quick snack (although it remains a bit unscathed). Other vampires are not as mainstream as Bill, but they very much want to be accepted by the public when they look at those living like Happy Meals with their feet. <br /> <br /> Despite my best efforts of suffering for the first six episodes, I came to the conclusion that no matter how long you watch a bad series, it's still bad. Something is dying for some reason, even vampires. Maybe this program should.
