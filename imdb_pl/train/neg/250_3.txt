Seeing three other versions of the same film, I'm afraid that this is by far the weakest result, mainly due to the rather boring and lead Scottish performance. His emotions are so bland that it is difficult to get involved in the movie. Alistair Sim introduced the role infinitely better. When Scrooge was the worst, you do not understand that Scott is saying with great conviction, and when he's undergoing a metamorphosis, he's equally unconvincing. I can not come up with any actors in this movie who match those from the Alistair Sim version. Even the music version (and to be honest Muppets) are doing it better. Very disappointing.
