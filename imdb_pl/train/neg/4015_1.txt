a friend gave me this, saying it was another classic, like "Debbie Dallas". Nowhere near. I think my main complaint is about the most unattractive porn actress in the industry. It is even scarier that it is on screen all the time. But I read somewhere that in those days pornography had to have some "artistic" value. However, I could not find him. See this only if you are interested in the history of pornography development in the mainstream or appreciate art in porn movies. I know I'm not. But the director of the film seems to be a talented person. He even tried to get Simon and Garfunkel to give him permission to use his songs. Of course they rejected.
