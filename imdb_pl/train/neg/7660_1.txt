0 * 's Christian Slater, Tara Reid, Stephen Dorff, Frank C. Turner, Mathew Walker, Will Sanderson. Director: Uwe Boll. <br /> <br /> Based on the video game director Uwe Bollu, he is unfortunately trying to play the game in a full-blown guitar playing, but unfortunately he fails. Instead, it creates one of the worst films ever made! Although he got a little fame, such as Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff, his film lacks the necessary foundation for a good movie, such as a story, and some basic relativity of what is happening in the dark and light. The film bounces around, and Uwe Boll has no creative control. And not to mention the bad CGI used to create monsters. Although they looked great, and the feeding was good, a little lame. Honestly, this is one of the worst films ever. My final rating 0/10.
