The six-hour Italian mini-series Quo Vadis Franco Rossi is a very interesting beast, creating an absolutely convincing world of ancient Rome, in fact fashion (very few long shots, without great urban landscapes), but so dramatically playing in the allusion to classic literature and history that history is constantly lost in the background. <br /> <br /> The changing structure (most of the first episode is played using the voice above the letters), and the lack of narrative diligence makes the full six-hour version simultaneously demanding and undemanding, and certainly too often uninvolved, but it has something in common. The two main strengths are the characteristics of Petronius (gratefully named Frederic Forrest, whose own voice would almost certainly flatten his dialogue) as a man who was looking for a sharp angle so long to survive his courtly life that he became unable to experience emotions, and a unique approach Klaus Maria Brandauer to Nero as a would-be actor, whose every move and action is calculated on the basis of how his "audience" will receive it. Elsewhere, Max Von Sydow appears briefly in several episodes, being rewarded with the most impressive and genuinely moving scene here, he meets a child when he is trying to leave Rome. This is something that a program can do with more, but it seems that it is too often flattening every potentially emotional, inspiring or exciting moment under its inexorable low direction. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Francesco Quinn is doing a stunningly anonymous hero, blending in with the walls and getting smaller as a Roman officer than the quiet, somewhat hopeless but harmless guy who works in the same office as you who never he talks too much at the office parties - you know, the one you're thinking of is called Dave or something like that. Budget constraints are very visible when the time of the meeting of lions for Christians and the struggle between Ursus and the bull is so decidedly low that he simply passes over you before the spectacle suddenly loses interest and is suddenly over. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid that this is not a trip that I can recommend especially, but if you decide on it, it is not without small prizes.
