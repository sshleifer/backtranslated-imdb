Here's a review for people like me. This movie sucks from beginning to end. I dropped the popcorn on the screen and resorted to playing in the MSF2000. The plot depends on random events and involves stupidity from people who should be intelligent. Lead falls on the impostor and it does not occur to her that she can be cheated ????? And she is rich ?? And she is a well-known psychologist ????? Come on, people. Goes to the bar at the most convenient time, when everyone is gathered to talk about giving it? It was so staged that it seemed to hit even careless viewers. Rain man would be offended. I also admit that I despise Mamet's dialog with the passion that some people have for meat eaters, warriors and people who wear furs. My hatred is so complete that it defies logic. But I will give him a chance. It should not sound really good. I do not care. Everyone is talking about the same. Mamet can not create characters; all he can do is impose his voice on us constantly by different actors. No wonder his actors are so wooden. They are confused that they are all the same. (However, his later films are improving.)
