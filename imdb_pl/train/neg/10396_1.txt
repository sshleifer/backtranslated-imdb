Being a filmmaker and with a rather dark and subversive sense of humor, I thought that I would be afraid when I took my home "My Wrongs ..." (not that the DVD cover gives something, instead chooses an ambiguous quote from the controversial director Chris Morris) short movie with scenes "). I should have known better and avoid this bland (and often offensive) piece. <br /> <br /> The scene in the church is repulsive to watch (especially since we are too familiar with Morris' skewed approach to pedophilia from his famous television series Brass Eye) and serves no purpose other than shocking. How this movie is called a comedy I will never understand. <br /> <br /> The commentary of the runner sounds basically like an innovative idea (I was a runner myself, it is often an interesting and unfettered perspective of the film making process), but unfortunately this is not the case here. Instead, we're treated by some public student who talks about dogs in the movie before we find that there are no really great movies with dogs. It's all very interesting, but not worth the single celluloid cage. <br /> <br /> To say that this movie will not be anywhere will be an understatement. He relies too much on his elevated style, at the expense of plot, character and dialogue, leaving the viewer strangely disturbed and unfulfilled. His overly simplified message - that man should take responsibility for his actions - is both grossly obvious and poorly illustrated. <br /> <br /> The film has its moments of pseudo-caf√© Surrealism, but ultimately it does not convince, entertain, enlighten and just be annoying. If you want to see a really great piece of the short film, I highly recommend Peter Capaldi's Franz Kafka's It's A Wonderful Life.
