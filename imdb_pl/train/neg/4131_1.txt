This film should be nominated for a new genre: Complete Mess! With the exception of a few chuckles and one or two gore scenes, this movie is a total waste of time. Calling him "Campy" does not even cut him off. "Camps" means a play that this movie was not. You spend the first half of the movie thinking, "This has to improve, right?" In fairness, at the end, when he finally explains who the "brother / sister" band is and what they want, but then you do not care because you spent the entire second half of the movie wondering if Mr. Onorati and Mrs. Pacula did something to push someone away from TEGO to get stuck in such a terrible movie. <br /> <br />
