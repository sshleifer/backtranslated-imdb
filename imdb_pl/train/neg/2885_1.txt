I can not really say what I think about this film, it's against the guidelines, I've watched a lot of movies, and this must be the worst possible. scenes from the slaughterhouse, because I could do a better job with a 8mm b & w camera and a monkey crew. It was so bad that I only registered to leave a comment because I had to tell someone that the movie rental was not enough. But this is my value of 2 cents, I suggest borrowing it from some poor juice that rented it and watched it myself. Because I would not waste my money myself. Now I leave you with this commentary. I hope they will not be realized in the place of rent when they do not pay you back .. =)
