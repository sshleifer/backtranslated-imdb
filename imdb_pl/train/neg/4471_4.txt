The best thing I can say about this movie is that it was sometimes a bit funny and that it was the right time killer. Unfortunately, this movie is so irritating that I wanted to hit these characters. It's a movie that's so cute it hurts your teeth. I suppose the intentions were good, but the situation becomes terribly tiring when the dialogue is so bland. When two wires are not together on the screen, it's really not bad, but be afraid during these frequent moments when a loving couple starts talking to each other.
