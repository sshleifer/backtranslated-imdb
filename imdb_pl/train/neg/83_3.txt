Jill Dunne (played by Mitzi Kapture), is an attractive, nice woman, delighted teenage daughter, Liv (Martha MacIsaac) and taciturn Sean (Rick Roberts). they were painstakingly self-centered and unpleasant. <br /> <br /> It was advertised as a family with problems persecuted by a crazy killer during a relentless storm. <br /> <br /> The storm does not even happen until the last 5 minutes of the movie, and then there is nothing to send anyone running into the basement of the storm. <br /> <br /> Stalking, similarly, does not become intense until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie we spend listening to Jill and her unbearable daughter Liv is arguing until I just wanted to hit my daughter next week. <br /> <br /> The problem with Jill from Liv is that she has dealt with Zack, a dubious boy, and they are constantly getting divorced - in fact Jill is coming home to find their two on Liv's bed. <br /> <br /> The rest of the time we spend listening to her husband Jill, Sean, or whine at Jill, or criticize her. <br /> <br /> Sean was not at all attractive - because his face is so freckled that you can play the dots. <br /> <br /> The story begins with Jill being notified of a credit card bill for a hotel she has never been to, and that Sean has never been in any of them. <br /> <br /> Jill goes to the hotel, where he meets the owner and manager of Richard Grant (Nick Mancuso), a very nice, elderly, divorced man who is sympathetic to her. In fact, when she sees her husband again, she calls Jill and pushes her away. <br /> <br /> Jill returns to the hotel, sees Sean with another woman. She is nervous, goes away without Sean and does nothing. In fact, he does not even tell Sean when he comes home. It did not make sense to me. <br /> <br /> Jill gave Richard his card, so he calls her and she is apparently in the property. He shows him a flat. Then they will drink, and between them everything becomes cozy. <br /> <br /> Richard and Jill are starting to do it, hot and hard. In fact, it seems to be slightly more aggressive than necessary when Jill suddenly decides to cut. <br /> <br /> Jill and Sean have a confrontation about their cheating. Sean moans about how Jill has let him down since his father's death. Apparently his lack of morality is her fault. Eventually, Jill confesses to Sean his own lack of morality and intimidation - and of course it's all her fault when it comes to Sean. <br /> <br /> A small family decides to go camping - which means more whining and excitement among them, especially from a spoiled daughter. <br /> <br /> I was so cheering for the stalker to get everyone, but Jill. <br /> <br /> 3 stars
