When I was younger, I liked this concert, but now ... BLACK !!! This performance is bad, badly written and rarely fun. The three leaders were all good actors and funny men (Saget's performance was much better than the things the program showed, just like Coulier was better, and Stamos was better than the average actor). After some time, Stamos wanted to leave the show because he wanted to do more serious things (who could blame him?). The concert was finally canceled when many actors demanded more money. <br /> <br /> Here are some things that drive me crazy about the show: <br /> <br /> 1. Phrase hooks - How many times one person can endure tiring phrases, such as "how rude", "Do you have a dude", "nerdbomber", "cut" and "have mercy" within 24 hours? <br /> <br /> 2. Kimmy Gibler - the most annoying character ever written for television. <br /> <br /> 3. Letter - obsolete and caked as an oreo cookie. It's good writing on cliched and bad writing on cliched. Full House had poor writing. <br /> <br /> 4. Three men living together in San Francisco- He said enough. <br /> <br /> 5. Unrealistic things - too much to remember. <br /> <br /> 6. Fashionable children - the girls had all the latest fashion in the mall and you can see posters with fashionable recording artists in which they will perform. <br /> <br /> Now this show is on Nick @ Nite. I would not call it classic. I have nothing to say about the people involved because I think many of them are talented. But this show was so sweet that I could not stand it anymore.
