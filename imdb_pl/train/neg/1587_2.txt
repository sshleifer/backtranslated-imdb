Perhaps one day television will be so brutal. Maybe "Big Brother" was just the first step towards Stephen? King Richard Bachmann described the end point. But enough about it. If I spend too many words on the subject of this film, I do exactly what the producers counted on, choosing this material. It's the same with "The 6th Day". No matter how primitive the movie is, it provokes a discussion about its subject, which serves producers as an advertisement. Let's not get caught up in it. The social criticism suggested by this summary of the plot is merely an alibi to allow the creation of a speculative, brutal film, more to sell videos than to the cinema. <br /> <br /> I have not read the book. I dare not criticize Stephen King, without reading it, but when I saw the movie, I thought that they could not make such a horrible movie from a good book: in the 80's typical set with music from the 80s and several smaller actors, Arnold Schwarzenegger is a policeman escaping from killers in a cruel TV program. The audience cheers. <br /> <br /> Together with "Predator" it is definitely the stupidest film of Schwarzenegger. 2 stars out of 10.
