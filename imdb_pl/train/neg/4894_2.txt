Unnecessary, eternal shots, useless shots, useless scenes are what you find in this movie. In other words, it seemed technically weak. The music pieces are amateurishly oriented (lack of synchronization in a failed dance, poorly synchronized, evil and obvious improvisation of actors from time to time, etc.). <br /> <br /> The movie is long and boring. Ultimately, he does several things and makes less sense. <br /> <br /> However, there are good ideas. Some elements of the comic are really efficient, especially on the opening scene. However, the film is getting worse, so it is unbearable and impossible to understand. <br /> <br /> The trailer I saw was very dynamic, which is not true for the movie. This means that the discrepancy between the trailer and the actual movie is something very close to being a rip off.
