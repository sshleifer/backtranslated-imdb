This is a version that even the author hates because he is so cunning. They gave him a "happy ending" and changed many dialogues, and this is just a huge pile of saccharin. "The director of the stage" is quite good, I believe that he created this role, but everyone else falls into this style of acting from the 40's, which really just poses. One great feature - music. This has one of the best results in history and it is worth looking for in a music store. In general, I think the version of Spalding Gray / Eric Stoltz / Penelope Miller from 1989 is much better.
