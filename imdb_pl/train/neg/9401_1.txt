In this unusually low budget (I've seen home movies made with better production value) the Australian total rip off "The Burning" and "Friday the 13th" the band plans to make a music video on the boat. They are persecuted by a serial killer who was burned years ago. This film is even considered as the "worst Australian movie" in promotional material on DVD. It's just a selling point! Complete and complete garbage in every significant way. Perhaps a few chuckles here and there for the bad movie buffs, but it still made me want to burn my volleyball. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: a quick flash of barely existing, ugly tits in a lame stage br /> <br /> My class: F
