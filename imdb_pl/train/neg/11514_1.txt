No doubt when Madonna and Guy Ritchie got married, it was because they both thought it would help them in their film career. If you've been through the attempt to watch "Swept Away", then you know that at this level it was a match in hell. After almost 20 years trying to become a respected actress (or "octopus", as she could say in "The Next Best Thing"), she still can not get out of herself long enough to turn on a show that everyone can taste even decent. And that's what makes people do not like her so much on the screen: it's the feeling that her ego is so overstated that it prevents her from leaving and connecting with the audience. If there is any justice in this universe, it gave her the last chance.
