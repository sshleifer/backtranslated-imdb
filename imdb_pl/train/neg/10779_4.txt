This movie turned out to be a complete disappointment. Talent available to the director - in particular Stanley Tucci, Chris Walken, Hank Azaria and Alan Arkina (not to mention the four main characters) - was completely wasted on an uninteresting, average story, whose conclusion could not be celebrated once introduced into horrible characters in stereo . Julia Roberts is weak, Zeta-Jones is just annoying (he appears to repeat his role with fidelity, without humor), Crystal simply plays his old hyperactive, neurotic, annoying alter ego, and Cusack simply goes through its part, apparently bored with the whole project. <br /> <br /> For what is supposed to be a "romantic comedy", there is absolutely no romance between the characters, not to mention chemistry, and as for the comedy - (possible SPOILERS), the only moments of gentle humor have fallen from the role Cusack at Grosse Pointe and his relationship with Alan Arkin - a screenwriter apparently incapable of showing any originality. (Spoilers) Azaria was quite funny, because the Mexican lover and Walken made a rather funny verse as a parody of the arthouse-maverick-Dogme director - but these parts were very little time on the screen and instead (Spoilers) we were treated to Billy Crystal his groin sniffed the dog. Pure genius. <br /> <br /> For the great fan of most of John Cusack's works, not to mention the rest of the fantastic cast, I was completely disappointed by the film with many good ideas, and at the same time completely reluctant to explore or develop any of them, instead, resorting to the same old genre clich√©s, and even dropping deeply into the almost "disgusting, teenage humorous film". <br /> <br /> Very poor 4/10.
