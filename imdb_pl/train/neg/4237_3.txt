JUDAAI was a bold movie Raj Kanwar in his time In 1997, When such a topic was damn damn <br /> <br /> To give him his credit, he manages to show how greed changes a person and to what extent a person can go after what you want <br /> <br /> The film is damn melodramatic, many funny places <br /> <br /> You might wonder why Anil does not buy a TV set for his wife? when does he earn so much to show how poor he is? <br /> <br /> The turn is well done, but the lead is straight from the comedy The Johny-Paresh from the 80s, who plays here and there stands out as a sore thumb because it does not fit the history <br /> < br /> There are even a few scenes to take part in. <br /> <br /> Raj Kanwar's direction is right but sometimes too melodramatic. Music is fine, but most of the songs look like forced. <br /> <br /> Anil is doing well Sridevi is great in her role Urmila is decent Among the rest Kader Khan is as usual Johny Lever is funny, Paresh is upset Farid is decent
