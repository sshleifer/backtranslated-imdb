How this film scores 6.7 is unbelievable. He does not deserve anything better than 2.0 and should be clearly among the worst 100 IMDb movies of all time. The National Treasure is an insult to national intelligence and another Hollywood attack by American audiences. Critics talked about holes in the story, through which you can drive 16 wheels. <br /> <br /> I love the justifications for this movie as a good one ... "Nicholas Cage is cute." Come, people, no wonder people around the world think that Americans are stupid. This must be the most stupid, offensive movie I've ever seen. If you'd like to see a really decent movie this season, consider Kinsey, The Woodsman, Million Dollar Baby or Sideways. Unfortunately, National Treasure has gained much more publicity than these great films. I bet most of you who have read this will not even hear about it because some of them have not yet been widely published. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage is a great actor - when he's in the right movies. Time and again, I saw Cage wasting his amazing talent in horrible mind-numbing movies such as Con Air, The Rock and Face-Off. When his talent is well used, as in the adaptation of Charlie Kaufman, he is an amazing actor. <br /> <br /> Conclusion - I would rather give my hand to a chopper rather than resign myself to this visual cruelty.
