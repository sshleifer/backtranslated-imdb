Watching "Surrender, Dorothy," CBS, I was wondering why Diane Keaton would like to attend (not because it's a TV movie - with no tempting roles for slightly older actresses, no wonder why the Oscar-winning performers, like Keaton, return - but because it does not give Keaton a chance to shine, a lonely mother, saddened by the sudden death of her twenty-something daughter, imposes - and gradually befriends - a group of young people her daughter was close to at the time of the accident. In addition to the fact that these insidious people are rough and dark, they are unbelievably unconvincing, as is a neat script and a house near the beach where the children live (one young man who wears Muscle shirts to say he is gay, hears Diane Keaton: Give up, Dorothy, "and he actually asks," It's from the Wizard of Oz, right? "... No, genius, it comes from" Citizen Kane "!). Keaton may have wanted to make this material based on the subject of confrontation with death. She tries to change this extremely unbelievable woman into the shadow of her own personality (lots of bizarre outfits), but it does not suit the viewer, because Keaton has always been nice and flexible in a flaky way. Here he is a crazy harpy who does not learn many lessons about discovering himself (the film quickly forgets about a dead young woman and becomes a odyssey for the nervous wreck of a mother who seems to be a hippie hippie who never lost anyone close to him). This is a type of movie actors promoted on talk shows with the caveat: "It should help many despicable mothers." I can not imagine helping anyone, because he is inherently smaller, confused and surprising. It's insane.
