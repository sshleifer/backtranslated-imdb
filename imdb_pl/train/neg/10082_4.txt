I was laughing through this rotten movie. It's so unbelievable. A woman leaves her husband after many years of marriage, she has a breakdown in front of the real estate office. What's happening? The office manager goes outside and offers her a job !!! Cheerful! The next thing you know that both women do. Yes, they are lesbians! Nothing is true in this movie "Lifetime for Women with nothing better to do". A successful dialogue like "I do not want to spend the rest of my life feeling that I have a chance to be happy and I did not take it." There is a rich, distant mother who disagrees with her daughter's new relationship. Sassy black maid - unbelievable, that in 2003 a movie is created, in which there is a sassy black maid. Hattie McDaniel has to rotate in the grave. The woman has a husband who goes crazy and wants to look after snotty teenage children. Hell! No cliche was reversed.
