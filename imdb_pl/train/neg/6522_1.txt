This is not a commentary on the actual movie, but for the release of DVD RUSCICO for North America. I do not know if there were different releases and updates, but the disks we borrowed had 2,000 rights to them, if that means anything. In any case, the sound mixing on these DVDs was absolutely horrible. Levels often changed up and down; When the scene cropped up to the panorama of the battlefield, the orchestral song would have thundered so loud that I did not know what would first explode - my drums or my speakers. When it was time for dialogue, the volume would usually fall into something barely audible. Sometimes the orchestra and Foley-work would remain loud, while dialogue was imposed on a much smaller level. My wife and I discovered that the only way to watch this movie from these DVDs at all was because one of us kept a hand on the remote to constantly modulate the volume. And, as another user commented, when we chose the English sound, the dialog box switched between Russian and English; and sometimes, when the heroes spoke French on a native track, the dubbing was in Russian, so you're SOL, if you do not understand. Eventually, we gave up watching the first disk. Before you spend $ 50 on this DVD movie for your own library, I heartily recommend getting a rented copy to see if you can really enjoy this epic movie when it's loaded with such a bad sound, especially if you never read a book and really want to understand the story .
