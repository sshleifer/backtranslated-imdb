And I mean ultra-light. This film contains four giant stars, about three and a half jokes and nothing else. <br /> <br /> There really is not much to say about this smelly one, except that it has some really good bits, most of them are not too funny. It does not work as an affair at all. How about a romantic comedy? Never in my life. Most of the dialogue is too flat to be sophisticated, much less fun. <br /> <br /> What is really ashame is not bad at all. This movie could have been much more, especially when the recent focus was on some of the fake ways to promote movies, along with fake quotes from critics. The film discovers the un-exploited territory of the press press - all these expenses pay for trips to journalists who almost always write nice reviews. But instead of exploring what should be the basis of jokes, he devotes about three minutes to this area and goes on searching for the lame romance of the film. <br /> <br /> The same applies to Catherine Zeta-Jones' character - neighing, selfish movie star. Zeta-Jones does a good job with what she gave, but she practically gives nothing. It's all homogenized and looks very pale compared to some of the things we've heard about the stars over the years. <br /> <br /> After all, it's difficult to understand what made Zeta-Jones, Julia Roberts, John Cusack and Billy Crystal sign on this dreaded ship, which drowns like the replay of "The Love Boat." In fact, as the old joke says, they should have forgotten the script and filmed the deal. Probably it will be a better story. So tell us, the filmmakers, what do you have about the stars that made them appear in this?
