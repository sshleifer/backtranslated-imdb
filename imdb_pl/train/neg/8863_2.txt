Howling II (1985) was a complete 180 of the first film. While the first movie was camp and scary. The second one was poor and tacky. The production values ​​on this are bad and the action is terrible. A werewolf-presenter's brother from the part who wants to know what happened to his sister. The "scene" from the first movie was poorly reproduced. A thin, smooth woman accompanies her brother (Reb Brown) in the old country (Romania) to discover the secret of her sister's murder / transformation / death. Christopher Lee appears and disappears from time to time as a kind of sage / guide for two. Sybil Danning and her two biggest assets appear as Stirba, the main werewolf of Romania. He also suffers from a bad case of the morning face, ewww! <br /> <br /> Bad movie. There is nothing good about this smelly one. I am surprised that Philippe Mora directed this photo because he is usually a good filmmaker. The film is so dark that you need a flashlight to view it (no, not content, but the movie itself). To end the movie, you have a poor "punk performance" Damned wannabe "Babel". Maybe if they put up a few extra bucks, they could have a real deal instead of imitation. <br /> <br /> It's best to avoid unless you're desperate or have lost the remote and you're too lazy to change the channel.
