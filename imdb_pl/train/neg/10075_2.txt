I'm sorry, but even Adrian Zmed from TJ Hooker could not save this part. I went through half of the movie thinking that it was the trick of the original. Then came this crazy and crazy motorcycle scene (note that this is the only movie that is directed by Patricia Birch); and unfortunately I realized that they are trying to be serious. I made a kick from the fact that the opposing gang, having lost its "wheels" due to its gambling habits in the original Grease, was forced to use motorcycles in the second film. Being embarrassed by this character Putz, Carrington, I would not like to see what they will run away later: maybe mopeds? dominated by-outsiders-school-ergo-go-for-tough-guy-with-stupid-biker-look-helmet. It was Disney's story that went terribly uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> It looks like YOU can ruin something good by putting chewing gum on Michelle Pfeiffer in the musical. The only thing I took from this movie is to imagine how many points out of ten.
