I did not think Joe Don Baker would be able to make a movie as bad as his smelly "Mitchell", but it works. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this if you are a MUCH of a better job of Joe Don Baker. But if you like to see how fat guys sweat and really, really fight with weapons, you'll love this movie.
