Historically accurate? Hmm ... Maybe ... if you squint your eyes and the light falls on the object the same way. But the basic accuracy is not a compensation for a grim, patchy and incoherent plot, a ream of cardboard dialogue and an unsatisfactory conclusion. The main characters are only characteristics; embarrassing stereotypes, from "enigmatic and noble" American Indians to "stifling but sadistic" British officers. A miserable and unworthy interpretation of the fascinating period in American history. I want my money back.
