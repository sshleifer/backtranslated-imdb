The Gospel of Lou was a big disappointment for me. I received an e-mail from the theater showing that it is a great and inspiring movie. It was neither wonderful nor inspirational. The photos were quite strange in relation to the whole movie. Many scenes are flash copies that were made in a way that was not able to determine what's going on. The voices were often distorted for no reason. Also, many people in the film were far-reaching. The relationship she has with her ex and son is never clear. Also, the whole film has it mostly in one direction, and then suddenly BAM, is cured and inspiring. The whole film seems to show that boxing is one of the things that is bad in his life, making him live his life as he is alive, but when he changes, he does not leave boxing, teaches others like a box. Thumbs down.
