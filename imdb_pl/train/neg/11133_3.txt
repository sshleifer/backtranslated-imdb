With the exception of better than average acting skills of two leads, this movie is really, very bad. Cheap production value does not help. Of course, you would not notice that production values ​​are cheap if you do not try to convince you that they have production values ​​at the beginning. Even for such a B-type freak like me, this movie really sucks.
