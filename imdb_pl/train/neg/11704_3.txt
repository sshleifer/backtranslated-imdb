One of them: "Why did this happen?" Cinema. Romance is very difficult to swallow. This is one of those romances that suddenly "click" - they are in love. The film is filled with long breaks and uncomfortable moments - the drive-in restaurant is the best known. Charles Grodin performs a credible job, but for the most part of the movie it's just him and Louise Lasser. Ask yourself, do you want to watch Grodin with your neurosis and Lasser with your neurosis for an hour and a half?
