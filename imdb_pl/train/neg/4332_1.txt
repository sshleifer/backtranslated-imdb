This movie is a bad attempt to make the original fans feel complete. The only thing people have forgotten is that the reason the original won such recognition was closely related to the fact that it was meant to make you feel incomplete. <br /> <br /> This movie makes me want to go to the bathroom. I'm not a negative guy, but the man working in this movie is ... without comment. The plot was a bad reflection of the life of Carlito Brigante and I am sorry that I had two hours of my time and my money wasted on this move. I still love the original and I will do my best not to ruin my opinion on this subject.
