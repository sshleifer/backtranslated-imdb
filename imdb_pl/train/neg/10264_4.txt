The head of the New York family Jane Gail (as Mary Barton) works with her younger sister Ethel Grandin (as Loma Barton) in "Smyrner's Candy Store". After Mrs. Grandin's abduction by dealers buying and selling women as prostitutes in prostitution, Mrs. Gail and her policeman Matt Moore (as Larry Burke) must save a virtuous young woman. <br /> <br /> "Traffic in Souls" has a reputation that is difficult to support - it is not well done and does not show anything special in that the "virtue" of a young woman is threatened by sexual traders. Perhaps it can be supported as a film that has taken up the subject in a longer than usual length (originally, it claimed to be ten drums). The main attractions are scenes from New York after all these years. Panning prisoners behind bars is memorable, because nothing else can make the cameras move. <br /> <br /> **** Movement in the soul (November 24, 13) George Loane Tucker ~ Jane Gail, Matt Moore, Ethel Grandin
