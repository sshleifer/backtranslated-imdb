About the time they released this movie on DVD. I know that some say that WB is in a hurry to release this movie because of The Dreamgirls. But how can you hurry with the release of the movie that has been in the catalog since 1976. <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed with the DVD release of this movie, with no special function, no 5.1 DD sound. Come on WB, you can do a lot better than this. The sound and image quality in this video requires serious help. <br /> <br /> It seems that WB did not sacrifice this time and attention because it is a black movie and my sale is good. They could keep a CD, which by the way does not have all the songs that have the original CD. <br /> <br /> Would I recommend this DVD to buy. Yes, because it's a classic movie. But WB has to add more special features. Take notes from other group videos, The Five Heatbeats or The Temptation, if you can only see performance, and the sound on both is much, much, much better than the DVD.
