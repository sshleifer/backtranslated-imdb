This movie was quite a strange experience. The film is of course based on art. Now I am sure that everything in this film works great in art, but in the film it is simply not interesting enough. The film is too "scenic" and did not even bother to change some of the dialog boxes to make it more appropriate for the movie. Instead, it is now almost literally re-filming the stage game, with top characters and a staged dialogue. For this reason, the plot really does not work, and the film becomes almost a complete boring and obsolete experience. <br /> <br /> It will take a while before you realize it's a comedy. watching. At the beginning you think it's a drama you're watching, with bizarre characters, but as you progress through the movie, you'll notice that the movie is more of a tragicomedy that focuses more on the comedy genre than on the dramatic genre. br /> <br /> The characters and dialog are really things that make this movie bizarre and unbearable. Of course, the actors are great; Peter O'Toole and Susannah York, among others, but do not really raise the film to a "sufficiently observable" level. <br /> <br /> History seems completely confused. Essentially, history is about nothing and focuses mainly on the brother / sister characters played by Peter O'Toole and Susannah York. But what exactly is this story about? The film seems to be a pointless and obsolete film that has little to offer. As I said before; I am sure that this story is good and interesting to watch on stage, but as the movie really does not fit and just does not work. <br /> <br /> Editing is just awful, and times are even funny in some sequences. <br /> <br /> More could be expected from the director J. Lee Thompson, who apparently made much better films than this rather unsuccessful, scenic spectacle translated into a screen, project. <br /> <br /> Not really worth your time. <br /> <br /> 4/10
