oh my God, I give this film three stars out of ten for the following reasons. the last sequence is quite effective again and it was totally fun. he gets these three points for it. otherwise it was terrible. it was not so funny, it was obvious, but dubbing, a game of named voices, a dialogue that they said, often funny. the actions performed and / or not performed also lead to great mirth and / or throwing objects on the screen. for example, when the entire city is killed, and one small group of people is standing on the balcony, looking as if they were watching a glass, or "trying" escapes from the church where they are wondering. <br /> <br /> angry mayor: I think something is happening outside, so you should go upstairs and look out the window. <br /> <br /> hero: ok. <br /> <br /> bad mayor: now is my chance for some idiot to go outside and flail, and the fire would be completely ineffective and would be hacked. <br /> <br /> insert the sequence in which this happens. <br /> <br /> bad mayor: damn, wait, I will get this little baby, and she will go outside and cry pappa seemingly indifferent to the fact that these rotten corpses are not just scary strangers, but in reality are zombies without a body or skin or anything, and she will drive them away and run away! insert the sequence in which this happens. <br /> <br /> hero (at the top): trying to escape again, fool, and he left the door open, he is stupid, this is a nice view. <br /> <br /> woman: where is my daughter? <br /> <br /> hero (now downstairs): I do not know, I do not see her anyway, and she was not outside because I could not see her, even though she is out and about, with a view of the whole neighborhood, and she stands outside, where could she be on the ground? <br /> <br /> needless to say that someone would throw things on the screen after 10 minutes of this. so watch the first movie with a few friends, drink a few drinks and make sure you're absolutely blind and drunk before you watch this movie, and you can just giggle with stupidity. and there was not even any decent blood, such a shame.
