Oh man, I know what you think: "With this title, I can not go wrong!" Yes, you can. I also loved the title, but I hated a man who was a stupid kid who played 'Little Satan's helper'. I also hated mother, sisters / daughters and her boyfriend - I hated all these people! Man, it was painful watching this time! The ONLY reason why there is not 1/10 is due to the low budget, so everything was fine. But oh man, I hate these actors, so stupid! I knew it would be bad, I think they saved a lot of money on using the killer's Halloween masks, and the Jesus costume at the end was really stupid too. Oh, agony, do not look!
