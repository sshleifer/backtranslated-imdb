Not much to say about it. A plot that you can do in the first 10 minutes. There is nothing wrong in the film, very few actions in the action movie. There was an opportunity to explore the character's emotions from time to time. Regardless of whether the action movie is the right genre to do, I'm still undecided. Sniper was one of the easiest movies to watch without sacrificing full attention because it had few twists and a simple storyline. I was probably guilty of this, so with the second watch or with undivided attention can be better. <br /> <br /> 4/10 (but the best of my 4 out of 10)
