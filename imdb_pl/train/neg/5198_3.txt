This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but I do not really remember when I saw it worse. I thought it would concern the investigation of air accidents. In fact, it is a soap opera, and at the same time evil. They defeated the "conflict" card to the limit. The first hour seems to be a flashy match in which incredible scenes appear. <br /> <br /> * Possible spoiler * <br /> <br /> 40-minute scene of "memory" with required black umbrellas and rain) for fictitious disaster victims was poor and I thought it would never end. <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs, unless you enjoy the "conflict". <br /> <br />
