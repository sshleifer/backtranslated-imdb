If you've seen other videos of this type, they're probably better. An Omega man comes to mind. In honor of the studio, they avoided the large, unnecessary, large budget that is typical of such films. In addition, the configuration and assumptions were excellent: four people whose past is practically irrelevant to us, try to escape the overwhelming infectious lethal disease. What is wrong is EVERYTHING! I have enough infinitely stupid, careless, weak, ineffective, arrogant figures in the movie. This is in a sense describing everyone in the movie. I rented it and repeatedly shouted to the TV set "no, do not do it!", "Why are you so stupid", "watch out!" Etc. Halfway through, there is a real lack of character development. The film SHOULD give you a strong personal connection with at least some of the characters, so that you really care about what will happen to them. This one is not. Also, the film should be longer and more demanding.
