It was 13 in the morning and I had nothing else to do. Do not judge me ... please. <br /> <br /> We're back in time during the Spanish settlements. The group reached the island. It does not last long before they meet a large "reptile" who devours their horse. Soon they are captured by the natives and they must kill the "reptilian gods" to gain freedom. CG sucks; reminds me of CG's early video games for the console. The meetings were lame. The only positive thing I have to say about this was a native hottie running in skimpy outfit. Otherwise it is only an average effort.
