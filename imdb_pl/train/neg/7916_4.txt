Where to start? What do you say on the wrong abstract: <br /> <br /> "X-Men Origins: Wolverine tells the story of Wolverine's brutal and romantic past, his complex relationship with Victor Creed and the ominous Weapon X program." <Br> <br /> His epic brutal past turns out to be extremely non-aggressive. <br /> <br /> His relationship with Creed is so transparent that it's difficult to understand how they have any relationship at all. We are from one point on the opening scene, which shows them as children on the run, to mount war scenes in which they fought for a long time of their lives, and finally to the present, in which they are part of the hardcore team of government killers. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to show their relationship as brothers. Nothing is folded for us to believe that it is authentic and even loving. <br /> <br /> The romantic element of the film between Silverfox and Wolverine was forced and violent. We're being thrown into romance so quickly that it's over before you can blink. After entering the character, Silverfox is killed about fifteen minutes later. We wonder why we should care about it. Who was she, anyway? <br /> <br /> For the key element of this weak revenge story, the romance is surprisingly unexplored. It just rushed him because it was required. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, when Wolverine discovers that his love is dead, he leaves her in the forest to rot when he goes to find Sabertooth. Being a romantic, he is out of character, but necessary to serve the story, drawing a very predictable surprise. <br /> <br /> Regarding the X weapons program, let's say this after the painfully paralyzing procedure Wolverine works and works. In the end, he comes to the house of a conveniently old but definitely loving couple. Surprisingly Ma and Pa Kent are not worried when they found a naked sweaty man in their barn. Is it any wonder what fate awaits them? <br /> <br /> In previous movies and comics, the main reason why Wolverines' amnesia harassed him partially was that he was reportedly maliciously and coldblooded. <br /> <br /> Knowing that it was ... did he really want to remember such horrors or hide them and continue his more positive lifestyle by fighting with the villains of the world together with his teammates? <br /> <br /> As indicated in X2: X-Men United, when Stryker gives up some secrets, it is said that Wolverine would be disturbed if he knew about the bad deeds they committed together. This film creates a band quite well, but it does not really do anything. No disturbing violence, merciless actions, simply harassing several natives in foreign lands for ten or fifteen minutes on the screen. <br /> <br /> It looks like Wolverine was not a bad man under Stryker. Instead, he was constantly trying to force Sabertooth, who was, as a consequence, an aggressive agent that we all thought was Wolverine. In the end, it just leaves everything together. <br /> <br /> There is no conflict of duality at all. <br /> <br /> Idiotically DELETE this conflict character of good and evil DULLED history tremendously. They might as well give him rubber claws. <br /> <br /> In this movie there were lots of other bugs that contradicted the X-Men trilogy, including the introduction of one of the most faithful Deus Ex Machinas who ever hit the script. <br /> <br /> Magic bullets erasing memory. <br /> <br /> Really? <br /> <br /> Apparently they are the only thing that brings Wolverine. However, apparently, it was forgotten when agent after agent was sent to bring him bullets and bombs that would not work at all. <br /> <br /> Another problem with this movie is that he tried to focus on Wolverine by throwing a lot of other mutants that did nothing at all. Interesting characters were just a dressing and did nothing for this story. Most of them were in the movie for a maximum of 5-10 minutes, and yet you think you'd like to see more and less Wolverine. <br /> <br /> Fred Dukes (Blob version, but not comical) can fire a tank missile with little or no physical damage at all, but a simple headbutt from a Wolverines metal cube is enough to stun him? <br /> <br /> The optical beams of the cyclopians (which instead of being shocks are now more similar to the lasers) can burn through buildings, but after firing directly at Sabertooth they just break it down to the ground, not even damaging his clothes. Adamantium digs everyone? <br /> <br /> Mutant Gambit (defying gravity), instead of using his signature cards, transforms into some crazy acrobat. In one poorly edited scene he is overwhelmed by unconsciousness by Wolverine ... and then surprisingly a few minutes later he is on the roof with the TOWARDS Wolverine system. When he regained consciousness, escaped a few blocks, climbed the building, and then ran back to Wolverine and Sabertooth in the middle of the scratching match is a mystery that needs to be cleared up. <br /> <br /> Some justify this film of weakness, claiming it was made of a comic, and therefore should be weak in character and heavy when flashing. The idea that this movie is a comic book is weak and superficial because of this is incorrect. <br /> <br /> Comic source material, Wolverine's REAL origin ... is a story worth showing on the screen. He does not hide his past or treat the reader like mindless CGI junkies. This is a well-crafted story, and although it has been told and adapted over time, it began with WEAPON X by Barry Windsor-Smith. A much more intense and exciting story. <br /> <br /> This FOX movie should be seriously forgotten. <br /> <br /> Someone has this magical weapon? <br /> <br /> 4/10
