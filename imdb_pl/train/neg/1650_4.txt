The four best friends of young male chauvinistic pigs (with an emphasis on pigs) meet every week at a New York restaurant to talk about their dating sexploits in this misanthropic and visceral comedy. Peet is the common denominator that dates the three bachelors in the group, which leads to conflict and the inevitable "whipping". Although the premise of the film has potential and there are some funny moments, in general, the movement does not work, especially when the girls do not look better than the guys who are contradictory to the core of the story. One of such single group flix with a dozen or so producers, "Whipped", will probably appeal to young people who think that "The Man Show" is Emma's material.
