The dialogue was terrible. The plot is not really anything that inspired her to make an obvious change. Not visually stunning. Actually, sometimes visually annoying. Certainly one of those videos that will be easier to finish if you hold one finger on the fast scroll button. If you could watch it for free, you do not have any other options at the moment, and you really dig at seeing a small poltergeist lady ... maybe I would recommend it to you, but not to anyone else I could think of right now.
