Do not get me wrong - I love David Suchet as Poirot. I love the series and movies, but enough: Death On The Nile. Everyone did it! We know who is dying. We know why they are dying. We know who the killer is. We know how it happened. I'm talking enough now! Mr. Suchet could use this amazing talent in another novel by Agatha Christie. I will say that the acting of all actors was great. The sets were great and very realistic. I especially liked David Soul, but I was surprised how "horrible" he looked. I hope it does not look like that in a "real" life! I really do not remember from other movies if the end was the same. I do not think so. I thought it was a fairly brilliant touch if Mrs. Christie wrote it that way. I would rather have this end ended up in prison!
