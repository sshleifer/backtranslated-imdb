I watched this movie alone, in the dark and outside it was the full moon! I did not do it on purpose, it just happened. So all the elements were for this movie to scare me !! Well, no, in fact I wanted to turn off the DVD player after just 8 minutes, but I thought I would give it a chance, unfortunately I did. Acting was terrible. The only decent actor was Samaire Armstrong. The plot is not original, if you're a fan of horror movies, this is the same thing you've seen many times. Some scenes did not make any sense at all, and you just feel like the director wanted to make the film longer! The monster was the biggest disappointment of the film. (Scary) scenes looked like they belonged to a horror movie from the 80's when there was not enough technology, but then good movies were made! I was surprised when at the beginning of the movie I saw the name of a large production company. I thought they could not put in a lot of money and make it sound? !! I could not agree with the ratings that the film received, it is also my opinion for him, 3 out of 10.
