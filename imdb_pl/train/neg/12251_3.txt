Oh, CGI. Blessing with proper application. Sin is used by people who have no idea what they are doing. Unfortunately, this is not the only thing that is poorly used in this case. Jaws rip-off. <br /> <br /> Ok, anyone who has read a number of my published reviews has probably noticed 2 things. 1: I like low-budget horror movies. I 2: If there's a sweet guy in this low-budget movie, I usually exchange it. So, let's make it out of the way now. It's one low-budget horror movie I did not like. Acting is mostly awful, funny effects, and the scenario rivals Battlefield Earth as the worst I've witnessed this year. As for the charming boy ... Dax Miller (Bog) wins the prize hand. This boy is hot! And, surprisingly, it is not just a toned body with pretty eyes and a charming butt ... it can actually work (well, as soon as it can do in this hideous film). Now, if we have cleaning jobs off the beaten track, let's move on. <br /> <br /> In the Cliff Notes version, here's the story (do not worry, I'll try not to give up anything) ... <br /> <br /> The film crew travels to a distant island to make a documentary film about two Surfers (a charming, charming boy and his pal) who surf with sharks. Unknown to them is quite a large crocodile of salt water lurking around the island. Croc appears, chaos appears and people are eaten. Finish the end credits. <br /> <br /> As I said before, this movie has a lot of blows. It started quite well, but soon became stupid and stupid. The main character becomes a luncheon (in a rather humorous way), and our other heroes speak about the costs of one officer. What's more, if this crocodile is at the top of the food chain, both on land and in the water, what about all sharks? If this thing can eat a 40-foot boat, I do not think a few scarce sharks cling. FX is one of the worst I've ever had dissatisfied. CGI is terrible and they even managed to spoil the animatronic crocodiles. Attention, filmmakers. National Geographic. Discovery Store. Croc hunter. They know what crocodiles look like. Of course, you did not refer to any of them, judging from the horrors seen at the end of the movie. What about the gang of pirate / drug followers? Do you just need another reason to break the woman's top? <br /> <br /> It's funny how we get small subgenres in the movie world. With Alligator and its sequels, Lake Placid, Crocodile, and now Blood Surf, now it looks like movies of "oversized crocodiles / alligators" should now get their own category in Blockbuster. The alligator was good. Lake Placid was good. I even thought Crocodile Tobe Hooper was good. Blood Surf, sucked. <br /> <br /> My rating: D-
