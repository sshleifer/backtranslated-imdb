Okay, the crowd of the film festival probably loved it. But your average popcorn movie, which has earned ten or fifteen bucks, which costs watching the movie, will probably wonder why he made that choice. If it's marked as "Copolla", it's great material, right? Wrong! This is a shapely parody of the pretensions to the film. But it is terribly "in". I am worried when filmmakers care more about entertainment than the public. It's interesting as a movie curiosity and it has a giggle or two. But once it begins to work in movies and television, dust will rise on cans and tape cassettes. Almost neither epochal nor epic!
