I am a fan of previous Best of the Best movies. But this one was terrible. No wonder it was so hard to find. I tried 4 movie rentals until I found one with a copy of the movie. Acting was terrible, the conspiracy was a joke, and the action was also bad. <br /> <br /> I really miss Alex Grady, Travis Brigley and the original characters and motif that this movie had with the first two films. <br /> <br /> John
