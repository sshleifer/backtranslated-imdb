After reading a book that was important to me, the film did not give me the feeling that the book conveyed. This makes me wonder if Kaufman even liked the book because he did something else. Either that or it's just bad. Most importantly, where is the lightness ?! From the first scene the music drowns out most of the dialogues and feelings, and it lasts throughout the whole movie. I think the creators thought that thanks to the optimistic music played throughout the movie, it would make the story light - but here it completely failed. Instead, the music manages to convey everything that "feels the film", in a sense, dramatizing events so that we can wait for them to make everything really hard. beautifying the story, making it more dramatic. In the film, we see Franz passing Tomas on the street that is on his way to Sabina. The introduction of this accidental meeting / passage, which certainly did not take place in the book, gives Tomas's story more meaning than it does light. <br /> <br /> There are many other examples in which the continuity of the story has been changed, if only the worst, but it could have been done, because the book simply does not transform well into a movie, this is Kundera's style. This makes us wonder if all the generous reviewers on this site have written about their book AND the film experience, instead of just writing about the movie. A movie that is as long as uncomplicated. For those who have not read the book yet, I recommend reading it. For those who have, I must say that you are simply wasting your time and probably end up here, writing similar warnings about the unchanged attitude.
