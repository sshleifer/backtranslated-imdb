Although it is not as bad as it seemed (I have seen MUCH worse), it is still a very bad movie. Basically, Siegel's "Coogan's Bluff" rehash, with the main difference being that Clint Eastwood's hat has more charisma than Joe Don Baker, the unattractive actor, if he was. <br /> <br /> Venantino Venantini is great (and great fun) as a bad guy, budget type Vittorio Gassman. This is the main reason why he must sit in this steampile, because the rest of the cast in most cases produces terrible acting, especially the girl. Poor old Rossano Brazzi, it's hard to believe he was once a romantic leader (see "Mondo Cane" to see how he escapes from women). Looking here like Ben Gazzar from the second level, there is nothing to do. This is unfortunately the performance of Joe Don. All this got the music for an action movie from the 80's that could not have been more boring. <br /> <br /> Greydon Clark can make good B movies ("No Warning"), but here he stumbles, falls, breaks his nose and loses three teeth. Well, at least the locations in Malta were pretty, and Venantini is trying to save the day. 3/10.
