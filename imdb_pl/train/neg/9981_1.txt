This film was announced as a comedy and mystery. It works badly on both. The only secret is why someone would do such a poorly constructed movie. The only comedy is the laughter I got when I saw how readers rated it highly. Can there be two movies with the same name? The movie, which I saw, played a girl with nice blue eyes and a story that was not there. <br /> <br />
