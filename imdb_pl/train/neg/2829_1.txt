The worst and full of people who really should know better (the cast has six Oscars between them). It is embedded in "modern" Africa (established in 1979) and concerns slave trade. It is frighteningly written and behaved (Michael Caine, Peter Ustinov and William Holden achieve a low level in this career) and they are completely lacking in emotions, not caring about the moral attitude. It is also ridiculed. You do not believe for a moment that any character will behave in the way he does in such circumstances. Richard Fleischer directs, but you get the impression that it's on the phone. It's as bad as it gets.
