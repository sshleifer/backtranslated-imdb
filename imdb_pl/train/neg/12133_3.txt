Author: Dane Youssef <br /> <br /> A bunch of cheaters. The perfect plan. Everything is going wrong. They're in trouble. The police are outside. They are trapped. What will they do now? <br /> <br /> Sounds familiar? <br /> <br /> The film seems to be a combination of acting workshops, the movie "indie" and the theater. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of thing that actors love - it's something like a workshop or art, because it mainly involves focusing on actors acting ... angry, tense, frightened, talking, intrigue, planning - giving the contractors have a lot of free coverage so that everything goes really well. <br /> <br /> Three cheaters, one leader, one runner, one brother, invent a big panic program. .. and the monkey key is thrown into the works. What's more, there is a bit of a "fender-bender" and one of the crooks throws himself through the rear window. <br /> <br /> The cops are on the tail and fall into a poetic (and leaden) bar called "Last Chance Dino". <br /> <br /> Spacey, as a director, tries to focus on the performances of actors and providing dialouge. He goes to a bright red cigarette with a smoking and smoldering Bogart. And it keeps all violence outside the screen, really. <br /> <br /> I think it was a mistake. Focusing on the intensity and macabre violent scenes would give the film some advantage. <br /> <br /> The problem with the movie is that it moves too slowly and suffers from poor play in almost every role. Matt Dillon ("Drugstore Cowboy" and "Wild Things") seems too young and too idealistic to become the leader of this gang. <br /> <br /> Gary Sinese seems to be meditated and deep in thought that he is an invertebrate - along with these guys and Joe Mantaga, he's effective as a traditional routine, cursing an angry police lieutenant who's a thumb but has nothing to do here. <br /> <br /> William Fischter is the only actor who is credible in his role of brainless grunts who just want to spill blood. <br /> <br /> And the fraudsters are in a tense situation in which they either go to jail or try to come up with a way out of it. <br /> <br /> Spacey is not able to create high voltage and continue. The characters mostly talk, trying to come up with a plan ... and they are calm and too articulate. There is even a scene where scammers play billiards with a whole swarm of armed cops right in front, ready to attack. At some point, one of the scammers will call even the police, which is just behind the bar. Oh brother. Oh, bother you. <br /> <br /> These cops will either blow them up or close them. Should not punches be a little scared, a bit worried? Meanwhile, the whole real action is happening inside. <br /> <br /> Someone is pulling a gun, a baseball bat, which leads to an ugly confrontation outside the screen, and there is another victim who happens ... well, a bit sad. But ... <br /> <br /> Faye Dunaway should also spend more time with the trainer of the dialect, improving her accent in New Orleans. Skeet Ullrich is doing fine in a smaller part. <br /> <br /> Listening to the clay within the range of a matchbox in the worst time is a nice look. And this is the scene in which someone passes through the rear window. <br /> <br /> Dialouge apparently tries to apply David Mamet's approach and is just as blasphemous, but never so realistic or insightful. <br /> <br /> The film seems too big really ... really a low-budget movie with an actor behind the camera, which for the first time directs other actors from the script, which is "not bad, but needs some more corrections". Spacey shows that he is not a terrible director, but he lacks something like "shaping the film" and it seems that he just films the actors. <br /> <br /> These actors are talented and can work with material, but everybody feels out of place. As I said earlier, the movie really suffers from bad thinking. <br /> <br /> I do not mean that the wrong actors were cast. I think they found the right cast, but they put them in all the wrong roles. I think that changing some of the roles would help tremendously. <br /> <br /> Having a mafia veteran, actor Joe Mantagna, played the pack leader, Gary Sinese as an angry police lieutenant outside, giving orders and barking at his soldiers, keeping Fischter in his "bloodthirsty thicket" and Matt Dillion as a lamb sacrificial. That would be a big progress. <br /> <br /> When some actors direct, it works. They can even win Oscars for that. But most of the time, when the actors are filming, they tend to focus on performances. Just shoot the acting actors. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it works ... but they need a good presentation. Excuse for him. <br /> <br /> Hostage situations are in fact almost the same as puberty stories, so it's natural that the films about them are also going from point A to point B. <br /> <br /> There are some really great entries in this genre. Spacey himself appeared in a similar film about the situation of hostages: "Negocjator." <br /> <br /> Certainly not become an iconic classic, let alone 100 AFI. Still, he has a few nice moments and personal touches, but in the end he immediately forgets about the movie that would be best played on a regular TV set. It's just not worth leaving the road to see. <br /> <br /> I give 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Another director of Spacey, "Beyond The Sea", was reportedly a better effort. Hmmm ... maybe it's true. You must fail before you succeed. <br /> <br /> author: Dane Youssef
