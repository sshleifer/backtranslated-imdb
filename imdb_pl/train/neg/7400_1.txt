I've seen some very bad movies, and it's there. There is no talk about the story, it's like one of those bad parts of a coma on a soap opera. I just wanted to hit this little girl, because, let's say, she's really suspicious throughout the whole movie. Monsters running around, wearing bling, were fun. I also saw a bit of "Silent Hill" there. And I read that it did and, or he stared at the Finnish metal band, Lordi. No wonder it did not make much sense. It seems that it is a vehicle promoting the band there and nothing more. FX is very good, the look of the movie, monsters, and even acting are also good. But history and its stories simply are not there.
