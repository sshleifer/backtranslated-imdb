Universal Soldier: The Return is not the worst film ever made. No, this honor would have to go to a movie that would attempt to make a statement or perform an artistic feat, but it failed in a pathetic or offensive manner. However, maybe no movie I've ever seen has ever tried so much and achieved such success as Universal Soldier: The Return. <br /> <br /> This movie is a parody of sci-fi / action, which has virtually nothing to recommend. Acting is as bad as any movie I've ever seen. The story is horrible and predictable. The special effects are pathetic. In short, anyone even remotely connected to this movie should be ashamed. US: The Return makes the previous Van Damme tariff seem like a landmark film masterpiece. Some movies are so bad that they are good. Believe me, when I tell you that this is not one of them. I'm really not sure what to say. I doubt if many people were considering watching this movie if they did not have it, but just in case: no.
