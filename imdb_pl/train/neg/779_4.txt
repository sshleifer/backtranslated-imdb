Seriously, I mean very seriously, when I first started watching the program, I thought it was good. But the plot has deteriorated. The plot was too boring or predictable. George is not always funny, sometimes he acts stupid. His jokes are exaggerated. His mother is the stupidest person in the series. How a mother can treat her son this way, good if it was a mother-in-law, but it was her own son. I'm giving this 4/10 show only because the first few performances were a bit funny. Actors Constance Marie and Masiela Lush do a great job. I do not know how these concerts will be played for so long. <br /> <br /> If you're really bored like me and have nothing else to watch, I advise you to watch it.
