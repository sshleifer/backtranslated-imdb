... but this must be the worst adaptation of the Christmas carol of all times. And that requires a little effort, as well as various life efforts. Do not get me wrong - I do not mind Cicely Tyson. I loved it in other roles (for example in Sipsey at Fried Green Tomatoes). But the script does not give her any option but to chew the scenery. And chew her, with all the enthusiasm of Tiny Tim, which is associated with goose Christmas. <br /> <br /> Give me the classic at any time: Alastair Sim, 1951. Except maybe Scrooged, all other excessive efforts to capture the past, present or future of the Christmas Spirit.
