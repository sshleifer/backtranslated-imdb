I stopped watching this point of sale as soon as the snakes began to "take over" the plane. <br /> <br /> At first I thought it could be "one" for comic relief. But then I realized that I could just watch three puppets for free and laugh more! <br /> <br /> Any respect I might have for Samuel Jackson has been irreparably damaged. And Hollywood is once again demonstrating how truly they are detached from reality. When I was a child, we caught snakes for fun. The only thing snakes do is to press at the bottom of the hold. And no amount of Hollywood cartoon snakes can change that. <br /> <br /> This movie is not worth traveling to Blockbuster. I warn you: if you pay for it, the only "victim" is your stupid ass. <br /> <br /> If you want to be really scared, I suggest Descent. If you want to feel humor, go to the local comedy club. Their worst contractor will be a million times better than this basket.
