Really bad and easily the worst episode I've ever seen ... ever. <br /> <br /> They tried to make up for it, telling him "we know we're doing it". It would be fun if it was not for the fact that "The Simpsons" have already done so. And it still would not make up for it if they came up with an idea. <br /> <br /> Flashbacks took place within the framework of ordinary fantasy characters (mainly J.D). The retrospections did not concern even the actual events that took place, only compilations, let's say, J.D falling down or, I do not know ... Elliott is falling over. If I wanted to see a Scrub compilation, I would go to YouTube and not waste half an hour of my life. <br /> <br /> The scrub finally fell into a trap, which most sitcoms must, and disappointed me, managed to pass 5 and a quarter of the season without such an episode. <br /> <br /> I hoped the bush would not have to be this kind of sit-com. <br /> <br /> And just like a passing thought, why the hell was Dr.Cox?
