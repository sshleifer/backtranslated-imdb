The whole genre of Biker Movie must consist of the worst movies ever made. This one provides a lot of fighting, generous amounts of blood, cyclists fighting Indians and slums that are blown up and destroyed at once. Acting is terrifying. What happened to Robert Walker, Jr. At one point he was in a few large studio productions, and then he just disappeared. This movie really blows, but if you have not seen the Biker movie for a long time, it's worth watching. At the end of the movie you should feel a bit cheesy for watching it!
