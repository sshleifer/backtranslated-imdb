It simply should not be done. It's predictable and trivial. Chemistry on the screen that made the first "my girl" so captivating, nowhere to be found, and acting as a whole is rigid and forced. Writing leaves a lot to be desired, some of the "memorable" lines, such as "listening to the barbaric custom" are simply shocking. Where "My Girl" caused a real feeling of sadness and really funny moments, like many sequels of "My Girl 2" trying to recreate these emotions generated by the audience and fail miserably. Maybe I'm working hard on this movie because of how great the first one was, but honestly, it offends the quality of the original with the kind of crap that this installment serves. Certainly it must be close to "Son of the mask" as one of the worst parts of all time. In both cases, the old saying sounds true; "If it's not broken, do not fix it."
