I had to give this film 1 because it's so bad, but do not think I did not like watching because I was laughing and laughing, and even had some questions. Halfway through time, I was laughing, half saying "what the hell is going on?" Or "why would anyone do it?" And so forth. What I liked the most was the horrible fog effects, naked scenes / battles / dialogs / nude scenes from the 80s, and the way the warrior's swords flutter in the wind as they ride a horse. And there are some shit model effects (these should not be real trees, right?) I still do not understand the guy they found in the cave, what the hell is he? My friend told me about these movies and I thought I would give them a chance, and basically I liked the movie as people like Ed Wood's films, I do not have real pleasure in what the movie was supposed to be, I look at it in my own cheerful way . So do not let it distract you, if you really thought it was an action movie, I just liked it for other reasons. It is much worse than the Evil of the Dead, so it can make you think as if you were wasting your life watching them (every few times it occurred to me). I think the best thing for most people would be to have a few drinks, have friends and laugh at the movie. Maybe it is a bit difficult, but I do not think you will rent them and you will see. Yo.
