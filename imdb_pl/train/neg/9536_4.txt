Best of the Best 4 is better than 3, but barely. Essentially, I say this because Part 4 does not contradict the 1/2 (eg 3) parts (ie Ich has no reference to Tommy Lee and his siblings). <br /> <br /> Anyway, I liked the Russian story of the story, especially the part of Sven Ole-Thorsen as Boris. Besides and a few fight scenes, the film is nothing special. The limited budget is also very noticeable (especially on the plane's explosive scene). <br /> <br /> Also part 4 does not really have morality or say anything like part 3, there are still some better known actors (Hudson, Thorsen) in part 4, but unfortunately nothing like the beginning of the series (and even these characters have very small roles). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it seems that Best of the Best to Rhee shows, and to tell the truth, can not wear a movie. <br /> <br /> Saw on the tape, mark: 4
