"The Dream Child" from 1989 is the fifth film in the (generally overrated) series of "Nightmare", and at the latest from that moment the series became a total trash. The only good films from this series were the original Wes Craven from 1984 and the third part of The Dream Warriors from 1987. The second part was disappointing and boring, and it was the fourth part, in which once terrible madman Freddy Krueger began to get upset with constant idiotic jokes. This fifth entry in the series has almost nothing to say, with the exception of (admittedly great) visuals and one horrifying scene, a flashback sequence, as was created by Freddy Krueger. The rest of the movie consists mainly of our crazy madmen geeks who make the jokesters, shouting stupid monoplanes, and the old formula of teenage jackass bands who are desperately trying to avoid falling asleep because good old Freddy is waiting for them in their dreams. Lisa Wilcox returns in the role of Alice Johnson, and some uninteresting nonsense, such as the super-stupid "amazing" rhyme for children, has been added for a different reason than to have any reason to do this unnecessary and boring sequel. .. In short: lack of originality, only the fall of the old formula and the overload of painfully annoying jokes. My (generous) 3/10 rating is due to great visual effects, and especially to the difference in relation to the terrible next part of "Freddy's Dead", which is terrible and unbelievable. In case you are not an avid enthusiast of Freddy Krueger, "The Dream Child" should be avoided, and even if it is, it will rather fail.
