Some children wander in the mountains, and one of them enters a large tunnel and discovers some old mummified gladiator. He puts on the gladiator's helmet and spends the rest of the film killing all other travelers. <br /> <br /> This thing is so pointless that it's annoying. Here's a short list of things that do not make sense: <br /> <br /> 1) The guy and the girl are in their tent and think they can hear something outside. The guy goes out to investigate the case and finds another tourist outside. Then he hears the scream of his girlfriend, so they come back to the tent - they come the next morning?!? He was only 50 feet! <br /> <br /> 2) These two fools then hear another girl scream (What, 100 feet away?), but do not test, because they are afraid of getting lost. <br /> <br /> 3) Another guy and a girl are walking around, and a girl tells them about their 10th stage together that due to circumstances the report does not require him to refer to her as a professor. I mean, what ...? First, it's just a really stupid saying, secondly, he never called her professor in the first nine scenes where they were together. <br /> <br /> 4) The injured girl attacks Demonicus and stops her, telling her that part of his gladiator training has taught him how to wound without killing. Um, yes, we noticed she was hurt and not dead because she gets up and walks. But thanks for this information. <br /> <br /> 5) One girl is bound in a Demonicus lair, and when someone tries to free her, instead instructs him to help her. Um, look, idiot, if she released you, which would take about 5 seconds, there would be no need for help. <br /> <br /> And it just lasts. The whole central part of the movie is spent with two idiots getting lost in the forest, and then they fight, then undress the tent and ignore the screams of friends, and then wander a little more. It's so fucking boring and pointless that halfway I turned off the DVD. <br /> <br /> None of these characters is nice, especially those that have most of the time on the screen. Demonicus himself made me laugh every time I saw him - he looks like a child in a Halloween costume, wrinkling his face to look bad. He's running, maybe I should say he's gay. The special effects are comedic, the acting is mostly horrible, and nothing makes sense. <br /> <br /> In general, maybe this concept could create a nice campus movie, if you spend more time and effort getting rid of absurd dialogue, creating characters with real, friendly personalities, having a logical flow to action, and maybe even doing Demonicus a female figure in a sexy gladiator costume. But no, instead, we get this senseless pile of nonsense that bores you to death.
