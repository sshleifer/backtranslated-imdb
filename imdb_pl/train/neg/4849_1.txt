I just rented it today .... I've heard many good reviews before. WOW!! What pile of steaming poop is this movie !! Does anyone know the director's address, so I can get my five dollars back ???? In the end, someone hit the "Stop-loss" from the first place of the "Worst Iraq War Movie Ever". To be honest, I do not think there are any good films from the Iraq war, but it was REALLY bad. <br /> <br /> I do not get any technical inaccuracies, there are 100 reviews from other GWOT vets who detail them all. If the director took the trouble to consult even the weakest E - nothing about the technical accuracy, they could make the film a bit realistic ... maybe. It seems to me that the writer should be "credit" for this wastage of the film. He or she apparently deleted the plot of the film from some vivid imagination not affected by reality. Is anyone but me wondering what was the meaning of this movie? Was there a message? Seriously ... WTF ???? <br /> <br /> I'm really surprised by all the positive reviews. This film is difficult to watch as a veterinarian because of gross inaccuracies, but even if you could overlook it, the plot sucks, the characters are shallow (to put it mildly), and the acting is at best weak. It's ironic, I suppose this movie is about explosive regulation, because it's the biggest bomb I've seen this year.
