I can not say that this movie was terrible. All Chineseness wakes up in your being because of the ancestors, it was difficult to sell. But telling the audience that every Chinese man knows Chinese history, even without studying it, is ridiculous. It's like saying that every American knows American history without science or any Philippine etc. It just is not credible. <br /> <br /> The story is flat. It was said that Shin came from a monastery in China - later identifying him with Bejing. However, the early movie sequences show a map focusing on Mongolia. I know that the current Chinese regime wants to pick up areas such as Mongolia. But it is a separate nation and even on the map of "Mongolia". Did Disney Studios fail in geography of the fifth grade? <br /> <br /> The relationship between Wendy and Shin is superficial at best, yet she feels attached to him. Her training is also poor. And let's get to the chase: everything in this movie is bad. It's bad enough to laugh and cry. The taekwondo action has been played and unrealistic in many cases. <br /> <br /> Bad eyes were bad. However, the left end would be the only thing going down. They should leave bad eyes. But instead, somehow evil is overcome. Yey! <br /> <br /> In general, not worth the time of the dog in the movie. Brenda Song should take care of another studio. "FA"
