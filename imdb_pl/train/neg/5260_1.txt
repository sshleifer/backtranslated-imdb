Usually, I do not have a problem with a movie or a story with an ending that makes you wonder what really happened when it's done intentionally ... <br /> <br /> But this movie really seems to have everything but the last 15 minutes have ended, and then I realized that they had 5 $ to the end ... <br /> <br /> I saw it on TBS ... I recommend that you do not spend it on it. If you catch it on TV, watch all but the last 15 minutes, then go away and make your own ending in your mind. <br /> <br /> Really, the movie would have been better if they just fled, and I will return with the State Federal Pipeline just to discover that the city and the car cemetery have disappeared, and in every respect have never been there ... <br /> <br /> "I would like to have more thumbs, so I could give this film 4 thumbs!
