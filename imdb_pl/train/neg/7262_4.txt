There are some really great ideas in this brutal film that, if done in a clear way, could lift it from spiciness of the Spaghetti-Western to something special. Unfortunately, TALL CALLED HELL is one of the worst edited movies you can imagine! Scenes start and end abruptly, the characters leave for long episodes, the performances (and accents) of actors are quite inconsistent, etc. <br /> <br /> Robert Shaw is a Mexican (!) Revolutionary who, after taking part in wiping the village, is a priest (!) ... ten years later the village is run by "mayor" Telly Salavas. Stella Stevens arrives, seeking revenge on the man who killed her husband. Colonel Martin Landau arrives, looking for Shaw. Everyone is screaming MUCH and everybody is firing MUCH. Fernando Rey is also in this (as a blind man). The performances are not bad, but they are very uneven. Savalas sometimes has an accent, like Landau (who really feels here). Shaw and Rey prove that they can not really embarrass themselves, and Stevens looks pretty foxy (if a bit out of sweat).
