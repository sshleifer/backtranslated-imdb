What an unintelligible mess in the movie. Something about clay, which extracts bullets from each other after being shot and holding them in a glass jar in his bathroom (and the size of the jar has already been shot about fifty times) and a secret tank guarded by five or six incompetent soldiers who for some because they bring it to Mexico. Whether they were sent there on purpose or really lost was never clear. And you will never hear another script with the word "butthorn". Gary Busey proves Mel Gibson's role in "Lethal Weapon" and while Busey is a useful actor, the scenario takes the whole film to mediocrity. William Smith takes another turn as a Russian soldier, the same character he played in "Red Dawn" a few years earlier. After playing heavy motorcycles for most of the 70's, it was nice to see him expanding his range playing communist trucks. Unfortunately, he will probably always be best remembered as the guy Clint Eastwood called in "Every Which Way You Can."
