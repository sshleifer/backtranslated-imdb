I saw "What Is It?" Glover's Crispina? at the Ann Arbor film festival. I must admit that the film was aptly named, because I have a clear sense that even the screenwriter / director can not give an answer. In the question and answer session after the screening, Mr. Glover said that the film was originally intended to be a short film showing the advantages of using the actors with the syndrome down. However, this is not a good reason to create a movie. Actors are, in my opinion, the basis for a wider vision - a bigger vision that seemed at best confused and absent in the worst case scenario. <br /> <br /> Crispin Glover also said he wanted to deal with taboo topics. Well, he does it. But why? The movie does not seem to have an attitude, there is no reason to turn to everything. Does he think that these things should not be taboo? The film does not even make me understand that. Taboo is not interesting because of the taboo. He can not even let the taboo interfere or arouse at any level because he did not make the audience care. <br /> <br /> Ignoring the problems with the concept for a moment, the most shocking to me was how bad the film was. Editions, photos and other technical aspects often seemed very amateurish. Glover said $ 125-150,000 went into the film, and I feel that the money should be spent on different designers (Glover did design the project himself - I know I saw at least sound in projects). Painted sets are fine (not great), but they are badly used. The parts feel like on a photographed stage - which would be okay if it had a purpose, but in Glover's hands it's just careless. Other parts are filmed like Home Movie, of lower quality than many things I see for the first time in iMovie movies. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the biggest problem with "What Is It?" I can not even understand how seriously the film should be made. There are certain parts that make Glover scream at you to think seriously. At other points it seems that he does not like his own joke. Perhaps he wanted it to be somehow ironic or significant, but I just felt that Glover could not even force his film into serious attention. <br /> <br /> Glover said he originally wanted a short movie. If only it were. After seventy-two minutes, the movie ended up with images and ideas in the top twenty, and one wonders if the ideas were formulated enough to claim that they were there for that period of time.
