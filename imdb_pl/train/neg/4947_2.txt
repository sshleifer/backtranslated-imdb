Dieter Bohlen, a well-known German composer and producer of lightly kitsch pop hits such as "You are my heart, you are my soul", he felt the need to tell his story - and graciously decided to hire a writer-ghost. As a result, a funny book about his life was created. Well, more or less obscure picture. He did not deny that he was a selfish asshole, but the whole story was twisted to match his image. There is no way he probably beat his ex-wife and she went to the hospital. However, it was written in a funny style and a huge success after its appearance as a member of the jury of the German version of "American Idol" - especially his unforgettable comments. <br /> <br /> That should be the end of the story - really. In the buzz of the said TV program "Idol" called "Deutschland sucht den Superstar" (abbreviated DSDS) someone had to come up with a horrible idea to make a movie from the book. The result is "Dieter - der Film" <br /> <br /> I rarely saw a movie that desperately tries to be funny and completely fails. None of the gags hit the nail on the head. Naddel's voice and style of speech immediately took my nerves, though the voice of Verona should have done more. Obvious, childish, predictable and long gags destroy the motivation to watch this movie in a few minutes. The content of the film is a sloppy adaptation of the film, written negligently by the writer-ghost on the basis of Bohlen's sloppy idealized memory. They could use this freedom to do almost anything. It was supposed to be a satire, but it did not work. The story is completely uninteresting, and the fact that the voice in the background is Bohlen, guarantees that the whole film has nothing satirical at all. <br /> <br /> No wonder he was considered bad for the cinema release. The probability that something broke down in some archive was quite high until recently, when the current DSDS season turned out to be an average success. Thanks to the "friendly" help of the largest German yellow press newspaper "BILD" and the desperate situation in which the RTL TV station has something in the program, while the still unbeaten program "Wetten dass ...?" Works on channel 2, the film finally appeared on TV - unfortunately. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is a waste of time - there are definitely better stories with much more pleasure and a history worth watching. /> <br /> Therefore: 2/10
