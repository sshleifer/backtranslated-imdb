This movie was terrible. The ending was absolutely terrible. There was no story for the film at all. The only thing that was decent in this movie was the acting of Robert DuVall and James Earl Jones. Their performances were excellent! The only problem was that the film did not perform any law enforcement performances. If the script came close to capturing a decent story, it would be worth seeing. Instead, the performances of Robert DuVall and James Earl Jones are completely wasted on the awful plot of the god ... or its lack. Not only did I wait in the whole movie for something that made the film ... well, it was a real movie ... not just an absolute dialogue between the characters, which ended absolutely for no reason. It was a simple dialogue that took place during this period. There was nothing special in any of the characters. The only thing that is exceptional is how Robert DuVall depicted a wandering, old, drunk old man. During the whole movie, including the end, nothing is happening. When the movie ended, I sat in amazement ... amazed that I sat throughout the movie, waiting for something interesting to make watching the movie worthwhile. It never happened! The cast of the character suddenly began to roll, which made it obvious that the movie really ended and I realized that I just wasted 2 hours of my life watching a movie without any plot and meaning. It was not even a story. The whole movie takes place in one day. this is it! It was one day in the life (and death) of some Southerners in the plantation. How many stories can take place in one day (other than Film Training Day)? The performances of the entire cast were excellent, but they were very wasted for such a disappointment with the movie ... if you can even call it a movie.
