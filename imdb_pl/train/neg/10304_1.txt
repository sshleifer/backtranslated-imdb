here, let me wave my hands above the keyboard, let me tell you what salad I want to order. over and over, it works like a charm: there is such a genius, omg, how does he do it? my shit detector goes crazy, if I even pass this program, when I scan channels, I have to be very careful (these days it's too often useful, so I do not have to break it into idiotic nonsense with that pilot!). Is this supposed to be some fascist propaganda, so that people would believe in some invisible sphere of control and uberman championship? or what? why it exists <br /> <br /> this is the most ridiculous show, totally unbelievable and invented, and I can not understand why it is still in the air. let the geeks give YES a lot better, showing such a difficult period (Chronicles of Sarah Connor, True Blood), but let this nonsense fit. programs such as Firefly (if they were) fall off after the season, but such thoughtless things that do not have logical sense are still going on. yeccch.
