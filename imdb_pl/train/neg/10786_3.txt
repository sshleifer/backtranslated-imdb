How this movie was made with so many big stars is beyond me. It's a scary, stereotypical movie with the worst acting act. It really surprises me that so many stars from the list A will agree to this nefarious movie. What's worse, there are almost 100 million in the states. It shows, however, that big stars can draw in bucks, even if the movie is horrible. I was sorry for everyone involved in this snoring. Billy Crystal tried his best with what he received, and the rest of the stars seemed to go through the movements. Whatever you do, do not be fooled by the perfect cast, because no one could save it.
