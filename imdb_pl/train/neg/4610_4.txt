I watched this movie because I noticed that the cast included Kari Wuhrer. For a long time I have been talking about her theory that she is a talented actress, but she never manages to prove it, because she is always in this film with a low budget. She's still beautiful, and she's still trying to work on the unfortunate stuff I always see her in. Not different. The film is often ugly and disturbing, but it does not make it good. George Wendt played against the type and it was so shocking that he got recognition for his role. Another remark about Ms. Wuhrer. Her breasts have clearly shrunk since I last saw her. Perhaps surgery to reduce or (more likely) remove implants. This is not a bad thing. It still looks great. I'd like to see her in a better movie.
