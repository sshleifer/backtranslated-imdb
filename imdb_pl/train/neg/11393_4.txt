Wow, I can not believe people think this movie is "good." Now I've seen a lot worse, but John Cusack has many more romantic / funny comedies. <br /> <br /> It's an average movie at best. While the acting was not terrible, but not great, the romantic comedy was a little passion, a small affair. There were many loose ends that do not appear or are not addressed. Unfortunately, the main characters descend as a complete coward. They do not know each other well enough to realize that they do not love people with whom they are engaged. How do we know that they are not in love? Because of the total lack of remorse, both characters have to leave their finances. I can think of a few more romantic things than a continuous escape from the commitment that these two shows. <br /> <br /> The film does not end even on the wedding scene, more than likely that both will be cold and will throw each other like hot potatoes when the commitment is approaching. This film is really about two people who can not commit themselves to anything, unlike previous Cusack characters who were more than willing to get deeply involved (Loyd in Say Anything, Martin in Grosse Pointe Blank, etc.). <br /> <br /> The biggest failure of this movie was the total absence of any twists or anything interesting. When the film ended, I felt that they could not join the history of the culmination, which in principle suits the whole movie: boring. No tension as to whether they will be together, without joy, when they do it, without consequences for their actions. <br /> <br /> It is sad that people are so blind to the cheesy of the film that they just admonish any criticism of "Everyone is too cynical!". The criticism of this film is not cynicism, just an objective examination. There are many other better romantic comedies, even from Grace Kelly or Eva Marie Saint. <br /> <br /> If you think this movie is great, try these movies, and your hearts will explode: Princess bride, say everything, Grosse Pointe Blank, High Fidelity, Keeping the Faith, Charade, Rear Window, North by Northwest or There Something About Mary (which is a good study of an idealized romance and today's society).
