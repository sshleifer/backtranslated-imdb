This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen, and I'm tired of the appetite for awful (and good) movies. It could (just) deal with the kind of teen humor if it was consistently funny "la ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW". Other movies, such as PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, can be fun while (apparently) they try to be serious. When it comes to acting, it looks like they've caught dead teenagers and asked them to move the whole production. In comparison, Tom Cruise looks like Alec Guinness. There was one decent interpretation - an older, smashing ghoul on a motorcycle.
