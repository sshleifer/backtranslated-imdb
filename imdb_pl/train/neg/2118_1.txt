What can I say about the Seven Pounds ... well, I watched a flight from Seattle to Tokyo and because this flight was a long and boring movie definitely did not help. Will Smith's character, Ben Thomas, is almost unthinkable, even if ultimately it will be redeemed. The two-hour duration of the movie wastes most of the time on the screen for random junk that simply combines the story as slowly as possible. In defense of the films, Rosario Dawson's character adds some life to the film, though not much. I do not understand how anyone could have crying during this movie, when all I wanted to do was turn it off. Also, Will Smith is killed with a jellyfish at the end, which proves that killing a medusa is the dumbest way to die.
