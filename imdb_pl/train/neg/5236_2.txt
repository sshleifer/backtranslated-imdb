my friends and I saw this movie about a week ago and I think it's absolutely necessary to tell the whole world (or at least those who read it) that this movie is not only in the top five of the worst movies I've ever seen, but in fact it has the honor to be number one. I've seen a lot of movies, but no one beats that fool. You could say I suffered watching him ... my only excuse is that we waited for a few hours and we were not able to go anywhere else without freezing the buttocks. I do not recommend it to anyone. At first I thought we were watching a really bad porn movie, but after 10 minutes it did not work out. This is not a comedy, it's not a drama, it's not an action, it's not a horror movie, it's just awful!
