I came to this movie with high expectations. I was aware of Greenaway's work and "Storm" and I was interested in adaptation. First, I wanted to shut up after ten minutes, but I felt it would be unfair. There was a storm representation, but where do you think you imagine a little boy pissing on a toy boat? Is it symbolic? I continued for another ten minutes, when my finger trembled over the "off" button, something caught my interest somewhere. This is not Shakespeare, it's not a movie. There is time and place for this, but I will not waste time and there is no room for it in my studies on Shakespeare. After twenty-five minutes, I gave up and it was over. Then I read all the comments on this site, and the pretentiousness of the film only suits the accused. "This is a painting ..... and then put it in the gallery", "it's a ballet ..... keep it on stage". Shakespeare can be done intelligently, performances for the mass audience were available, and this version helps put a wedge between Shakespeare and the general population - and I do not think Bard would be happy about it.
