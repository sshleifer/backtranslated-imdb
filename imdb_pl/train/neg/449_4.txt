I admit that I only watched a few episodes, but each of them seemed completely different from the next one. It seems that after the first season the producers decided to completely rebuild the show, drop characters, introduce new ones and rewrite the whole dynamics of the series. <br /> <br /> As you've probably already guessed, the show is about a weird character, an unpredictable teenager Holly (Amanda Bynes) who introduces herself to her high sister Valerie (Jennie Garth) in New York. A decent assumption: a strange couple + a fish out of water + a high jinx. <br /> <br /> While I miss the comedy series from the past, this show unfortunately omits the funny sign many times and is sad because it has some decent talent. <br /> <br /> Besides, they insisted on changing the series (Val lived with the cast regularly in one season, then suddenly he was gone, so he opens the bakery? what?) When something changes, you drastically feel that even * show * knows that it is bad. I mean completely new sets, written characters and new regular visitors of the show! <br /> <br /> In the margins (it's just boring), I know it's a TV show and it's not real, but Val and Holly live in a huge duplex in the attic (there are stairs) with a terrace ... in MANHATTAN! Are you serious!?
