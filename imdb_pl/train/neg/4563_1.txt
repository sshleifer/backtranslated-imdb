This film is probably the cheapest, harshest and poorest sequel ever made. <br /> <br /> However, this is the funniest and most idiotic Disney movie that will guarantee laughter from surly stories and lame threads from beginning to finish. <br /> <br /> This is a group of short stories that look like bad fanfictions. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ALERT * The first applies to everything that Beast and Belle are petty over a pitiful argument. Then three new characters who have lost, decide to settle the matter by inventing a letter of forgiveness to give Belle. In the middle of this small episode, Belle has eyes on the walls that make my siblings and I laugh so. Then she and the Beast are fighting for a letter ... and later they will know the meaning of forgiveness. How many years they have??? Certainly old enough to know the meaning of forgiveness. <br /> <br /> Then the next one concerns Lumiere as the world's largest drug when it comes to romance. It comes from a man who could get anything feminine. And they make FiFi become a psychotic wickedness that tries to kill Belle and end up with impunity at the end. What a message to send children! <br /> <br /> Then, next is Mrs. Potts, who is furious. And the next after the Beast becomes too possessive to the bird, to the point that it seems stupid. <br /> <br /> Animation is so ugly that it kills. There are at least 100 errors that you can clearly see ... and the color scheme is terrible. <br /> <br /> Belle is a simple juice that crushes when something goes wrong. It is also small and very different from the usual Belle. <br /> <br /> And the side characters are annoying ... (I mean, Cogsworth and Lumiere fight almost all the time, I know they did it in the movie, but it was exaggerated.) <br /> <br /> But the worst form is Mrs. Potts. It is ruined in it. I can not even describe it. Buy it and see for yourself. <br /> <br /> I give him 1/10 for juice, but I give him 10/10 for the comedy.
