This movie is horrible. You do not need to continue reading this review. If you plan to watch it, just say - no (unless you study, do not make a good movie). <br /> <br /> Acting is frightening ... a serious amateur hour. Throughout the movie, I thought it was interesting that they found someone who says and looks like Michael Madsen, just to find out that it's actually him! New low even for him !! <br /> <br /> The plot is horrible. People who say it's original or good have probably never seen a decent movie before. Even in the standard Hollywood action movies, this is a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this !!! Instead, go jogging - at least you will not want to kill yourself.
