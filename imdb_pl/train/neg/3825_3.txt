I saw this movie over the weekend and although I was impressed by the beauty and Polish films produced by the church, I was disappointed that this film was so short without informing members and leaving investigators with many unanswered questions. <Br /> <br /> The film is a 70-minute vignette from the life of Joseph Smith. This is not a real biography because there is no real coherent narrative. Most of the episodes involve Joseph, who does good deeds, plays baseball, runs races and laughs with children, often in slow motion. What a great guy Joseph was, what? Look at him, beating the carpets for his wife Emma. Well, about the rugs of his 33 many wives? There is no mention of polygamy. Gross omission. <br /> <br /> And in such omissions the movie fails. It provides too little information and makes critical audience thinkers wonder WHY Joseph is battered and insulted, WHY he is interfering in jail and WHY this crowd wants to kill him? The highlight of the film is, of course, the journey of Joseph and Hyrum to the prison in Cartagena (passing by the real United Nations with faces coming out of Nauvoo's door). But you never mention WHY. Nothing about Smith suppressing the Nauvoo Expositor newspaper and not ordering her press destroyed for revealing the secret science of polygamy. The public is to wonder or assume that it is simply a more groundless persecution of the Church. There is no mention of Joseph's accusation of betrayal for announcing martial law and calling on Nauvoo militia. <br /> <br /> Of course, I certainly did not expect this church produced by the film to present the last biography of Joseph Richard Bushman Rough Stone Rolling, but I was surprised and surprised at how little substance was actually presented. <br /> <br /> And what's worse, what substance was presented was often inaccurate. Two examples jumped on me. First, the translation of the Book of Mormon. The film shows how Joseph reads the gold plates in a binder with two rings that were actually hidden away from the place. It is well known that JÃ³zef made a translation, burying his face with a hat, staring at the stone there. The second inaccuracy occurs in the prison in Cartagena, where the crowd assaults the cell. Church history reports that Joseph had a six-player shooter, and even fired several rounds before jumping out of the window and gave a masonic signal of suffering (as reported in the Times & Seasons). <br /> <br /> Maybe showing the reality of the shooting would destroy the heart-wrenching mood created by the filmmakers, but omitting it, they were unfaithful to history and did not show Joseph as he was: handy with weapons and able to defend himself. In fact, the impression the movie gives is that Joseph was a nice guy, but also a kind of milquetoast that everyone beat, threw in jail and eventually murdered in cold blood. He was far from that; Joseph was a disciplined and determined man who endured many hardships and fought to do what he believed. <br /> <br /> See the movie, but know it's cotton candy. Then get your meat and potatoes by reading a copy of Smith's biography about Bushman, Rough Stone Rolling. <br /> <br /> PS: movies produced by the church have no credits, but experienced eyes can pick a few familiar faces. Rick Macy is perfect, like Joseph Smith, p. I Bruce Newbold, beloved as Thomas in search of faith in Christ, plays here a corrupt Methodist pastor who did not show Christian love to the young seeker of the truth.
