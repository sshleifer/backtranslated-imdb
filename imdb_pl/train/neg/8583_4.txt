Americans have a focus on the fruit fly and if something does not happen as part of a typical advertisement, we usually lose interest quickly. <br /> <br /> I learned the exciting fact from this movie: someone has to paint high voltage poles and do it on schedule! And guess what, they really would like to do something different (the viewer has similar feelings). <br /> <br /> To my surprise, when I was bored watching the ads at night and decided to watch this movie, I found the characters to be interesting and very engaging. <br /> <br /> I just do not watch too much TV late at night, so I can not recommend this movie unless watching dry paint is your idea for an exciting two hours of your life.
