I really had to catch a different movie from the rest of the commentators on this page, because during the screening of the movie yesterday, the audience was so mortified with the dialogue that I (even kidding) did not go out in half. Filmed as if the filmmaker thought he was approaching a bold new territory, presenting a homosexual tale of adolescence, the film uses the inspired by David Lynch visions inspired by acting Fassbinder. The performances in this movie are so boring and boring that I thought one of the actors would faint because of how uninspiring the script seemed. What's worse, it's colored like the Miami Vice episode. I do not know who this director is; maybe he has a grudge against surrealism, such as Bunuel, Jordowsky, etc. But the problem is that all the above-mentioned directors show the level of erudite sensitivity that is very lacking here. I could understand the meaning of this movie about ten years ago, but when we have such masterpieces as Bad Eduction, Mysterious Skin and Show Me Love, why bother with this cinematic turd? There is nothing new to see here.
