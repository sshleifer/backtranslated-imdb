Probably a noble effort, but ultimately poor. Before I saw this movie, I felt that "Bartleby, The Scrivener" is unacceptable. After watching it, I still do it. Unfortunately, I think that only those who have read this story will understand what is happening and will be upset by unnecessary film corrections (updated from 1850 to 1970, moving from New York to London). Even the great talents of Paul Scofield are not able to save what seems to be a good intention, but a mistaken effort to film Melville's metaphysical classic.
