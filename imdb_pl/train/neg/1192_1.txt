I totally agree with jamrom4 ... it was one of the scariest movies I've ever seen ... it was horrible nonsense ... I was warned not to see it ... and I stupidly watched it anyway ... about 10 minutes to a painful experience I completely gave up from watching the cruelty ... but I was sitting until the end ... just to see if I could ... well, I did and now I would like it not ... it was disgusting .. nothing happened and the ending was all enlightening .. there is no movie that has the right to survive ... I am begging you all to spare yourself the fear of fat bus riding ... if only I had followed the same warning ... please save yourself from this movie ... I have the impression that those who judged it's very, they were involved in making the movie ... and everyone should be wiped out from the surface of the planet ...
