I understand that this movie was made at a very low budget, but that does not justify the horror of Grendel. Deathstalker, The Throne of Fire, Barbarian Queen, Conquest, Invincible Barbarian were made on modest budgets and weak special effects, but still managed to create iconic classics, adding scantily clad warriors and a good sense of humor. Primitive costumes, dark castles and a beautiful Bulgarian landscape gave Grendel the opportunity to be a very good, low-budget sword and a sorcerer's film, but the creators completely ruined the opportunity, using very poor CGI effects and colorless figures. Compare this movie with Beowulf (1999). Maybe it is not Citizen Kane, but it is a good example of how a fun low-budget sci-fi / adventure movie can be created using reliable special effects and attractive characters.
