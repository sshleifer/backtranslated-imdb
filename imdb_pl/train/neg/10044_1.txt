This is the largest 2008 flop. I do not know what the director means to create such a catastrophe. The songs have been added without a situation, the story has been stretched to fill the 3-hour gap and the most disgusting are the acting acrobatics performed by the actors, as if everyone had superpowers in which they can fall between the bullets, and nothing happens to them and one person fighting with 100 people. The only best performance was the man Anil Kapoor, who plays the role of villain with a comic accent saying Hinglish ... Akki also does a good job ... But the movie forgets about it.
