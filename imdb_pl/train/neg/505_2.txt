Wow, that sucks. I will summarize it as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> The count invites 4 naive whores to her castle. Nothing happens for a long time. There are some lame and non-erotic erotic scenes. Some girls cut off their heads (off screen) - End. <br /> <br /> The only thing that happens in this case is decent-looking sets and costumes, some bad dubbing that leads to unintentional funny dialogue, and a few short shots with nudity. And believe me, these things are not enough to buy back 90 minutes of boredom, which is this movie. In fact - the best part is tarts at the beginning of a distributor who has some strange gothic chick covered in blood and showing their tits - and again - it's definitely not worth the price of admission to this trash. As everyone has noted, the title of the movie is completely nonsensical, because there is absolutely no bloodsucker or any dance in the film. You might as well call him "Kozi-rapper leads near-Jerk" - or at least he would have a better title, which also does not apply to anything in the film. The exact title would be '90 Minutes of Torture '- another attractive title that would be at least truthful ... for the viewer. Honestly - the trailer on the album shows all the best parts (and I use the term "best" very loosely ...), so I highly recommend watching this if you're still curious. I can not imagine anyone would like this film wreck - please, take my advice and leave it on the shelf. 2/10
