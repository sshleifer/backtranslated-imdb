Warning: Contains spoilers. If the movie starts with a sex scene, it's a bad movie. (see, for example, 300). This confirms the above lemma. The second scene is the rotating center of the entire action. The fact that we know that the end makes the movie boring. What's more, other threads are revealed when the story rolls back and forth several times. And it became more frustrated. To compensate for the lack of tension, we learn more and more about how unbalanced characters are. And yes, they have a lot to show. Andy (P.Hoffman), for example, is addicted to drugs, more?, He cheats on his wife, more?, Plans to rob his father, more? he does not regret his complicity in the death of his mother, more? he is a serial killer, more? etc. etc. not enough room to write here ... I wonder how he could have the best job. And why his wife did not leave him earlier. On the other hand, I really like performances by Hoffman. <br /> <br /> Even here, PSH saves what's left of my $ 7 spent on this absurdity. Why absurd? Because it does not make sense, why should I care for wicked characters? Another broken motif is that the movie should have a nice (at least nice) character. <br /> <br /> There is also a lot of sentimentality, for example, we should take care of the suffering of a widowed father, not knowing anything about the parents' life before the crime.
