First of all, as a longtime student of the Titanic disaster and a member of several Titanic clubs, I feel entitled to comment on this film. I do not care how many prizes and awards the film won, but for me it is still an absolutely awful movie. Cameron had the resources to make the "right" half-documentary about the catastrophe, but unfortunately he decided to turn it into a romantic face. The fact that so many people around the world have fallen is only evidence of the sad state of taste and common sense that film critics and the public have today. Whoever said that all films should have a hero and a heroine in love? In fact, most of the real events are not romantic, and the Titanic disaster was certainly not a catastrophe. I feel that he needed a better script and director with a semi-documentary approach and the smallest artistic license. I almost vomited in the last sequence in which "dead" lovers meet with other lost passengers and crew who are applauding. Is this an intelligent movie? Ask yourself.
