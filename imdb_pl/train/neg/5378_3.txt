I watched this movie without expecting too much, I got it in a set of 5 movies, all of which were pretty awful in their own way for deception, so what can I expect? and you know what I was right, all were horrible, this movie has several (and some stretches) of interesting points, the occasional camera view is a nice touch, the drummer is very similar to the drummer, i.e. damn annoying and, well, that's the point the problem is that it's so boring that what I can only put on is trying to build up tension, there's a lot of stuff going on and when it's totally tedious (I had my thumb on the fast button "forward", ready to press for most of the movie, but he did everything) and seriously is the vocalist of the band, which looks great because they do not mention how beautiful hell is, I thought it looked a bit like meercat, all that, and I did not even mention the killer, I'm not even going to do it, it's just not worth explaining. In any case, as far as I'm concerned, Star and London are almost the only reason to watch it, and apart from London (which was quite funny) it was not because of their acting talent, I certainly saw a lot worse, but I also saw a lot better. It's best to avoid it unless you get bored with the paint.
