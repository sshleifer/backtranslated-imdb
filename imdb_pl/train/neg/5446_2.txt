For loyal fans of Duran Duran who want to watch a good music video, skip this one. The producers decided to become creative and make a movie from the 80s something like science fiction, involving the evil villain Barbarelli, from whom the band took its name. <br /> <br /> What causes this idea to fail is the fact that in the middle of Duran Duran's wonderful 80's songs there are confusing and irritating scenes showing a fictional antagonist who tries to stop band on one of their concerts. Not only good music is repeatedly interrupted, but we must suffer through some cheap story, hosted by the evil doctor Mario. It's almost too much to bear. 2/10
