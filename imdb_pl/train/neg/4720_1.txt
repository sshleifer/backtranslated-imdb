When I saw this "document", I was disappointed to see the Serbian Propaganda in action once again. Although Serbia and its nationalist policy are the main reason for the disintegration of Yugoslavia, this is not mentioned in the "document" by Bogdanovich, whose name tells us that he is a Serb and his film, which is not objective. It is one of the lies pushed by the Milosevic regime. All others are guilty only the Serbs were right and they were victims, although most war criminals tried in The Hague are Serbs, although the Serbs were genocides committed genocide against Bosnians and attacked Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia with all independent nations recognized by the UN. The destruction of Yugoslavia was not avoidable because the Serbs refused to release the grip that their nationalism had had on the federal Yugoslav government, so Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia were forced into independence to protect their interests. they are interested in an objective documentary about the breakup of Yugoslavia, and the fact is that it is not a document. You should watch "Yugoslavia: the death of the nation," produced by the Discovery channel and the BBC.
