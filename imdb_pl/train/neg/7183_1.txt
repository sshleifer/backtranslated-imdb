This is the worst adaptation of the classic story I have ever seen. They unnecessarily modernize it, and some points are simply sick. <br /> <br /> The songs rarely move in this story. They seem to be accidentally thrown in. The flying scene with Marley is aimless and funny. <br /> <br /> It's not just one of the worst movies I've seen, but it's definitely the worst musical I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It is probably considered classic, because "A Christmas Carol" is such a classic story. The fact that the original story was classic does not mean that there is cheap adaptation.
