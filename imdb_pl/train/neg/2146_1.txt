I will introduce it here, it was the worst continuation of the classic Disney movie I have ever seen. In 1950, Disney released what I consider to be one of his greatest films of all time. Now take great songs, add a weak storyline that resembles a lost TV show. "Combine it and what do you have?" The biggest load Cruda has ever seen. After I saw it, I thought it was the end of Disney. Cinderella should finish with "and live happily ever after." It's not junk. This film did not deserve this type of continuation. I thought it would be "Turn in time", which was moderate, but better than this one. In addition, what do we care about Anastasia? She changed sides like Iago, but it did not help anyone.
