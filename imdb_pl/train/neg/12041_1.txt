Well, start? This is definitely one of the worst movies I've ever paid to see. I will not comment on the story itself, it's a great classic, but here it's like a soap opera. At the beginning acting, with the exception of Eric Bana, is the quality of a soap opera. I've always been a fan of Brad Pitt, but here every actor in The Bold and the Beautiful embarrasses him. Camera operation does not help either. How it stays on him when he thinks, it just takes me to Brooke Forrester's days in the lab! Peter O'Toole either had a really bad plastic surgery or he desperately needed it. Either way, it looks more like Linda Evans than Linda Evans! To end my remarks, Diane Kruger is a lovely girl, but she is definitely not Helen of Troy. Peterson should rather choose Saffron Burrows for this role, because Elizabeth Taylor would be quite unsuccessful.
