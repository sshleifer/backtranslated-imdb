The poorly performed crime drama "blaxploitation" was directed directly at the black city market from the early seventies. Celebrities Pam Grier in the title role, a nurse who becomes a one-man guardian after the drug-dealing bandits make little sister Coffy a junkie. Sudden nonsense goes stubbornly, with energy in cans and excitement; only Grier's ardent temper confers shock on the narrative (she is not an actress, but she connects with the audience in a primitive way). The film, which was not much different from what Charles Bronson did at that time, was sold and advertised as a criminal exploitation, and yet he managed to find a large audience in the city center. Today, however, this is only a footnote in the history of the film from the 70s and lacks a wide range of other films in this genre. * 1/2 of ****
