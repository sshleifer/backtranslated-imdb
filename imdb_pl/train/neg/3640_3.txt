I had no knowledge of this movie before I bought it, but it sounded great and for some time I wanted to see a really great Viking movie ... Unfortunately, this movie was not what I was looking for. I was hoping for the best, but instead I got a boring soap opera from Scandinavia, which seemed to drag too long despite the 84-minute working time. The premise of the film is intriguing enough: it is a Viking who opposes his God, and Odin is so angry that he curses the son of the ruler, named Barek, to death and rebirth as Berserker. This guy Barka is then forced to live a furious, crazy and brutal life after life. The film is filmed well enough, with rich photos and quasi-good performances of actors, but again I got bored and asked questions when this dribbling was over. The creators of the film had the opportunity to do something quite funny and semi-unique, but they threw the ball. Perhaps it could be improved by cheap tactics such as unpaid nudity and lots of gore ... I mean, we're talking about Berserkers here, right? The Vikings were to be BAD enough, with all the rape and plundering, so are not Berserkers even more extreme? All in all, if you're not a fan of the Young and the Restless (etc ...) or, in fact, you are a crazy Berserker who likes to torture yourself, I will probably avoid this gray piece of celluloid.
