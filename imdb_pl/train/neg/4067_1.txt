Am I wrong or is the 2007 version a rip off of the original? I have to ask, because the DVD I just bought is one of the worst films I've ever seen ... bad acting, bad editing, etc. ... the only aspect of "exploitation" is how we were cheated on our money by buying this piece of nonsense . It's nothing but a light porn movie ... there is no real blood, no terrifying images, just cheap junk. If someone wants to see a perfect movie without actors with names, some slimy gore and a decent story ... take Baby Blood ... also done on a cheap budget, but well done ... and a real story! a waste of money, but I will keep it only for laughter .... it's pathetic! New comment .... September 3 ..... I will keep this movie forever just because SOOOOO is bad, it's almost good ... in a really bad way ... the worst act ... a real movie classic!
