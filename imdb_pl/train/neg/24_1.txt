I must congratulate the genius who approved this. Edward Furlong, you're not as good as you think, you can not catch every piece of cheap amateur shit whose only intention is to get bucks. <br /> <br /> Filming is bad and I mean BAD. Anyone with a camera will achieve the same result or better. <br /> <br /> Acting lets say: do not go to the supermarket in search of actors. They usually have a good degree or at least have a damned experience! Director ... Mr. Jon Keeyes, please find your goal in life, as a director just sucking. Your direction is poor, the angles are mixed up (not in a good way), the lines look like they were read from toilet paper, and the damned music ... always appears when it should not and goes out for no apparent reason. By the way, do not go to the writer. Making movies is not like serving on a coffeshop, it requires art and skills, things that I really doubt you will ever have. <br /> <br /> Instead of doing a bad movie with shooting, you should shoot this back to oblivion and wait until something good appears ... Or just find a job on coffeshop. You will have less stress and you will save filmmakers some money and bad nights. <br /> <br /> voice: 1/10 (my first one)
