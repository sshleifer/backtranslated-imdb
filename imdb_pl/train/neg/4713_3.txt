As you can guess, I do not like Johnny Test, according to my review and my review title. Now I think I know what people will say, "How do you know how bad it is? Have you ever watched it? ", I watched the program a few times because I'm learning film and animation, and it just does not. Stick to my standards. <br /> <br /> I want to talk about animation first, because it's one of the most confusing things I've ever seen. Like the first two seasons or only the first season had hand-drawn animations. It seemed to me that it was a nice program to watch when it was hand drawn, but then it switched to flash animation and the quality dropped a lot. <br /> <br /> So this is one blow to my eyes, but lets look at the story of the show. He's trying too hard to be like Dexter's lab, but there are differences because instead of one red scientist, he's two and they're both women. There is a talking dog (why?), And the parents' attitudes are slightly changed. I have others, but I do not think I can write them here (I do not mean curses, but I mean, I do not know if there is a limit of words). Everything else is on the spot, even DeeDee himself, Johnny. It's just so hard to be Dexter, but I think it's a soulless failure. <br /> <br /> Finally, I want to talk about jokes. Do you remember in Dexters' laboratory that some jokes were about screaming? Yes, shouting may be good for a joke or two, but Dexter's laboratory also had cunning comments that forced me to come back and check the joke. Johnny Test forgets all of this and just shouts 50% of the time and stops the music when there is a stupid joke or one liner. This is not a comedy, it's a stupid comedy (I know what some people think about ... Are not you three stupid comedies? Watch it and Johnny Test back, and you laugh more at the first option.). Sometimes jokes are based on bizarre situations that, like Chowder, drive me crazy. I have a general rule for cartoons and comedy: To many weird comedy does not equal, it just makes you think "what am I watching?". <br /> <br /> So he hits all accounts. Do not watch this program if you have any estimates for comedy in any shape, form or form.
