* Spoilers * Some say that Natural Born Killers is a brilliant critic of the media obsession about violence. But this dispute ignores the real content of the film. Oliver Stone could show his serial murderers how vengeful, inhuman murderers of innocent people contrasted with the morbid media fascination. Instead, he gives them justification. The film presents almost every victim as someone who deserves to be wounded. Engaging in cruel stereotypes, Stone presents victims as unpleasant caricatures - silly reductions, broken English immigrants, lazy fat people. The only person who kills dove birds is also a stereotype. Of course, they make friends with the old, hallucinogenic American-Indian - because they are fashionable, dude? Let's make him an admirable character. Fat, Chinese officials and "hicks" are sloppy, so let's make them think they deserve to die. Instead of twisted, hateful, corrupted by their misdeeds, their madness makes them happier and more in love. Mickey and Mallory are sexy, and cool and surreal visuals attract more sensitive people. Justice is ridiculed. Police and prison officers are portrayed as brutal, ugly and intrusive as compared to GQ murderers. Again, this is not in the media in the film, but in the "reality" in the film. The film has no nuances or subtleties - only exaggerated performances and visualizations. The film says nothing new or specific about obsession with violence. The proof that the film fails in its message relies on real reactions to the world. Some sensitive young people who saw the movie quoted him as an inspiration to commit murders. The "message" of the film is a failure because it inspires people in the opposite direction with terrible, real results. You can not see wise news anywhere.
