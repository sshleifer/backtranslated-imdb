DARK REMAINS is a low-budget American horror movie that somehow managed to win 2 prizes. <br /> <br /> It seems that the plot includes 2 separate threads. First of all, the woman commits suicide, cutting her wrists while bathing. Second, the young daughter of a technical writer is found with a throat slit. The mourning couple decides to move to an isolated cabin in the mountains. Later, it turns out that the cabin and surrounding places are haunted. <br /> <br /> Over time, two separate story threads eventually converge, as you might expect. However, the execution is accidental and causes confusion, which can be solved only by repeated viewing. Unfortunately, the movie is simply not tempting enough to attract the majority of viewers to watch it more than once. <br /> <br /> Almost anything that can go wrong with this movie goes wrong - and fast! A low budget can not be used to justify all the shortcomings identified here. <br /> <br /> I think it would be a mistake to judge the actors involved in this production because the material was just too poor. <Br /> <br /> Characters are uninteresting, as other reviewers on this page show. A badly written script introduces too many people without giving them an interesting dialogue, without creating opportunities for situations based on characters and without adding depth to any of them. <br /> <br /> The direction is not very inspired. Inspiration with J-Horror movies such as RINGU, THE GRUDGE and ONE MISSED CALL is obvious. Unfortunately, the DARK REMAINS directors did not pay much attention to the J-Horror style. J-Horror works so effectively because it plays out of fear of the unknown. The tension arises as a result of constant changes between the bizarre situation (for example, the ghost in the CCTV camera going towards it) and the reaction of the central figure that stands before her without any warning. There is no humor or jokes in these films. Everything is played so simply and without remorse or restriction that one can not resist conviction and admiration. The atmosphere of a bad feeling has created tension and ensures that the horror has a psychological impact, very different from the "horror" used in Hollywood movies. CGI was also avoided. Tribute to J-Horror could be well planned. Unfortunately, the lack of inspiration can make the viewer laugh at alleged "horrors" on the screen. The effects of ghost makeup were not so bad considering the low budget, but their actions simply contradicted the logic. I scratched my head several times during this film. <br /> <br /> I could not give up the end, even if I wanted to. I just could not understand it. I could only deduce that it was a kind of struggle with the culmination. <br /> <br /> What's left? The answer the reviewer noted on another website is boredom. The film is obligatory. Fortunately, the pain ends after one and a half hours. However, most will probably shut down long before the end. <br /> <br /> There are only 2 positive things that I could find in this movie - a successful avoidance of frightened stereotypes and a lack of "f-word" in every single sentence you would normally expect to find. That's why there are two stars. <br /> <br /> Those who like supernatural or psychological horrors associated with ghosts and hauntings, can well stick to such films as LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, CHANGELING or J- Podgatunek horroru. <br /> <br /> If you think you've seen too many well-known movies and you want to see a little-known budget horror movie about the "R" rating, watch the Death of the Spirit. Maybe it's not the biggest horror movie ever made, but it's certainly a lot better than DARK REMAINING and has some real surprises in the store. <br /> <br /> I advise everyone to avoid DARK REMAINS like a plague.
