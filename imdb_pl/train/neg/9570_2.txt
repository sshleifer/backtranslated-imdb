For the first time in years, I felt the need to log into IMDb today to get rid of this video by writing a review because it was just such a disappointment. The story sounded amazing when I read it, I was expecting a minimal thriller, a mysterious, claustrophobic phantom hunt. Unfortunately, all this is so weakened by the down-to-earth, tiring love story and too many imagined and gratingly stupid "non-saying-things-like-from-this-in-bad movies" -dialog√≥w, that it's just painful. <br /> <br /> Here's a quick description of the worst offense in this movie: <br /> <br /> - The scenario is so based on coincidences and inexplicable and unforgivable stupidity the main characters that are just ridiculous. No, actually it's anger. And lazy. <br /> <br /> - Related to this: cheap emotions. A long parade of "just in time" moments. <br /> <br /> - The main characters. All right, it seems that the screenwriter has never experienced real human beings in real life, but instead got all his knowledge from bad movies. So his characters are boring, dead genres of the second generation. They are ordinary devices, tenants without the slightest personality. They are "a man and a woman in disintegration who still love each other." I have never seen it before, with the exception of 100,000 movies, and it does not become more realistic or enjoyable. Think about the dumbest two-dimensional Hollywood tariff and have it. There is not a single character in the film that would be even a little fresh, charming or interesting. <br /> <br /> - Amazing, unclear resolution that sways very badly and needs only one jab to roll over, although the word "Resolution" may be badly adapted here, because the movie is a messy mess, which is nowhere he is not going. However, before you go, you do not care. The last third of the movie I just moved forward because watching was so unbearable. <br /> <br /> Okay, that's it. Regardless of what functions the movie has, all this is buried in incompetence. Do not watch this turda.
