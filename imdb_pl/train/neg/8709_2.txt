Arg. Shuffling dinosaurs are coming back to re-bite our mental health in this awful third movie. This time, European terrorists (Irish would say) hi-jack military convoys that were supposed to transport uranium. They enter the shipyard, open the truck and discover our old friends of carnosaurs. Pandemonium occurs when rubber dinosaurs break terrorists, cops and some marines. The whole film seems (again) largely inspired by Alien (like Carnosaur 2 was) with pathetic soldiers passing through the "claustrophobic" shipyard? guns at the ready. This third work is probably the driest and worst film of the party, with only one stream of blood when the rubber dino tears off the sailor's head. Dinosaurs are stiff, shuffling creatures as usual, and T-Rex sounds like an angry elephant when he roars (it also seems that he has no eyes). One of the craziest scenes in the movie is the appearance of coppers on the scene: they enter a building where a kidnapped truck is stored and hear a strange noise coming from another truck. After opening, a surprise! Rubber Reptile Rape exploded and consumed them. Why were the dinosaurs locked in the second truck after escaping from the first? How were they closed, because the truck's door could only be closed from the outside? What was the point of filming this scene? Oh, who cares? Both thumbs down too much rubber iguanas.
