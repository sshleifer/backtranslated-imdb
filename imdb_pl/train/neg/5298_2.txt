I rented this movie because I was browsing the horror section in search of films that no one had heard of and which could be a possible jewel. I saw it, and because I'm a fan of violence and blood, I got it. He received the EM rating, which means: Extremely mature. Thinking that this rare and high grade was totally meant for violence and everything else, I have it. The warning on the box says: Extreme violence, extreme Langauge and nudity. "Extreme violence" appealed to me. The film ended with quite a familiar movement. He had one or two bloody scenes, but I saw worse in the PG-13 movie. Of course, the amount of film in the film is not that important, right? You also have a story. Well, the plot was boring and there is nothing special about it. Do not rent it. I'm telling the truth. I can not imagine how someone could really enjoy it to the extent that they say, "I'm going to rent it again." Those were the moments in which you were moving, but I will never see this movie again.
