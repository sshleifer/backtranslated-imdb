Based on one of Gabriel Marquez's books and may be a brilliant literature, this cinema adaptation really sucks because it resembles more the struggle with sleeping than using some cinematographic shots. The story is about an old couple, whose son died and who lives a life in which poverty prevails, and the main character is a rooster, which I hope one day will bring money to the upcoming cocks. I'm not in the mood to pour out more words about this useless pretentious song, maybe you can see Salma Hayek here, but sitting 90 minutes in front of your screen for that? Not gracias .....
