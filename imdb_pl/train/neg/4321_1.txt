It was the worst Christmas movie I've ever seen. I took my two young children to see it. It was the darkest, darkest story - the family has no money, my mother loses her job, her father is killed in a bank, a bank robber steals a family car with both children on her back and after a high speed chase, she leaves the bridge and drowns in the river. Mom stays alone. No wonder her holiday spririt disappeared. Christmas angels do not save children who drown, and Santa Claus does not bring back dead fathers! I thought it was the worst message to send children. It's better to tell them that Santa is NOT there than to show him such a movie !!
