I could barely refrain from nodding or turning off that turner, but I decided to get it out, if only because something * might * happen. This is the work of a writer / producer / director / special fx, Kenneth Herts, who wants to make a statement about ecological damage when creating a monster movie. He wanted it, anyway. What turns out to be is a lot of acting, or a bit thin, or simply mundane and with no merit, and scenes that seem to repeat as monsters attacks in the river (oh, and what a bliss, a woman just happens to be naked in this ... even if it was already ZANIECZYSZCZENIA!) <br /> <br /> It is simply nonsensical, but I think it is not too harmful; it is not at least unbearable and once or twice we get a semi-interesting insight into Brazilian "culture" (meaning a father walking around the city with his flock or other appearances "hey, this is NOT America!"). ). But any hope that the director had in casting Mitchum or Carradine is wasted at best for pedestrians, and in the worst - horribly banal and stupid. It does not help that when we finally look at the monster well and the "action" happens, it is also stupidly staged and only poor. I would usually regret a filmmaker who had many problems with the completion of a particular photo - in this case it took most of the mid-70s - but with Monstroid or Monster, or whatever it is called ... nah. > <br /> If you happen to get the dual function of Elvira DVD (bad print with bad transfer quality) with Blue Sunshine, remember to skip this. Unless of course you are not Elvira, you can not help but hear her juicy comment; I would personally prefer Joel or Mike Nelson to do the robots from the Mystery Science Theater on this roasted turkey.
