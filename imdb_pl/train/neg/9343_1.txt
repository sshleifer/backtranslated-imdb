How do you start browsing a movie that will soon be considered the "worst movie of all time" by "the worst director of all time"? A film that could develop a cult because it is "so bad, that's right?" <br /> <br /> The analytical approach criticizing the film seems to be pointless as well as part of the band-wagon band - let loose freely without worrying about the reaction because every other man on earth does it, and people who like this movie because of the flaws we would cite. <br /> <br /> The universal poor quality of the film is obvious - "Sixteen years of alcohol" is not without competition for the title of the worst film, so he has to get the title and keep it low, but I believe that this movie could go a long way. IMDb does not allow a sufficient number of words to cite all film failures, and putting the "Sixteen Years of Alcohol" elements is much easier. Unfortunately, moments of glory have been buried so far in the shadow of this film's weakness, and this task is not worth pursuing. <br /> <br /> My impressions? I thought I knew what I was getting into, I was warned to drink a few cups of coffee before I sat down to watch this one (I'd like it to be a vodka cup). Despite my low expectations, "Sixteen Years of Alcohol" did not entertain me even at the level of "playfulness of a bad movie". Not only bad, but terribly bad, as if Jobson deliberately tried to make this movie a poetic yawn, but he went overboard and pushed poetry into our throats, which was not deep but fun. .. and supposedly Jobson honestly tried to make a good movie? Even after seeing the promotional literature "Sixteen years of alcohol" I can not believe in Jobon's honesty. Stupid and unpleasant to the end with a few smiles / giggles (everything that I'm not aware of) doprawi≈Ç movie, and these few elements prevented me turning off the DVD. So bad, that's good? No. It was enough. "I can not believe it's a serious moment in the movie" to keep me from turning it off and nothing more. <br /> <br /> Definitely a movie to watch with a group of bad movie connoisseurs. Prepare your own comment. That would greatly improve my experience. It's so bad that Mike Myers comments in his Scottish cod accent, as it happens, to turn this whole slime into a comical farce, "Ok dare ma man, give me annuder gliss from dat wiskey."
