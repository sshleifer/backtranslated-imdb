As much as I do not like to say "me too" in response to other comments - it's perfectly true that the first 30 minutes of this movie have nothing to do with the endless lament that covers the next 90 years. <br /> <br /> Being somewhere forbidden does not make the movie possible to watch. The fact that it does not resemble a Hollywood product does not make it credible. <br /> <br /> What's worse, apart from the lack of a noticeable plot (except that there are many muddy places in Russia and many people, even very old women, drink a lot of vodka) many visual effects are so unnecessarily nauseating that I am in my second Rolaids package. <br /> <br /> As for the spoilers - well, the movie is so devoid of a narrative thread I could not write if I tried. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time or money and do not confuse it with a good Russian cinema.
