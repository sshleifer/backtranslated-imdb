This performance was absolutely horrible. For one, George is not funny, and his children are snobbish. He also treats his mother without respect. As a Spanish woman I am very offended by this performance and the way in which heroes are portrayed. <br /> <br /> Plus that the dysfunctional family was made to die. I want to see something original for the first time. What makes this program fun when other concerts do it millions of times? I thought that ABC would sense and pull this piece of rubbish out of thin air, but unfortunately, we will have to bear it until it "jumps the shark". <br /> <br /> In my opinion, they have already done so.
