THE CRIMSON RIVERS is one of the most distorted, oversized, oversized mess I have ever seen in France. There is nothing worse than French production trying to outdo films made in Hollywood, and CR is a great example of such a damn horror / action / buddy. I almost stopped doing it because I knew it would be nothing but French guys trying to show off. <br /> <br /> The film begins promisingly like some expansive horror, but it quickly moves genres, from horror to action, from the type of x-files to buddy, that CR is all and nothing of it. It's so full of stereotypes that at one point I thought the whole comedy. A painful dialogue and those silent breaks, with disappearances and disappearances, only in the right moments of the exhibition, made me groan. I thought that only films made in Hollywood used this broken technique. <br /> <br /> The scene of the pursuit, in which Vincent Cassel runs after the killer, is so exaggerated and exaggerated that it is almost beautiful. The climax at the top of the mountain, with a stupid revelation about the killer (s) with Casselem and Reno playing in "buddies" such as Nolte and Murphy at 48 HRS, completely derailed the small credibility of the film. br /> It's hard to believe that the director of THE CRIMSON RIVERS directed GOTHIKA, which although it had many problems, did not even come close to the horrors of this exaggerated, confused film.
