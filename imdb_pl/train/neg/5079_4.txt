What a great actor in such a terrible history ... <br /> <br /> The film and its production are, however, quite good, though set in London, but outside in Bristol. Irrelevant ?? see one cathedral, you've seen them all, in a sense. <br /> <br /> The story, however ... is about a man born with the power of death and destruction on anyone and anything, if that was the wish. Having only a fleeting reference to real life examples of telekinesis, the narrative builds the image of a man who is abused and misjudged as a boy, teenager and finally as a man; so much that it literally demands revenge. Over time, he comes to the conclusion that the whole world is going in the wrong direction, so he decides to destroy the fate? just thinking about it! <br /> <br /> The problem with the narrative, however, is that he tries to combine authentic scientific data with strange mental powers and combine them into a quasi-religious trap to create a hodge-podge theory about all this. Mixing facts and fantasies in this fashion rarely works? and I'm afraid Richard Burton must have been terribly worried about trying to sound convincing. His best scene, however, is that when he left his home, he gave his wife and her lover pasting: a sharp, witty and deadly dialogue, released as soon as Burton could. <br /> <br /> A good cast, however, helps to improve the look and sound, starting with the Lino Ventura, which I last saw in Garde A Vu (1981), as Inspector Brunel; Harry Andrews as deputy commissioner; very underestimated Lee Remick as Dr. Zonfeld; Derek Jacobi as a publisher, Towney and several other famous character actors. <br /> <br /> I liked the way the story was presented as a retrospective retrospection to fill the story, and thus to resolve the immediate mystery of the attempted murder of Morlar (Richard Burton), the writer of a deadly disposition. Until then, it was a good piece of the visual work of detective Brunel and his English midfielder. Nevertheless, it was very predictable, because it became very obvious to me that the identity of the would-be killer had changed. <br /> <br /> Then they went and ruined it all in the last fifteen minutes. If you want to know what it is, think of Samson and Delilah (1949), of the prominent Cecil B. de Mille, and how Samson finally has bad guys. And the last scene is simply stupid. Why? Because there are at least a hundred ways that Morlar's madness could be stopped, absolutely. <br /> <br /> Shame, because it can be a much better story and movie. It seems to me that Burton really needed money. <br /> <br /> If you're a Burton fan, take some time to watch the scene mentioned above. Otherwise, do not worry.
