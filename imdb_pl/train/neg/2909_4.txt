Watching Tom Hanks as the murderer of the Irish crowd is a bit like seeing Jimmy Stewart as a serial rapist who just does not work. It was really hard for me to accept it. I do not think Tom can work because I can follow his career since Mazes and Monsters, but for some reason it has fallen on me. Maybe because I am a fan of the graphic novel and I risk that it sounds like a fanboy (the only form of life than a fanboy is a cockroach). The film as a whole fails for me. The additions of Jude Law and the subtraction of everything that remained made me feel cold and more than a little disappointed. I was expecting a great criminal film more like Bonnie and Clyde Mendes to rip the whole heart out of history and leave us boneless. In this movie there are things that they like, but the pictures are breathtaking, filling the screen with beautiful paintings Paul Newman is as perfect as ever and I really liked the result, but Tom as the "angel of death" Sullivan was completely flat.
