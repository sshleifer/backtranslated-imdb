Seeing "Triumph of the Will", I can only say that this movie is spooky, even measured in relation to the historically low "standards" of that time. Of course, everything is completely fabricated and harmful. This can be expected from the German propaganda of the thirties. Unfortunately, the quality of the presentation itself is trite and cheap. It is also so absurd that even modern Germans had to leave the theater holding their noses. In a genre known for its attractiveness, lack of originality and uncontrollable anger, this film does not even qualify as "bad". To achieve this status, it would have to be significantly improved!
