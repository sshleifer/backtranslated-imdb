One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Acting was terrible, both for children and adults. Most often all the characters showed lack, little or no emotions. The lighting was terrible and there was too much clutter about the time of the day the film was shot (in the scene on the river where they just destroy the boat, there are 4 shots; sheriff and dad in the evening on the boat, Jillian and Molly are swimming in the evening, the rest of the children within day * when it should be in the evening * on the river bank, and the doctor, Beatrice and Simonton at night, but not in the evening, getting off the boat.) The best actor in the film was probably the sheriff, Cappy (Although, when the pulse detector * has traces of character , whatever it is, when people die, it sounds * shows that Cappy is dead, he is still moving when the sound signal is still heard, and while the nurse checks the pulse manually, shows the pulse again and then dies.) I think it will not be perfect because it is an independent movie, but it can still be better. It is not worth watching, honestly, even for children. You might as well see something good like The Lion King or Toy Story if you want to see everything you remember.
