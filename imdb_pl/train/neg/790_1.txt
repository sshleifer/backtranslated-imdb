Here's what happened: <br /> <br /> 1) BBC3 must prepare programs for different audiences to BBC1 and BBC2 to keep the license and work. <br /> <br /> 2) Lenny Henry offers his unruly friends up. <br /> <br /> 3) BBC3 boss tosses them, completely ignoring the fact that they are not funny. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that it is racist, as all characters approach bad stereotypes. If a white person did something like that, there would be a scream! <br /> <br /> Garbage.
