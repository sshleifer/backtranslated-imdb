Essentially, take the concept of every Asian movie about horror ghosts and break it into one and you'll get this movie. The story looks like this: a group of college kids receive voice messages from their own phones that predict their deaths. It's a bit of a ghost that if you've seen an Asian ghost movie, it's not terrifying anymore. This movie was quite annoying because it is very stereotypical. It's the same nonsense, another movie. <br /> <br /> Acting was pretty good. Unfortunately, the actors are placed in a very strange situation, so we have not seen anything in the past. These two main roles have done solid work. <br /> <br /> As far as gore is concerned, little is happening. We get a nice sequence that includes the head twisting arm (I do not know how to explain it otherwise), but it's cut off, so you can not see anything but the final result. You see blood sometimes, including cut shoulders and zombies (which looked really nice, I could add), but this movie is not too bloody. <br /> <br /> The scare in the film is scarce and spread, and it really is not so scary. Sometimes you'll get scary images, but it's not enough to scare me. It is no different from Ring, Ju-On or Dark Water and neither of them has scared me. The real collapse of this (and most Asian horror movies) is that if it does not bring terror, it's just not that good. <br /> <br /> When it comes to directing, Takashi Miike was still doing well. He seemed a little tamed in this film compared to his previous films, but he still portrays much of his style from which he became famous. Many of the paintings were very similar to Miike (including a scene with a bouquet of dead fetus jars), and the last 15-20 minutes seemed much more like Miike than the rest of the movie. Despite this, the film is faulty due to its non-originality. <br /> <br /> I recommend this only to people who are huge in Asian horror movies (even if you are, I can recommend it much better) or to large Miike fans. A warning for those who want to get to Miike is NOT his best job. <br /> <br /> I give him 4 because it's just average. Maybe if it was released 4 or 5 years ago, it might be worth a higher rating. <br /> <br /> I would also like to talk about Asian horror very quickly. How is it that this is an Asian horror? Many of these films are Japan's equivalent of what Scream, Urban Legends and I Know What You Did Last Summer were here in the 90s. If you've seen one, you've seen them all. Many of these movies are based too much on fear and images that if they do not provide the horror they intend to do, they simply are not that good and nothing will change that. More Asian horror movies must be more similar to Audition and A Tale of Two Sisters, two films that, if you do not scare and scare you, at least have great stories, acting, directing, photos and much more to support them. Two movies that are not just great horror movies, but great movies in general. More Asian horror movies must be such, not stereotypes: "The ghost just wanted to be found, so he killed people by phone / tape video / house / electrical appliance / water pipes / google search engine / vibrator / groceries / etc."
