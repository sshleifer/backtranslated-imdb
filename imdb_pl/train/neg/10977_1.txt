I live in Ottawa, where the movie was made and I really wish it was not. This is one terrible god. I really try to support independent films, but this is stigma associated with anything indie and this mark is: Indie Films Blow. Well, this movie does nothing to throw a curse. Actor, screenwriter, director Brett Kelly does not bring much to this genre, rather creeps tired stereotypes from previous films. I am really tired of dangerous evil characters that lurk in the shade and prey on unsuspecting, it's too exaggerated. <br /> <br /> I remember one scene, especially right at the end of the movie, where the whole scene is illuminated with car headlights. Now some people can say that it was an effect used to create mood and tension, but unfortunately it was supposed to show the modest budget of this film. For a movie that has the courage to call itself a horror film, the viewer will find himself in a difficult situation to find any real gore, except for a few scenes with corn syrup and a red dye. <br /> <br /> The biggest thing that pulls this movie down is the stimulation and lack of character development, the basic plot is that children are kidnapped, and parents have to track down this Bonesetter man before a certain time to recover their children . Not because this concept pisses me off, but I did not really think it was believable that when the two main heroes, both who lost their children can find time to get along. It is done in such a short time that it is unthinkable, my first priority would be to return my daughter and at least get to know her before leaving with her. <br /> <br /> The last thing I have is ... and I will not stop it from Kelly, but the movie is filmed entirely on a boring, emotionless movie and it really takes away any tense moments that would just be interesting style on the film. Although if this movie would get a millionth rebuilding and reworked history, and boring acting and lame everything could not keep the film on the surface. I just hope something will happen that will prevent Brett Kelly from making a sequel, which was published on his website, a sequel that was half-written in one sitting. <br /> <br /> Lord, help us all.
