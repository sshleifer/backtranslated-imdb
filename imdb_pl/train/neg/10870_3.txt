Bill (Buddy Rogers) is sent to New York by his uncle (Richard Tucker) to experience life before he inherits $ 25 million. His uncle paid 3 women Jacqui (Kathryn Crawford), Maxine (Josephine Dunn) and Pauline (Carole Lombard) for taking care of him and made sure that he did not get angry with gold prospectors. One of these women, Cleo (Geneva Mitchell), appears on the stage with disapproval of women. We follow the story when the girls get more money to appear in the show instead of their escort role they agreed to do for three months when Bill is in New York while Bill meets Cleo and another woman. In the end, love is in the air for Bill and others ............. <br /> <br /> Picture quality and sound quality are poor in this movie. The story is intertwined with musical numbers, but the songs are bad, and Kathryn Crawford has a terrible voice. Rogers is not very good either. It's nice enough, but it really comes to life by playing drums or a trombone. He is a very irritating figure who plays a taxi driver (Roscoe Karns), and the movie is simply boring.
