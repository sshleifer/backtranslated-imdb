"ASTONISHING" screams "LA Times" at the front of the DVD box. They had to refer to the fact that such a pathetic piece of shit was ever released. The film revolves around a group of girls who have a disease that forces them to become cannibals and murder innocent people just to stay alive. Their skin peels off throughout the film, we also see severed legs, heads, etc., which are as convincing as the Halloween Fuzzy Felt set. There is a lot of talking b * ll ** ks, a bit of human food and some weird zombie hunter who imprisoned those suffering from this disease in a closet tied to a chair, before stabbing them in the head, chopping them to pieces ... <br /> < br /> You get a photo. Given that there is no actor talent at all, and the blood is ridiculously unrealistic, what is the meaning of this whole farrago? Again looking at the video field, the guy responsible for this is an "underground cult director". Would it be like these strange religious cults where brainwashing forces you to think in one way, when the opposite is true? Because this is the only possible reason why anyone can enjoy watching this tax deduction. Then in the same paragraph he compares himself to Mike Leigh, Ken Loach and George Romero. HAHAHAHAHA, stop it. Now you are just stupid. <br /> <br /> Do you like this movie? Are you offended by the above opinion? If so, you must be a member of this cult. Do they put in your salary? Do they allow you to see other family members? Do they make you watch Andrew Parkinson's movies until you think he's the best director since A.Hitchcock? Say ... it sounds like a special Panorama beer for me. And say hello to the LA critic when you come back to your colony, okay? 0/10
