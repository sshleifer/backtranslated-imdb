Few films left me with such a sense of uneasiness, and this is not a compliment. Since I saw it in the theater (how I ended up, I can only wonder) I was subjected to 90 million hateful, derived garbage, the main impression was a bit like in this other film about the disease "I do not answer the phone" - but worse. The nastiness of all this, rape and everything, is shown without distance (as opposed to strong things such as "Last house on the left") and total contempt for (perfect?) Victims and all involved, leaving the viewer treated as a sadistic peeper. At the end I wanted to take a shower. No credits for the director
