This film is about a group of five friends who rent a house in the forest. One of my friends catches a terrifying virus eating meat. Suddenly, friends turn away from each other in a desperate attempt to refrain from contracting the disease. <br /> <br /> "Cab Fever" is a terrible movie. First of all, he tries to be many species at the same time. Is this supposed to be a tribute, a comic book, a black comedy or a frightening movie with an unintentional comedy? No one can say. At the beginning there is a serious scene and a second change that becomes funny. When the movie tries to be funny, humor is quite bland, except for the ending. I really liked the ending. <br /> <br /> But outside the end I was very disappointed and disgusted. Violence is remarkable, more distracting from the screen than frightened. The tone changes in every scene, sometimes funny, sometimes frightening and sometimes quite random. In fact, you see a girl doing karate in a slo-motion movement. What are we to get out of this? The same girl will bite one of the characters. Was this supposed to be funny? I do not know. <br /> <br /> Some performances were decent, and many were quite amateur. I did not care about most of the characters. I liked the conspiracy, but the execution was terrible. As a horror movie, I did not know what it meant to be. I did not think it was funny, tense or frightening. At the end you remain indifferent, thinking: "What exactly did I experience?" Unfortunately, you will never know the answer to this question.
