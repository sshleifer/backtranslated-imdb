Neise, they go to the dug tomb of the mummy. On the way, Captain Storm Sylvia and his men come to the desert princess Simira, Ziva Rodann. <br /> <br /> Simira seems to be superhuman in his ability to withstand the rigors of desert life, does not drink water or get tired, but also knows what Captain Storm & Co. is looking for. and warns him and his group to stay as far as possible from the excavation, the tomb of Pharaoh Ra Ha Theta. <br /> <br /> In the burial chamber of Ra Ha Teta, Robert Quentin and his crew of archaeologists, along with their Egyptian guide, brother Simira, Numar, Alvaro Guillot, have already opened their tomb before Captain Storm can get there to stop them . Quentin shattered Ra Haeta's body, forcing Dr. Farrady, Guy Prescott, to cut the bandages. This action with Robert and Farrady caused that Numar lost consciousness. Later, it turns out that Numar somehow was possessed by the spirit or soul of Ra Haeta, who took over his body and caused his aging, at a rate of 500 years an hour, to become a 3,000-year-old mummy. <br /> <br /> In the movie, Numar is dressed in what looks like a pair of pajamas sneaking around the tomb Ra Ha Theta, and his surroundings attack and suck blood to survive, like a vampire, any human or animal to whom there comes contact with.
