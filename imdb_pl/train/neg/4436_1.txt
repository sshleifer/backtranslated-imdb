I gave this film a grade 1 (horrible). The only reason why he should get 1 instead of the big -0 is Ben Kingsley, which always shines no matter what awful stuff is being thrown at his side. here, as a spectator, you simply can not be reconciled with the fact that it is even in such a piece. <br /> <br /> Stupid, stupid story and terrible production. DO NOT waste a rented $ video.
