Shiner directed by Christian Calson focuses on three "couples" and their relationships with obsession and violence. As for me, it's quite a good start. Interesting. Couples break up into a heterosexual couple, two heterosexual friends and a simple guy who is "harmlessly" persecuted by gays. <br /> <br /> A pair of "het" really does not have too much of a cinematography. There are several scenes that show how they like to be aggressive during sex or play with each other, but they seem to have no real purpose because they are so marginalized. I suppose they are a more everyday illustration of how sex / violence is integrated in the life of a couple. The pair is not very aggressive and is not even shot in any erotic way. As heroes, they do not add much to the theme or story. <br /> <br /> Two men make up the majority of the story. They get involved in some gay beating, convincing a homosexual man to have sex with them in the alley. It intensifies into violence. And violence changes them. It becomes a means of sexual satisfaction. And their demand for violence increases as the film progresses. The main problem I had was that violence is not convincing. Never once does it seem that a character is in real danger. It just does not work. Given that the whole theme of the film concerns the heroes' relationship with violence, this is a serious problem. Unfortunately, makeup does not help either. Sometimes it is good, sometimes bad. In one scene I really wondered why one of the characters had a pink stain on his face. Misleading. <br /> <br /> A more interesting pair of characters is a "pair of persecutors". Here, Calson seemed to have more to say and was able to develop a more coherent storyline. Perhaps this is because the characters seem to develop more and have a resolution at the end. Shiner could have been much better if he got stuck with these two. <br /> <br /> I appreciate that Calson wanted to achieve a lot thanks to this film. It's admirable. Most low-budget movies do not aspire to many. I do not think that Calson will achieve the desire he aspired to. I did not find anything particularly controversial or disturbing myself. Shiner was unconvincing. This does not mean, however, that the director can not achieve something in his next film. <br /> <br /> It seems that he has something to say.
