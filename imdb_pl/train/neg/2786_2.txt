Okay, I will not criticize this movie in depth. I note many thought-out opinions that I had before, and since I generally like Maria de Medeiros, I have long hesitated whether to comment with disrespect - almost a year has passed. But every time I see a DVD on my shelf, I feel an inner moan. In any case, let these loud voices replace me! But for other moviegoers like me - beware. <br /> <br /> Expressed in the simplest and the mildest way, here's my position: <br /> <br /> The political turmoil and overthrow constituting the background for this movie also served as a backdrop for a certain period of my life - through the newspapers I read daily in my local Central European pub. At the time, I followed the reports, but I never understood what had happened. Reporters tended to report in non-party categories or with conservatism that did not look at groups that disrupted peace or incited rebellion against the establishment. These were times when other winds of unrest swirled in Paris, Berlin, Prague and various places in the US, all of which I understood at the time - but dictatorship or not, my documents tended to treat the Portuguese government simply as establishment - not as well shaped "evil empire" to use the incorrect dates of the Star Wars. <br /> <br /> So week after week I read about the disturbances, but I never found an intelligent article that could provide a story behind them, or assess the practices and socio-economic effects of dictatorship, etc. <br /> <br /> Yes So, buying this movie, I had at least two hopes: finally, to understand the details that lead to social unrest and enjoy the well-conceived drama. This movie did not give me this. <br /> <br /> The film assumes that viewers already have a lot of knowledge and deep emotions about historical facts. And drama - well, as I said, I want to encourage Maria de Medeiros and the Portuguese film industry, but - it was trivial and shallow. <br /> <br /> I received my copy of the DVD from France - "The official selection of Cannes 2000 - Un Certain Regard". The box shows smiling, shaved actors, and the lead gives a sign of victory in a way reminiscent of the Playboy bunny. After watching the work, I was wondering what the French could think about - although as a shallow piece of the "cinema version" with sensitive ethnic content, I understand their natural inclination to praise her for "honesty", but ... <br /> <br /> Look at the back of the frame: "Un regard chaleuruex sur la Revolution" - warm respect? Try to describe the overthrow and murder of Allende with "warm respect"! Try it with Czechoslovakia in 1968! Try it out with a whole set of overthrows and civil revolts! <br /> <br /> Another review: Maria de Medeiros and renoue 'avec son pays, son of enfance et son histoire. "Garbage, rubbish, garbage! least for me. <br /> <br /> I love Portugal, throughout Europe, Lisbon, Barcelona and Prague are my favorite cities, but my love for the city and the country is not an empty movie. I will stick to my old VHS tapes Capas Negras and A Cancao de Lisboa - meanwhile I'm stuck in zone 2 with the above title, which might as well be in the basket.
