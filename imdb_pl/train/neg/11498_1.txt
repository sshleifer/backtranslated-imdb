Gadar is an example of one of the worst movies overrated in Bollywood. Directed by Anila Sharma, who prefers to make films related to the era, gives a junk movie. The songs were boring and they were not the kind of song you want to listen to in the car, full volume. Sunny Deol is famous for doing daft√≥w, which alone defeats 100 bad guys. He copies even the metal prison door (Indian) and digs a moving car away (Teesri Aankh). I can give you another 50 examples of the shameful action of the Sunny Deol. But I'm sure most people already know about it. Sunny gives pathetic behavior once again repeating the same kind of role. A guy who claims he's fighting for his country using violence. Amisha Patel is incredibly sexy with an amazing body that I would really like bones. But even she could not save the movie before the catastrophe. Instead of wearing sexy clothes, as usual, in this movie no. Maybe because she played a Muslim, but she does not behave like in a movie. Overall, this is a bad program, I'm sure that it will appeal to some people who love to see a Bollywood actor over 100 guys. Give me a break.
