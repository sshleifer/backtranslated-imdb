I was very disappointed with this film. I was expecting more of Thelma and Louise's crime film. Instead, women escaping from prison in this movement did not have a sense of loyalty to themselves. They were extremely vulgar stacks of hyenas that beat each other, crossed each other and even raped lesbians against other women in the film. <br /> <br /> Instead of being clever thieves who got stuck together to plan their escape and find a hidden supply of money, the escapees were too selfish and malicious to trust themselves for a long time. These women have not been liberated in a positive sense. It ended up being a bunch of loose cannons, unable to respect one another or each other. If you like crime movies from the 70's, skip this bomb and see the Big Grand Chase in Texas where Claudia Jennings and Jocelyn Jones play.
