Note that I gave this 1 star if the option would give me zero. When I put this DVD on the TV and sat on the couch, I was expecting the worst movie at its best. I looked at this movie on IMDb and saw that it was the worst movie, so I think I was critical of every mistake. But that did not prepare me for the shit that was supposed to come out of the TV screen. <br /> <br /> The box makes this movie look good at best. DO NOT ALLOW TO BECAUSE YOU. This movie must be banned on all shelves around the world. <br /> <br /> The best way I can describe this movie is pornography, but without any sex scenes. Acting (if you can call it that), "plot" (so many holes must look like Swiss cheese), and special effects are really just awful. <br /> <br /> Please, do not be like me and rent this movie because you think it will be fun to watch. <br /> <br /> After all, I'm not saying that I can make a better movie than this, but I think about it.
