This move reminded me of Tales from the Crypt Keeper. It's the same way people get what they deserve. I think it is always in the history of Crypt. The same applies to bad acting. It works very badly. I liked the film, knowing that most people did not like it and did not expect too much. Whenever I watch Stephen King's film, I do not expect much, because all of his films are awful compared to the genius of his novels. I read The Shining and Carrie and they were great books. I love how Carrie played as if it was a real story, and the whole book is a collection of reports and theories and the like. It was so good. But I noticed that both novels were not similar to films. The endings were very different from the film versions. From these two novels, I assume that all his novels are very much changed, and the endings are always tacky. The ending of Thinner is the worst. So tacky. I want to read a book to learn about the real ending. I suggest to all who intend to read Stephen King's novels to watch his films before the hand so that they can be compared. This way you will be very happy with the book. I'm going to do it with all of his novels that were made in movies. I'm sure if it were movies, they were really good books ... and the script went terribly wrong.
