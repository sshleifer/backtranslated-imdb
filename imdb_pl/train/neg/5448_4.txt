Doris Day never lets a bad script fail her. Even in the most difficult circumstances, the day gives 100% and usually goes unscathed. This comedy, perhaps inspired by a real black-out in New York in 1965, but actually adapted from the French art of Claude Magnier from the late 1950s, gives Doris little to do, but impersonates her own good image and, in the other half, be comically calmed (which is fun because of spin the day gives the situation). There are some funny lines here, but the spectrum of the material was obviously moved from the game ... and instead of inventing funny incidents in the Big Apple, we got stuck in the suburbs. Doris's co-workers (Patrick O'Neal, Robert Morse and Terry-Thomas) are not well-matched to her, as are the shapeless haircuts they wear. Still, it is not terrible, it has a few big laughs, and for lovers of Day-to-must-see. ** with ****
