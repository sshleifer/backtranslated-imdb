A dead girl's body was found, deprived of all possible means of identification. When it is discovered that one leg is longer than the other, it is assumed that it is the body of a missing daughter's pair. After this trauma, the couple splits, and the mother becomes addicted to sedatives and leads her unhappy existence. All this changes when one day, many years later, she receives a phone call from her daughter! With the help of a former police officer and a reporter, she sets off on a journey to determine if her daughter is alive. "Los Sin Nombre" is a mess in the style of fiction, moves at a painfully slow pace and is completely distrustful. Emma Vilarasau is a saving grace and she performs a great job as a desperate mother. The best part of the movie is the ending, but I'm not sure if it's worth the rest of the movie. Watch out for the English subtitles on the last version of R1 - they are not very accurate.
