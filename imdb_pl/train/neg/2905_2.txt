Expectations were quite high for me, when I went to see this movie, I finally thought that Steve Carell could not do anything bad, starting from great movies like Anchorman, The 40 Year-Old Virgin and Little Miss Sunshine. Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I'll start with what's right with this movie: Steve Carell can be Steve Health in some moments. There are a few moments in the movie that made me laugh, and that's almost entirely because I got a room to do my thing. He is undoubtedly a talented man and it is a pity that he signed a contract with what turned out to be, in my opinion, a complete train wreck. <br /> <br /> Of this I do not know, I will discuss what went terrifyingly wrong. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Dan Burns, a widower with three girls, which is taken into account in the national column of advice. He prepares his girls for a family reunion, where his distant relatives gather for a while. <br /> <br /> The family is high on the list of things that make this movie terrible. No family behaves this way. It's almost like being transported from Pleasantville or leave it to Beaver. They are a caricature of what we consider a family when we are 7. It achieves a point where it becomes unbearable and simply frustrating. Touch football, crosswords, family bowling and talent shows are NOT HOW TO SAVE THE TRUE PEOPLE. It's almost disgusting. <br /> <br /> Another big disadvantage is what a Carell woman is supposed to fall into. Watching her in the first scene with Steve Carell is like watching a stroke trying to redeem yourself. What I imagine to be unique and original in this woman is gentle. <br /> <br /> It makes me think that this movie is taking place on a different planet. I left the theater wondering what I just saw. After thinking, I do not think there will be a lot.
