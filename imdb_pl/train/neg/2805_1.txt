This adaptation positively sculpts a classic that loves its subtlety. Timothy Dalton has no idea about the various nuances of Rochester character. I have the impression that he never even read the book, he just stepped onto the stage in too tight breeches and was given a summary of the character that read: "Grumpy, broody, murky past. He plays Rochester not as a character or a real person, but as a superhuman who never smiles a smile until he becomes engaged when he miraculously turns into a pansy. There is no chemistry. The only feeling that this adaptation excites me is disbelief and also compassion for Charlotte Bronte, who certainly turns away in his grave. Go and BOOK A BOOK. ROCHESTER MA PERSONALITY. AND ON THE WAY: "PASSIONING" THE SCENE OF LOVE DOES NOT MEAN YOU HAVE YOU TO HER FACE.
