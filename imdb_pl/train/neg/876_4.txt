Until the last 20 minutes, I thought it was probably Jackie Chan's worst movie (with the exception of his work from before 1978, which I do not know). The final sequence of the fight changed everything: it is long, good and intense - indeed, one of Chan's main career highlights. But to get on with it, you have to sit through a lot of "comedies" that can entertain five-year-olds (oh, look, someone tossed the tomato in the face of this guy) and endless "balls." Not to mention dubbing (which contains the line "How can I turn it off? It's not a tap" - check what it refers to). "Dragon Lord" is worth renting only for the last fight, but the rest of the movie is only for collectors Jackie, and even only for those who have seen at least 15 other of their films. (**)
