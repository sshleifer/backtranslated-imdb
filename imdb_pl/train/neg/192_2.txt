The only good part of this movie is the beautiful scenery. This movie was long and boring. The minister should have left the pulpit when his son Pawe≈Ç wandered from the teachings he preached. How many times have his boys in vain taken the name of the Lord in this film from the Presbyterian background? It does not fit. I regretted that Paul had not been swept down the river without a boat at the very beginning to spare us Paul's stupid, humorous, selfish story (Brad Pitt). Norm becomes a teacher, and Paul becomes a compulsive gambler who Norm wants to save, but he does not. It's very uninteresting. We see prejudiced whites whom Paul opposed because of his native American girlfriend. It was the only part that aroused some interest and perhaps it could have been transformed into a real "wild western". We see only a sleepy city in which the sons of two ministers have nothing to do, but 1. Norms chase a lame girl and cope with the family 2. Paul makes up stupid stories in the newspaper store, scratching his head and taking a lot of swans and bind a lot of flies. I'd rather watch a fishing program that this movie will not happen again.
