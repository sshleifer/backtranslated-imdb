The film took after the remake of previous years with the army creating equipment for electronic surveillance in the desert, where the attacks in the first film took place. The crew are killed shortly before the arrival of a group of soldiers who do not find anyone nearby. You can fill the rest. <br /> <br /> This is a photo of payment around. It seems that there is no passion in someone's performance or in anybody behind the camera. It's a movie that's made for money and nothing more. At some level this should work, it could have been more frightening Southern Comfort (where the National Guards are struggling with some people in the swamps), but not much of it. To a large extent, you can blame the script, written in part by Wes Craven, who goes through the same old goals again and again. Add to the clutter the fact that the direction is boring, and the sequence setting is so weak to remove any inherent tension in any scene. <br /> <br /> It's not that bad but it's badly done and dull. Let me present my feelings in the context: The reason why I saw this movie was the fact that the local multiplex has screwed up and started this movie instead of the children's movie "Last Mimzy" and wanted to see what caused this scream much in common - he says sarcastically). I am convinced that this movie will only scared those who like the last Mimzy.
