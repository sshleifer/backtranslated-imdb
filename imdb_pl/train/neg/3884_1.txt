Many moons ago, when I was seven years old, I remember that I remember seeing the trailer of this movie. This appealed to my naive sense of curiosity and I decided to ask my parents to take me to this film. As wise adults, they told me: "Absolutely not! It's a handful of rubbish. " Of course, I was very disappointed that I would not be the first child in my block to see "Incredible Melting Man." <br /> <br /> It's been a while - maybe a few days. I forgot about "The Incredible Melting Man" and my disappointment disappeared. Twenty-five years have passed before she was at the forefront of my thoughts again. While surfing the channels on a digital cable, I found this long-lost movie relic. My curiosity was delighted and I finally decided to take part in this fruit forbidden by my parents. I should have listened to them. "Incredible Melting Man" is probably the worst film known to man. He makes films such as "Def-Con 4", "Metalstorm" and "Freddie Got Fingered", which look like Oscar nominations. primitive even in 1977. How anyone convinced the film company to produce this film outside of me. <br /> <br /> Do not make the same mistake as me. Listen to your parents if they forbade you to watch this movie. They were right.
