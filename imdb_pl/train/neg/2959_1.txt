No matter what someone tells you, there is the word "possession" in the film circles - for example, "what has possessed you to show this movie?" Religion has nothing to do with it, but common sense does. That is, if your head is clean and you have a reasonable mind to make an assessment. <br /> <br /> On many levels I tried to rationalize where this movie will be entertainment ... or even interest the average consumer. Star? History? A unique idea? A buddy movie that kids would love a dinosaur and a black woman? Oh my God! I'm sure when it was an "idea" it sounded good. But somewhere in the process of development ... someone should point out where the idea can not translate into entertainment, for which someone would like to watch or pay ... unless they were very deeply under the influence of alcohol or drugs and saw something that the rest of us did not she saw. <br /> <br /> Regardless, this is a complete mess. Clutter, mess - sin and mess. <br /> <br /> Who cares about the conspiracy (what plot?) and others Whoopie got the payout, but I would be ashamed to take it. I hope that she fired her agent / manager / columnist during this career. Of course no, she made more bad movies. And more bad movies. Sad.
