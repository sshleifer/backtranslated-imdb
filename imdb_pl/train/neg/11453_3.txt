This movie is one of the worst comedy movies I've ever seen. I hate these ripples of Napoleon Dynamite. Just face the people already stupid humor has been mastered. Do something new at once. All these new comedies are simply awful. And the exit from SNL Andy Samberg is not ready for the main role yet. I hope he can come back from this awful movie. And whether Arnett's character is simply evil. Hey Will, did you read the script. The plot is really the worst that has ever been written. Now tell me if it's weird. (This is a movie) Dad's father Rob Kimble dies, and the family needs $ 50,000 to pay for heart surgery, so Rod plans this huge leap to raise money for Frank. Only so that Rod can defeat Frank in the fight and prove his masculinity. Yes, this movie, you tell me, you would spend $ 7.00 to see this piece of nonsense! <br /> <br /> 3/10 only horrible <br /> <br /> -adam
