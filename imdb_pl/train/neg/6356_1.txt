If I accidentally came across this script in text form, I would read it and laugh. I would not, however, laugh at the fragments of the film in which the director would like me to laugh. Although I'm still not entirely sure where they are. I do not care if it's Woody Allen, this writer can not write dialogues, or at least can not consciously write dialogue, and then draw performances of actors capable of drawing laughter from even the most sensitive clowns. For example: <br /> <br /> (paraphrase) "I'm an art historian, I'm looking for a job in an art gallery". <br /> <br /> OK, that's true, but honestly, do you know art historians who would say that? How would you answer? <br /> <br /> "Really? Art Gallery? Who would have thought it? "<br /> <br /> The whole scenario is full of littered quasi-intellectualism that I would not expect from such a respected figure writer. I admit that I do not know about Allen's other work and judging by that, I do not want to learn. Characters are revolting without exception, an attempt to illustrate that we all suffer from human condition? Or maybe a really poor character? You will be a judge.
