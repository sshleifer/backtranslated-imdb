I do not attach too much importance to the conspiracy theory of AIDS, but it is sociologically interesting to see the phenomenon dramatized. In the early years of the AIDS epidemic, suffering and paranoia of frightened and dying people often caused such dark fantasies. This was especially true for politically radical and extreme sexually demons San Francisco. The city, known for its beauty, rarely seemed uglier than in this film. The sense of darkness and decay permeates every scene. <br /> <br /> Although you can not say that acting and the plot are well done, the unique cultural context of the movies and the oppressively dark mood at least partly save the film from being a total loss. Actually, the most interesting spectacle was Irit Levi as a crisp and cynical Jewish, lesbian (?) Police detective. It is interesting, although not necessarily convincing. <br /> <br /> The most interesting: the film using the flashy tragic Turandot is an effective motif and is a sophisticated silent episode by the cult performer, Ron Athey.
