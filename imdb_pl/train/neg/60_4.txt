I like Goldie Hawn and I wanted one more of her movies, so when I saw the $ 5.50 Protocol in Walmart, I bought it. Although the movie is a bit funny, the movie never does it. Some scenes, such as a party scene in a bar, take too long and really have no purpose. <br /> <br /> Then, of course, at the end of the movie there is a preach scene that gives the whole thing when it comes to me, make a bad taste. I do not think this scene will ever join the movie. I do not like stupid comedies trying to teach me a lesson, written by some 60's burned out especially! <br /> <br /> In the end, although I'm happy to have another Hanna movie, I'm not really really worth the money I paid for it!
