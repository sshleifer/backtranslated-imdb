I should explain why I gave this ... "work of art" 1 asterisk 10. It's simply because it's difficult to judge it as objective. It would probably be the same if I gave him 10/10 - and that would be the explanation. <br /> <br /> I do not like these meaningless movies, such as HOSTEL or so - I think it's disgusting horrible (in all possible contextual meanings), but as I learned after watching this movie - there is a genre called "drama" historical "- and it would probably be a 10/10 case, because it has a lot of it and Tarantino would be more than happy (and made Kill Bill 3 spill more blood on the screen than here to show that it's possible). but the genre of "historical dramas" is that it is a sub-category of "junk movies" in which John Romero is an undead-emperor-spy and therefore automatically can not be rated as the default movie - because they are films deliberately done deliberately and not you can really tell if the comically bad moment was supposed to be that or if it was just bad. it's for people who like to play badly, bad script and everything else. And by some return of faith - I am also one of them. There are days when I feel like seeing a really bad movie and looking for trash, and you're going - the day is saved! but this is definitely my opinion and does not suit anyone else. <br /> <br /> I wanted to say that if you want to watch a terrible movie - Casanova Fellini is definitely a choice, but listen to my advice and do not judge it by default.
