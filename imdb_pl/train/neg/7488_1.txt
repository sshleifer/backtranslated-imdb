Anyone who has seen the original 1970 movie knows how a great cast, screenplay and director can create a comedy masterpiece. For the same reason, it's easy to see how the opposite can create another bland boredom from Hollywood! This movie was pathetic! If it was not for John Cleese (comical genius), I would have left this terrible waste of celluloid for about 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> Neil Simon would not write another scenario for this version (he said he could not correct the first one), and I'm surprised that after this film fiasco he would not have slandered humor! <br /> <br /> Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis have done such a great job original, what were the producers thinking when they threw this one? How could the director and editor have a look at these scenes and believe that any of them were funny? I do not know, but one thing I know - it is not surprising why foreign and independent films are becoming more and more popular .......
