As has been said countless times, "The Hills Have Eyes 2" is NOT a remake of (unscarred) parts of the second half of the 80s original Wes Craven from 1977. But wanting to give this postmodernist sequel a remake of the official Diminishing Returns stamp, Craven himself (double threat together with his son, Jonathan) decided to write a film of the same quality - in English, awful. Former director of music videos Martin Weisz takes over from Alexandre Aja and is clearly over his head - but he wonders how anyone could create a movie to watch from the screen of Cravens writing 101 scribbles. Not only the heroes (in this case, the gang of National Guard gangsters (wo) sent to explore the hills of the original remake) are completely unbearable and susceptible to really annoying genre traps (played without a bit of irony, remember), but they still spoil the jokes that they are not funny. After seeing their total ineptitude during training, their fate against repulsive, wandering cannibals is painfully obvious. Only this time - as in the original continuation of the 80s - the script is so simplified (actually does not exist) that any potential subtext is rejected in favor of raising the rate in repulsive shocks (we treat us as a combo - say during the initial subtitles, and also free rape for those who have not put the DVD in the middle! Even the mutants in this tour are personalityless freaks without a memorable posture - cheesy, rubbery FX make-up, like the rest of the movie, try to hide your face from embarrassment. "Surprise" at the end of the great movie Aji, and producers quite literally broke out at the end of "Hills 2", setting the stage - VERY lam stage - on the third installment ... and yet Cravens and Weisz created a movie that is such a cynical bastardization of this , which meant that the 1977/2006 versions worked that it would be difficult to find a pub number after this offensive face hit.
