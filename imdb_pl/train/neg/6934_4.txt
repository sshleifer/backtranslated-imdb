OK, so of course ppl thought it was a good movie in 1955. <br /> <br /> I feel sorry for fools who think so ... His absolute trash. <br /> <br /> History is simply. .. funny. The heroes are absurd caricatures - but this movie is not meant for satire, I'm sure it's supposed to be a serious drama, right? <br /> <br /> Dean and others are too old for their parts. People say that Dean is great in this movie and maybe he played his role as well as he could. His character is to be 16 or 17 years old. But Dean was a 24-year-old man when he made the movie. Seeing him tormenting and throwing mockery like a four-year-old boy ... his pathetic. <br /> <br /> Natalie Wood is great, but the early scenes at the police station where she cries and complains are very unconvincing. This creates a bad precedent for the film ... and for the rest, you feel crumpled every time one of those badly preserved emotional scenes appears. <br /> <br /> It could have been good for his time, but, really, his drivel. <br /> <br /> It must have been a buzz about Dean's death, which overstated the movie's reputation.
