Why would anyone return to a person who kicks them in their teeth, not once, not twice, but over and over. <br /> <br /> This film teaches us that to find love, we must accept abuse (not only forgive but accept it fully). Ooops! No wonder my first relationship lasted only ten years. Of course, I did not embrace my inner masochist. <br /> <br /> As Bucatinsky's literary debut there are many great aspects of this film; However, to justify the re-enactment of Eli and Tom, the character's development would be more helpful. We are never familiar with Eli's masochism, in fact we are convinced that he is not a masochist, although Tom's psycho-emotional sadism is very visible.
