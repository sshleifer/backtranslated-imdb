This is a bad B masquerade movie as a mockumentary. The documentary film in the movie has almost as much time on the screen and dialogues as every other character. It completely destroyed all the "documentary feelings" that they might want to create. <br /> <br /> The fact that a movie is not really a document is the smallest of problems. The film is not funny. The film is not sexy. The film has nothing important to say about the porn industry. It's not even polite. While sex is simulated, the amount of nudity is mild for a movie with an R. rating. <br /> <br /> One day someone will make a good document about the porn industry. It is not it.
