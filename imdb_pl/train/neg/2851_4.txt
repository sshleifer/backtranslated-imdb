There are often badly chosen couples (in the general sense of the word) - in Huston's films: "African Queen" "Heaven knows Mister Allison" "roots of Heaven" "Misfits" ... "The Barbarian and the geisha" (check the title) another good example, so to speak. It seems that Japanese things were fashionable at the time, because such works as "Sayonara" "world of Suzie Wong" and "teahouse moon tea" testify to this. Huston's effort may be the worst of this rather bad fate (except perhaps "Susie"). John Wayne fits the Ford world perfectly, in Huston he is like a bull in a china shop. His Japanese partner is completely bland. dramatic scenes (cholera epidemic) do not save the film from absolute boredom. <br /> <br /> Only those who are completely in love with every Hustin work, have to choose this movie from all their great movies.
