When I started watching this movie, I saw a guy from Buffy, Xander, and I thought how nice he was still making a living by playing movies. Now a strange movie that I can bear, considering that it is a good dose of strange, such as David Lynch's films, twin peaks, lost highway etc. And you have to be in the mood for one. This one, however, caused me to mention sneering about crazy pages about conspiracy theories that have absolutely no sense. I mean the Nazi people who are plotting with America to create a godless trinity of evil powers? I was surprised that they did not mention the empty earth in this movie with Hitler's flying saucers and lizard people. Maybe if you had 60 grams of the heroine with this movie, it would make sense, but seriously I do not tolerate drugs, as if I did not tolerate this film. It should be burnt, torn and forgotten, so a good Xander can get another acting job. It was not his acting, it was okay, but the script just did not make sense. Excuse me.
