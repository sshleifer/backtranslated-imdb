pokemon movie was a terrible movie. unlike the first, it's not a good movie. the graphics were decent, but the story was flat and no real drama arose. in the first interaction between the characters was decent. subtracting brocka and adding tracey was bad. tracey does not really have much to say or do, and unlike brock, it does not offer comic relief. The only good side is that you see a vague creature that becomes gelatinous over ash, and her early thought of being called her girlfriend was fun. in general, the movie is not worth renting, and the short film has not done anything for me or my wife before. and we consider ourselves to be pokemon fans. Well, maybe the next one will be better
