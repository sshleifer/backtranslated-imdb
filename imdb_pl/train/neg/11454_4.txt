So I had low expectations for this movie, but I could not fulfill it. While there were some funny parts, even one or two laughing loud parties, this movie was terribly out of what I would call good. the funniest jokes were unexpected and very fast, leaving us sitting "WTF just happened?" and there were some jokes that just stretched and lasted. the part in which she fell to the top, yawning me. also the editorial staff really missed. there were some weak transitions between scenes, but now it seems to be a style. It made me laugh, but I would not watch it again and I am very happy that I was waiting for him to borrow it. give him a chance, you can enjoy him, but do not think that you want something like a 40-year-old virgin or Superbad.
