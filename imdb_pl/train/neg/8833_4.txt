No fault of the actors (everyone had a great time) the general story was not very well done. The film begins with a great zinger: a crazy old guy forcing a young Aboriginal girl's car off the road. But then we are forced to endure 40 minutes of character development with a whole new group of characters ... and we do not know why until 40 minutes have passed. It turns out that they finally discover the girl's body ... and the story grows. <br /> <br /> When the story is raised at this moment, it really does not go. After 2 hours I asked myself: was there anything important in it, or did they just see how the characters are struggling with accusations of racism and stupidity, how did they deal with the discovery? The story was ultimately unsatisfactory and unfinished. Although it is well-preserved, there is not enough strong skeleton in the film to guarantee its recommendation.
