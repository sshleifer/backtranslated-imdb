Despite the good reviews, I just had to give this film a chance? after all, it is HK's super-babe Shu Qi plus six other oriental charms as a team of versatile burglars. Are you sure to check it out? Well, as babe-festes are going, it's hard to beat Martial Angels. Eye candy is of the highest quality. Shu Qi looks as fantastic as ever, and the rest of the girls, Rosemary Vandebrouck and Amanda Strang, have especially caught my wandering eye. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, if someone is to judge this film on the basis of other possible merits, it is an absolute stench! The story is poor, the action is tacky, and the special effects are pathetic. Director Clarence Fok and producer Wong Jing gave us a photogenic cast and not much more. <br /> <br /> If Shu Qi is the only reason you are considering watching this, it would be better to watch Sex and Zen 2 again!
