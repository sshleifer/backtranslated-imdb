Unless the title is supposed to be a spoiler for the transformation of a wife (devils, they ruin it for us). Anycase, if this film was not a Made-For-TV movie, it should be so low, uncomplicated, unfinished and hits every seventy years except for the discotheque. Nobody is sympathetic, and you can carelessly what happens to someone in this. Very forgotten, with the exception of bad, bad performances.
