I wanted to see it when I saw the absurd poster of MEATBALLS and I realized that it must be the best satire in history. What a genius idea for satire - the genre is rich. Unfortunately, the finished product (I think all involved probably realize this) is a catalog of lost opportunities, performances not fully available and (fortunately!) A few extremely funny, inspired bits. Janeane Garafolo, who is very striking, looks really bad here, probably because she can not stand her role. David Hyde Pierce is just sad looking, trying to be fun and looking like Castro's gull. Molly Shannon is so funny, just seeing her makes you laugh, but somehow her segment does not get something hysterical. Paul Rudd had great teenage manners and he was sexy as hell, the other boys are really funny (you're more nervous). I think the problem is that the director does not move things at the right pace. It starts very unceremoniously and it sets up monotony. But when it allows things to become really outrageous (the drug sequence is the second most ridiculous moment I've had all year in the movies, the first one that appeared in a lame movie: Andrea Martin in ALL OVER, THE GUEST REFLECTS IN & OUT) it's just funny. I wanted this movie to work so badly, but simply not. Clothes and styling for 1981 are PERFECT in 99.9%, and very few songs are perfect. This ends with a medium-bad TV episode of MAD along with frustratingly long sketches.
