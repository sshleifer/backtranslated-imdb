As a mother of two young children who grew up in connection with Scooby's many reincarnations, I feel well prepared to comment on the historical and current version of Scooby. <br /> <br /> If we did not see any episodes before Shaggy as a family, and Scooby saw that we could enjoy it as a light, nothing special Saturday cartoon. But basically the problem is that in the current format it is so light that it will not have the longevity of the "old" Scooby and gang. I am sure that this can bring a quick monetary return, but I am sure that the long-term focus of old and young people is very real. My 6-year-old son, seeing the new version, was really unhappy and without any hints he said it looks really badly animated and why it was not like the last series (Where are you). <br /> <br /> Tied up Doo was an anomaly, but still infinitely better. Let us hope that the key will be apropos for producers.
