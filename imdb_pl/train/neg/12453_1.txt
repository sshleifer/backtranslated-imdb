I've always been a big fan of Lynda Carter-Wonder Woman, so when Sci-Fi Channel launched this movie, I had to see it. I was bitterly disappointed. This is just Wonder Woman. the right costume [she had to refuse or ordered serious changes], and the storyline runs like a James Bond from a poor man. Nothing that made the heroine of the comic book a success, or superhuman strength or determined will. bad dream. I do not think Cathy is so attractive anyway. I would not waste time.
