Tara Reid as an intellectual, Christian Slater (usually great) as a shop with dollars Constantine and Stephen Dorff as ... well, it's STEPHEN DORFF FOR CHRIST SAKE !!!! Personally, I would like to thank the genius directors for their hard work and effort. You are on a horse. Here's the idea, just my humble, modest opinion that the film will be publicly available, but it results directly from previous elections, the film about the most brilliant neuro-physicist in history invents one pill to cure all diseases known to man, clinker, in which must be played by Jessica Simpson and Paris Hilton. I knew you would like it. Seriously, but you owe me $ 7.50.
