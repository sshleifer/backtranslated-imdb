I wonder what Pierce Brosnan's career looked like before Bond appeared on stage. In this "tense" thriller Pierce Brosnan plays a gentle Patrick, who leads children from the ghetto on "confidence courses". He loves a woman who has a typical mop boy in the mid-90s named Eric. The drunken husband of the woman soon appears on the stage and begins to play with Pierce. <br /> <br /> At some stage Pierce innocently creates "vegetarian". The husband comes in. Pierce resumes making vegetables. Then the husband attacks Pierce. Small pieces of a half-eaten vegetarian call fall from Pierce's mouth. The fight suddenly ends without showing the result. It's as good as a movie. <br /> <br />
