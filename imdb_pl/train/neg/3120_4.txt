I really expected little from "The Night Listener" and I never really heard about it until I saw the cover in the video. However, the film is very effective when it comes to building suspension and tension. Sometimes it's a bit of a drag, but it actually helps you wonder what will happen, and more importantly: when. As the film progresses, the character played by Robin Williams is dragged into some kind of "cat and mouse" until he is obsessed with the truth and existence of a 14-year-old abused child whom no one has ever seen in person. The Night Listener is an interesting story that is great for building tension throughout the movie and you're almost in the dark of who's lying and what's real. In the end, however, it disappoints and can not cope with the potential it could have. It really does not give a detailed or credible explanation about the second main character, which would be helpful and interesting.
