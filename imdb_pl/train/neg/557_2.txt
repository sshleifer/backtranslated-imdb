It's hard to believe, after 14 years of waiting, we finish with this piece of cinema rubbish. The original was a dark thriller, which achieved the status of "cult", demonstrating the art of cinema directed by Paul Verhoeven. This movie does not add anything, does not provide anything, and eventually ends up in a huge box of unsuccessful sequels. <br /> <br /> The opening sequence could trigger an intriguing set of story events using a very talented and capable cast. Unfortunately, we're being treated for a 90-minute trial in the indulgent life of Catherine Tramell ... whether it's Sharon Stone. Probably copulation of both. <br /> <br /> If the desire is also visible, continue the sensually provocative style of sex, as in "B.S.1", forget about it. You'll end up with boredom with soft porn that eventually supports the old saying that a woman can be more voluptuous in clothes than with them. It is interesting that the great Charlotte Rampling was playing at her skivvies through GEORGY GIRL from 1966, when Mrs. Stone was only 8 years old. A very talented actress and quite adept at keeping her even here. <br /> <br /> If you're a real cinema fan, you need to see this movie and evaluate it using your own rating system. If not, you may as well wait for a DVD in the "evaluated" version, "invaluable" version, "collector's" version or "final" version, and maybe for the next 14 years we will be saturated with "Basic Instinct 3" news at the moment Stone will be 62 years old and nobody cares.
