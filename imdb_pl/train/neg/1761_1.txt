First of all, I realize that the rating "1" is to be reserved for the worst of the worst. This film comes from me because, as one of the reviewers notes, it's not bad in the self-aware, over-upper way that may allow it to have some comic or cultic value. It just does not hit every meter. ** Includes possible spoilers ** The dialog box is completely disingenuous. Continuity is so thought-out that it is painful. Daniel just ends talking about his lost love, and his last word begins to dance flamenco. The shocking shock of her name (see? I do not remember even the name of her character, let alone the forgotten actress) when her husband (Baldwin) first tells her that her friend is a bad guy. The car and motorcycle rides did everything you could. Vegetable carts left. Cars collide with each other. Motorcycles going down the stairs. People are almost hit, but what's interesting is that nobody is there. Oh, right ... except for one guy who was stabbed several times, apparently stumbling over the curb with knife wounds, and the approaching car apparently did not notice him there. Hmmm. <br /> <br /> It's becoming more and more unusual for me to be able to make such films. In the film industry there is so much pressure to make money, one would think that someone in Hollywood would think about making good movies worth seeing. Now is a new idea. <br /> <br /> My suggestion: do not watch this movie. Do not rent a DVD. Do not watch it on the cable. There are many other things you can do that will make you feel happier.
