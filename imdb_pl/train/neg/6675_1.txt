Just passed the weekend and watched "28 weeks later", which was very good. Then I watched the movie. <br /> <br /> I told you that this is one of the most boring so-called horror movies you can watch. The scenes were unreal, there was no script or plot. The alien being was unreal. And the battle scenes are mild compared to the school fight in the yard. To make matters worse, the guy named Cody had an uncontrollable, disgusting tongue that distracts attention from the main movie. <br /> <br /> Forget about this movie; rather go and watch 28 weeks later. <br /> <br /> Regards, Mesake C.
