Why are I watching such films? - besides, I have a strange, erroneous, masochistic belief that one day I will find a true jewel among all this slag, I can not come up with one good reason. This movie was slag from start to finish - but half-fun slag. Elsewhere, but in a bad Italian movie with dubbing, you can find a hot exchange of surreal, scarred English, such as this one between an honest military type and the sinister boss of a secret organization of X files, whose purpose is to hide "Prawdy": <br /> <br / > Man in black: Silence is the best for us until we can prove that UFOs do not have warlike motives. <br /> <br /> Military type: In any case, I consider your interference to be offensive. <br /> <br /> Man in black: whoever has to impose his will. <br /> <br /> I've rewound the DVD (you know what I mean) a good half a dozen times and I still can not make these lines mean anything reasonable. My second favorite line was: <br /> <br /> "We can be quite heavy for those who oppose our interests." <br /> <br /> It's English Jim, but not as we know it. <br /> <br /> Other attractions of this boring filmmaker for me were completely spaced figures of the photographer at the beginning. Carried by the worst haircut EVER in the history of everything, the man simply wandered around looking like a stunned fish in a bad wig, until he was kidnapped and forced to see a piece of plexiglass by strangers. The most effective aliens are not seen as a post-shot - a hand-held camera with a fisheye lens - a ghostly type the first time, but used again and again lost its power (incidentally, if it is a shot from the point of view), it means that aliens always for some reason they come out of the rooms backwards. <br /> <br /> The movie has been set in England. This meant that the Spanish Italian set designers had put a few British license plates on several English cars and put Union Jack on the press card of our hero ... and that was it. No other attempt to make it look like the United Kingdom. <br /> <br /> Favorite moment? When Foley's artists did not notice that the characters they were playing (is there such a word?), They did not walk on the gravel, but they were now on the lawn, so their feet loudly "crunch!". sounds. Besides, another total loss of 90 minutes of my life. I hope that they will prove that these UFOs no longer have militant motives ...
