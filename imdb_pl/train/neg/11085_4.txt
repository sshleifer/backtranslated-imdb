TYSON <br /> <br /> Image format: 1.33: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: Stereo <br /> <br /> Feel - though scrupulously fair - description of the life and times of boxing champ Mike Tyson. Given his belief in the accusation of rape, the movie is careful not to portray him as a hero or villain, but presents a warty portrait of his rise to fame, pressure of success and people who have shaped his destiny or bad. Restrained by time constraints, the scenario gallops through further important details, omitting briefly important events, culminating in the (temporary) fall of Tyson in 1995. - a preliminary approach to the material. It depicts Tyson's life as a circus in which he was ultimately led astray by the circumstances of his own success. In fact, the scenario contains most of the venom of Tyson's ex-wife, Robin Givens, characterizing her as an ungrateful gold seeker who took advantage of his naivety. The production values ​​are uniformly solid and the cast is excellent: Michael Jai White imitates the title character well; George C. Scott plays mentor Tyson Cus D'Amato through the acres of clenched teeth; and Paul Winfield certainly was born to play Don King!
