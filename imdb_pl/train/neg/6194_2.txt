With the title "borrowed" from Werner Herzog and the liberal help of Kubrick, Haneke and Noe, it is painfully obvious that Thomas Clay regards himself as above the ordinary rubbish that our British cinema throws. "Robert Carmichael" (in short) becomes a realistic study of youthful alienation and at the same time seemingly a critique of the Iraq war. The problem with realism is that the characters are so unrealistic and unusual - in contrast to the stinking images of "extreme" filmmakers, most teenagers are not drug addicts. As a critic of the Iraq war, the film about youth violence (a talented classical musician - an overtext society destroyed this sensitive person) is so infantile that it is difficult to think about it. There are signs of technical ability, but some reviewers overstate this. Like Kubrick and Noe, he shows that the desire for shock associated with the alleged serious intention may be the worst film scam in the last movie. People liked "Mechanical Orange" and "Irrevocable" because they liked rapes and violence, but above all they liked to feel culturally better for liking the most hated things. Too much Kubrick and too little Haneke (a serious and moral filmmaker) calls it one of the most idle movies for years. (I'm not against violence in the film.) Doing this seriously is a tricky trick - people in cinemas cheered Alex in "Clockwork Orange", showing how Kubrick's implied intention was omitted in a number of ways than the pretensions of many film directors.)
