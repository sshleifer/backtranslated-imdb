The trailer of this movie interested me enough to guarantee DVD rental. However, the resulting film is absolutely tragic! Admittedly, this is not the worst film ever made, nor the worst film of the year, but it came in damn close! <br /> <br /> The main problem is that the movie does not know what it wants to be: comedy, adult drama, thriller, teen-porn? The story is interesting because it concerns mail order brides' traps, but the movie is a mess. What begins as a slightly interesting "comedy" (the word I use in the easiest of times) goes completely back and turns into a very dark and unpalatable misogynist thriller. Nicole Kidman should know better, and Ben Chaplin is wasted! Like Matthieu Kassovitz and Vincent Cassel, about which I can only assume that they did it for money. <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie in almost every aspect. It's not funny, it's almost sexist, you can almost forgive Benny Hill for everything he did, and the dramatic elements are just nasty. A movie to avoid unless you must see Kidman or Chaplin in each of your movies!
