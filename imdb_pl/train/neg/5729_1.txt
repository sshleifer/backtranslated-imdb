It must be the worst movie ever !!! Acting is more frightening than a movie. A lot of blood, but I have no idea where it comes from, because they do not even show you cuts. I can not believe I wasted my time watching this movie. We laughed as if we were watching a comedy, not a horror movie. It's a disgrace to horror movies !!! First of all, if they are in Asia, why is there a white policeman who drives past the rubbish bin ?! There is so much different language that you do not even know what's going on in half. Editing a movie is a joke, my teenager can do better. And if I went to the cinema and that nasty old man was working on the window, that would be the first clue. DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM !!! DO NOT SEE WHAT IT IS, YOU WILL SUCK YOU THAT YOU WERE !!
