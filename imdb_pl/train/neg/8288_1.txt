It is a pity that Alan Clarke must be associated with this flak. This, however, does not exclude; Gather a group of boys and a couple of Stellas, and feel how this whale spins and turns on the floor with tears of laughter. Great wasted things for the night. Al Hunter lives in a well-publicized topic from the late 1980s - the hooligans were well organized and not interested in football alone - often with decent work (real estate agent ???). But how can Clarke convince us that each of the two actors who have left other low-quality television productions (Grange Hill) or will soon end up in poor-quality drama (Eastenders) can convince us for a nanosecond that they are a difficult football bandits are funny . Are we really to believe that ICF (on which, of course, the drama is based) EVER go to another city to fight with just six boys? <br /> <br /> ICF will push subway stations and similar HUNTERS. Andy Nicholls' Scally has to be read before he even considers this kind of story. Acting is frightening and assures the majority of laughter - Oldman is such a camp that it's unbelievable. Most of them look like they should be in Mr Matey's bubble bath. A real inspiration for anyone with a digital video camera that thinks they can do it quickly.
