I liked this show! I think there was nothing wrong with that! Only that Spidey does not punch anyone, but only because the show is not good for nothing! Some people think that this program is bad because of this. The story was great and it was fun when other heroes appeared, such as X-men, The Punisher, Daredevil and Iron Man! Bad Sandman will never appear, but I like it! The best Spidey show ever !! My favorite episodes are: 1. Turning Point 2. Spider Wars 3. Hobgoblin 4. The Alien Costume 5. Mutant Agenda <br /> <br /> But there are some episodes that were really bad, such as: Rocket Racer and The A place that was difficult to watch. And I do not like Morbius and Hydro Man. The first of Morbiusa sucks the plasma instead of blood and I do not like vampires. It annoys me that he was almost the main villain in season 2. Of course I have to mention Hydro Man! He was terrible! I rather see Sandman! His last appearance was so horrible. And I do not like Spidey as a Spider Man! <br /> <br /> But probably everything was bad!
