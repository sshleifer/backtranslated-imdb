This film was recommended to me by a friend living in California. She thought it was wonderful because it was so real: "Just people in the Ohio Valley!" I'm from this area and I've experienced this movie as "just the way people in California think we are!" I lived in Marietta and Parkersburg and I worked there on the basis of the minimum wage. We laughed a lot, joined up and made breaks with people of our age; young people went out together at night. Older people had little free time after work because they looked after their families. The area is beautiful in the summer and it is no more dark in winter rain than anywhere else. <br /> <br /> In addition to "if you live in a production house, you have to be depressed" patronizing, the story lacks any elements of charm, mystery and even a sense of fear. <br /> <br /> Martha was the worst character. It is doubtful that someone so repressed would belong to the church, but if it did, she would probably be friends with him. I have read the reviews that seem to assume that Martha was jealous of Rose, because Rose was "younger, prettier and thinner", but if it is, it is not shown. We only see that Martha learns not to like Rose for reasons that would apply the same if three friends were of the same age and gender. We see that Martha feels left out during the smoking session, absent in the loop, when social plans are created, used, but underestimated, and finally neglected and abused. <br /> <br /> One more thing: are we supposed to suspect Kyle of murder because he once had several panic attacks? Please. In this way, the stigma against mental illness is at a new level.
