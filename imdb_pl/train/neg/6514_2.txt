The film tries to be a mockumentary - filmed in a documentary form, but with many obvious parts of the script - but it fails to provide the public with any figures that could create an illusion of mockumentary. The film also aims to find true love in Los Angeles, but it is nothing more than an uninteresting view of an amateur filmmaker who is trying to make his first "big movie".
