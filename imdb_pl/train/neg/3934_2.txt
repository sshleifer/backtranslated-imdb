We were waiting to watch this movie and see these great actors. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the script and the entire story of this story. David Duchovny, (Dr. Eugene Sands), "Connie and Carla", "04, was a doctor in history, who uses drugs and loses the right to practice as a doctor. Dr Sands visited the nightclub and was able to use his medical experience to help the injured client. He was assisted by Angelina Jolie (Claire), "Taking Lives" 04, who immediately became interested in Dr. David Sands. Timothy Hutton, (Raymond Blossom), "Kinsey", "04", playing Big Shot Gangster and a man with all kinds of money and calls. Timothy Hutton seems to be exaggerating in most scenes and disappears completely from his thoughts, trying to stop gang members from dying. Gary Dourdan, (Yates), "CSI-Vegas TV Series", plays a great supporting role and presents the real COOL DUDE, which is the so-called body guard Raymond Blossom. Angelina Jolie looks beautiful and sexy with her ruby ​​mouths that attract the attention of all men. This movie is not the best, but entertains.
