Recently, I had the pleasure of watching the fun comedy Bachelor Party, one of my favorite comedies, I laughed until I just hurt the type of movies. So naturally I wanted to see the sequel, hoping it would be the same laugh, but instead Bachelor Party 2: The Last Temptation is the work of the American Pie generation, where it's tasteless and overcomes the purpose of the first movie. Yes, the first movie has nudity, but it does not appear in every scene. Also, the plot is exactly the same from the first, it is not always a complaint with me, but it could have been a bit more original. The only thing is that I'm glad that the film does not show at least the old actors from the original, because it would be a tacky or really stupid look. <br /> <br /> Ron and Melinda are engaged two months of dating, everyone is against it. Melinda has a rich family, but are very pleased with Ron and Melinda's brother, Todd is afraid Ron will take his job. So they're going to Miami for a bachelor party this weekend, and Todd will make sure he imprison Ron in the picture that will make Melinda change her mind about marriage. <br /> <br /> Bachelor Party 2: The Last Temptation has a couple laughing here and there, but most of all it does not deliver what the first movie made. These guys, Ron's friends, were more annoying than sympathetic, except for Seth, he was a bit funny. The only nice characters other than Seth is Ron and Melinda, everyone else just more or less nervously. Do you want to watch this movie? Just watch Girls Gone Wild, same, but do not try to pretend it's a movie. Stick to the original stag party, it's a movie that will lead you to tears of laughter. <br /> <br /> 3/10
