Umm .. I was very surprised that someone really gave this film high marks. <br /> <br /> Let's face it ... Tori Spelling is not a great actress ... and this movie only proves her talent "The plot of the film was poor ... I bet that dork who came up with this idea, he was some pervert voyeur. If there's something good about this movie, I'd say it's Tommy Chong's daughter, just because he's his daughter ... and then it's that the male soap opera leader who looks decent makes him attractive, but he stops help his dramatic abilities. * Why does IMDb require at least 10 lines? How much more can you say "This movie sucks"?
