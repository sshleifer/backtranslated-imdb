It was just awful. I read the book to school, I did As at all tests and saw it that way! My teacher forced me and 20 other people to watch him and it was worse than Leonard Part 6, Plan 9 with Outer Space and Hudson Hawk put together. What made this movie so terrible was enough to kill you. First of all, it was made on Hallmark. Second, the acting was terrible. Thirdly, it was completely different than in the book. It was literally so bad that I asked for a justification. Basically, I'd rather watch Basic Instinct 2 than watch. Take my advice, do not watch this movie. Nobody would like to see it. That was awful. AWFUL!
