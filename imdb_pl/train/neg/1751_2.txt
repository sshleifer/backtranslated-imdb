I watched in Hulu (much too much advertising!), So he stopped the pace, but it was like watching a really bad friend from the early sixties. Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, where both parts are played by Jerry Lewis. If I were an Indian, I would protest before presenting all the males as elemental and all women as shrews. They cheated on Western music videos and used many Western models, so men could touch them. I usually like Indian movies, but it was a big disappointment, especially for the modern Indian film. There is no history in India (my uncle remembers when Mac will return to India), but I can not find out where it is going.
