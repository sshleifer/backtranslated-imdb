I am a Catholic taught by nuns in parish primary schools, taught by Jesuits in high school and college. I am still a practicing Catholic, but I would not be considered a "good Catholic" in the eyes of the Church, because I do not believe in certain things or act in a certain way just because the church tells me. <br /> <br /> So for the movie ... it's bad because two people are killed by this nun who is to be satire as the embodiment of a female religious figure. There is no comedy in this, and satire is not well done by actor Diane Keaton. I've never seen this art, but if it was very different from those movies, it could be good. <br /> <br /> At first I thought that the weapon might be false, and the first view of the whole plan by a woman of four former students as an attempt to demonstrate the emotional and intellectual bigotry of Sister Mary. But it turns out that the bullets were real, and history has a tragedy ... the tragedy of losing life (in addition to two former students ... life of miscarriages, mother's life), dogmatic tragedy, power over people's love, tragedy of organized religion replacing true faith in God. This is wrong with today's Islam and yesterday's Judaism and Christianity.
