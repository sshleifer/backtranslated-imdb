I love westerns. I could watch them all day. "Good, bad and ugly" is my favorite. I watched "Silverado" probably for the eighth time, just because it was presented on CMT. However, this movie, Shiloh Falls is without a doubt the worst sunset I've ever seen. Acting was awful all around. They do not explain anything at the end of a mysterious thing that looks like a compass. The only good part I can imagine is a handsome canteen girl. Very noticeable long gaps between dialogues seemed intentional to make up the time to make a film of acceptable length. This movie was not even worth the new rental fee that I paid at our local movie rental company. I felt like I was robbed and deserved to be reimbursed if it was. The only reason I ended it because I hate not to see the movie until the end. I turned it off halfway because it was so bad. For the director, please do a better job if you decide to do another one. It's a kind of movie that can discourage people from being westerns.
