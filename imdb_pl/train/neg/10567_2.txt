I thought this movie seems to be a case study on how to not make the film the most. Because I am a filmmaker, I give him 2 for cohesion. <br /> <br /> Problems remain from the beginning to the end, and the plot is extremely predictable, using fragments of most, if not all, previous successful war stories. The computer generated graphics were too similar to watching video games in points and it seemed that the director did not try to add realistic quality to the story. I became interested in the budget to find out what it must work with, but I did not find this information. <br /> <br /> It looked like this project was pushing the boundaries of a low budget movie too far, which led to a production that pulls the viewer along with the plot without engaging the imagination. The actors were not bad, but the plot needs more innovation.
