It really does not matter that Superman's comics are unbelievably naive, and their purpose is ten years old. What counts is that "Superman Returns" is a bad movie. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, a question for Dear Readers, how many of you really believe that Superman will be defeated by the bald Kevin Spacey? Someone? Exactly as I thought. No spoilers here. Let's now go to some of the main problems. <br /> <br /> First of all, this movie looks like an advertisement (the bar scene with Superman / Clark Kent drinking Budweiser is just a scene that looks like it should). Imagine Superman advertising, two and a half hours. Seriously, this is not "Amadeus" or "The Departed". You really feel that this movie is too long. And by the way special effects are not so special. <br /> <br /> Second, the scenario is stupid. Sometimes, even if something is acceptable in a comic, it looks stupid in the cinema. And this is the case here. Of course, dialogues are a disgrace. I can not believe someone took the money to write it. How many times will we be fed with villains giving speeches? How many times will the laws of physics be raped? (Jesus is not just a question of Superman's strength, but also the resistance of the materials he's dealing with.) How many times will Lois Lane be deceived by Kent? How many times will the Hollywood producers look for stories in kitsch comics? Because it is difficult to create a good story, why do you have a bad story to start with? It just does not work. Guys, catch yourself. Try harder, please. Or just stay on this strike forever, who cares. I have the impression that the WGA is a permanent strike. No offense. I do not question the lame money that these people receive, but the quality of the product being delivered. In this case, there is no quality. (At the moment, you can ask yourself: is it so bad? Yes, it is.) Thirdly, the acting is weak, which is quite a surprise because it directs Bryan Singer (Ordinary Suspects). Kevin Spacey is having fun, but he is the only one. The audience is not in a mood for jokes. The thing is that the hero of the comic can be transformed into a real personality, with clear motivations, but also with doubts, fears, a certain depth. In this case, nobody did this job, and the characters are not really interesting. <br /> <br /> Finally, the entire effort of the creators turns this film into a parody. The second unit is so bad that it attracts attention because nothing interesting is happening on the screen anyway. The harder they try (if they try), the fun it gets (but you can not laugh). <br /> <br /> The final ending? One word: shame. <br /> <br /> This particular movie, ladies and gentlemen, is a camp. Do not waste time and do not waste your money. Stay home, read a book.
