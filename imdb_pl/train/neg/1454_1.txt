Recently I watched the movie twice and I can not understand why the creators of h * ll made this pile of nonsense. I mean, yes, it gives a great impression of Hitler's environment and I mean the way in which they reproduced Austria in the late 1890s, in the First World War and in the inter-war period. I can not understand why they imagined Hitler as a 100% pure evil, crazy, unbelievable, mentally unstable freak. He was a very thinking, loving and intelligent man who, of course, had his dark side, no doubt. But why in the name of heaven presents him in this way? All his positive aspects were removed from the script, leaving only a very propaganda portrait of a man who had the greatest impact on modern civilization. Yes, he threw Germany into the devastating World War II. Yes, he was a racist and yes, sometimes he was sometimes unstable at the end of the war. Everything is true. But again; why the hell did LIE publicly reveal? To warn us? <br /> <br /> I absolutely do not consider this movie a warning. The real danger of Hitler and the Nazis was the fact that they were able to come to power in moments of serious global weakness. The fact that this evil was so recognizable and at the same time so crowded by almost every living German (not to mention Austrians and BIG people), makes him a warning for modern civilization, NOT the fact that Hitler was such a "freak". If it were, as the creators believe, I would be convinced that the German nation is delayed. A man like this in this film would never be near the party leader - not to mention ReichsKanzler. <br /> <br /> 4/10
