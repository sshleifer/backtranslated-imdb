"The Crush" is a nice 40-person friend, a romantic chick for the first two thirds, trying to be British "Sex and the City". <br /> <br /> I especially liked the trophy of a young handsome, whose character is not too strong (think about the fact that we have not seen him so much physically, and Kenny Doughty is worth seeing more). <br /> <br /> They certainly do a lot more business to a young man / older woman than they did the opposite in both versions of "Sabrina" (no movie I do not like) or in this case with Douglas / Zeta-Jones or marriage Dion / Svengali. <br /> <br /> Surrounding Andie MacDowell as an ex pat, they are welcome charisms from British dramas and comedies, such as tart with tresses Anna Chancellor. <br /> <br /> The story revolves towards the end, feeling very deus ex machina. But only after the subtitles appeared at the end I realized what could be wrong. As in the case of "Sex and the City", the screenwriter / director is a man, here is the first John Scotty McKay and I think he really wanted to write a script about three homosexual men, probably about them going out with their lovers and at work (heroes they are the school's director, policeman and doctor), which would be a better and more interesting movie. The title of the film was "The Sad F * cker's Club", which would be more similar to the gay "Broken Hearts Club" even more obvious. <br /> <br /> (originally written 4/6/2002)
