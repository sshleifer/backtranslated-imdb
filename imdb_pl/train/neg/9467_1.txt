If you liked the Grinch movie ... watch it again because it was not as good as the translation of the movie in Seussian. Mike Myers' Cat is probably the most annoying figure who has recently "delighted" the screen. His voice / accent is horrible and he laughs at his own jokes with a terrible sound that is the only laugh I heard in the theater. Even the children did not like it, and now the children are laughing at everything. Save your money and see Looney Tunes: Back in Action if you're really looking for a fun family movie.
