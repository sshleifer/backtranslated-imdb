Ok, so I found out about this film and watched almost all the reviews and had difficulty debating whether or not I should watch it. Before I even watched the movie, I was strangely emotionally on it. I was so uncertain whether I was going to watch and worry about it for a long time. So I decided to take a chance and looked at him, and I heard what I thought: the beginning began well for me. It seemed to be heading in the right direction. I passed the rape scene and could not understand why people were so moved or bored with the movie. Do not get me wrong, the rape scene was just as sad and frightening, but it did not really bother me at such a dramatic point. Then when he came in, I understood the boring things that were happening. There were 5 minute shots, but people walked, saying or showing nothing! One thing is to take a picture in which the person shows some emotions, but this movie did not have it. He had about three of these nonsense scenes in which Maya's main character got out of control, but it did not turn out right, which made me want to speed up. Then, when she got involved in hardcore partying, it was not that boring, but it was still a bit boring. Oh, and as a note Rosario Dawson was still doing great. Okay, so finally after an hour of senselessness in the middle of revenge, she's thinking of Maya. It bothered there. I did not feel bad for him or anything he got for what he deserved, but the whole scene was really disturbing and I just felt eck. I really can not tell you whether to watch this movie, because it is ... I do not know, I can not find a word to summarize it. But if you decide to watch, just do not be surprised.
