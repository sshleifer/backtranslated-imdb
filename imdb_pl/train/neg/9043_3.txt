I went to see it with my wife and my 3-year-old son. It seemed he liked it much more than my wife and I. Writing is surprisingly poor for a pixar / Disney trip. In fact, it was very difficult for me to attract attention. The film looks amazing, but the story becomes so strange and long that I hoped that my son would fall asleep so that I could pick him up and leave him. t an interesting concept, just so strangely told (bad scenario?), especially when "we meet family" for the first time. I know that we should get the impression that the family is crazy, but good ladies, they could shorten this sequence for a good 15 minutes (apparently I did not have time). At that moment I scratched my head, looking for a way out.
