Yes ... it is definitely with some of the worst MSTifyed movies, but I definitely saw worse. Think Gremlins judged R. Well, anyway, I met Rick Sloane at some science fiction concert that amazes me that he lectured! It was one of those really low budget conventions where everything goes, everybody brought something (if you want to see shit, you should see what brought some friends and me). <br /> <br /> He seemed like a very nice guy, he was very nice in my questions and comments about Hobgoblins, and he even told me not to take it seriously and say he loves the MST3K version! <br /> <br /> In all, Rick Sloane knew what he was doing. And I think he was going to be angry like the Martians. So I think I'm fighting for this movie, giving it to 5 and betraying all my friends. I'm sorry, guys.
