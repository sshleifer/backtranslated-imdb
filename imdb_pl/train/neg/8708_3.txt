Like all Carnosaur movies, it's a joke. The way dinosaurs move, reminds me when my sister plays with dolls because they can not be stiffer or more false than they were. <br /> <br /> The plot did not make any sense. I mean, they're on the bus first, then in the warehouse, and then they're suddenly on the boat. And let's be serious, does it make sense that several dinosaurs can stay together on a van or on a ship? I thought that dinosaurs are the biggest animals, and now they can fit in a moving van. It sounds stupid, even if you think about it. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave it to 3 is because it's still fun. I found it better than the first one (I have not seen the second one yet). Just do not rent. I saw it on TV and it's good that I did it because I would not want to waste my rental money.
