I can not believe that the Indian film industry is still releasing such tertiary slag as Waqt. For starters, the plot is completely unbelievable? the spoiled son is thrown out of his family home to teach him self-sufficiency. So what does he do? Immediately the national talent competition wins by doing several jumps in front of the panel of judges (to be honest, I'm not kidding here). In the meantime his father dies of lung cancer, but keeps him secret from his son, but survives long enough to see his son become famous, see his new grandson, and also make a new toy giraffe with his own hands. <br /> <br /> Acting is deplorable in his hammer? no effort was made to try and act in any convincing manner by any of the major players in this movie. As usual in Indian films, the family lived in a huge mansion and seemed relatively untouched by the fears of the real world. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the main losers when such horrible films are made are the intelligent viewers who made the mistake of seeing such a movie. Actors like Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar will still be worshiped as gods by those people who have nothing but blind faith in Bollywood.
