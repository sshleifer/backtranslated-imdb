oh God, where to start ...... bad behavior ... characters you do not care about ... are they Americans or British ... they seem to think they're in America, because elsewhere it's gigantic forest in the middle part ... <br /> <br /> one big wine ... they drive all night through these woods ... unless they drive around and would be in Scotland in the morning ... when the moaning knocks the poor woman wandering over. ... <br /> <br /> and these are mobile phones do not work ... so what they do ... separate, make it easier to get away ... so three are looking for a home that could be in the middle of nowhere and the other two to "take care of" an unconscious woman ... so what they do, instead of making it comfortable, cushion her head, cover her, and even take her off the thriving road, just leave her lying on a hard road, while when they go and light a campfire 100 yards .... and they have a camping car all the time, put it it's in ... <br /> <br /> and the horny angels that are supposed to covet the human race, that they have been thrown out of the sky to live among us ... so what are they doing? to establish sexual relations with every man encountered? ......... they do not bite big pieces of them and they take their heads off ... I think they are missing a point ... <br /> <br /> they are not great, they were not sexually angels, they are cannibalistic Vampires ... And as for the volume of savini, saying how beautiful breaths are ... well, these girls have good bodies, but nothing special in the face. the main role was much prettier than the so-called irresistible sirens ... <br /> <br /> garbage from a junk movie worth Â£ 2.30 from my local library ...
