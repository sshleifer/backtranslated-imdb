Waiting for the entrance to the theater with tickets in hand, I was expecting an interesting sci-fi fantasy film that would eventually satisfy my appetite for videos about robotic technology, instead I was disappointed with every aspect of it, once again proving that it is a unique effect they can not help a boring story, which in my opinion was worse this year. Acting in this film also did not satisfy me, Will Smith did not show anything new in this movie, but I've never seen his game change since "Men In Black", which in my opinion was his only success. From that time he had to retire without breaking his name with the titles "I, Robot" and "Men In Black 2". 4/10
