When I first saw a small stage in some of the ads, I thought the program would be fun to watch. The little worker looks a bit sweet. The animation style is a bit like some classic shows. Before the program was broadcast, I studied it through some sources. There, I got a little scared. Three children (Tommy, Gus and Lola) have appropriate voices, but Robotboy is an exception. It would be much nicer if it was introduced by a young boy. A good example is Robot Jones, a robot character from "Whatever Happened To Robot Jones"? The show is not really bad. But the way Robotboy is misrepresented is my only criticism. So I do not watch too much.
