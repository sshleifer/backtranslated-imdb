Rosario Dawson plays the girl who was raped on a date, and then she begins decency in the dark until she has a chance to take revenge. Although it is clear why Dawson took on this role, he has the chance to show his acting chops and make a small independent, definitely not a Hollywood movie, it is also clear that in addition to a stunning look Dawson does not fit this role. Forgive me, I just could not find her. It was not a mistake, I felt that way, I had no idea where she was. Yes, I know it is on the screen, but even though I spent most of the two hours looking at her, she did not leave any impression on me. I blame the script for this because, apart from the end, there was nothing big about what happened on the screen. People seemed to be more upright than real, and what was happening did not match. Forgive me for being indefinite, but nothing in this film, except the end (about which I would like to talk, but it can not ruin it) and Rosario Dawson's image as a picture, stayed with me. What can I say, it might be a click, maybe not, the time has come for me that I can not come back. Only for fans of Rosario Dawson, although it must be remembered that there are several real reasons why this is NC17. (And Rosario ... please, you're a better actress, choose better scenarios)
