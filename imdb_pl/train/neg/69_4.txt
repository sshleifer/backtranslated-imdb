I thought it was a very clumsy, non-binding version of the famous Australian history. Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom were very good in their roles and gave their characters a personality; but the whole thing was forced and mechanical. <br /> <br /> The beginning could have been much more engaging; perhaps starting with the shooting and then flashing to remind them how they got there or something like that. I felt that every scene is routinely predictable and marked as a bad television soap. <br /> <br /> I really could not wait for this movie and I was hoping for something much better. The only thing I can say in his favor is the fact that Mick Jagger is beating, but not much.
