This movie makes the Canadians and the British are stupid, idiotic idiots. Men fall / drink and then scream / beat each other in almost every scene. Women are unnecessary in history? I do not understand why they are there? they spend every scene causing confusion, or worse, they spin like hypnotized cattle. Apparently, Canadian women are either quarrelsome vulgar vagrants or powerful hippie chicks. It's just a knock-out girl, her inept boyfriend and his wicked mother whom we've seen in countless movies before. <br /> <br /> Every character here is a caring, infantile stereotype. Not to mention that everyone looked like they needed a shower! And the idea of ​​any scene suggesting sex with George Wendt ?? shudder? all you have to do is gag anyone! I watched the movie because Samuel West was in it? but I can not understand why he would take such a role. Maybe he needed money. Ian Tracey is a great actor - the only one who has a vague moment of redemption, but his talent is wasted here. <br /> <br /> What about the rest of the story? three imbeciles trying to recover drugs? yawn - or Karl? who is dead, but who is actually a very lively figure in the minds of those who remained (almost like Rebecca in Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece - although I'm ashamed to even think about comparing the two films), why even bother? Karl is so angry that you will find the circumstances of his death satisfying. <br /> <br /> Towards the end of this unfortunate movie, I thought it would be better to go down with him on this boat!
