Nowadays, life in Eastern Europe is difficult, and for young women prostitution is one of the only career options and reluctantly taken care of by Melania. It draws the attention of American Seymour, who is obsessed with her, paying more and more money for the time, and finally wants to buy it. She has two pimps with various emotional attachments to her, and generally she is passed like a piece of luggage without her own feelings. However, we are on the territory of "modern home cinema", so conventions such as narrative structure, lighting of the object, in order to be able to see, camera techniques that add rather than divert attention from the action and vaguely coherent plot can be abandoned. Most of the time, I had no idea what was happening and I really cared. People started to leave the projection almost before the arrival of the last ones late and I do not think I've ever seen so many people go out. <br /> <br /> Images are important for the director - the characters slowly emerge or disappear on a dark screen, we have long shots about nothing special, and one sex scene takes place in the infrared. In fact, for such an unconventional movie, sex scenes were extremely ordinary; missionary positions between naked people in bed abounded and there were no drugs or strangers associated with them. But perhaps today's being ordinary is unconventional. <br /> <br /> Generally, almost completely without merit. <br /> <br />
