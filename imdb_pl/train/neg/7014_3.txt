What a loss! This movie could be really decent, but in particular the writing is nonsense, and the main characters are rather shallow and uninteresting. Mike Meyers was good, and the historical recreation of the decade of the late '70s was well done, but overall, this movie was a great waste of time. Instead, a movie to watch, which deals with similar themes and the same basic time interval, is a great BOOGIE NIGHTS.
