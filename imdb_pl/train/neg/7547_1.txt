Waitress: Honey, here's their eggs you ordered. Honey, like a bee, take it? This is called a purposeless announcement. <br /> <br /> Edward Basket: Huh? (By the way) Cart: Here's your doll back, little girl. You really should not be so careless in your goods. <br /> <br /> Little girl: Yes, whatever. <br /> <br /> Suspension! Boom! Whoosh! Crash?? Cart: I think something bad will happen. <br /> <br /> (Later) Cart: Mmmm. Vicodin! What?? ? (Tears open the letter.) Wow! The letter from my ex-girlfriend has really improved. And look, her missing daughter looks a bit like a girl with a doll who was accidentally in a sense responsible for killing. And she has my hairline. I wonder if I should torture myself and find her? Let's see what my friends from the camp think. <br /> <br /> A colleague from the basket basket: HAHAHA. Willow is a funny name. <br /> <br /> Shopping: I think something bad will happen. <br /> <br /> (On the island) Cart: What's in the bag? AHHH. <br /> <br /> Woody crone: This is not her daughter. <br /> <br /> (In the tavern) Cart: Can you swing it? Tavern tavern with large bones and trees: Huh? Basket: (smashes a bee). Everything is fine. <br /> <br /> A sensual, pretty, formerly promising actress playing a lusty maid from a tavern at the inn: That's good. Honey is not a plant. <br /> <br /> (On greensward) Willow: Oh, yeah, and I forgot, you're a father, my child, Conan, er, I mean Rowen. (Yawns.) I could stay and have life with you. But I do not. Instead, I wanted to become a bee princess. I mean, it does not matter. (Nodding, jerking, expanding his eyes to the proportions of the anime). Mwah, kiss. I love you! What we talked about? Basket: Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? Willow: Edward. Smell. Flash. Why. Are. You. He screamed. W. Me? Is it because I gave you your Vicodin? Smell. To snore. What we talked about? Cart: I think something bad will happen. <br /> <br /> Willow: my lips ache. <br /> <br /> (At school) Rose: What is a man? Not very attractive twins: phallic symbol, phallic symbol. <br /> <br /> Rose: Echo? Echo? Cart: Move away from the bike. <br /> <br /> Rose: And I'm a good twin. <br /> <br /> Shopping: I think something bad will happen. <br /> <br /> (u uli) Cart: Hmmm. Hello? Ow, ow, ow, it bothers you. Stupid old bear. Snore. <br /> <br /> (In Queen Bee's residence) Sister Summersisle: You have so much potential. What are you doing here? Were you not a Cher stud hit in Moonstruck? (Lips lips). Trash: I wanted to ask you about it. Where is the girl? Sister Summersisle: How are you? Let's talk about the meaning of my unnecessary "s". Cart: Watch out for this truck that is coming to us! Aaaaah! A. It does not matter. Damn it! (He pushes another pill.) Mmmm. Thorazine. <br /> <br /> (Back at the tavern) A generous, elevated taverna taverna: I tried the Weightwatchers, Jenny Craig, South Beech, and I still got the size of a bear last year. <br /> <br /> Wood crone: HAHAHA. All the better to bake this nosy policeman, my dear. <br /> <br /> Girls with big bones: Absolutely. <br /> <br /> Trash: It was the last straw that broke the back of the basketball! Take it, maid! (Slugs her.) (Edward Basket is mysteriously attacked from behind) Voluptuous tavern wench: EEEE! Shake off this! Leave the island and take me with you! Do I have to face you or what? Get out of this, I say! EEEE! Cart: Take it, maid! (Boldly kicking her in the face. Her eyes roll back and become cartoon Xami.) Sensual girl: Snore ?? (On Nicolas Cage's baking) Ellen Burstyn: Who can forget about the part in which the Basket cell phone rings in the middle of his bear costume, and then the conversation is interrupted. It's like a wireless advertisement: help me! Can you hear me now? Hahaha. <br /> <br /> Kate Beahan: And remember when I produced the bullets I pulled from Basket's gun? He looked so surprised. You should be more careful with your belongings, Nick. Hahaha. And your choice of movies. <br /> <br /> Everything: The drone must die! Basket: (shouting) Oh, yes, you bitches? Well, burning me will not help your cholate honey! Aaah. My legs! Honey (honey, do you understand?) Put down the flashlight and move away from the cart. Sweetheart! Smokey Bear says that do not play matches. Hahaha. What??? Look out for this speeding truck! Ahh! Father Damn, these flashbacks from the drug experiment phase in the 1970s are getting old! Where is my heroin? Oh. Oh. My watch is not fireproof. Oh. I think something bad will happen. Can you hear me now? I am ready for my approximation. Damn it! (Six months later) A sensual girl in today's slutty outfit: I told this title basketball suitcase to take me with me. <br /> <br /> Innocent young drone: I like helping people. <br /> <br /> Girly girl: So get me out of the sequel contract! I think something bad will happen. EEEE!
