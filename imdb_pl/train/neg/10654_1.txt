Big hair, big boobs, bad music and a huge pin ....... are words that best describe this horrible movie. I love bad horror movies and I've seen hundreds ... but it must have been the worst I've ever done. The plot is thin and absurd, acting is an abomination, the scenario is completely funny (it's best to have a final game with a policeman and how he discovered who the killer is - he's so damn horribly written), the clothes are disgusting and funny in equal amounts, the hair they are big, lots of tits bounces, men wear those cut shirts that absorb their stomachs (disgusting that men actually wear them !!), and music is just a synth basket that plays and Again ... in almost every scene is kitsch music, boobs and paramedics take the bodies ... and the gym still does not close to mourning !! Joking aside is a really bad movie whose only charm is to look back at the catastrophe that took place in the 1980s and have good old laughter about how bad everything was then.
