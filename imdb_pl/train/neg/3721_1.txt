Two films are useful for scaring people to God, this and the "Event Horizon". One has a meaningful and moving message, the other is as one-dimensional as a religious movie. It is a pity that Paul Anderson went to the damned movies of Resident Evil, he really had something to do. <br /> <br /> Thief in the Night is hampered by many obvious independent attributes of the film (acting, storytelling, dialogue and persuasion) and it is obvious what the intentions of the movie are from the very beginning. The Christian film industry did not learn what happened, so we got stuck in the Omega code, Left Behind and other Tribulation movies. Their basic element is that they care so much about selling their message: "Get save, people!" That everything else becomes the second after the audience hits the head with the Bible. <br /> <br /> Generally, I can not believe that I am writing so much about a movie that is ineffective. Skip it all and go back to Sam Neil picking eyeballs. 1 out of 5.
