The finale of Wearzmuller Tarzan's films is rather weak. There are several things that derail this movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, Tarzan spends most of the film on soft sandals. In my opinion, every footwear on Tarzana, whether it's sandals or shoes, as sometimes presented, deprives the hero who is supposed to be anti-civilization and pro-jungle. <br /> <br /> Second, Benji's character, as mentioned in the previous post, completely ridicules the film as a comic foil. For me, his character is not needed for the plot of the film. <br /> <br /> Moreover, while Weissmuller still cuts the character commanding as Tarzan, it can be seen that he was not in the best shape. Although in his later films Jungle Jim, his body structure slightly improved from this film. <br /> <br /> The octopus battle is a great idea, but I think it should have been done in the earlier Weissmuller movie when it was at its physical peak. Similarly, a battle that lasts only 30 seconds would be much more exciting if it was drawn for 90 seconds to 2 minutes, like the classic giant fight of crocodiles in Tarzana and his officer. <br /> <br /> And while Brenda Joyce as Jane and Linda Christian as Mara are extremely pleasing to the eye, they fail to save the last Weissmuller movie - a disappointing ending of the great course of the character.
