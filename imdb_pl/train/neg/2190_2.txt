** Possible Spoilers in advance ** <br /> <br /> Jason (a.k.a. Herb) Evers is a brilliant brain surgeon who, along with his wife Virginia Leith, takes part in the most colorless car accident on the screen. Leith is deprived of her head, and the doctor takes her back to her residence and rejuvenates her head in her laboratory. The outside of the mansion was allegedly filmed at the Lyndhurst estate in Tarrytown; The lab scenes were apparently shot in someone's basement. The bandaged head is kept alive on "laboratory equipment" that is cheap enough for Ed Wood. Some songs from the library? The climax of the movie? Later he appeared in Andy Milligan's THE BODY BENEATH. Leith's head has several heavy metaphysical discourses with another Ever miss, a mutant chained to the wardrobe. In the meantime, a good doctor prowls through the striped ponds, looking for a body worthy of his wife's gabby pasta. The tip, in raw imprints, contains a little splash and dismemberment when the zucchini monster comes out of the closet to bring the film back to welcome. It took three years to release it, and then the audience gave him the bad reception she deserved. Between this, PLAN 9 FROM EXTERNAL SPACE and several others, 1959 should be declared the Year of Turkey.
