Something to Sing About was produced at Grand National Studios, where James Cagney worked in a contractual dispute with the Warner brothers. He made two films for this studio B, none of which holds high in Cagney's rankings. <br /> <br /> One of the great losses in the cinema is the fact that Jimmy Cagney has made so few movies that have used his great dancing abilities. The two that come to my mind are Yankee Doodle Dandy and Footlight Parade. Two smaller films are The West Point Story and Never Steal Anything Small. Cagney himself said he never saw anything but his retired musicals. So why did he do so little of them? <br /> <br /> Well, he was wrong. Something to Sing About is about a hoofer who heads a band that discovered and received a film contract. Usually there are complications of the head of the working studio and press agent, respectively, Gene Lockhart and William Frawley. His contract requires a marriage clause, so Cagney and the singer of the band, Evelyn Daw, marry in secret. Then we have a complication related to the commercial romance of the studio with the leading lady Mona Barrie. I think you can imagine where it's going. <br /> <br /> The most disappointing thing about Something to Sing About is the lack of dance numbers for Cagney. He dances briefly at the beginning and end of the movie and nothing in the middle. Evelyn Dawen had a nice voice and charisma of ham sandwiches. She got music numbers like they were. I'm sure the film audience paid for tickets to see Cagney's dance. <br /> <br /> In addition to giving him some dance numbers, a dance partner would be nice. He danced well with Ruby Keeler at Footlight Parade and with Virginia Mayo and Doris Day at The West Point Story. Was Ginger Rogers, Eleanor Powell or Ruby Keeler not available? <br /> <br /> No memorable songs came out of it. And Dawa's voice is also distorted. He has a soprano voice, Jeanette MacDonald, who does not fit into the swing band. <br /> <br /> No wonder Cagney returned to Warner Brothers. But they should give him decent musicals.
