When jokes against bushes become really easy to do, a program like this should be sure that it has something extra. When it's something extra, children's versions of political figures joking about the future they do not have yet are simply nonsense. Dick Cheney and George Bush are doing well, but Dick Cheney mumbles mainly. There is also Condoleeza Rice, who for some reason has a crush on Bush and Donald Rumsfeld who is not so similar to Donald Rumsfeld. Democratic figures rarely give their names, so it's a secret who can be anyone except Barack Obama and Hilary Clinton. <br /> <br /> The episodes have consistent stories, but it's not close enough to stop it from sinking.
