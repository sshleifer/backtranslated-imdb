This is probably the best horror movie since Ed Wood's death. <br /> <br /> I can not screw up the ending because I have no idea what happened. However, I will try my best. There are some lesbian vampires, but they are constantly exchanging bodies, so any character may or may not be the character you should think about, or he may be a lesbian vampire. <br /> <br /> Sounds misleading? It is not as confusing as it may seem, because none of the characters makes sense. There is no plot, no character development, random people appear, speak a few lines and then disappear to never hear them again. There are also zombies that are * probably * enemies of vampires, but in a psychiatric hospital there is also a sequence of dreams in dreams, so maybe nothing like this happened, and this is all hallucination of the main character. <br /> <br /> Up? Both leading girls are tearing their shirts off. The special effects are simply amazing (I particularly liked the incredibly slow, uncomfortable sequences of the fight). Everyone has a really stupid Canadian accent that increases the overall level of merriment. <br /> <br /> Worth the rental price. We laughed until we cried.
