Night at the ball: the most important night for every shallow girl consisting almost entirely of plastic. And so the characters repeated to us every ten minutes, when a bizarre event occurred in their tiny lives. <br /> <br /> There really is no excuse for Prom Night. It is less than nothing original and I would really give it zero or less stars if it was possible in IMDb. The only part of my viewing that I liked was that the group of teenagers sitting in front of us decided to play "ghosts". It was much more exciting than anything that was happening on the screen in front of them. <br /> <br /> The conspiracy was basically some crazy guy. The thing is, it was not even an exciting craze. Maybe if the guy was a bit scary, not tame Robbie Williams with a baseball cap, I could sit there with a bit of anxiety. The fact that I was less concerned with the characters than with the color of the cinema carpet did not bring any effect either. What's worse, the rest of the characters were equally one-dimensional and unconscious. The hotel staff obviously did not notice or cared that one of their maids had disappeared and were another proof that the murderer was unrecognizable after he shaved. I was incredibly surprised that this bizarre, stereotypical girl in the blue dress was the only person who noticed who he was. He realizes it, then walks down the stairs, intertwines in a plastic sheet, and then rolls over the pile of paint buckets. Not bad. <br /> <br /> The worst part was that I believe that the director tried absolutely the most difficult. He really pushed all the limits, not showing that he was actually killing himself. Shocking! And music, do not even start me. It was almost as appropriate as undressing at a funeral. <br /> <br /> I really want this night to be a joke. It was horrible and stupidly predictable. No one, having common sense or otherwise, has any reason to watch this movie. The mainstream cinema seems to go down, and such films make the situation worse. If you want to see this absolutely horrible movie, hear my request. Do not do this. There are better things to spend on six pounds. Like a ghost game sheet.
