I saw this movie last night after many good reviews from many sources. I would like to emphasize that if you are not ready to constantly check who is who and what it means that you hate this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm still fighting to understand the roles of the actors in this movie, the movie skips from different stories and does not really let us feel into any of the roles. <br /> <br /> For lovers of politics and people interested in corruption in other world governments this movie is probably pretty good, but for the average observer of the movie this movie is uncomfortable, very boring in places, and you leave the cinema confused and irritated that You paid the entrance fee. <br /> <br /> see if you're ready to focus 100% on every minute of details or you're interested in politics. I do not see it if you really like watching movies.
