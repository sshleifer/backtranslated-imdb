Watch how a team of bomb experts in Iraq counts down their time before they get home. <br /> <br /> That sounds boring in itself. Every time that this small sign appeared telling us how much time had passed, it caused that the movie did not have a plot going on. Hurry up and finish your time so we can all come home. <br /> <br /> I have to miss something. I am a huge fan of war movies if they are well made. It had the jarhead syndrome. The movie, which was sometimes beautifully filmed, but cinematography does not stop him from being completely exterminated and pointless. <br /> <br /> And you have to defeat the slow "pistol cartridges". they could save money and just get footage from another movie with weapons in hand. <br /> <br /> I did not have any empathy for the main guy in him, I still hoped his recklessness would force him to die. In fact, the movie would work a lot better if it had. <br /> <br /> I have read some reviews and it seemed to me that those who were in the armed forces did not like it and liked everything else. I have never been in my strength and I am with them. It's pretentious nonsense. 3 stars are for photos.
