I really tried to like this movie. He deals with an important problem in any society: sex addiction. <br /> <br /> In this story, we find out that you can lose everything when you are addicted to sex. In this case, our main character and heroine, who has sex without a break with different women (crazy, perverse, neurotic), puts him in danger of marriage, work and even life. <br /> <br /> production values ​​are terrible; mainly acting. Oh, you will not like ANY sex scenes, most of them take place in very bad taste and you may think that you are watching a movie at home. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the plot is not meaningful. How could such a wise and beautiful wife bear all the horrible things from her husband? How could she believe him ?! The situation of the three is priceless and will make you giggle for a moment. <br /> <br /> A scene with a black cinema companion is simply pointless and will leave you thinking "wtf?". <br /> <br /> Scenes like these you will find plenty. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie. Please, avoid this; it's not a soft core, it's not a document, it's not a dramatic function. It is a pretentious effort from a so-called documentary director or something like that. <br /> <br /> Only the legs of Mrs Kinski at the exhibition are worth watching. I caught it on HBO and I'm glad I did not spend money on it. But those 90 minutes of my life will not come back.
