Susan Swift is an attractive young man, a transplanted flower until the 1980s (like young Susan Dey), but she does not have a wide vocal range for demanding dramatic advantage and has a tendency to moan; it is still rather sweet and has bright eyes and a nice smile. In "The Coming" (as it was called shortly after the release of the cinemas), Swift can be the reincarnation of a witch from Salem. Fast traffic is very low and borrows from so many other photos, which I gave up about 15 minutes. It starts strongly and has a camp appeal. Of course there are more serious films that concern the Salem witch trials that deserve to be seen; however, as junk movies go, it is not too scary. The Boston premises are a definite plus, and the supporting staff is fun. * 1/2 of ****
