<br /> <br /> When I first started watching this movie last night at Cinemax, I was shocked that it was made. Cruel Intentions, in my opinion, was one of the best teen-oriented videos created for years. This prequel had some things inconsistent with the original. (Sebastian's father married with wealth, so why does he have a rich aunt on a long island?) <br /> <br /> Then I learned that it was not a new movie, but a television series, Manchester Prep. After hearing this, it made sense to me that it was not the same as the movie, just as Buffy the Vampire Slayer is different in TV form. <br /> <br /> I think that Roger Kumble probably added the ending that the movie had. After the show he was not picked up by Fox. It looks like something that would happen too fast (Sebastian becomes a male version of Katharyn) and I just do not know where they will go with the next episode, because it will not lead to the 1999 movie (which newer ending is directed towards. ) One thing I did not like was that he suggested that Sebastian and his father got married, which usually does not look good in this part of New York, and mother sine Katharyn was only her adult version, she did not look like something a woman could do in her job, marry a man who did not belong to her social class. <br /> <br /> As a prequel it's pretty bad. But I would be interested to see how it turned out as a series.
