Boy, it was definitely one of the worst movies I've seen all summer. It's true, it was in Sci Fi, and I do not watch too much Sci Fi, but man, talk about a razor-thin story and two-dimensional characters to the maximum. <br /> <br /> The characters were stereotypical and exaggerated, the plot and surroundings were unbelievable, the vampires were less intimidating, more fun, gore was unnecessary, the special effects were terrible, and the ending? Well, the only thing unpredictable about the ending was that suddenly the boy becomes a lesbian and starts doing it with a female vampire who, incidentally, is not that hot, given that it occurs for about three seconds, you are closer. " What the hell? "Then" Man, it's hot. " If it ever appears in replays, God forbid, DO NOT BACK IT.
