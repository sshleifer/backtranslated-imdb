To make a good movie, you either need excellent actors or a great director. You need at least one of them. We do not have any in this Eye of the Needle. <br /> <br /> I do not even remember the director's name. He could not do much in his career. I really like Donald Sutherland, but he absolutely can not be the main actor in the movie. Spada. Sutherland is perfect in the film when it appears no more than 15 minutes. I would say, for example, that Sutherland was perfect at JFK Oliver Stone when he talked to Kevin Costner on the park bench for 10 minutes without a break, without even breathing. Great. But Sutherland as the main actor in the film is not good. <br /> <br /> Kate Nelligan? It's probably good for TV series. The DVD is terrible. Horrible colors. A terrible light. I could not even appreciate the scenery of Storm Island because it was a bad photograph. <br /> <br /> This story of Ken Follett was good, but it's a pity they turned it into an uninteresting movie.
