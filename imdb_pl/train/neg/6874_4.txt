Jean-Marc Barr (Being Light, The Big Blue, Dogville) has directed and interpreted this strange movie, which is the second installment of a trilogy. I may be wrong, but I do not think this movie is part of the Dogma '95 manifesto, although it really looks like. I'm not sure what I think about this movie. All actors are good. They provide quite good performances, especially Rosanna Arquette and Jean-Marc Barr. History is interesting in some way. But I do not know, there is something in the movie that I do not like. Sex scenes are too long. From an interesting work of art to an erotic piece of shit, I do not know exactly where he stands. Sure, this is not a bad movie, but I will not suggest that people see it, nor tell them not to watch it. Just do as you like. If you feel curious and open, try, you may like it.
