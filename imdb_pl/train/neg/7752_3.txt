The film is about the destruction of the amusement park, where teens hunt scavengers. Because there are no rules, they break into the building and start to die. Deaths are cheesy and stupid. But at least it had better effects than the trackpad. I gave her three because Stacy was in it and I loved Sabretooth. I thought it was okay, but some deaths were off screen. There was a stupid scene in which two teenagers are kissing and jumping out of the trackpad's head, and the boy leaves his girlfriend behind, leaving her to completely mimic the looking red guts. Then the saber gets up in the holes and bites the children. The final death with the owner was completely false graphics. Even this death was stupid, because the tooth of the statue passed through his mouth and hangs there in such a way that it will support him and there is a scene in which the goth girl loses contacts, does not find them and does not seem to need. The film is idiotic and a waste of time.
