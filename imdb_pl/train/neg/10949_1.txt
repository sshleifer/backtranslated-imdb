I'm going to the cinema to have fun. There is nothing funny about this film. From the beginning to the end there is no respite from the gray, grinding reality of this woman's life. It is at one pace, without changing the mood. I stayed to the end only because I was convinced that everything must improve. They do not do it, and I do not think I'm the only one, as evidenced by the many groans in the cinema when the film is closed. A sincere depiction of social deprivation is not a crime, but boring listening to groans is not a way to win public opinion. Scary Movie.
