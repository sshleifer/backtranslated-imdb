If I asked how I would define the word "Shallow", I would say "Watch the production of Jerry Bruckheimer." If I asked how I would define the phrase "wasted potential", I would say, "Watch the production of Jerry Bruckheimer." Bruckheimer's productions are almost always a surefire hit, but they almost always receive critical criticism. In the depths of my soul, I can only think about ANGEL AND GENTLEMAN and BLACK HAWK DOWN, which have gained critical acclaim. <br /> <br /> Also CRIMSON TIDE met with critics' reluctance, it is certainly one of the better Bruckheimer films, which unfortunately does not say much. The problem I had was a scenario that tells the story: the Russians are fighting against the Chechens, and the conflict is spreading all over Russia, which leads to the ultra nationalist Russian taking over the atomic missile base and threatening the West if they interfere. Maybe the end of the Cold War had something to do with it, but I found this setting very unconvincing. Some errors in geography did not help, such as the French carrier Foch in Med (would not Foch be better located in the black sea?) Or that the exposition film chronicle contains well-known films with conflicts from the Balkans, the first Gulf war, and even Vietnam. Once again, the adjective "Very Unconvincing" has entered the mind. History improves slightly when history begins - the battle of wills regarding the orders between the nuclear submarine commander and his number two begins. Director Tony Scott does everything in his power, but the problem is still in the unconvincing scenario. The worst thing is that if it was in the mid-eighties, when the Third World War was a viable option - not a probability - this movie would frighten me, but after the end of the Cold War the dangers of nuclear war meant that CRIMSON TIDE had little effect.
