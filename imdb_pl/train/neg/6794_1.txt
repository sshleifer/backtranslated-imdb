Friday the 13th step! Officially, it's a worse movie than your hateful show. I won this film in a college competition and it was a waste of money, even if it was free. Jack Jones plays a really terrible singer who tries to find murderers or something like that. At least Friday the thirteenth I was never bored. I'd rather have my nails pulled than I saw it again.
