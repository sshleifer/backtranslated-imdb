Honestly, I did not like the "performance decision" - which was an obvious template - very much, but in comparison with this piece of nonsense, it looks like a masterpiece of art. <br /> <br /> Not only are the people moving in the film (the term "actors would be an insult to all other actors") should attend more acting, the guy who builds the scenery did not even see the plane from afar. It's so absurd that at 747 only 3 flights are on board, but this is just the tip of the iceberg. The movie is full of illogicality (eg Use a gas to sleep, then do not use it, and then use it), which ultimately lowered my rating to the end. <br /> <br /> You can have more fun adjusting the sock drawer or drilling the hole in the knee and filling it with milk.
