THIS IS NOT A CHILD'S FILM !!! <br /> <br /> This movie is like a "trip in bad acid" for children under 5 years old. me "Why did this rabbit bled from his mouth" or "Why did the bulldozer have buried all rabbits?". (And it was not the worst). We stopped it for about half an hour, but the damage was done. Intensely morbid, oppressive, violent. Fortunately, he finally forgot all this miserable thing. Whoever decided that this movie should be sold to children should be raised on the basis of fees. ... (Go ahead, condemn me, my conscience is clear).
