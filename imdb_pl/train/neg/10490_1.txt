I noticed that the previous reviewer (who seems to be still at school) gave this film a very good review and I can only assume that this is because the reviewer did not see far better adaptation of this classic 1989 novel on the BBC. The main problem I had with this (1999) version was to fill Anthony Way as Tom Long. Anthony Way was a talented boy who scored fame after appearing in the mini television series "The Choir." I can only assume that he was cast as Tom Long by virtue of his excellent acting in the "Choir". Unfortunately, the little boy who appeared in "The Choir", has grown into a tall and dangerous young man, when the movie "Tom's Midnight Garden" was filmed and as such Anthony is not convincing as a student Tom. Too far from the imagination is the belief that Tom (played by Anthony) befriends much younger Hatta. In the BBC version of 1989, Tom and Hatty are much closer to age, and the development of their friendship is much more credible. In the case of the 1999 film, even the special effects are not convincing and are not a noticeable improvement of the television effects from 1989. The cast and acting of this version are worse than the previous adaptation, and the film was entirely devoid of the sheen of the real classic. Finally, I would like to point out that the VHS version of the BBC from 1989 has much more than 20.00 pounds from the second hand, while the new DVD with this version can be bought for less than 5 pounds, I have to say more?
