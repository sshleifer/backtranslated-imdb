I gave this film only one star because it could not be less. <br /> <br /> Scientists have developed a formula for replicating each organism. In his laboratory (a neglected warehouse in L.A.) they form T-Rex. A group of industrial spies breaks in to steal the formula, and the rest of the movie is one endless pursuit behind the feet. <br /> <br /> Of course, T-Rex (rubber marionette) relaxes and starts to wipe the cast. He has the incredible ability to sneak away 2 or 3 feet away from someone who does not notice them, and then immediately bites his head. <br /> <br /> One cast member escapes in a police car and spends the rest of the movie aimlessly through the city. He has such an excellent mental ability that he can not even handle the radio. He never tries to drive up to a substation or a donut shop and seems hopelessly lost. <br /> <br /> T-Rex wreaks havoc all over the city, there are burning battles and buildings (cardboard mock-ups) blowing up, but there is a single police car or army, and no one else. Such activity must be common in Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> We can only hope that we do not plan to continue.
