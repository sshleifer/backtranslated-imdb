This is without a shadow of a doubt the worst movie that Steven Seagal ever did. And that says a lot. Do not be fooled by the assessment, it is too good. This abomination did not even deserve a rating of 0/10, if there was such a thing. <br /> <br /> - Absolutely no plot <br /> <br /> - The worst action scenes in history and there are not too many <br /> <br /> - Seagal does not do anything alone, including fighting , calls (a lot of dubbing) and so on. As always. <br /> <br /> - Seagal is fat, lazy and does not care about this movie. Something that is very obvious all the time <br /> <br /> Take all the other DTV junk movies that Seagal has done, multiply them with you, multiply by a thousand billion, and all the evil prey that you will get then "I even describe 1% of this absolute nightmare.
