I already know that critics and some viewers say that it was a satire, there were many political and social messages, names refer to other names, etc. It may be so. I can not do such things (I do not want to do this anyway), because I am not interested in it, I am interested in "cinema". As for the film itself, it is said that the film is clever and dramatically powerful. I have not seen anything that we do not see in monster movies, except for the scene that takes place in the office in the second half. Yes, this scene says something about humanity, but it does not make the film a genius. The film is funny (softly) and exciting in some moments or scenes, but not more. As for the biggest disadvantage of the film, these are visual effects. It was just shocking, I could not collect for a while, because I was expecting a realistic monster because it is not one of Gojira's old films, it was created in 2006, but it was not. It's like you do not believe that there is a monster, you can not worry about it. If you agree with me on this matter, I highly recommend Cloverfield, who is extremely realistic. The monster's design is not interesting, but at least planned, it requires effort. Dramatically powerful criticism. Some critics say that it was Kurosawa's film. Yes, it's more like a drama than a thriller or action, but that should not mean it's dramatically powerful. I do not want to compare Host with other monstrous movies, but I try to say that Host does not do something that other monster movies do not do. By the way, some people may call a film masterpiece because of their compassion for Asian cinema. Yes, I also like Asian cinema, but that's a fact.
