Was this the first role of the actress in the film? the character, Leon, is quite funny, but soon after, the sexual jokes and humor are too stupid to listen to. some videos may escape sexual jokes and base your audience to know when an ad appears. Some movies are American cake and a scary movie. the frightening movie was stupid, and the American cake would not be good without sexual jokes. The only role, beyond the leon, which had some humor, was ferrill. the character was really stupid and that's all, stupid humor was what made me watch. the movie was fine and nothing more. I really do not understand why people who are dying to leave the exhibition always get a movie based on the character they played in the show. skits last about 5 minutes, and if they can make a movie from a 5-minute sketch, then what is the world going for? molly shannon had a superstar, cheri o'terri had a terrible movie, but she did not play a leading role and will have an elf. but it was good, but he made some stupid movie, but I do not remember, and myers mike with Wayne's world. where does this crazy TV crew never get a movie offer? I've seen only one guy get through, but only in two movies and a TV show with andy dick. but this guy relies on comedy to keep his life going, funny or not. this movie is not good, but it had a bit of positive humor. what a loss of film and people's money.
