Ben Stiller does not react so much. And he does it very well. He is very dependent on the comedy that is going on around him. In There Something About Mary the stage of standing hair only works because Stiller tries to keep his face straight. When he confronts the other two suitors of Mary, he is the most dangerous guy in the room, but the scene is fun. <br /> <br /> In Along Came Polly, the formula breaks down for reasons that are difficult to understand. Stiller is surrounded by a series of comic talents. Hank Azaria and Philip Seymour Hoffman receive the best lines, which are too few. Having said that, Hoffman relies a bit on bodily humor - you know we're in trouble when they go to fart jokes to pick up laughter. The basketball scene in which Hoffman is preparing is completely overcrowded (although he throws one problem in the form without the shirt of the opponent who makes a smile - noticeably through the Stiller's reaction). However, everyone seems to work in a bubble, there is very little reaction. Characters Hoffman and Stiller could play much, much more. Aniston appears again as Rachael, but Stiller is not Ross. This is more of a scenario "Joey with sympathy in Rachael." <br /> <br /> Polly is rom-com-by-numbers and this is his failure - he lacks heart. You do not eradicate the character. With a bit of work, we could have a deeper story, but in the end the film's failure is reduced to poor writing. It's worth to watch if it appears on TV on a free night, but you will regret that you set up cash to see it.
