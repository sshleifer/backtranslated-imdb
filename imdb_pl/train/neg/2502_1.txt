One more Die Hard straight to the video to break out with cardboard villains? How many of these gods are terribly cheap (and bad) ripping from the more popular action movies from the turn of the 80s and 90s are still lurking there? For the record (not that you care about it) this is another blatant spurt of the combination of Die Hard, Under Siege and Speed ​​2 with a full set of stereotypes and predictability. <br /> <br /> Unspeakable villains are the usual choice of cardboard cut-thro guns, which are sent by various means as the film progresses. The hero is obviously a former cop or something that has problems with family and attitude and of course brings to the party not only ordinary emotional luggage, but also a matching piece of candy to the eyes and his annoying son. <br /> <br /> The supposed luxury liner that runs between Florida and Mexico is carefully described as the intersection of the liner and the ferry ?? does it explain how it happens that they are roaming over a rusty cross-beam? in New Zealand! Acting is as wooden as a deck, unfortunate letter, one predictable liner, completely inept, the villains have holes in it, through which you can go by boat. <br /> <br /> It seems that never ending a wave of this kind of rip off straight into the video garbage that pollutes the late night TV slots and containers with DVD drinks in supermarkets around the world (although even this movie is so bad that it is still has not seen the DVD yet, but give it time!) Is there any chance for at least half decent performance, half reliable and most important ORIGINAL?!? No, I thought not ...
