I must say this before revealing the "monster". saying that it really did not fit into this category, just a strange thing that had an irritating squeal! And personally, I think grandmother could get away from it, but anyway. Actually, I was entering this movie, although having the main character as a drunk and addicted to the heroine did not come as an appeal. But such scenes as when escaping from the train and you can see that the character at the door was a little scary, also where the guard was just killed, and the "monster" put his hand on the screen. <br /> <br /> But then the catastrophe got stuck in the moment of revealing the monster, which became your average horror, with limited thrills and horror. I slowly became more bored and wanted to turn it off. As most people say that they support the homeless, especially the guy, he gave me some cheap laughs here and there. I think this movie could be something special, but it has become what all other horror movies are nowadays! Just boring and not worth the money. <br /> <br /> if you are looking for a cheap fear here and there or a mindless gore festival (which is limited, almost none at all) give it to him, but for all of you serious observers of horrors look elsewhere, much better movies.
