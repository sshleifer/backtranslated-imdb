'A Smile LIke Yours' is a pathetic comedy that does not make sense. I do not mean that the story was complicated, but the whole plot is based on one thing: a desperate and costly unsuccessful attempt to conceive children. People who tried so much had to forget about the possibility of adoption, which this film is not good at. <br /> <br /> Lauren Holly plays Jennifer Robertson, a total contradiction with what the women's liberation movement offers, showing almost no sense of independence. She is quite a boring figure as a dreamy housewife with absolutely nothing but having children. Greg Kinnear, like the romance comedy of the fifties of the 50s, is her surrendered husband who also does not show personality, independence and no interest in us. <br /> <br /> They are the two most boring and often annoying characters, and they hardly touch the themes of comedies, which should present themselves with many disasters that should result from the fact that the couple does everything to get pregnant. Except they do not really do anything except go to the fertility clinic and spend a lot of money to do what they could do in their own privacy (except in vitro fertilization). The story almost does not allow any unfortunate accidents, because, well, the couple do nothing to create a bizarre situation. They just go to this clinic. So what? <br /> <br /> These topics are aimed at checking the loyalty of the couple, an essential moral element of the story, because the couple plan to raise their children together. Jennifer works with her friend in a store with a new age (played by Joan Cusak) and develops aphrodisiacs. Christopher MacDonald plays an intrigued buyer, and Jennifer is a promising negotiator of an attractive price for her and her friend. This thread does not offer much interest (although Joan Cusak is quite funny on the restaurant scene). <br /> <br /> Danny (Kinear) is an architect who has the opportunity to earn extra money to cover clinical calculations, taking a job in Seattle, where his boss is a stupid seducer (also another hopeless, helpless female character) who tries to affect Danny (as stupid as he) to have an affair with her when things are rocky with him and his wife (for reasons I do not want to give away). Jill Hennesy is good in this role, but her character is too predictable and too formular, like a much-needed element to create a conflict for Danny. This is stupid and once again, not very interesting. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is completely boring and it is not funny at all (save the restaurant scene and the flight). The plot does not offer anything that really attracts attention. Even if the whole story concerned two people who are trying to get pregnant, the authors could come up with some funny misfortunes that could develop from this. Second, the main characters are completely boring. They are complete silouhettes of silly comedies from the 1950s with a happy wife and unconscious husband. Thus, even without the mishaps present in the storyline, the characters themselves do not offer anything interesting, let alone funny. <br /> <br /> Joan Cusak should be at the forefront, and someone else should take part in Kinnear. Cusak would make even a bad story very funny (because sometimes he plays the lead role). This is definitely one of the reasons to give up.
