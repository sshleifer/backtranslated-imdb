First watched 5/17/2002 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Ewald Andre Dupont): Quite a short report from the Titanic crash is the first filmed version of this very promised event. Replication of a catastrophe is not bad, but the drama around it is sometimes stupid, badly kept and too soapy. The story is very similar to the newest award-winning Oscar, except that we showed how the crew tried to hide the real catastrophe that took place almost too late. Good only for nostalgia purposes and for the sense of what James Cameron competed with (barely?) In his recreation.
