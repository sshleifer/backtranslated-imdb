The perfect murder is thwarted when the wife (played by Mary Ellen Trainor, once the wife of director Robert Zemeckis, who led the episode) who murders her husband with poker, has the misfortune to receive a visitor when the body is to move outside escaped from a crazy madman wearing a suit Saint Nicholas (played by the crafty hideous Larry Drake). She is fighting for her life, trying to find a way to hide her husband's corpse. He decides to use an ax when he drops the murderer of Santa Claus, who longs for a few chances to chop off a woman's head to frame the murderer for her husband's murder. Santa's killer closes her in the closet and chases the woman's daughter as she tries desperately to free herself to save her child. <br /> <br /> This episode of TALES FROM THE CRYPT simply processes the tired material with the old Santa Kills theme, while adding the murder of a woman-her-husband-to-be-married-often-used (add nauseum) - beauty - with routine. Essentially, Trainor tries to find a way to avoid catching a dead body that kills while maintaining a safe distance from the maniac. There is nothing refreshing or new in this story that almost goes through the movements. Not one of the main attractions of the program.
