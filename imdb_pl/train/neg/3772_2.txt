I just saw Dick Tracy and thought it was horrible. Images in the background of cities looked terrible. Mafia characters also looked too strange. Warren Beatty did not do terrible work as Dick Tracy, but he definitely did not belong to his better performances. Madonna should just stick to the song. Glenne Headly did a good job in this movie. I gave this movie 2/10 only because of the amazing acting of Al Pacino. In his career, it was not a high note, but he still did a good job.
