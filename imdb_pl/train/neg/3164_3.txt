Vulgar Eva Longoria dies on the day of the wedding, when an angel's ice sculpture (without wings) falls on the back of the truck and kills her. He tries to ruin the relationship of his ex-boyfriend with his new girlfriend, the psyche, who can see her. <br /> <br /> An obvious non-original movie would not be bad in a trivial way, except that the Form of Longoria is hateful and nasty that it exhausts all the fun of the movie. It's like cleaning your ears with sandpaper. To be honest with Longoria, or anyone else in the cast or crew, is not a problem, his horrible god script saps the proceedings. It's really really stupid.
