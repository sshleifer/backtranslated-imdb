Falsely accused, chasing after the skirt John Wayne (as John Scott) and Eddy Chandler (as Kansas Charlie) change their identity to "Alias ​​Smith and Jones". Mr. Wayne becomes "John Jones". Mr. Chandler is to be "Rev. Smith, "but Wayne calls him" Dr. Smith ". They are never as funny as Roger Davis, Pete Duel, Jonathan Harris or Ben Murphy; though Wayne can be considered infinitely more successful than any of them, wise in his career. Pretty blonde Mary Kornman (as Anne), grown up since the time of "Our Gang", is a lovely interest of Wayne. She and Chandler have some lovely scenes with Wayne. If you're not a fan of John Wayne's low-budget movies from the thirties, this movie will not make you.
