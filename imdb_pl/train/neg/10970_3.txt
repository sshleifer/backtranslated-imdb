This is absurd - except for a friend from Australia who reviewed the film, I can not help thinking that everyone who has sent the review so far has somehow been involved in the production of Elektra, considering how generous they were from their praise . <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan of converting comics to movies, so I did not meet many expectations, but I still considered Elektra incredibly disappointing. What irritated me the most was the fact that the movie was SO MUCH, which was unexplained, which left you thinking "huh, what's the meaning of it for the story?" Or "how was this aspect of the character created?" just hope that these are things that maybe are somewhat explained in Daredevil, which I have no intention of watching. <br /> <br /> In addition, the characters' behavior in this movie seems to do o-face for random moments that fit the story, and do not even make me start with a completely meaningless romantic sub-story. I also (still) scratch the head of the character of Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, which seems to be unexplained. <br /> <br /> If I could give this movie anything, it would have to be a fantastic location where it was filmed, but otherwise I did not enjoy the Elektra. I know we should suspend our disbelief for fantasy / action movies, but almost everything in this movie was so unbelievable or misleading (even by the standards of the action movie) that it just frustrated me. <br /> <br /> Well, hell, at least Jennifer Garner looks damn good.
