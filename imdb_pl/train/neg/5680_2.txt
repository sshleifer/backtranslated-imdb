If at least cruelty and ripped deaths had a purpose in history to justify their inclusion, the script was simply unintelligible and simply stupid. <br /> <br /> There was nowhere, history did not have a clear continuity. It was just a few pointless snuff scenes and a really stupid tip, as if they said: "end * signal * you my hatred and my few defenders for watching my rubbish." <br /> <br /> I do not understand this, a masked murderer, who never took off his mask in prison, the prison rape scene that was supposed to be the guards who raped an ugly, deformed serial killer and killed by him and nothing more? no explanation, no punishment, really poor main cop figure, which was a loss of an actor like Pare who did not try to take off the guy who killed his cops, tortured a child, a woman and a dog and sent them to you on video. <br /> <br /> Policemen who for an unknown reason set out in the dark alone (individually) in their home on the farm at night, like a group of poorly written teenage characters who are about to be killed like a bunch of idiots, and no other policeman he hears them dying in the dark, one by one, and they just wander around without a reason until they are killed in turn. <br /> <br /> A bunch of horrible snuff scenes at the beginning, for no reason or explanation, did he mention whether he watched to masturbate or was it a comedy ... what was it? Nope Boll thought to throw it in to upset the animal lovers ... whatever. <br /> <br /> then Pare, believing that the word of the psychic path will allow his family to leave if he kills himself ... a more credulous, stupid policeman whom you have never seen in a movie. <br /> <br /> I do not know why I try not to hate his works. I'm trying to find a reason to explain the art of horror writers, but these things ... pure nonsense. <br /> <br /> Boll, what are you doing? I hope you understand this because I know many more deserving people who can not dream to get a budget that you keep repeating to create movies. <br /> <br /> If you want to see Bolla really in his best checking, "Postal" was fine.
