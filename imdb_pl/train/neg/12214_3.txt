What can I say about this film that it's great to see so many Asian faces. In the film, I did not like that it was full of stereotypes about what typical racial characters would do in their role. An Asian who is not sure who must play with someone else to get ahead, a white guy enchanted by Asian culture and decides to leave his white world behind a yellow country and "keeping him a real black taxi driver". In addition, all products from coke, Shanghai and dunkin were too obvious. The story itself was fun, but to a large extent like I thought that this story would develop. On the other hand, while watching romantic comedies, you can not expect much, but again I would just be surprised. Parents are the best part of the movie.
