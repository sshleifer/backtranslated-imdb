Bo Derek's debut film remained invisible for eight years? and it should remain so! John Derek was a competent actor, but as a director he is practically Edem Wood from erotic cinema? this is not particularly clear, considering that Bo (unusually sports dark hair) was only 16 when the film was made! Jan also wrote and photographed it; the latter results in a decent film material from the Greek island against which the narrative is set? but the conspiracy is childish and cruel dialogue! <br /> <br /> The character played by the male leader Peter Hooten grew up with the family Bo: They grew up as brother and sister, but now that they were teenagers, the couple found that they are attracted to each other (but, as I said, do not expect any sexual fireworks!). But the worst of it is that the characters are obsessed with the whole movie, which is not only stupid but annoying in their tenacity? Hooten wants to transform the remote fishing community into a modernized seaside resort and expects a cruise liner to appear (which of course takes place in the final); Is Derek's even sharper? I want to have a large antique bathtub !! As a reminder, marriage is a marriage before the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> The city mayor and photographer lothario who wants to make a model from Bo (and who is obviously suffering the wrath of the jealous Hooten) does not participate in the events. Sometimes, without a very important reason, we even treat fragments from the screenings of old Hollywood classics in the open-air cinema, where the entire city gathers (among the titles shown is THE PUBLIC ENEMY [1931])! At the end of the day, while Bo's naivety is undoubtedly adorable, it is not enough to offset the overwhelming boredom and amateurishness of the film.
