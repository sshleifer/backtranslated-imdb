The second renaissance, part 1, let's show how machines first rebelled against people. It all starts with a single case in which machines claim that they also have the right to life, while people claim that the robot is something they own and that is why they can do anything they want. <br /> <br /> Although this is an interesting premise, the story becomes really stupid (violent!) The riot between robots and humanity. Somehow it does not seem right, as another reviewer points out, everything is a bit too clever. <br /> <br /> The animatrix stories that remain close to the matrix core (especially Osiris) work on the best. As for the second renaissance part 1, I would say that it is too violent and too stupid. 4/10.
