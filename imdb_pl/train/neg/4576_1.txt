At first glance, this document / fiction / cartoon is quite funny and provocative. Of course, when something provokes thinking, you can analyze it. In fact, this film combines metaphysics with innuendos and groundless conclusions. The connection that "What the Bleep ..." would like to see between science and spirituality is not really rooted in science. The study of transcendental meditation mentioned in the film argues that group meditation can in this case reduce crime in a given area. In fact, the HRA crime rate (Homicides, Rapes and Assaults) was around 30% higher in 1993. Than the average crime rate between 1988 and 1992. During the study there was absolutely no drop in the homicide rate. In fact, any claim that links metaphysics with science can and has been refuted. <br /> <br /> This conclusion shows that this film is either a poor attempt to indoctrination people or a joke. Anyway, I suggest you do not waste time. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a long science movie that could provoke thoughts, you can consider Mindwalk (1990).
