What can I say. Kamal Hassan's film is horrible. It's very good, but it's a horrible story, along with a terrible direction. In my kind opinion, director Gautham Menon has to give up directing. There is a lot of tragedy in the whole film. Besides, you can not just believe how real these horrible crimes were. The film was not practical. Gautham's history ends. But both Kamal Hassan and Jyothika behave very well. The villains look too ugly, though their performances were not bad. I do not think it's a Sunday afternoon movie, like Padayappa, which you can see with your family. You will not get a dream seeing this movie !! However, Harris Jayaraj did a great job again and that's why I gave this movie 4 out of 10. His song "Partha Modail Nallae" is full of soul and soothing. In addition, great cinematography. In general, it is a bad, bad movie. I think that Kamal Hassan should have rejected this film.
