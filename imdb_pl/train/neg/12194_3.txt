The film starts with a voice that tells the audience where they are and who the characters are. And at the moment I started not to like the movie. Thanks to all the infinite possibilities of a film director, I really think that it is a very easy and cheap solution to express the situation with a voice that says everything. I believe that the transformation of voice is a betrayal of the concept of film making. <br /> <br /> I hate hearing when we say where we are, where we are, and especially what heroes feel and think about. I believe that the director needs to find a visual way to convey the feelings and thoughts of the audience's heroes. <br /> <br /> But after a bad introduction, a very effective movie starts that takes quite a long time. The life of a middle class family and all members is individually presented in a perfect, realistic way. I think the director has the talent to capture real situations. For example, a father who needs to make private conversations from a bathroom may initially seem abnormal, but life itself leads us to certain situations that may seem abnormal, but also very normal. I think the director is a very good observer of real life. <br /> <br /> But that's all. After a while, the realism of the film begins to sacrifice the story. I really felt that I had a big headache because of the protagonists' conversations. It was as if the actors and actresses were given a theme and allowed to improvise the dialogues. This is really realistic, but the characters always ask "really, is it like that" etc. Or the characters saying "no" or "do you listen to me", ten times, once you only say it, it's enough that my head hurts. <br /> <br /> I also think that exercise and reading books is more than they should. I understand that art and the book in the film are very much related to the story, but I think the director missed the moment when he should stop showing these scenes.
