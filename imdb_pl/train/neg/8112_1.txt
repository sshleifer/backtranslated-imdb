Hanna-Barbera sucks life from another famous real estate. Violence is relaxed, stories are formulated, animation is bad, music is unpleasant and repetitive, and to be honest, the performance is simply not funny. <br /> <br /> At this time, HB puts each of his series through the same stereotypical situations, regardless of whether it fits the cartoon world or not. So Popeye and Bluto appear in the repeating segment as cavemen ("Hey! Popeye is popular, and Flinstoni are popular. Combine them and you can not miss them!"). Besides, in the seeming rip-off of "Private Benjamin", Olive Oyl and the Goon have a regular segment that presents them as new army recruits. Seriously! Why? <br /> <br /> Increasing the annoyance rate is public service announcements in each episode (standard practice during cartoons, but still annoying). Popeye tells his nephews that they are safely crossing the street, processing and are you ready for it? - dangers of smoking! (I swear I will not come up with it.) <br /> <br /> The only charm that remains of the original cartoons is the fact that Jack Mercer, Popeye's voice from the first days, continues this role here. <Br /> <br /> It's worth checking only once to gain new recognition for old Fleischer shorts. Otherwise, avoid at all costs.
