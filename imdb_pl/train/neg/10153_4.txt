SLASHERS (2 out of 5 stars) <br /> <br /> Not a good movie ... but I liked the idea ... and the creators of the movie made it look pretty good, considering the small budget I had to work. The movie is allegedly a "live episode" from the Japanese reality show, which sends several players to a closed "danger zone" and has three costume creatures sent to them to kill them. Survivor, if there is one, gains fame and fortune ... everyone else just ends their lives. The main disadvantage of this movie is that the game is very bad. None of the "real" people ever seems real. Actors playing killers are funny ... because they depict the tacky caricatures of popular contemporary horror films ... and that's exactly what they'll do if it's a real show. The film pretends that it is done at once ... there is one operator who follows the players around the "danger zone" and everything is visible from the point of view of his camera ... but the lights are flashing and turn off constantly (to hide "cuts" from one to the other, I imagine).
