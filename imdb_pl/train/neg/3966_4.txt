I admit that I am not a connoisseur who is my partner, but a well-prepared, clever movie is worth the time. My disputes, in short: <br /> <br /> - The dialogue is often weak and sometimes unbelievable coming from a given character. <br /> <br /> - Unconvincing acting. <br /> <br /> - The story never really caught on fire. <br /> <br /> The writers pulled out pieces from half a dozen mainstream movies, thrown into the kettle, cooked not enough, and tried to feed us with poor saps of the resulting mess, al'dente. /> <br /> Long and short, although it is absolutely terrible, it definitely was not worth absorbing one of my NetFlix rentals.
