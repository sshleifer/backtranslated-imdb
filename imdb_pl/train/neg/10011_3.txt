This film tells us that a man's escort engages in an investigation into the murder that took place in the circle of wives of powerful men. <br /> <br /> I thought "The Walker" would be exciting and engaging, but I was wrong. Stimulation is painfully and incredibly slow, that even after 40 minutes of the movie, nothing happens. Seriously, the first hour can be reduced to ten minutes. It is so slow. <br /> <br /> The fact that he lacks emotions or action scenes, worsens boredom. It's almost shocking that even the quarrel scenes are so simple and emotionless. Maybe it's because of the stiff upper lip of the upper social class? <br /> <br /> It is sad that "The Walker" becomes such a boring mess, despite such a strong cast. Blame him for the poor storyline and even worse pace.
