This movie is the worst movie I've ever seen ... it's humorous, how bad it is. All the time I watched him, I was expecting music, and the doctor started dancing ... (I've seen porn with a better plot) When a raptor tried to get to the door, I think someone was throwing a plastic doll out of the door about 2 feet away. But as I said, it's so bad that you have to watch it so you can see how bad it explains to me that it will not do anything compared to watching it. I do not recommend renting it, but if it appears on TV, watch for about 30 minutes to see what I mean. I could not watch more than 30 minutes, but if you can sit through the whole thing, you have good will
