If you like watching what must have started as a 2-hour movie in unrelated instability series, you'll love this movie. Otherwise, you are just wondering how they could make such a movie from something so simple that it can be translated into a big screen as Inspector Gadget. <br /> <br /> The film preview shows a lot of scenes, not in the movie and in the movie, some scenes just do not make sense. Although the movie is a bit shorter than an hour and a half, I can only think of one really unforgettable moment, i.e. just before or during the subtitles! <br /> <br />
