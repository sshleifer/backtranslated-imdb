This exquisite fusion of New Age slurry and horribly wrong filming may not "open" you, borrow one of your favorite verbs of the film, but may leave your jaw relaxed and your stomach ache from laughter or reflexes. Based on the best-selling book by James Redfield, the first (own) published in 1993, this horn of kitsch abounds in the spiritual awakening of an American history teacher (Matthew Settle) who travels to the deepest, darkest, loudest Peru and sniffs either air or something even more illegal. Namely, what he discovers is schlock Shangri La populated by smiling zombies that may be nutty or simply heavily treated, perhaps because they are often accompanied by a panpipe bloom and an occasional scream from the heavenly choir. Although much is said about "energy", there is definitely a lack of quality in a dense cast whose numbers are Thomas Kretschmann, Annabeth Gish, Hector Elizondo and Jurgen Prochnow, all of whom are now firmly embedded in the pantheon of the camp. For those who care, the plot concerns the army, terrorists and the Roman Catholic Church; Armand Mastroianni assured the inefficient direction while Mr. Redfield, Barnet Bain and Dan Gordon wrote the bang of the script. In short, the worst movie watched over 40 years of watching movies.
