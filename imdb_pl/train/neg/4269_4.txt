Sometimes the premise starts well, but due to the need to replant, to meet the needs of the public suffering from attention deficit disorder, it transforms into a chaotic mess. And for the three respected actors who worked better before and after, it is a deadly shame. <br /> <br /> So let's see. The premise: a loving couple who lives in a beautiful home is threatened by a bad policeman. Interestingly, at least. Make the captivating policeman be a bit worried, why not. It was well done at THE HAND WHO ROCKS THE CRADLE and SINGLE WHITE FEMALE and it's a proven ticket to a successful thriller. <br /> <br /> Now the dilemma lies. Create a disturbing story that actually interferes with bringing a real threat to the main characters, never going so far as to look ridiculous, or give up appearances, strengthen the shock factor and make that cop so extreme any other super-villain who he has been in cinemas since silent times. <br /> <br /> Producers and directors chose the latter. In this way, a film is created - badly made, in which the actors try their happiest roles and tails in the roles they have previously described, and nothing smaller.
