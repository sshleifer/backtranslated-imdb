Anything that could potentially be interesting in this material is drowned in the first seconds, with the proviso that the events we will soon see will never be known and "This is a whisper [rumor] most often told" about one of the most sensational "secrets of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Okay. So we do not receive anything new (and "Mysteries & Scandals" from E! Gives better support in a specific incident ... and this is not any approval). What do we get? <br /> <br /> We learn that Hollywood is a nest of vipers and decadents. No important news. More interestingly, we find out what the ejected director is willing to do to regain power in the entertainment and / or political industry. The question arises whether Peter Bogdanovich speaks from his own experience through these characters. But what has been said is so cynical, ugly and confusing, we have remained guilty for being a witness to the hooey band that is going through history. <br /> <br /> The tone of the film has a strange, crazy quality, which turned out to be more annoying than fun. We are not empathic towards anyone. And the great Citizen Kane improves the relationship between Davies and Hearts in a much more convincing way. In "The Cat's Meow," we're not sure about Davies's motives to be with Hearst. As soon as we were told one thing, she does something else. <br /> <br /> And should we believe that Davies was a lover of the chaplain's life? Or maybe he's just trying to push away one of the most powerful - and apparently moronic - citizens of America. The film never explains this. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are convincing. There is a glorious holiday in the clothes of the yacht and the era. I see more from the construction of men's jacket flaps than from a story that captivates many of the most famous personalities in Hollywood history. Nobody will remember that the script is pure fiction. The reservations that make up the film frame make it even more uncertain and unsatisfying. <br /> <br /> Contractors can not be faulted, although Meg Tilly is talking about a parody. Kirsten Dunst never fails. It gives the most sincere performance in the sea of ​​scenery chewing. Only Joanna Lumley rises above the material, but so much that it seems that she distances herself from the whole enterprise instead of telling it. One of her first lines is: "I'm not here!" And I'm sure she would like her not to be. <br /> <br /> This is not compatible with cheesy, yes-bad-good-Bogdanovich's "At Long Last Love". He is trying to do something serious, but hesitates and stumbles mainly because he is full of bitterness to the "beast" named Hollywood. This is the movie "National Enquirer". And this not only marks the names of those who put the film on the board of Oneida this weekend, but the audience is also very dirty.
