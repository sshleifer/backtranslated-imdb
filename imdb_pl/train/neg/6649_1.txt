OK, anyone who can honestly say that this movie was great or even good is either a fantasy or a director, scriptwriter and producer, and tries to revive the movie. I watched a movie because my friend was working on it and it was horrible. I am an actress and I have been working in the industry for some time in big movies and even independent films and this film bores me to tears. The reason why I am so harsh is that this movie was clearly another movie "Of Mice and Men" and they should sue because it is such a horrible stripping of history. In an industry where Hollywood seems to be a creative bankrupt ... for someone who would take a classic book and "Of Mice and Men" and destroy it with a new spin, it hurts so much. Actors, accents, dialogue and direction were amateurish, and writing was bleak. My point is that if you decide to have a new spin on an existing story, make sure it is as good or better than the original, so that the new spin is justified. I did not like this movie.
