Oh, for loud crying, it must be THE LATEST movie I've seen all year round, and I'm sorry that the normally amazing John Cusack was even involved in this mindless, frail piece of Stupidity. Where Sleepless in Seattle has provided what is supposed to be the same message, although at a more subtle, slightly more mature level, Serendipity delivers it with a blacksmith's hammer, and then enters your psyche for the next arduous hour and a half (and this is one and a half hours of my life I will never come back, thank you very much !!). Bad enough that the main characters in this film have a level of emotional maturity of fourteen-year-olds (actually I know better fourteen-year-olds ...), except perhaps Jeremy Piven, who was pleasant enough. Only the first 15 minutes of the movie, in which the character Kate Beckinsale plays this annoying stupidity of the game of throwing all sensitivity to the wind (literally), had my best friend, and I irritated unbelievable. I told my husband, Rockstar, that he had more intelligence, or at least the characters in Rockstar were not half as dysfunctional as idiots in this "Serendipitous" mess. It is annoying to watch characters who seem to have no idea about the choice in their lives, and feel that they are nothing more than puppets of destiny and the whims of fate. How tiring. I am sure that this film will be more liked by those who prefer not to get involved in a chaotic mess, making more complex life choices, and then responsibly living with the consequences. In the end, it is a movie in which our hero and heroine live happily ever after they wreak havoc and misfortune on the lives of two other people (namely their fianc√©s), not to mention other relatives and friends, just for that to get there. <br /> <br />
