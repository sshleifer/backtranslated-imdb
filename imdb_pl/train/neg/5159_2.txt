Watching this movie is like eating a banquet with meringue. Initially, it looks great, but ultimately does not provide satisfaction - lack. <br /> <br /> The plot is a confused mess about the toy factory and the forces of evil. How is it possible that thanks to this basic story and Robin Williams, the film still turns out so bad ?! This is because the picture is completely irrelevant - just like the horrible photo of Popeye that Williams did at the beginning of his film career. The movie had to cost a fortune, but maybe there was not enough money to hire writers who graduated from high school. <br /> <br /> The movie is one unwise joke that lasts and lasts and continues. I'm really not sure why it was created in the first place - it certainly was not created to provide any entertainment.
