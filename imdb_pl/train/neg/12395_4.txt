When I released this film from my work, along with three other similar films. I watched very low expectations then. Now this movie is not bad per se. You get what you pay for. It's a story of love, betrayal, lies, sex, scandal, everything you want in the movie. It's definitely not a Hollywood hit, but it's not that bad for cheap emotions. I will probably never watch this movie again. In short, this is a kind of movie that you can see very late at night at a local TV station that only wants some time, or you would see it on a Sunday afternoon at a local TV station some time. Despite bad actions, stereotypical lines and work in the camera. I did not want to turn off the movie and pretend it never appeared in my DVD player. The story has been done many times in many films. This one is not different, not better, not worse. <br /> <br /> Only your average movie.
