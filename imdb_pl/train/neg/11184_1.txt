It's a really awful movie. <br /> <br /> I'm just writing this to let some people put it aside. If I stop one person from wasting a part of their precious life watching this movie, I will die happy. <br /> <br /> Extremely boring, although since Al Pacino, I was cheated, thinking that something interesting would happen at any moment. Then the loans began to appear and I realized that I was completely cheated by watching this unbelievable drivel. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that this movie has achieved such a high result as in IMDb (over 5 stars when I last saw the vote). Do people vote ironically? <br /> <br /> Please, please, do not watch this movie!
