The most absurd thing about this funny movie is its conceit, that if someone becomes a saint, he or she and his family and his significant other person live forever. Let us forget that in order to become a saint, the saint must be dead and the saints have no significant other. That for a millennium Nick was Jolly Elf, and Fred's Scrooge is never even suggested! Open to Nick learning how to make toys, and then Fred, who will learn to handle numbers; Nick gives the sick child dolly, Fred picks up the car, and the family farm! After several successive episodes, changing today, Fred releases his spleen to the Anonymous Siblings when his companions lose their empathy. That's where I wrote a more coherent plot than this idiocy! <br /> <br /> This Santa Claus, who is "ho, ho, ho, ho" away from the massive coronary, is a neurotic burden burdened with the Queen of the Harpia, the operation straight from Hell Mega-Mall, and the response to the Board (huh?) who just gave Easter Egg its pink egg. Oh, and his right hand is a fair-haired blonde in a tight mini dress and go-go shoes. Ho ... ho ... ho ... ho ... ho! <br /> <br /> But what really sent me was that Slam was named # 1 on the Naughty List. Should the naughty list be reserved for future Hitlers and Stalin? Children who are real embodiments of evil? No, for Old Sausage-Fingers, a good boy who whips because he is unwanted and unloved, is Demon Seed! Bah!
