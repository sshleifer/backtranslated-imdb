This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I've looked at it mainly because of morbid curiosity, since I loved the novel, and I'd like it not. I turned it off after less than an hour, but I wanted to turn it off after five minutes. I would like to have. He often disregards the novel and changes various factors. If the movie can not be bought back in the last 50 minutes (which would be impossible), I would not recommend it. This is an insult to one of the greatest writers of the 20th century. I do not think how many people say that "The Bell Jar" is necessarily impossible, but this particular version could be done without. I would almost like to see this day in the hands of a director and screenwriter who can do it fairly.
