This amazing waste of productive money is proof that rich and famous can be just as stupid and wasteful as politicians. From the (stupid) game of Tennessee Williams and the directing (with the dead hand) of Joseph Losey with Taylor and Burton and Noel Coward - this project filmed in a spectacular cliff house on an island in the Mediterranean must have seemed like a fire Winner presented to Universal in 1967. it is so absurd and tedious that it almost contradicts conviction. Visually, the film is spectacular, but it is the power of nature that allowed the setting and the fact that a real home is used instead of a set. The horrifying phrasing of Taylor squeaking, Burton's half-hour, crazy dialogue, Noel Coward laughing at each other, absurd stories and feature devices, and absurd costumes just annoy the viewer. BOOM is a disgrace, a waste of money and talent, and clear proof that famous people can be idiots, just like the rest of the planet's plebs. Not even great. Just horrible and crazy shocking waste.
