:: POTENCJALNE SPOILERY :: <br /> <br /> Man, this movie was awful. Katolicki / przesÄ…dny / suspensowy thriller, which is already well mastered by previous films. <br /> <br /> Doubting priest. Sex and priesthood. Politics and religion. Church hypocrisy. A conspiracy involving the church. Dawn of a new bad age. All kinds of dark magical voodoo battles between good and evil. <br /> <br /> Pretty stupid and bad with a poor storyline. The story revolves around two concepts: Absolution, better known as the sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick - the last rights a person can ask for to cleanse his sins on the brink of death; And excommunication, the act of cutting a person from the Church. Essentially, an excommunicated person can not receive absolution. So he comes in Zjadaczu Sins, and I will leave it. Put in all the stuff I've already mentioned and you have "The Order". <br /> <br /> I found a sex scene with a priest intertwined with the image of the Mother of God, rather offensive to Catholics. It ends with the statement of Heath Ledger (I paraphrase) "I am the redeemer and the condemnation of sins, I live without love bla bla bla" / cue him walking down a dark alley in a long mantle alla "Matrix". > <br /> I gave this film 1 for not only being shitty and unoriginal, but also because he managed to insult all faith in the process. If you want to see something better, I suggest "The Prophecy" with Christopher Walken.
