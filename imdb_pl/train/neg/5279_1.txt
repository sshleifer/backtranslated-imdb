My friends can usually endure many hopeless films, but this one was too poor for us to even look at. It was so boring and un-original. Even the "hot" girls who played in this film did not let me watch. Everything was simply predictable and irritating. <br /> <br /> Acting was sometimes good ... but more times bad. The most annoying character in the entire movie you wanted to die would have to be the best friend of the main characters. The more I saw him, the more I wanted to break the screen. (You know, what a thick, ugly child I'm saying) <br /> <br /> The plot has been made so many times before I think that they should be sued by other film companies. OK, that's a good idea, but that's all that the movie had. <br /> <br /> In general, this video can only be viewed by you to save any abuse from friends. Or, if you have absolutely nothing better to do.
