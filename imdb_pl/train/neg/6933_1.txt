In relation to other Columbo films, this can only be estimated at 1 (horribly). I really do not understand what other reviewers have seen in this terrifying film crash. It was only after the morbid fascination that I continued to watch him - to see what the director would do next or inaccurate. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer suggested that it was Falk's only directorial performance because it interfered with his role. In fact, I think the real reason is the head of the studio, who must have been terrified when they saw what he did with his money. It is strange that they did not murder him.
