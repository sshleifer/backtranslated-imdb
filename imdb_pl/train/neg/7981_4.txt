The Rookie suffers so much. The film features random music, a long pointless script and a rather embarrassing slapstick to make Jerry Lewis blush. Noonan and Leavitt simply do not know when to leave. Before the story reaches the main story, the characters have to spend an entire hour, and the characters are broken. Then the boys start playing Japanese sailors with a standard racist caricature of the day. It is a pity that the funniest parts of the movie are when Noonan and Leavitt play stupid, stereotypical Japanese. But after switching between two sets of characters it becomes quite tiring. Then it suddenly ends. Even naked Julie Newmar in a towel can not save it. <br /> <br /> There is really little charm in the movie and it's over half an hour too long. The story just staggers, trying to create a funny situation and a failure. Hold on to Martin and Lewis. At least Deano had charm, and Jerry had this animated face.
