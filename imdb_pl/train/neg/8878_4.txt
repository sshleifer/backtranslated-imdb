Judy Holliday hit gold in 1950 with George Cukor's film version of "Born Yesterday", and from that point on, her career was about finding the right material to let her get gold again. <br /> <br /> never happened. In "It Should Happen to You" (by the way I can not come up with a darker title), Holliday makes one more variation on a stupid blonde who maybe is not that stupid, but everything in this movie is warmed and half-hearted. Even Jack Lemmon, I think, was his first film role, he can not collect enough energy to revive this comedy from recycling. The audience knows how the movie will end virtually from the very beginning, so it's mainly just sitting and waiting for the movie to catch up. <br /> <br /> Maybe if you're in love with Holliday, you'll like it; otherwise I would not bother. <br /> <br /> Class: C
