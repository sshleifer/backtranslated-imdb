We have two incomprehensible children here who have never had a chance for a cruel, poverty-stricken existence: Robin Hoods, distinguished by police for persecution, because they were sometimes wild things. Reptile! According to this shit, Bonnie was the sweetest little river west of Missouri, which he had learned to be a psychopathic killer by a fun-loving boyfriend who did not really want to hurt anyone ... he just wanted things without putting much energy into them. Poorly preserved, badly filmed, unbelievable dialogue, unrealistic use of weapons, gore that looked more like jelly from grapes than real. Avoid this bilgewater. Thumbs down. -5 stars.
