John Pressman (Micheal 'I should be called Ditech' Lerner) works in a doctor's office as an orderly. His mother (Zelda 'Poltergeist' Rubenstein) hypnotizes him to depart from people who think they hurt him. But it turns out to be a movie in a movie, but the lines are quickly blurred when John goes to the cinema to kill. Prompting a guy who watches a movie to do the same. Lerner is appropriate in this situation, but Zelda repeats the dialog lines over and over again. It annoys quickly. But not as annoying as two girls who watch a movie in a movie. As a horror film, this movie fails, it is too busy to be wise, trying to convey a message and it seems that it forgets about the movie tension, or at least a jump or two. No, what we have here is the worst kind of slass: House of art. <br /> <br /> My class: D +
