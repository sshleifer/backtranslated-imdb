I recently saw it at Palm Springs International Film in 2009. This is the feature-length debut of the veteran of the Dutch actress Monique van de Ven and based on my observations it should be her last. I hate films that are so unbelievable that you choose virtually every scene. This film immediately leaves you scratching your head. when a young photographer begins and his girlfriend, who works for an international aid organization, carelessly drive through the Taliban-controlled mountains of Afghanistan, talking about his love, when the rocket stops the truck in front of them. They leave the vehicle to observe how Talliban fighters equipped with rocket launchers, machine guns, rifles, pistols and grenades execute all five people in the truck. Bob (Waldemar Torenstra) starts taking pictures of all this when he is noticed by one of the insurgents who throws them with a grenade that kills his girlfriend. because they are in the distance of throwing hand, they can not be more than 50 yards, but he somehow escapes. His girlfriend is blown up and takes a picture of the moment of the grenade hit, which kills her and wins the award as the photographer of the year for the photo. Every scene and situation in this film is as absurd as opening up. The following year, Bob is assigned to National Geographic on the Dutch resort island, where he meets Kathleen (Sophie Hilbrand) and puts himself in her dingy underworld of international drug smugglers. Avoid this movie. I would give him 4.0 out of 10.
