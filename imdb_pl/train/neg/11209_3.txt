This bland mini operetta with the Eddy-McDonald prototype in the Valentino scenario is so bad that after five minutes it becomes a endurance exercise. It is stupid, because this brevity opens two military men discussing the lack of manhood at the son of one of the officers. In less than a minute, he is packed into Morocco, where he lives a double life as the Red Shadow; leader of an Arab tribe who prefers to sing rather than fight. <br /> <br /> Alexander Gray and Bernice Clare have excellent light operatic voices (with little acting ability) and there's also decent bass, but acting is such a chaotic scene, so badly prepared, you get the feeling that they're doing everything, like they go further. <br /> <br /> These two were part of a larger stage production that includes a list of six writers. With more room for falsification and warning, the show could have some entertainment value, but this hurried quickie is just an insult to the audience waiting for the presentation of the function.
