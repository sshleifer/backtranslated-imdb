If there was a strange reverse Oscar festival, this movie would win anything. He has all the gods, a great story, extreme special effects combined with unusually good acting skills, and of course there is a star superstar in every role. Well, it could be a scenario if the world is reversed, but it is not. Instead, it is the worst horror ever made, not only bad actors who seem to read scenarios from the teleprinter with evil dyslexia, but also very few special effects. For example, a devil costume (which is obligatory) is the most fun thing I've ever seen. Whenever I saw a red-black so-called monster on the screen, I could not stop laughing. And besides, it looked like the fun creature was transported by a conveyor belt. <br /> <br /> Do not make the same mistake as me. Checking the IMDB, seeing that the film was released in 2003, He had less than five votes and thought: - "Well, it's worth doing, it can not be that bad." <br /> <br /> Yes, maybe. <Br> I'm not even going to waste more words on this movie.
