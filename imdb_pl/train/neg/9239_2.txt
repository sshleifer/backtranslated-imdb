Heavenly Days is committing a serious comedy faux pas: she is desperate to teach us the lessons of civic education and will not end until we pass the final exam. Fibber McGee and Molly go on a trip to Washington, where they see the senate in action (or inaction if you prefer), spit with their senator (Eugene Palette in one of the worst roles in his career), get acquainted with a group of annoying stereotypical refugee children and meet a man on the train reading Henry Wallace's book. Henry Wallace !! A year later, he was considered to be close to communists, but in 1944 he was OK. Add to this really awful musical moments, lots of hooey with flags and a boring thread about press journalists, and you have a movie that had to have Philip Wyli ready to write Generation of Vipers 2: D.C. Boogaloo. Drastically inaccessible, Heavenly Days is another reminder that the devil has all the best melodies.
