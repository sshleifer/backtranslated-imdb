Slashers ..... well, if you like horror movies, you definitely have to see them, otherwise do not even bother. It's perfectly obvious that this movie has an exceptionally low budget, for example it looks like the whole movie was shot somewhere in the magazine, and on many occasions you'll see the shadow of a mike boom, and the camera supports the shadow, believe me you do not have to look for them . Also, try to ignore the shoddy actors if you call it that! The basic outline is a few people who decide on a game show in which they have to live the night in a big labyrinth, because they are three assassins in the wild, and whoever is finally rich is live. Now there is something in this movie that makes you watch and rarely happen with cheap budget horror today, for example, when I watched it, I thought I would not mind going to this game ! especially for $ 12,000,000. so in any case, I recommend that you look at it and decide.
