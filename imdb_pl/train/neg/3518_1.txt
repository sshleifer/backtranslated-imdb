I saw this movie with my rock climbing instructor, and the whole thing was so absurd that I could not wait. (First, if Stallone climbs himself, there is no need to wear any equipment, but I think that these hanging karabiners look a bit like a "mountain climber", so let's throw them in). For those lobotomized people who think that Colorado looks like Dolomites in Italy (where the film was filmed), well, Hollywood magnates have a lot more funny and stinking things to swallow.
