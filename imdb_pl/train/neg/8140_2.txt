I saw this film in a mysterious scientific theater, which was called "Live at night". This title is much less misleading than "Batpeople". In fact, it would be more accurately called Batperson. This movie is about a doctor who is studying bats, I think because he wants to better treat rabies. This is not clear. It is clear that he and his wife are visiting the cave and are bitten by a bat. Why a scientist must go on a trip to study bats? Should not he be able to enter alone. Well, after a bite, he and his wife are going to the honeymoon, where he begins to attack. They go to the worst doctor in history. The guy stays in the hospital and kills the nurse. In the end, the guy kills 3-4 people, and his wife is standing next to him, and you should cheer on him instead of the sheriff investigating the murder.
