I find this film quite strange. From the very beginning, I liked this film very much, and now, after a brief reflection on it, I can very accurately determine the reason. Jean-Marc Barr, although I love him to pieces (I think Zentropa is one of the best films in history), he's quite unsuccessful here and although I can not imagine a life that would be better, I'm sure someone could easily take his place and make this movie work. Everything else is fine, except for the quarrel in a weak comedy (A Meet The Parents Joke is not really needed, the filmmakers!) And I really like Richard E. Grant as a British major. He just suffers from one thing. Jean-Marc.
