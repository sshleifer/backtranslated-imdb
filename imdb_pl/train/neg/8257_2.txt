"A Gentleman's Game" uses golf in a country club to illustrate the discovery of a teenager about honesty, prejudice and other life lessons. I thought several times that I knew where this movie was going, but it turned out that I was wrong. Unfortunately, I'm not sure if the filmmakers knew where it was going. The decisive moment in this film is probably the scene in which Gary Sinise mocks "The Karate Kid" and refutes all imaginations that he will become a mentor of an adolescent golfer. It's refreshing, in a sense, that this movie does not want to follow the majority of simplified and overworked film formulas. However, too much of it is still invented. In one fell swoop, people abandon any semblance of politeness or do not keep up with the things they believe in, or are exposed to something much less respectable than their place in society. Unfortunately, there are often no solutions to these moments. And with the exception of the fact that the club serves as a background for them, there is no real continuity or joining them. It is a pity that the writers and the director could not save a better movie, especially considering some talented actors and the potential in settings.
