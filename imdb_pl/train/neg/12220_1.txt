This movie is actually worse than most movies I've ever suffered, and I suffered a lot. Absolute nonsense. This is a terrible, forced dialogue; purposeless plot changes; really directed scenes of "scary images" that look more like a high school remedy than a horror project; 5/10 in the best attractive women; long, boring erotic scenes with the participation of these women (forget about what you know about virgins, especially those with false breasts on both sides); he muttered, it is difficult to understand the speech of some of the characters; and they actually used masks from Killer Klowns with Outer Space during the masturbation scene, which should be a grace, because this movie was quite funny, but it is not. Veden Fell is the worst evil man in film history. <br /> <br /> Absolutely miss it.
