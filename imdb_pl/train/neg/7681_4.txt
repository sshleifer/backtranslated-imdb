Sean, you know I think you're absolutely the greatest actor in the world, but I can not praise you. Comedy is simply not your strong asset. <br /> <br /> However, this is not all your fault. Some things were simply too difficult to understand. Alfred Lynch did a decent job, but you have to wonder where the lines came from. <br /> <br /> Sean again ... sorry.
