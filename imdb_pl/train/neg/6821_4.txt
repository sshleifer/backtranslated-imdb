It was a good story, but not well said. I liked the themes and the main storyline that was not as clear as it could be. Maybe there was too much and there was no way to control it all. Acting was all right, trashy, some were stronger than others, and even stronger actors had worse quality moments. It took me several months to watch the whole movie because it did not catch my attention, and the flow was just bad. I just finished watching and I'm happy that I did because the movie finally moves and has a certain continuity towards the end. Again a good story, but the delivery was below normal. I recommend it to the storyline and maybe some sweetness to the eyes, and I mean a little.
