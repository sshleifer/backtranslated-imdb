Although the title of this movie is Flying Guillotines, it has no connection with the original Flying Guillotines (1975) and its sequel Flying Guillotines II (1978). The two originals are masterpieces of the kung fu film and still stand out as a classic. This is a much worse copy of the original, and even as a regular kung fu movie, it is below average. <br /> <br /> First of all, this movie does not have much acting. This is one pointless fight scene after another, and the flying guillotine does not even play a significant role in them. The story is about some Shaolin monks who hunt down some villains who started the holy book, and the bad prince who owns part of the book is part of the plot. The same evil prince is going to lure monks and use flying guillotines on them. <br /> <br /> The title has four films with Flying Guillotine. This is in my opinion the smallest quality. The design of the flying guillotine in this movie differs from the other three indicating that this movie was produced by another creature from the other three. <br /> <br /> The film has no chemistry besides being unintentional funny poor production. <br /> <br /> It is best to skip this and view the two originals.
