In a word ... fatal. I give him one star for hippie sex scenes and sweets of women, otherwise forget. Corman's worst effort, without any. Ben Vereen should have his name permanently from the cast. I can not believe that it will now be on DVD (from 2/15/05) with "Wild In The Streets" - another smelly retro. I woke up sick in bed this morning with cold, I decided to watch a movie to cheer me up, scan the digital channels ... the premise looked interesting because I like watching sci-fi movies with B movie, hippie culture and rebellious teenage cinema. It seemed familiar to me, and with Ben Vereen in the cast I thought ... why not? What a big mistake ... it was a terrible start to my day. <br /> <br /> Only after seeing him now I know why knowledge has crept into the recesses of my newly awakened brain. I remembered that I see the upcoming attractions of this film as a 14-year-old (I'm 45), in the early / mid-seventies in Sombrero, a local theater of art that no longer exists ... the entire theater laughed hysterically and even moaned loudly, how bad this movie looks like. Acting: horrible, history: horrible, photos: almost terrible, music: horrible, sound: scary, directing: joke. If you decide to watch it after my warning, remember ... "I told you that." <br /> <br /> "Gass-sss" is the perfect title of this movie ... you feel "gassed" after watching this rotten movie - a maybe you should be taken to the gas chamber to waste your brain. I saw home movies Super 8, which shamed this movie. Definitely a new addition to my top Top Ten WORST movies ... there (downstairs, there) with "Mackami". <br /> <br /> Ted in Gilbert, AZ
