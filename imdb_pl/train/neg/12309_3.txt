It was a disappointing movie. Considering the material life of the army is always good for laughter - and celebrities, this movie should be the fall laughfest. At best, it was worth a few chuckles. Steve Martin was a lot more fun and it looks like Dan Ackroyd should stick to dramatic roles in which he can follow Robin Williams' lead and one day win an Oscar.
