**** LESS SPOILERS *** As an evil film connoisseur, I had to watch hundreds of bad movies, and yet "Hobgoblins" stands out from others in its own unique way. Classic characters like "The Creeping Terror", "The Mighty Gorga" and "Manos" are equally bad from beginning to end. On the other hand, "Hobgoblins" begins to get bad and gets worse. During my first viewing of the infamous rake scene, I thought it was a really bad movie. I was blissfully unaware that I just saw the best in this movie. The film transfers its most massive nose into celluloid hell during the painfully inept sequence of the "Club Scum", which is a continuous sequence of one unhappy joke after another. In this one film, director Rick Sloane proves that he deserves mention next to artists such as Coleman Francis and Bill Rebane as one of the worst directors of all time. How bad can a bad movie be? Follow "Hobgoblin√≥w" and do not hesitate.
