I had to watch this movie because the story was so scandalous and the film met expectations. In fact, makes watching is quite uncomfortable. Unlike other Meyer's films, sexual pranks are kept to a minimum. Some scenes of violence are unnecessarily unjustified and offensive. The plot is chaotic, and some acting and lines are terrible. <br /> <br /> The film is a strange combination of sado-masochistic fantasy combined with a window of brutality and immorality of slavery and fails in all areas. It's as if Meyer tried to make up for sexual exploitation / blackploitation, having a higher moral message. Meyer knows that we feel a little guilty about the glaring dominatrix associations with the early stage showing Lady Susan holding a whip in a provocative outfit. Then he tries to return to the right path, turning it into a movie about the victory of good over evil. However, because they cancel each other out, it ends with nothing. <br /> <br /> Because it's so bad in so many ways, it's really worth watching if you appreciate the art of making a horrible movie in the worst possible taste. Maybe because it's so bad, we almost let Meyer escape the unacceptable.
