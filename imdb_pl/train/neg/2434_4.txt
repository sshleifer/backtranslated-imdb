A realistic movie, of course, except for the fact that the characters do not look scared. When Billy Zane tries to kill someone, she feels bad ... but it does not look like it. That's why I do not like his performance in this movie. Tom Berenger plays the soldier again. Lack of good emotions, realistic sequences. Not always shooting, it's one great thing. Well filmed. I hate the sequence of helicopters, because only one terrorist kills almost the entire sea group ... I give it ** and half of *****
