My personal vision of hell is locked in a room with no way to close my eyes or block my ears, and this movie plays forever on every available space in this room. The whole conviction that Streisand is playing a boy / man is just scratching the surface of how funny the premise of the movie is. The most important thing in watching any movie is the concept of "willing suspense disbelief." . . it can not be done in this movie.
