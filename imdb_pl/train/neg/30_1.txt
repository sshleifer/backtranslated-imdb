I did not like the idea of ​​a female turtle in general since 1987. We knew that TMNT are four brothers with their Splinter teacher, and their enemies, and each of the four brothers is named after a great artist such as Leonardo, Michelangleo, Raphel and Donatello, so Venus here has no meaning or play any important part and I believe that the old TMNT series was much better than the new one that contains Venus. The female turtle will not add any action to the story we like. about TMNT, which we knew in 1987, to have new enemies in each part, is a good point to take certain actions, but to have a female turtle is a very weak point to act, we want to see more new TMNT series, but the same the very characters we knew in 1987, without this female turtle.
