If Deborah Messing was no longer cast as "Grace," it could be a film tolerated. However, this is another story of a frustrated girl with problems who employs a paid escort (Dermot Mulroney), which she reads in an article in a magazine to go to London to marry her sister in London. How new is this conspiracy? <br/> <br /> Neither funny nor romantic, Wedding Date moves through the story of fraudulent sex by the bride and the best man, and paid for the escort to pass the film as Four Hugh weddings, and definitely a dead end for a naive master a young man who does not know the sexual history of his fianc√©e (Amy Adams). While Messing perfected the victimized princess, a 30-year-old woman with a failed relationship history, her neurotic and drunken movements on another artificial beau is simply a repetition of her series. If this woman is an actress, get a role that will not refresh what's already in the best of times. <br /> <br /> Many drunken women, cricket jokes and Mulroney in a towel (nice!), But the movie is boring with an obvious happy ending. Expected sequel Messing: Date of divorce.
