I would like to write about this story, but it was not. I would like to quote a few difficult dialogues from the movie, but "hinglish" is fun only for 5 minutes, and then its exaggeration. I would like to swoon over the "uncertain guess," but it was as predictable as ... um mm, the movie from Yash paradise (?). I would like to talk about the action on the edge of the place, but I do not like cartoons. <br /> <br /> * sigh * <br /> <br /> In summary, this movie is perfect for: 1. people trying to commit suicide - I promise that it will push you over the border 2. Sado-masochists - this movie it is much more effective than the barbed wire worn by the Silas guy in the Da-Vinci code. 3. People researching alternative ways of spreading terrorism - I swear that the audience leaving the room seemed to want to kill someone. 4. Film Piraters: More power for them. If any movies deserve that the audience does not spend money on watching - that's it. 5. Dyes, most types of plankton and green algae - Because almost all other living creatures would require a IQ ratio a bit larger than the film offers. Reflection: of course, the director is a genre of his own. (And I hope that God is the only one of its kind .. enough one) <br /> <br /> Things that could make this movie better: 1. History 2. Choreographer 3. A Scenario Scenario 4. Coordinator stuntman 5. Story (Did I say that already?) 6. Director - preferably one who is not mentally retarded (although even someone who was questioned could do a better job) 7. Anil Kapoor = Bubonic plague - Avoid at all costs 8 Statutory warning - "Watching Yash Raj movies is harmful to mental health"? <br /> <br /> Things that I liked about the film: 1. Kareena Kapoor - For obvious reasons 2 English subtitles - "Mera Dil Kho Gaya" become - "My heart is in a vacuum", "Chaliya Chaliya Chaliya "Turns into" I'm a flirt, I'm a lover, I'm a tramp "... priceless. /> <br /> In short, Tashan is the opposite of the Rubric's cube - the cube is supposed to increase the player's IQ, Tashan promises to lower the IQ, and this ... in just 2.5 hours! Woot! <br /> <br /> * sigh * .. But it's just me. I might be wrong. Nevertheless, you have been warned.
