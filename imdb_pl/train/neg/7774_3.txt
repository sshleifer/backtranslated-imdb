For about half an hour I remember thinking, "Hey, that could be Bill Rebane's best achievement in history!" The opening sequences are atmospheric, immediately horrifying moments appear, and our director in a funny way applies even to his famous smelly "The Giant Spider Invasion". The concept has been shamelessly stolen from William Castle's House on Haunted Hill, where three old and extremely bored millionaires lure nine losers to an isolated mansion to win a million dollars in the elimination game. Of course, the participants begin to disappear quickly and one by one, and the other greedy fools take too much time to realize that old people are sadists ... or that there is another murderer among them. The film begins and ends with a strange narrator telling a lot of senseless things that are not important or even interesting for the plot, but there are also some nice T & A that you can admire in the first ten minutes and this stupid bimbo (Shelly, I think it is called) is really fun observe. After the first half hour, the inevitable happens naturally, and "The Cold" turns into a textbook Rebane-production with delayed twists, the most stupid dialogues and total lack of emotion. There was no budget for bloody murders, but our talented director (?) Tries to compensate for the endless films of disco dance girls and amateur rock band. The film also has four or even five different culminating points, and none of them is somewhat satisfying. Maybe it was inspiration for LOTR: Return of the king? Avoid this movie, you will live longer and happier.
