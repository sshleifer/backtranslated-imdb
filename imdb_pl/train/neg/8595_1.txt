Lucy Alexis Liu and Cillian Murphy are great actors who can certainly face any actor challenge. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, "Watching the Detectives (2007)" offers only one for actors and the public: not to fall asleep during a boring, boring, very predictable and unimaginable story. <br /> <br /> "Watching detectives (2007)" is trying hard to be funny, but the comedy is forced, very poorly directed and embarrassing on the verge of complete ridicule. <br /> <br /> After one-third of the movie, nothing that can capture even the most eager audiences, such as friends and relatives of the director, is even indicated, not to mention that it is actually happening. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure everyone who liked it, faked it or had to fake it, just like Neil's girlfriend did when he showed her an old black and white film she did not care for. "Watching detectives (2007)" is nowhere near B, located somewhere between questions and responses like -Questions? and - Ask questions! The director knows what he is doing! Well, if his goal was to immerse the viewer to death, he did a very good job! <br /> <br /> "Watching detectives (2007)" was a complete waste of time for Lucy Alexis Liu and Cillian Murphy, PRO PLEASE, do not let it be a waste of time! <br /> <br /> Rating: 0 out of 100.
