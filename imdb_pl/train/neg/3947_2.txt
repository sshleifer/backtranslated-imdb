The modesty is strong in the comic. Alexandra Staden, who plays Modesty Blaise, looks more like an anorectic model. There is neither morality nor personality that Modesty has in comics. Modesty would never give a woman advice to show more skin to make more money. I do not see any similarities to my comics with Modesty and this movie. It's like the Mission Impossible movie about Ethan Hunt was locked up in the high school detention room, talking to the janitor, when he went to high school, and Hunta was played by DJ Qualls (on Road Trip). Soo, if you're a fan of Humbleness, you do not see the movie, you're just angry. If you do not know much about the Modesty comics, rent a different movie without losing time on this movie. I can not understand how Quentin Tarantino can put his name on it. I am asking for a refund at my DVD rental tomorrow.
