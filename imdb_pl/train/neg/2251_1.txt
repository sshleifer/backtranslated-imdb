A really amazing pile of pap! <br /> <br /> Predictable, slow movement, destroying the soul, paralyzing the mind, which seems to be cutting your own wrists with a rusty bread knife ... well, almost necessary. <br /> <br /> The acting for a thin dialogue is over, each scene is at least twice as long as it should be, intricate details about how this career is crashing or the career is developing, it's just too bleak and mundane for words. Music would be good if you did not have to sit in the movie, but actually three good songs are not enough rewards for the effort required to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie, I prayed to God for narcolepsy or for someone who would shoot me. <br /> <br /> Never, never, never again.
