This story had a different angle that intrigued me, enough to buy an invisible VHS view earlier. It was a mistake. <br /> <br /> In what could have been a very nice story - about badly injured people in the hospital and their different personalities - quickly transformed into a very profaning soap opera with unpleasant characters. /> <br /> We have "Bloss" (William Forsythe), a stereotypical racist white person who speaks f-word every second sentence and is so mean that they did not give him the name in the movie. It is great fun. Then there is "Raymond Hill" (Wesley Snipes), a fast speaking womanizer. Snipes liked these fast-moving "hip" arrogant roles because he played in many of them, as in "White Men Can not Jump". Then there is sweet Helen Hunt playing "Anna", a wonderful, caring, loving person who has adultery with a leading character in the movie "Joel Garcia" (Eric Stoltz). <br /> <br /> Yes, it is nice, has a good frame of mind. It only makes my heart melt, watching these nice people. But if you are one of those who love the mad heroes portrayed by disgusting people in this dingy movie ... you might like it! Add a dose of Hollywood political correctness and there! What else can you want?
