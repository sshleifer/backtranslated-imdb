Time corridors. A movie that you can watch if you're looking for a sophisticated way of suicide. Some use weapons, ropes or gas, but you want to destroy your brain? Do not wait any longer! Time corridors are probably one of the biggest possible mistakes: thinking that Christian Clavier is able to act and bring you joy. I'm not short of 45 francs that cost me these poor things: sometimes you have to reset your rating system by looking at absolute zero. This movie deserves 2/10, but it's only because I like Jean Reno. It's a pity for him, he's also playing Ronin. I think I do not like him ...
