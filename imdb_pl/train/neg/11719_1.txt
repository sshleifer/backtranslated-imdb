In the words of Charles Dance in this movie "Bollocks!" No plot, no character development and absolutely unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Full of things that simply do not happen in the real world (since British police inspectors armed with holster pistols? Full of errors (Bulgarian trains in London?). Full of boring and artificial dialogue. / editing is terrible - shaky manual shots from the camera that add nothing to the film, except the vague sense of seasickness, confusing jumps, lack of structure. <br /> <br /> Wesley Snipes' character is completely unpleasant - why should we worry What will happen to it? Directly to the video? Go to the trash!
