I'm sorry for all the fans, but this is a useless movie. The action is bad, even wooden, it exaggerates early with a frightening factor and does not work exactly. I think it was going to be something weird at the end, but it ended up being madly confusing. What the hell? The guy who killed everyone was one of the hunted ones? Try again. <br /> <br /> It is not very original and is not even particularly good as a simple slasher. And that says something. <br /> <br /> I think that whoever made the castings, whoever wrote the script and whoever thought about the concept should be mercilessly released and deported. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie. If someone sets it up at the party, throw the disc out of the window and put on a good horror movie like Silence of the Lambs or The Shining.
