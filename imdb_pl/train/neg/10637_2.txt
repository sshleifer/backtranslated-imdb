I regret that I bought this series. I expected more action, a more objective image and greater coherence. It is simply a pure propaganda series, very dark, without charm or romanticism, it's just boredom. I believe that the actors also work quite poorly. O'Donnell may seem charming like Robin (with Batman), but in this photo he lacks charm. Probably during aging, she loses her childlike charm, but does not gain the charm of an adult. No wonder it has not been shown in many countries and is sold in the UK for 40% of the recommended price and has not even been released in the Netherlands.
