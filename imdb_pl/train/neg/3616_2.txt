If you look only at the cover of this movie, it's cool. NO. The movie itself put me to sleep. It was a slow pace, minimal violence and poor voltage use. The working material was the bottom feeder, and the plot, although it would be nice for another movie, was not shown here well. They even kill the only nice character in the whole movie! I give him 2 out of 10, because the only thing that was good was the turn of the action at the end. Besides, you may want to save yourself from the trash from this movie.
