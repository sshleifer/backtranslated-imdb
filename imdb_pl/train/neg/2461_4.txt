Probably more people are afraid of the dentist than, say, small monsters or terrifying dolls. Which makes it an ideal theme for horror, really. <br /> <br /> Dr. Feinstone (Corbin Bernsen) has been a successful dentist for several years, but when he catches a wife betraying him by the pool, he surprises and his work causes anger and frustration. Well, give the crazy dentist a drill and mouth, and you'll probably guess what's going on ... <br /> <br /> As I said, a brilliant idea, but not delivered as well as it should. In particular, the ending is a huge disappointment. One last note: see Mark Ruffalo (You Can Count On Me, Eternal Sunshine ...) in this. <br /> <br /> 5/10.
