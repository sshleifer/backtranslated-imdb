No, this is not a horror movie ... This one is actually a love story. <br /> <br /> The Ring is a silent movie from 1927, in which two boxers and a woman who walks in between them play. He loves a boxer known as Jack "One round". He loves him until the master appears. Although he marries One Round, he begins to openly flirt with the master until the climax final boxing fight between One Round and the champion. He returns to the corner of one round when things look the worst, and he miraculously finds the inner strength to win the fight and win his wife back. <br /> <br /> This movie was very early in Hitch's career but the time constraints could not make him make a permanent movie. Although there are special movie tricks and comedy, this movie just can not stand any of its later work. However, it must have been very risky during this period when a shameless adulterous wife. Perhaps it was a recession in 1927. Looking through all these old films, it's amazing how I think you can make them on today's screen and really leave. Maybe should be the only one .... <br /> <br /> Skip this movie, unless you plan to watch all Hitchcock movies. You can fall asleep inside.
