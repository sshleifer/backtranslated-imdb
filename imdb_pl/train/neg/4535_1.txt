slow, unintelligible, boring. Three enthusiastic words describing the movie from the book. This is certainly a case in which a movie should never have been made at the expense of a book. The best part of the film was the scenery, perfect. The worst part was the slow movement of actors combined with endless meaningful glances. The edition is sudden and inconsistent. However, despite this, the actors worked very hard, at least trying to be a bit credible with a horrible scenario. It was surprising that although in Peru there was no Peruvian person wandering around the set - even in the flashback scenes depicting Peru in the 17th century. If you have any sense of history, try to avoid this movie.
