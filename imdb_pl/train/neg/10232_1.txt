This is one of those dramas that is so bad that it almost strikes the fact that it is very funny, the scenario is absolutely tragic, terrifying direction, purely armature lighting, the only thing that allows it to go away from the truth so badly that it is good that the sound of the design is only bad; does not add tension to the story, although he tries hard, but does not destroy any statements. There are problems with the continuity of seasons around the world. And finally, the last but not least is the acting. In professional production, you have the impression of a university media project, which you must regret for all those who had to give them their names.
