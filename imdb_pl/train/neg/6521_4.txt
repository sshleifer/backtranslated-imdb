I probably do not give this movie a fair shock, because I could not see it. Perhaps, if I saw it in the theater, in its original presentation, I would appreciate it, but it is too slow for me. <br /> <br /> I read the book about 25 years ago and the details of the plot disappeared from memory. This did not help the film, because it is something less vivid and clear in the presentation of events. <br /> <br /> These are really four connected films, or a movie in four parts, and I think it was intended to be watched for four nights in a theater presentation. I found Part I that was pleasant enough, but that's all I could do to sit in Part II, which goes on forever. Reading Tolstoy's philosophy is one thing. If you get a good translation or can read it in the original, its brilliant writing far exceeds any problems related to the pace of the story. However, in the film it is difficult to reproduce it without being heavy. <br /> <br /> I have other problems with parts of the movie that I have seen. It is very splattered, with a lot of work with the hey-ma-look-at-this camera, which draws attention to itself instead of being used to develop the story. <br /> <br /> Of course, I miss something, I just could not recall the enthusiasm to tweak parts III and IV.
