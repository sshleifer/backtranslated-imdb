When I saw an advertisement on this topic, I wanted to see it. Now, forgive me, but so much time has passed since I saw that I do not remember how it went. Suffice it to say that the movie I saw was not similar to the "movie" in which they sold me. <br /> <br /> I was bored, irritated and incredibly disappointed with this movie. And if that was not enough, they had to sink it even more with this horrible reggae music. Not exactly mood music for horror, huh? My guess is that if you've never seen an ad (or trailer), you might think it's hot. The advertising was much better for my money.
