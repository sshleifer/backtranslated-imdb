I wanted to read other comments before leaving the review, and most definitely rule: this movie is terrible! From animation to unrealistic animation to countless mistakes. I hoped that the flaps would be extended by stretching the imagination (it is not possible to extend the flaps without engines). The chassis can not be lowered unless you have electricity. That tiny fan that was going was not enough to leave the chassis. The only thing that seemed odd to me was that when they landed, the rear wheels landed, then one of them broke off, thus hanging the plane from both rear tires in the air. How did the captain use left and right brakes for tires that did not touch the ground? Have they forgotten about spoilers? A word to the director: Learn * all * about airplanes before you try to make an "airplane" movie. I apologize for the technical trick, but I give this movie 1/10.
