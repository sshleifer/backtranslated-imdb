This movie seems to start from the inside, depicts peripheral players as if they were meaningful, and depicts the main characters without any content and paper-thin and / or impenetrable stories. Almost nobody has a credible or perceptible motivation to act in this film. The story goes on and is nowhere to go, the dialogue is clumsy and banal, and the director has no idea how to best use his actors. It's almost like the first half of the movie, but it never was created. <br /> <br /> We were told that a mysterious pyramid had appeared over New York and that Central Park had inexplicably become an arctic wasteland. However, none of this has caused much confusion among the general public, and the government has only minimal concerns. <br /> <br /> We are portrayed as an "evil corporation" in eugenics, but it's really just a comfortable conceit to populate the universe with a few servants who stumble. The whole ambiguity of "Eugenics-is-evil" is hard and never really is here. We should take care of the main characters, but we never know enough about them to know why. So much about this world is underdeveloped or completely undeveloped, it comes out as a one-hour, 40-minute fatalistic rationalization of rape. <br /> <br /> On the "groundbreaking" digitally animated world created here, all I can say is that at about the same time that this film was made, several other directors did the same, achieving more fluid and reliable results. <br /> <br /> After spending time watching this movie, the most urgent question in my mind was "so what?"
