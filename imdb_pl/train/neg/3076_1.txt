This movie should not be watched unless you try to kill yourself. I think this movie can cause serious brain damage. The main characters are timid, not the heroine Kevin, Amy, his mate, the godless conservative girl, Kyle, dork in red shorts, who likes phone sex, Daphne, skinny, horny girl who is supposed to be "cool" and has no sense of how dress up, and her overloaded boy Nick, recruited from an army who can do anything. No, I'm not a pervert, REALLY like the movie goes. The film itself is an exaggerated rip-off of the Gremlins from 1986, but you will not find a trace of Gizmo anywhere. No, those Hobgoblins, unleashed by Wimpy Man (sorry, Kevin), fulfill one's wildest dreams, and then kill the victims. Yes, you guessed it - they end up in a strip club, where Amy's biggest dream is revealed - she wants to become a stripper! Listen, I watched the movie with MST3K, and even with Mike Nelson, Tom Servo and Crow T. A robot making a laugh from this movie wreck that still caused me to bleed from both eyes. Not really, but I would like to have one. I do not give you a story anymore, because re-experience gives me that big urge to fork through my brain. Also, it's not worth mentioning the story. They should put a general surgeon's warning on this video.
