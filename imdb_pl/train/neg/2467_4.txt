This film has both a 6/10 rating from me and 9/10. Here's why: As a standard horror movie for an ordinary crowd of horror movies, where action, horrors and horror are taken into account, this movie will bore you. This is essentially a family drama similar to the one you can see on the Lifetime channel, but placed in the horror universe. History and formula are eternal, retreaded hundreds of times. If you're looking for any originality in the plot structure or minimal conflicts, you'll be disappointed. Take away the zombie, and you'll have something as melodramatic as A Beautiful Mind, stumbling over cheese. This is 6/10. <br /> <br /> However, the basic summary and idea are quite original and not quite known. It's literally something that you and your friends would be joking about when you're half drunk. . . but this joke actually had a cinematic edition. The idea gets 9/10 from me. The only reason he is not perfect is that they could take him even further, but they did not do it. <br /> <br /> The mix of both is mixed. I thought it was fun, but like most comedy, it was not so much fun. I told my mother and my younger sister to watch it with me, and the jokes we wrote about it were more fun than jokes written. There were moments of total genius, but there were also moments of pure boredom. <br/> <br /> I sincerely hope that other films will take such an excessive risk and original ideas. I just can not say that it was perfect, or even close, because of the lack of originality of the story. <br /> <br /> A GREAT family movie. A great movie to watch with a group of boys (or girls). A great movie to watch with everyone. . . but if you look at it yourself, it will be a bit boring. Other people always make this movie more fun and richer. <br /> <br /> 4/10
