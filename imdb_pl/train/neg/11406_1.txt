But I understood it. It seemed to me that even the author of the book favored Caroline. I was sorry about the character Louise, and she was constantly compared to Esau, who was angry, I just felt that the comparison was a bit harsh and unrealistic. Really, however, the film was bad. I would not see it unless you're ready for a big disappointment.
