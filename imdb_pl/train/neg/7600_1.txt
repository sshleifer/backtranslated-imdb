This movie proves that good acting comes from a good direction and this is not happening in Ask the Dust. Colin Farrell is usually a great actor, but in this he is a minor. Donald Sutherland is an amateur. Why? Because the script is horrible, the adaptation is horrible, and the actors seem bored and naive. The atmosphere of the movie is bad - I could only think when it's over and I turned it off half. The director did a very poor job and although I have not read the novel, it is certainly a missed opportunity. The atmosphere that this film tries to evoke, and the message and story never reach the audience. In a word, it's a scary movie.
