Poor Michael Madsen; he must kick himself to know that people have learned of this terrible flutter. I really can not think of anything worse I've ever seen, except for amateur porn. It's so bad and everything here; wooden acting, bad script, bad moral end, you hate it and this is in this movie. <br /> <br /> My question is: "Who the hell put $$$ in this piece of dog doo? I could see my sister Michael Virginia naked in the scene, but I do not think it even saved that stinking ... <br /> <br /> For a nice guy who did some special films, I want to know what a crazy church sponsored this piece of crapoli.
