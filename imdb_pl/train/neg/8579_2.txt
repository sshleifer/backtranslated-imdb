I am afraid that this is quite terrifying, despite some good performance and a generally competent direction of the camera. This is the first and last attempt of the writer-director Soo Lyu. "Rub and Tug" (2002) is one of the unfortunate byproducts of the Canadian film promotion program. While the program encourages valuable efforts such as the "New Waterford Girl", it opens the door for unskilled novices, such as Lyu, who did not have to aggressively set up the project, but were ignited without proper scenario or credential examination. <br /> <br /> You do not mind low budget, because shabby design, bad lighting, poor sound and gloomy style choices are in line with the subject matter; employees of Canadian massage salons. But dialogue and conspiracy give the actors nothing to do, the editor gathers a lot, and the viewer has no mental challenge other than suspending disbelief. When your story is so simplified, the last thing you need is a muddy technique of telling stories; even if nothing happens, the movie is difficult to follow and the point of view can not be determined. <br /> <br /> Don McKellar's performance as Conrad is a few degrees below his similar characteristics in "Exotica". Lea Lindy Booth is her standard idiosyncrasy; as always is nice, but here is not much more. Cindy Kiry Clavell is a nice surprise, a kind of Asian Shelley Duval. The only other role of any consequence, Tara Spencer-Nairn in the Betty style, more than cancel her outstanding performance in the "New Waterford Girl." Her shallow performances in "Rub and Tug" should limit the tendency to look for other films in which she appeared; unless you need to further confirm the skills of director "Waterford" Alan Moyle in working with young actors. <br /> <br /> You quickly come to the conclusion that reptile Lyu's brain can not understand concepts such as the complexity of the plot, so the need to put a lazy and lame device "deus ex machina" at the end is not a surprise. It can still be worse, this apathetic tale has so little internal logic that an unlikely ending is not as painful as usual. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
