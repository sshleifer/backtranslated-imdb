There are things I can never understand. Such as this movie. And what if I was to create a really cheap and cheap Dino model and crocodile polygon in Maya, and then go to cut and paste it in an amateur video clip where people scream and eat the same? How can anyone even believe that the completely false CGI dinocroc, which looks completely out of place, would affect the events in this film? I know that his class B, low budget and anything outside the producers can do better than making a piece of shit that nobody will ever see or sit down. It just does not make sense. Are people really so stupid that they were sitting through this? Apparently, yes. For laughter? No, it's not even worth laughing.
