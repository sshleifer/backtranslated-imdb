This film is deeply disappointing. Not only that Wenders only shows the very limited musical spectrum of Blues, his subjective and personal interest in the parts of the music he introduces, makes watching and listening absolutely boring. The only climax of the film is an interview with a Swedish couple who became friends with J.B. Lenoir and showed her private video recordings and told stories. The introduction of the Wenders film theme begins quite interesting - referring to the culture of the world (or rather the American culture) traveling in space, but its limited appearance, as well as not funny or completely fascinating reproduction of the stories from the 30's does not make the film as an ordinary help to sleep. Yawn. I expected more of him.
