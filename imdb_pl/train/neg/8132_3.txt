Really, the use of the documentary nature of swarming bats employed by THE BAT PEOPLE is one of the most effective in history. Caves of bats shoot at the ceilings of the caves, swarming with bats flying out of caves or whirling near the mouths of the caves. Only that is enough to be disturbing: Imagine that everyone is teeming with you? And it really is in the sequence, which should be a show series, which happened about a forty-minute sign, even the wrongly funny sequence, in which a swarm of bats seems to attack the police car, splashing on the windshield like bloody broken eggs. The problem is that this sequence happens about fifty minutes too late to save a movie, most of which consist of one or more people running around, shouting, waving their hands excitedly excited about some poor goat who managed to bite the stick during his holidays. <br /> <br /> He fears that he will go down with a rabid who actually sucks, so their vacations are ruined because the plot summary at the top of the BATCH reference page actually points out. Here's an effective summary of the movie: A young couple goes on a romantic getaway that's ruined when a guy gets bitten by a bat. They are boldly trying to eliminate it, but it's starting to go crazy trying to convince the people around him that he's more involved than rabies, that he can not control himself, and everyone should KEEP OUT. <br /> <br /> Now that someone is frothed in the mouth, covered in sweat, eyes stunned like one of the cheaper Muppets and screaming at you, TO HAVE FROM ME, you will leave him. You're not trying to give him drugs, you're not trying to tell him that you love him, you give his guy a place, come home and try this scenic escape next year. <br /> <br /> But no, the people in this movie behave like morons, they insist on pushing the guy to the edge, and he turns away, mutates into a bat-like man and kills a group of irrelevant secondary characters. There is nothing wrong with that, but the film forgets that it is a low-budget Creature function and tries to be a kind of psychological study. Instead of a monster movie, we've got a lot of people running around trying to get this guy to take a cold pill, and finally he runs out onto hills that look much more human than he should, people insist on pursuing him and paying the expected price. <br /> <br /> The main disadvantage of the film is that it should happen in the first fifteen or twenty minutes, thirty peaks, and the film should refer to the guy PO his turned into a bat, not a journey. It takes eighty minutes really to have fun on this front, with some interesting sketches of characters in which there is always a funny Michael Pataki as a policeman from a small town who lost his moral advantage, and the late Paul Carr as a friend of a doctor who does not he gets messages. <br /> <br /> The movie is terribly boring, about fifteen minutes too long and I missed the opportunity to be a nice, forgotten, small Creature Feature about amok with a mutant, such as the Italian horror movie RATMAN, which I watched today and was unfortunately inspired to try this after watching. Me and my bright ideas, although the scene with the patrol car was an alien: it is a pity that we could not have another twenty minutes of this. <br /> <br /> 3/10
