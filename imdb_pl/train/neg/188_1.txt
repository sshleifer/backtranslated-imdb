This movie has a beautiful scenery. Unfortunately, there is no story. To have a plot, there must be a conflict. This movie had none. He spent two hours painting the beautifule scene and did not put any activity in it. The painting tries to be artistic, but does not pay attention to the basics of telling a story. <br /> <br /> If you love Montana's set design and fly fishing, you'll find value in this movie, just do not expect history. No such.
