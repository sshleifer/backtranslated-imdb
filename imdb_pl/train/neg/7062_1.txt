OK, probably not, to be honest the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> that did not make any sense, there was no plot, no characteristics, no action, just nothing. <br /> <br /> Here's what I thought, when I first saw May 28, 2003 ** caution, this is a spoiler alert. I am also very complaining about how bad the movie is: <br /> <br /> ok, so the movie starts and the characters are entered, but there is no explanation of the character. As far as I knew, the main character was new to this school, but apparently not. it turned out that he lived alone ... and then he was a foster child ... then his mother was a raging alcoholic who still lived with him. also all his friends apparently did not have parents and they lived alone. <br /> <br /> Now we come to the main plot, this crazy guy got out of the mad hospital and started running. now our main character is obsessed with this guy and focuses on him because of the film's contingency. I think I had to miss the main element of the story here, there was NO REASON to let the main character get caught. even for that matter, having no reason why all his friends who are skeptical, like five minutes earlier, suddenly follow him and do what he wants. <br /> <br /> so the movie goes on and gets it right. they ravage at school, blah blah. but wait a minute ... suddenly everyone knows that the main character is leading the "show" here. Wait a moment, did not a crazy guy tell the main character not to do it? it was supposed to be anomomic. <br /> <br /> another important element of the plot has been omitted ... crazy guy was not meant to be crazy ... everyone said he was not crazy. but when history is rolling, it is VERY UNIQUE. but I thought the messages that people said were not ... hm ... <br /> <br /> now the movie is over. WAS IT CLOSED? WHAT WAS THE CHOLERA? not only did the ending answer no questions about the main character, but he did not answer any questions about the crazy guy. are these people in the same situation? if so, there are very simple lines of stories that do not. if not, what is the point of saying "it's you in two weeks." ?? <br /> <br /> * the end of things ... * <br /> <br /> that's what I thought. this is exactly what I still think now. it's six months down, and if I can get it for free, I can give it another chance, but I doubt it. He doubts it.
