The whole logic goes straight out of the train window in this British horror movie, set in the London subway and playing the usually reliable Franka Potente (Run Lola Run), Frank plays Kate, a businesswoman on the way from the office party to meet friends who fall asleep at the subway station wake up and discover that she has been locked up and feels "someone" or "something" with deadly intentions. <br /> <br /> Strange holes and unbelievableness are common and there are very few moments that are really crazy / frightening, but a lot that are just boring. <br /> <br /> In total an unpleasant movie that should stay closed forever and do us a favor. <br /> <br /> The only plus is the inclusion of the popular veteran actor, Ken Campbell, who is better than that? including even "Erasmus Microman"!
