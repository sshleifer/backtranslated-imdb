Eyes of the Werewolf (1999) is a really bad movie. The assumption was really good, but the overall performance was just awful. I would like filmmakers not to take care of this project instead of throwing it into production. Some blind guy gets new eyes, the bad thing is that they belong to an old, old werewolf. Nasty things start happening with a guy when he turns into a cheesy-looking creature. Can he find a cure before his hot girlfriend finds out? Who is this strange little troll who helps him and what's happening with this policewoman? If you really want to find out, check out Eyes of the Werewolf! <br /> <br /> This is not a bad idea for a movie. I would like filmmakers to spend a lot of time in production before making a decision to make a movie.
