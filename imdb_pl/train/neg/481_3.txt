Every time a film is so short-sighted in its desire to present a specific ending or point of view that it simply does not care about the actual story, it is annoying. These are the types of films in which the beginning or point of view is conceived as the first and the story simply attached. For this reason, we often talk about a story "leaping through hoops" that revolves around, trying in vain to go to a predetermined end in a logical manner. <br /> <br /> The story in "Comet on Broadway" does not just jump over the hoops, it's a circus with three rings. It's so absurd, so badly thought, so insincere, that if you have a tendency to speak loudly on the screen, you'll be good at it before it's over. <br /> <br /> The main theme of this scenario cesspool is a woman choosing a family and a profession. Because everything is so tangled up, it will end offensive to both people. So history does not make sense, the subject becomes irrelevant and, as is often the case with weak scenarios, acting does not save anything.
