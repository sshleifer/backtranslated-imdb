I've seen better quality on YouTube! I felt sorry for the actors because writing was awful and the direction was shocking, I was not sure how they could get out of the line - I really doubt any actor would be able to save this movie no matter how good it would be. Characters were not developed at all and there was no real coherence in the storyline that seemed out of nowhere. It is a pity indeed, because the premise of the film was good and with a better quality of production, direction and scenario it could be a decent movie. It certainly was not a comedy, unless you laugh out loud from dubbing - which was amateurish, even the English actors sounded weird.
