If there ever was a movie that deserved a high zero rating, that's a pile of nonsense. I love movies about zombies, and even bad movies usually have something for them, but not cruelty. Actually, I started to rage watching this movie because it is so offensive, I can not believe that the people responsible for this would really consider it acceptable. <br /> <br /> There is no plot, and the non-story is cut out with scenes of sadism and spanking. People do not react, act or resemble human beings. The whole film is also shot in two scantily decorated rooms that resemble the places where they should be. The whole thing is one pointless mess, it's nowhere and when the zombies finally appear, they look like rubbish and they do not do much. <br /> <br /> I could make a better movie than this one, so could you and someone who has never seen a movie before. It is pathetic and undoubtedly the worst movie of all time. <br /> <br /> Honestly, the worst movie of all time. You will notice by the way that the only positive reviews give this 10/10 and encourage you to buy a DVD. I can not imagine anyone neutral, really thinking that it's a good movie, it's awful. <br /> <br /> 0/10 and this is generous.
