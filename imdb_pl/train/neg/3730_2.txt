First of all, there is nothing wrong with studying Daniel, Revelation, Matthew 24, Isaiah and other prophets. There is also nothing wrong with making such a film to try to present the gospel message. My scruples related to this film are neither honesty nor aspirations. As a Christian, though amilenised, I believe that there will be a great tribulation and I believe that Christ will come back, as he said the same. So even if I do not agree with the movie about the admiration, it's not why I rate this film so low. <br /> <br /> No, what makes me judge this film so low is not its sincerity or its message, but rather the lack of production values, horrible scenario, average acting and pathetic FX. This movie ranks there with one of the harshest sci fi in the 1950s. No, this movie goes there with Plan 9 From Outerspace. This movie did not get old well and probably was dated during the sequel. <br /> <br /> Apocalypse film producers could learn how not to create a movie from the end time, but it did not work. The Left Behind, The Apocalypse and Omega Code series did not learn this because they dealt with FX problems and problems with the appearance of the day, but their scripts are still weak and their operation is wooden. <br /> <br /> There are great Christian films with an exceptionally low budget, but this movie is not one of them. I'm surprised that the MST3K team never annoyed it.
