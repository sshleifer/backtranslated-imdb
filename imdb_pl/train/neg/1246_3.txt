Spoilers, I think. <br /> <br /> The absolutely absurd logic of ending destroys the whole movie. I just could not beat it. And what is wrong with the character of Mark Wahlberg? If I suddenly found myself broken-landed on a planet full of speaking monkeys, I would be like "AAAAhhhhHHH !!! But he is like "talking monkeys, okay. Next? "I would say it's pretty jaded. He must regularly encounter even stranger things. Besides, it's the best work of Rick Baker. This film is a real testimony of how far we have come in the field of monkey makeup. 3/10.
