If you study Welles and want to see how far he has fallen after Citizen Kane, this movie proves it. A cheap excuse to make the hero a self-styled mannequin to explain how he can fall into such an unadulterated scheme, he does not explain the absurd theatrical judgments and the absurd twists that eventually arise. Do not get carried away by the high-score film in db, just like me; I can only guess that there are many die-hard old fans of Welles and Hayworth.
