Jim Belushi is experiencing a middle-aged crisis, nothing goes well when his car goes to him ... he enters an empty bar where Michael Caine shows him what life would look like if one event in secondary school were different. Good premise with a few moments, but mostly flat and uninteresting. on a scale from one to ten..3
