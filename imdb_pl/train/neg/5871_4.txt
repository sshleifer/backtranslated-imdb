For me, the only reason to look at this remake was to see how bad it can be. There was no doubt that it was fun and bad because I saw "Voyna and mir" (1968). Should we start? Idziemy ... <br /> <br /> Robert Dornhelm and Brendan Donnison's Pierre Bezukhov - a skinny guy who lacks the depths of the original; Natasha Rostova by Robert Dornhelm and Brendan Donnison - scarecrow, her image can cause insomnia; Andrej Bolkonsky of Robert Dornhelm and Brendan Donnison - a good incarnation, which like the skinny guy (see above) lacks the depth of the Russian soul and "struggle inside"; Robert Dornhelm and Brendan Donnison's Napoleon - a rather unimpressive leader; Prince Bolkonsky Robert Dornhelm and Brendan Donnison - turd with English face; Robert Dornhelm and Brendan Donnison's Count Bezukhov - bezkolizyjny show-dziwak ... <br /> <br /> The rest of the heroes is not much better. <br /> <br /> The movements of the actors and the way they look and say are often awful. They behave like modern EU citizens dressed for a one-day masquerade. All this looks cheap and never approaches the standards of our Russian men and women of the early nineteenth century. <br /> <br /> Good entertainment to check and play. We remembered about this modern product that was shown the previous evening on our TV, chuckling in our office several times. <br /> <br /> "User rating: 8.0 / 10 (29 votes)" - I think that many young people have never watched our movie ("Voyna i mir" 1968) nor have a strange sense of quality "Tarantino-Spielberg ". Do you remember the scene in which our hussar saves a friend, turns, shoots, and the bridge breaks? It looks like a CGI explosion. <br /> <br /> There is no point or craft to create a better version of the novel that was once correctly displayed in our country. But I am happy to see the Russian remake of "Gone with the Wind". Hey, directors, wake up and take care of it, instead of coddling our classics. <br /> <br /> Let's get back to common sense now. Jokes aside. What I mentioned above is nothing new, though deadly exaggerated. <br /> <br /> To make foreign actors try to pass as Russians (participating in very serious epics and dramas), it's a rude mistake, and filmmakers make this mistake again and again. Of course, it causes a lot of laughter - especially Clemence Poesy is unpleasantly ridiculous, and her dancing and singing makes the Russian viewer think, "It sucks, that's fun!"). <br /> <br /> To say something new, I would like to mention the pace of the movie. In my opinion, this new version is very patchy. Narration and scenes do not flow naturally - they stagger and pop out like in a modern video. Again, I have to remember our "Voyna i mir", in which the action is so natural, and the narration is so easy that you just sit back and enjoy "going with the flow". <br /> <br /> I thought that perhaps the battle in Borodino would be great (somehow to rehabilitate numerous defects), but it turned out that it did not fit into the war scenes shot in 1968. <br /> <br /> There should be something good in this movie. And is. The actors try to make everything work. From the beginning, they did not have a chance, but they joined the losing team. Plus 1 point for this recklessness. It makes the Russian viewer uncomfortable - some scenes are ironically funny, though they are to be dramatically powerful, and the actors do their best. All this brings pity and sometimes - laughter attacks. <br /> <br /> What I still like about this series is its last part. It shows very lively how everyone gets their "salary and taxes". Besides, judging by the trailers of the movie, I thought that the movie will have an adult sex scene, which will definitely kill the whole project. But fortunately, there is no such trash. And this is a big plus. <br /> <br /> "Voyna and Mir" is not "Harry Potter", and now even we, here in Russia today, do not have enough equipment to film it properly. Do I have to say that the moral quality of our lives has deteriorated significantly? Fortunately, the film was shown in Soviet times. The American version of the 1950s was to some extent justified - ours did not exist yet. There were mitigating circumstances. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 (1 point from the beginning, 1 point for recklessness and 2 points for the last part of the series. Thanks for your attention.
