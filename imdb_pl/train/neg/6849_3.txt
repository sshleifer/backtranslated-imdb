This quasi-horror accompanied a young woman who returns to her childhood village on the island of Shikoku to sell a family home and meet old friends. She discovers that one daughter of a rural priestess has drowned several years earlier. She and Fumiko (another childhood friend) find out that Sayori's mother is trying to bring her back to life thanks to black magic. Already, the bonds between the dead and the living are weakening, and friends and peasants see ghosts. Nothing was exceptional or even very good in this film. In contrast to the J-horror movie stars, the tension really does not build up, the result does not seem too dangerous, and the ending borders on the absurdity. <br /> <br /> This movie is like plain white rice boiled a little bit so long that it borders on mushy. Sometimes you get it in poor Asian restaurants or you cook your own white rice a bit too long. You end up eating because you need it with a meal because what is Chinese or Japanese, without rice, it almost spoils the meal because of the sticky, sticky taste of it all. 3/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
