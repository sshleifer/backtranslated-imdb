This Oscar Petersson movie is unique. Its uniqueness is not in this story, because many of Hollywood's half-brain production has served us relatively unfortunate plots, but rather in the exact way that complete and complete poverty in one aspect combines with equal wickedness in all other aspects. /> <br /> The dialog window is worse than embarrassing. Rotten acting and poor direction are thrown into the mix. Bosniaks who speak English with heavy Swedish accents add an unintentional element of humor. Unusual lightnings and work with the camera are covered with a turkey cake. As a kind of surprise for the audience, there are several completely un-motivated sequences in slow motion in which you least expect. To add an insult to injury, the whole thing is cut by someone without a sense of time. <br /> <br /> "A bad guy who is good after hearing the speech of a good guy" in the church, it makes sense in time to dethrone Ed Wood from the position of the worst director of all times; Move along Ed Wood - Oscar Petersson is coming!
