Perhaps I could not find the DVD menu selection for PLOT: ON OFF. Of course, the default is OFF. When the closing credits ended, I could not believe that it was all. Like our poor but beautiful hero, I felt used, dirty, cheap .... <br /> <br /> The heroes were drawn with very wide strokes, and the writer's scorn for rich Thatcherites was visible. I consider myself to be "Roosevelt Democrat", but I would appreciate a bit more subtlety. <br /> <br /> Of course, the problem can be with me. I see that many others seem to find some meaning or message in this photo. Unfortunately, not me. <br /> <br /> The only thing that stopped me from giving it to "1" was pretty scenery, human and plant.
