This is exactly the kind of film that frustrates me the most. Great cast, great director, great role-playing potential, and then everything is destroyed by a script that never goes anywhere ... and it does not say anything when it goes! There is no depth here. Without the depth of the characters, without the depth of the plot, without the depth of surprise, tension and common sense. We know what is happening, it is said how they plan to solve the problem, they fix the problem, they give us a surprise at the end, which does not generate any tension, and then suddenly end the film. A missed opportunity. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, Glenn Ford leads a cast of British (and one French) actors who are fantastic, doing incredibly impressive work with the one-dimensional writing they've received. One of the absolute favorites is Herbert Walton as "Old Charlie", which delivers great pieces of humor and warmth to a dark and serious movie. I also thought that the film has a great look ... all shadows and fog ... very sensitive movie noir. <br /> <br /> Even if the actors are doing their best and directing is pleasant, it is still not enough for me to recommend spending time watching a movie. There are much better Glenn Ford films: The Big Heat, Gilda, Affair in Trinidad, etc.
