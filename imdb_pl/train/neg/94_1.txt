KRONIKI ZOMBIE <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.33: 1 (Nu-View 3-D) <br /> <br /> Audio format: Mono <br /> <br /> When searching (literal ) a city of ghosts in the middle of nowhere, a young reporter (Emmy Smith) raises a gray hitchhiker (Joseph Haggerty) who tells her two stories involving zombies feeding on the body that haunt this area. ABSOLUTE waste of time, from the very beginning limited by Haggerty's amateurish amateur performance in a key role. Even worse, the two stories that make up most of the time are completely routine, deepened by indifferent performances and the poor direction of Brad Sykes, who was previously responsible for CAMP BLOOD (1999). This is not a "funny" movie in the sense that Ed Wood's films are "funny" (at least he believed in what he was doing and was honest in his efforts, despite his lack of talent); Sykes' home movies are in fact burdensome, boring and almost devoid of salutary virtue, and most viewers will feel rightly furious and deceived by such unimaginable, ill-conceived trash. The 3D format is completely wasted.
