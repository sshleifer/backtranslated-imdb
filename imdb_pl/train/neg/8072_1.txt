(Possible spoiler or two) <br /> <br /> "Soul Survivors" is probably the worst movie ever released. Nothing makes sense, there is a conspiracy about a girl who has strange visions of people who may or may not be worried. The whole movie is just a few random shots of things that really do not merge together at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Acting does not exist, the camera's work is uneven, and the script is so confusing that the film is even harder to watch. <br /> <br /> I was waiting for something to tie the movie, but nothing came. By far the worst film of the year. - **** 1/2 stars.
