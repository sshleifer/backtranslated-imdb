1st watched 5/26/2002 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Michael Almereyda): Strange story of a druid witch who tries to capture eternity, inheriting her granddaughter's body. At least I think it was a relationship. This film has a kind of amazing quality, unlike The Shining Stephen King. The difference is that Nicholson's performance was abundant, which is not in this film. All this is taken very seriously until the end, when some bad, one-color and unquestionable moods do not work at all. Performances are not a problem here, but history is. It seems that everything is not going very smoothly, and the viewer has a lot of information and the lack of a real understanding of what happened in the film. Christopher Walken acts as the uncle of a granddaughter to a very small extent, which of course gives him the highest bills for trying to sell the movie. Do not buy this gadget and avoid this video. <br /> <br />
