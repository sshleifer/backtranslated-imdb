I really wanted to like this movie. I love kenny hotz, and rice spenny has a charming side for him. Not that I liked spenny at all. Spenny is ruining this movie. He should let Kenny and his hot girl spread the movie. <br /> <br /> In any case, it's pretty boring if you do not count the scene with Roger Ebert. There are not many celebrities in this film, and most do not seem to speak more than one line. Overall, this movie was disappointing. I would suggest just watching it if you have it with DVD 1 kenny vs spenny (it's available for free on the third album). Regardless of this production, I am still very excited to check The Papel Chase.
