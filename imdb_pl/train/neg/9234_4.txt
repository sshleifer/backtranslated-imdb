Converted today, this movie would be a very frightening, very disturbing dark comedy. Persecution, obsession and a network of lies and manipulation received in 1948. Gloss of not so sweet harmlessness. Drake plays on the persecutor, an unrestrained user of people, alternately pathetic and manipulative, Grant plays a victim of persecution, alternately angered and unconscious. <br /> <br /> Very disturbing; I was unable to look at classic romances with the same suspension of disbelief. <br /> <br />
