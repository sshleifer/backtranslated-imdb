Fine. Who it was? Who gave Revolver 10 out of 10? Do you stumble over Ecstasy pipes? There were so many of you. Did you do it for courage? Is this a cult? Did Guy Richie himself sign up 788 times under different names? <br /> <br /> Before I say anything else, I will say it. Just because you do not understand the movie does not mean it's not great. Maybe you had a bad day at work or you sat down to watch a movie after you had to argue with your wife and then you were not in the mood. Perhaps there is a more basic obstacle - you simply have no mental ability or a sufficiently developed philosophical sense to take care of it. BUT. And this is very, very big, but. Mega-size elephant XXL size, but to end all but. <br /> <br /> PLEASE do not confuse the inconsistency with the complexity and please do not confuse this two-hour non-ejaculation with an interesting movie. Really. You may think that you are quite clever. You can even think of yourself as a romantic figure: an independent thinker defending masterpieces against the chorus of sheep-like Sheepdogs. Please do not. You are ashamed yourself. <br /> <br /> A revolver is a waste of everyone's time. If you were thinking about whether you recognized it for a few minutes. It was a waste of staff, wastage of the crew, wasting catering companies and definitely a waste of valuable minutes (you can not get them back, you know) of bad luck that will sit in this unspeakable, unfortunate mess. <br /> <br /> "No - wait", a voice comes in the dark. "You just do not understand. It's NOT LINEAR. This means that history does not go into STRAIGHT LINE. This is actually a COMPREHENSIVE and SUBTLE work by AUTEUR. It deals with difficult OCCURRING questions. CLUB, when it first came out - did not you hear? - Because they could not cope with COMPLEXITY. Now they are eating a modest cake. I bet you hate Lynch's movies too, right? <br /> <br /> I hate to disappoint you, but I'm a big fan of Lynch. I rather like Memento, so a narrative told in an unconventional way does not necessarily fill me with fear. And although I only studied it a few years ago, philosophy is very interesting to me. For these reasons, I do not like a revolver. I do not like it because it's about meaningful, lengthy topics, but it deals with them in such an offensive superficial way to be ridiculous. I'm not much of a chess player, but Richie's idea of ​​how chess works seem to be a premature four-year-old. I do not like it because the characters have completely disrupted me completely. "Aha!" says Richie's apologist. "The guy cleverly turns his hat over to Brecht!" Maybe you're right. I think it's more likely that he just can not write a decent toffee script. <br /> <br /> Comparing Revolver with Fight Club is really very informative. Fight Club has a sour, nihilistic dialogue that makes you laugh. The revolver froze in fortune cookies, rejecting the one liners that make your ears bleed. Fight Club has a great turnaround that makes you re-evaluate everything that has happened. As far as I know, the revolver has a few unintelligible twists that do not give any satisfaction, because ... well, they do not make sense. If you pull a carpet from people, they will eventually throw you out of the house. And then they close all the doors and windows. And they never come back. Ever. <br /> <br /> Guy Richie seems to assume that being philosophical involves repeating the mantra of small phrases. Most often they are pronounced, but often flash on the screen with assignments. It's almost pathological. <br /> <br /> But what makes this film particularly remarkable is the way something so incomprehensible can be married so carefully with all the tired gangster stereotypes in the world. Ultimately, it's so insignificant. You do not care. You do not understand anything. You're coming back home. <br /> <br /> Actually, I really liked it: a clever killer who has a crisis of trust. He is amazing. But I can not recommend you to watch the movie just to see it. It's only for a few minutes. <br /> <br /> Please believe me. This is horrible.
