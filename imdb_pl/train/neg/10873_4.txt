Many people think it's a good movie, but I do not agree with them. At the beginning of the movie, the spacecraft crushed on the ground and some aliens escaped from the spacecraft and then killed some people on the ground, but for good reason. Besides, he's in a dark forest, I can not see anything on the screen, I hardly hear the sound. <br /> <br /> After a few days the predator came to earth, but no one had previously sent signals to him, he should not know what happened on earth, so there is a contradiction. Finally, the predator found an alien director and killed him for no reason. He did not live on earth, he has nothing to do with what happened here. Finally, the duration of the film is only 90 minutes, the summary is too short and can not clearly tell reviewers about the story. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I do not think it's a good movie.
