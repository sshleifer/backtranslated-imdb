Another early film by Alfred Hitchcock, which seems to be made of a contractual obligation. As with Juno and Paycock, you can say that Hitchcock was not interested in this movie. There is almost no style or craft. The story revolves around Fred and Emily, a young married couple who falls into money and goes on a cruise that turns out to be an attempt to marry them. Emily has a chance for a new life with a wealthy man with a good heart who falls in love with her, but decides to go down the road and stay with her husband. This may seem more plausible if Fred is not considered a completely insensitive, pompous ass that jumps at the first opportunity when he sees that he is leaving his wife for another woman. The couple stays together, but the film lacks a real reconciliation scene. The third act goes in a completely different direction: the couple settled on an abandoned ship and saved by an Asian fishing boat. Joan Barry gives a very moving performance as a faithful wife of an unfaithful husband. That's all you can say about it.
