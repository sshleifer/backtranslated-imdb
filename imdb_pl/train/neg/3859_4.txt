Jason Lee makes every effort to have fun in a silly situation, but the movie simply does not connect. <br /> <br /> Perhaps because Julia Stiles' character seems awkward, as careless and sexy, she will soon be a cousin. <br /> <br /> Maybe because Selma Blair and her heroine should have been cast in the opposite way. (Selma Blair seems more clever than Julia). <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is another Hollywood trivialization of a possible real situation in the world (that your cousin does not bend with your trousers at a bachelor party) who, despite the promise, fails to deliver it. <br /> <br /> There are some laughs that you can be sure of, and the cast (even if it's bad) does everything in its power, from sub-class material that does not go beyond its obscene topic. So instead of a successful raunch fest (eg Animal House or American Pie) we will stay in the middle of the field of humor and stupidity (ala Meatballs 2 or something like that).
