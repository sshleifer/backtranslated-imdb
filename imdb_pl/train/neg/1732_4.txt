Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history and deservedly so I'm happy to see their films. Basically, the man in the horn factory is the fourth one who will break, and soon it will be enough for the Ollie to break with all the sounds of the horn. He rests with Stan at his side, he needs peace, and Doctor's phone calls (James Finlayson) say that he will check at Ollie. After realizing the plumbing and electricity is mixed up by the zezookiego mechanic, the doctor comes to check-ups, and after a few tests recommend drinking goat's milk and getting sea air in the ocean. After Stan is practicing some trumpet game, he hangs up a window near the telephone cable and car accident, he and Ollie to the dock, to rent a boat. They keep the boat on the dock, trying to drink a goat, and Stan brought his trumpet! Meanwhile, on the front page of the newspaper, we read that Killer Nick Grainger - Escaped Convict (Richard Cramer) escaped, and he sneaks on a boat of boys during sleep, and goat chews on the boat, drifting into the sea. In the morning see their location, and the Slayer comes out asking for something to eat, and he notices Stan and Ollie making fake food, such as a spaghetti string, cheese soap, a bacon belt, a sponge for meatballs and forcing them to eat. When Ollie begins to choke, Stan blows a trumpet to help, and Rage Ollie strikes the Slayer and continues until the police arrive, just to make Rage Ollie imprisoned. There were the smallest moments of comedy, but this is not a great black and white film. "Well, here's another nice mess you put in me!" Was number 60 for 100 years, 100 quotes, and Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were numbers 7 in comic comics. Fine!
