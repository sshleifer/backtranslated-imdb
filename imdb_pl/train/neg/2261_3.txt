THE RINGMASTER performs as Jerry Springer in the role of Jerry Springer, but it's not JERRY SPRINGER SHOW, his guests are a litter trailer, but not a garbage truck that you can get in THE JERRY SPRINGER SHOW, they attack each other, but not so in ..... What is the point of making a movie about JERRY SPRINGER's show and pretending it's NOT JERRY SPRINGER SHOW? And besides, it is a very boring movie
