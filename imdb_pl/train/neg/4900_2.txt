SEKS WISH was released (minus ten minutes more, ahem, "extreme" footage) here, in the UK, in the early days of the video boom, and caused a storm of tabloids in a glass of water when it allegedly inspired the murder of imitators. Surprisingly, the papers brushed that unusually disturbing movement under the rug in their hurried hurry to get a relatively innocent habit box FROZEN SCREAM and NIGHT OF THE DEMON, resulting in the film being forgotten. I jumped in for a chance to watch it on DVD-RW and spent most of my movie time with my jaw on the floor. It's not so much politically incorrect as it is completely insane, triple X will face Michael Winner's DEATH WISH (did the title in a sense give the game when it comes to inspiration?) With hardcore sex and some really nasty violence thrown into a bubbling brew from the seventies . If you do not consider yourself sensitive, it may force you to rethink. Before SEKS WISH is over, you will want to clean your eyes with disinfectant and take a long hot shower to cleanse yourself. If any movie really deserves the tag "it's just a movie, only a movie, only a movie", then this is it. <br /> <br /> Major events (or weak points) - rapist using a vibrator on the victim when he masturbates over her, stealing Harry Reems' mustache, helpless young black couple who is forced to wriggle against the killer sword (they would get Oscars for their completely credible performances, if the Academy went crazy) before man is castrated for his troubles and some snappy direction, which threatens to bring proceedings beyond their obvious origin. Do not say I did not warn you. If you think the world has been more innocent for thirty years, SEKS WISH will prove you very badly.
