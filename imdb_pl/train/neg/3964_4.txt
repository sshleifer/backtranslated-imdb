Despite all the hype about this film, I kept an open mind about what I was ultimately thinking. And although it is sometimes slow, the first 90% of the movie is quite good, with more than a few "outdated" horrors that make one nervous and restless. Actually, I thought that the pictures were perfect for many of these scenes. However, when Dark Remains fails, it reaches its climax. The end of the movie and the solution is something that seems to be MILES APART with his body. The plot completely falls on the face with an illogical conclusion and the answer I was looking for the most - what REALLY became Emma? - it has not been explained! The premises of negative energy were at best absurd, and in the end I felt very cheated. What could have been a great horror was finally haunted by a terrible ending.
