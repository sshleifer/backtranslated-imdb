I will not go and I will not give them 10 bucks. I went and bought the fourth season of the original and the best. At least my children like it and they can watch it without worrying about what they see. I have a teenager and think that the announcements are funny and prefer to see the original. And she thinks Jessica Simpson is a terrible daisy, in fact she thinks she looks more like a whore than a prince of daisy. Those shorts she might not be wearing at all. And since when American Pie has something to do with Dukes SHAME ON on them, for putting this nasty line on sex with the car. The same should give the film an R rating. The only good thing that can result from this is a film with replays with the originals. Lets all hope. People who went to see the movie will see what it should look like
