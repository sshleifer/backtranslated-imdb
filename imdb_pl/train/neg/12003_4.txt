Six different couples Six different love stories. Six different angles of love. Eighty numbers of viewers in the cinema. Looking at eighty different parts of the silver screen. <br /> <br /> I'm sitting somewhere between them looking at the center of the screen to find out what's happening in the movie. All stories have no connection, but somewhere below, Nikhil Advani tries to show a relationship between them. I tried to find some poems that I could write as a review, but at the end of 3 hours 15 minutes I found nothing to write. The film is a bad copy of the LOVE ACTUALLY Hollywood blockbuster. <br /> <br /> My suggestion. Do not watch the movie if you really want to watch a nice movie.
