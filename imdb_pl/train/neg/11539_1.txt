This is the biggest load of nonsense I've seen in a long time. Last time I hated the movie so much when watching "28 days later" and "Magnolia". In this movie, there is absolutely no point, except for some really sick and twisted sex / rape scenes, Gillian Anderson relieves himself on the side of the road, and every sentence of dialogue must use the word "F" at least a few times in it. It has an extremely cheap method of operation and a very low budget. My friend and I finally turned off the movie after about half an hour. We tried to give him a chance, but nothing could save that dirt. DO NOT WATCH IT !!!
