Where to start ?! . . . I feel harassed! True, violated! I just spent 1.5 hours of my life, 1.5 hours, which I could spend doing something more useful, like watching dry paint, on this so-called horror film. <br /> <br /> It is not scary, it is not funny, it is not dramatic, there is no action, nothing is ... <br /> <br /> It is predictable, boring, tragic ... <br /> <br /> I can be a little harsh here, but watch this movie and you will feel the same way ... or ... no, do not watch it ... unless you want to feel also violated.
