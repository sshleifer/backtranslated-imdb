Poor story, unbelievable car failure and helpless, clumsy figures. Initially, I thought that this movie was made in the seventies, because the image quality, as well as the plot and drama seemed to be taken from the old episode of Kojac. When I checked and found out that it really only came into being in '97, I was amazed. It's definitely one of the worst and least (thriller) movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> If you read this, let me know if you see that you are wasting your time when you could do something more exciting, like watching dry paint.
