I do not know what Oskar's voters saw in this film, but they had to see quite heavy things that you can see in it to be able to reward him with the best image of Oscar. I only know that Gene Kelly was playing in it, and that would be twice as bad as I think. First of all, I do not think Leslie Caron is really capable of playing that role. She is not so talented, she is not a great dancer and she does not look good at all. It is a pity that one actor or actress can ruin a movie, just like playing it, because if Leslie Caron was not in it, maybe it was a great movie. The story was intelligent, the direction was not bad, and as I said, Gene Kelly was pretty good. Now, I'm not saying everything about Lesl Caron just to criticize her, I just say it because I think it's the worst part of the movie. She's probably a good actress, but I can not say because I did not see her in anything but I think she was pretty bad at An American in Paris. So if you want to see it, go ahead, but I'm telling you that you're much better watching "Singin 'in the rain".
