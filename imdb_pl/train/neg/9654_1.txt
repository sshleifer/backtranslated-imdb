The film is bad. Just awful. The string of bad movies from Bollywood is endless! They must have no excuses to create such awful movies (or not). <br /> <br /> It seems that the problem mainly concerns directors. This film consists of two good actors who have proven in the past that they have the ability to deliver great performance ... but they were poorly directed. Poor script also did not help. <br /> <br /> This movie has lots of funny moments and very bad editing in the first half. For example: <br /> <br /> After her first big concert, Ajay Devgan, she meets Om Puri (from whom he escaped about 30 years ago and talked to him again) and all that Om Puri discovers is guarding his friendship with Salman !!! What a nonsense. Seriously. Not to mention the soundtrack. Whatever happened to Shankar Ehsaan Loy? <br /> <br /> Ajay Devgun is a total loser for portraying a rock star. <br /> <br /> Only saving is good performances in the second half. Ajay shines when his character shows his dark side. Same as Salman as a drug addict. <br /> <br /> You can only watch it for the last half hour.
