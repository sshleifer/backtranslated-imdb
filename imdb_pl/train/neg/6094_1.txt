I was largely convinced to write this review for a number of reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) No doubt this is the worst movie I've ever seen 2) If you do not receive more reviews, it will not be listed as the worst movie of all time - which he deserves 3) I was lucky - I paid five pounds for it. I saw it in stores for 15 pounds. DO NOT PAY THAT TOO MUCH FOR THIS FILM! You will be very angry. 4) There are many movies in the genre of horrors, which have no honest assessment (in my opinion), and giving this film a higher rating than it is criminal <br /> <br /> Summary of the plot: a guy without friends meets a vagrant who promises to the world - well, the magical ability to appear to everyone else as someone else. Our hero cleverly turns into a teenage girl and joins the gang - he sits on the swings, taking care of the child. He kills them one by one until he is tracked down and found by the police. <br /> <br /> Why is it so bad? At the beginning acting is VERY VERY bad. Someone else compared it to school production. No, it's worse than any acting I've seen on the school scene. <br /> <br /> I bought some of these previously forbidden films from the DVD vipco company and I was not as disappointed as I was. well, acting is bad, but the movie can not deliver it in any other sense. What was the sense of creating this movie when there are not even gore! ok, no blood. What else can a movie like this offer? Breats? No, even no excitement! <br /> <br /> it's true that this movie may have a certain charm in its unique insolence, but any potential buyer / observer of this movie should be honestly advised that this movie is at best only worth one in ten.
