This is a typical mess of the 70's. This is to be the docudrama about the crew hunting Bigfoot through the Northwest Pacific. Each character is a stereotype, from Native Americans to a cynical cowboy. Acting and narrative is a complete joke. If you're hoping to see a lot of bigfoot recordings - hope. There will be many, and what can be done in your yard with the help of a cheap costume and video camera; it would look better than this movie. <br /> <br /> It's not that I do not like low-budget tickets from the 1970s; I do. It's such a mess of bad acting, bad characters, bad stories and no emotions that you just can not enjoy. It does not fit the "it's so bad" category, and you can not make fun of how bad it is without the help of illegal substances. This is primarily boring photos of people who camp, wander, ride horses and watch wild life. Bigfoot's attack is completely stupid; presumably our friend Sasquatch throws stones at the campers while they shoot at him with rifles. At this point, you are cheering hard on the big foot to throw stones at the filmmaker's head and stop the whole thing.
