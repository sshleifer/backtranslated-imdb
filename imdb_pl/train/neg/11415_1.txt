Well, AWFUL is just a name. This film is a clichéd piece of rubbish. School comedy in a military camp. I'm sorry I had to give this 1 star that he did not deserve. <br /> <br /> IT MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS: <br /> <br /> Almost everything is completely forced, unconvincing and unreal. HEPO (military police) will not come for you if it does not show up, especially on the day of the wedding. The actors were very embarrassed during this scene because the stage did not work because it was very unlikely. You can feel it in their voices. Even if they were not so bad actors, they would not be able to save the scene. <br /> <br /> Then the guy has to practice in his wedding suit. No, there was no time to give him a uniform first. Man, these are great pictures! I remember this scene for the rest of my life. <br /> <br /> There are also GIRLS in the camp - exciting - one of them is even a model, though it does not look so great - and the worst actress I've ever seen. I doubt they would have told her one line in Hollywood in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Well girls in the army! It's cool now. The girls are even placed on the same floor, so we can sneak into their room at night! In fact, they would have been placed in another building, a quarter mile away, separated by two barbed wire fences. <br /> <br /> There are tanks that we can use for fun in our free time, which we have plenty of. No, the tanks are not blocked and the ignition keys are inserted. No one will notice the engine sounds, especially not at night. <br /> <br /> There are several sexual scenes and references, all below the waste line. We need those who also like Germans. Switzerland is too small a market for any feature film. Good job! <br /> <br /> One scene of sex takes place in the kitchen. Certainly none of these objects is ever closed. Military procedures are just as sloppy as they can. <br /> <br /> At the end of a brainless attack, mafia people are vengeful of a poor guy trying to shoot him! Because he left his fiancée! Sure, I buy it, Italians are like this - a jealous package (no). <br /> <br /> Bad guys try to do it in daylight with two dozen eyewitnesses. Not at night in a dark alley. Again, military training grounds (where they shoot live ammunition) are open to the public, anyone can freely ride or walk there. There are no such things as guards or fences. <br /> <br /> The act, however, prevents a good captain by firing a rocket into the Italians' car. The explosion knocks down men's legs and an angry fiancée. Nobody in the distance of 40 feet will suffer if the car is torn to pieces. It's COMEDY, remember. <br /> <br /> Okay. It's a comedy, I have it and I can live with it. You do not need realism. Movie makers can easily do it if it's fun, sharing fun, funny, interesting, challenging. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. It's just embarrassing. Breaking from mindless American comedies. The latter are at least professionally made, without amateur actors. <br /> <br /> It is quite boring and predictable, a waste of time and energy, especially for those who sit in the whole movie, as I unfortunately do. Yawn.
