This film is advertised as a clever romantic comedy. It is neither clever nor romantic and definitely is not an effective comedy. The fate of a well-meaning, but pathetic hero, "Tom," oscillates from one extremely embarrassing catastrophe to the other. The only saving grace is the competent performance of Toni Collete and the frequency with which we can see the pleasant face of Paltrow. In general, it should be avoided!
