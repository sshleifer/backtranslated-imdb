The creativity of this film has been lost from the very beginning, when writers and directors left a good plot to replace terrible special effects. This movie focused on fun children, but he could not even achieve it. Many small low-budget movies can become great movies, but this movie does not happen anywhere. Fortunately, it will be another film easily made and easily forgotten. This movie was probably a chance for the actors to earn some money on their side until their chance for a real role in a good movie appeared. Anyone who has a little respect for movies should avoid watching the movie at all costs.
