Absolutely the most boring movie I've ever spent money on. It was a bad choice for all those big stars who were wasting their reputation. Boring! boring! boring! Each character was presented in a less than inspiring way. Actors' talent was not demonstrated - just reading the part. Alec can play realistic characters normally, Gwynyth made her look ugly for the ungrateful part, Annette needs advice on how to choose the movies he chooses to play, like all the big stars that disappointed me that everyone allowed the talents they have be suppressed in a function that leaves a lot to be desired in entertainment. "Running with scissors" leads society to look forward to great acting in a film that suggests experiencing tension and deep emotions. There was no time when the cast was able to present any interpretation on the screen. Maybe it's the director's fault - whatever.
