It must be assumed that those who praised this film ("the largest film opera in history" or did not I read somewhere?) Either they do not care about the opera, they do not care about Wagner, nor do they care about their desire to appear in Kultura. Either as a representation of Wagner's swan song or as a movie, it seems to me an unbelievable disaster, with a leaded reading of the score to match the artificial, pathetic implementation of the text. <br /> <br /> It is doubtful that people with ideas about "opera" (or, in this case, art, especially Shakespeare), would be admitted anywhere near a theater or film studio; Syberberg, very fashionable, but without the slightest excuse from Wagner's text, decided that Parsifal is "about" bisexual integration, so that the title character, in later stages, transforms into a kind of beatnik babe, although he still sings high tenor - not many, if any from the actors in the film are singers, and we get a double dose of Armin Jordan, the conductor who is seen as the face (but not heard as a voice) of Amfortas, and appears terribly in the double exposure as a kind of Batonzilla or Conductor Who Ate Monsalvat while playing music Good Friday - in which, incidentally, the transcendent charm of nature is represented by the scattering of vaulted and flaccid crocuses embedded in poorly laid turf, a goal that surprises me. In the theater, sometimes we have to explain such imperfections with our thoughts, but I can not imagine why Syberberg could not connect, for Parsifal and Gurnemanz, mountain pastures as lush as foreseen for Julie Andrews in the Sound of Music .... <br /> <br /> The sound is hard to bear, and the high voices and trumpets in particular have an auditory glow which adds another kind of tiredness to our impatience with uninspired conducting and paralyzing development of the ritual. Someone else in the review mentioned the Bayreuth recording from 1951, and Knappertsbusch, although his pace is often very slow, he missed what Jordan missed, the sense of the pulse, the feeling of low tide and the outflow of music - and after half a century, orchestral sound including the set, in modern pressings, is still better than this film.
