What do you do when you mix stereotypes with infinitely variable stimulation and a group of characters that you do not care about, and an unsuccessful attempt to create an attractive visual style and an even larger block of stereotypes and a poor sense of humor and a really big budget? Why, you get one of the most unbearable movies that can not be watched! I mean Domino, of course. <br /> <br /> Here are some things that people can say while watching this movie: <br /> <br /> "Ooh, wow, the plot is told in turn, which was not done a billion times before and much more skillfully than in this movie. <br /> <br /> "Wow, look at all flashing lights and grainy textures and complicated films. The director is trying hard to make everything look artistic and create a visual style! It is a pity that none of these effects adds anything to the movie, nor does it make sense to the scenes in which they are found, and is also too bad that most of them turn out to be annoying! "<br /> <br />" I've heard this dialogue exchange before about twenty thousand movies! "<br /> <br />" I've seen this scene in about thirty thousand movies before! "<br /> <br />" This one too! "<br /> <br />" Uh, did not they reveal this "storyline" about half an hour ago? This should be surprising? "<br /> <br />" If this movie is supposed to be showing a "hard stick" walking around kicking the ass ... when why does not she do too much? "<br /> <br />" I can not believe how unoriginal this dialogue is. "<br /> <br />" How long does it last? I feel that I have been watching it for over four hours. "<br /> <br />" I have no idea what just happened, but I also do not feel motivated to try to figure it out. "<br /> <br />" Is this the end? "<br /> <br />" I want to get my money back. "<br /> <br />" The songs from this soundtrack are so badly used here. "<br /> <br />" It is ironic that all the curses they use actually weaken the influence of each one. "<br /> <br />" UGH. "<br /> <br /> And finally:" Maybe I will have to end my friendship with the person who recommended this movie to me. "<br /> <br /> In conclusion, this movie is a failure in almost every aspect. Avoid watching it at all costs. If your home is on fire, and this movie is playing in the only room that is not flammable, you should seriously consider burnout alive instead. <br /> <br /> (If I sound bitter, it's because I just spent more than two hours watching this movie and I really did not like it.)
