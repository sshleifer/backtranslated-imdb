"Magnolia" is a preposterous, stunning acting presentation that complements very little. Like "Eyes Wide Shut", "Magnolia" is a pointless series of episodes without concern for consistency. The camera bypasses the corridors and corridors, catching glimpses of sad characters. Where should you look after these people? The common theme seems to be people who shout a lot, who can not take care of others (except for the characters of John C. Reilly and Philip Seymour Hoffman), and are self-destructive shocks that either break up or die. I remembered how much I disliked Shine because of the irrevocable monster of my father, played by Armin Mueller-Stahl. There are so many unattractive, unattractive characters here, why would we want to spend time with them? <br /> <br /> Having said that, nothing stands in the way of "Magnolia". Paul Thomas Anderson's ideas are abandoned on his canvas. In particular, there are two ideas of this bomb. Both happen in the last hour of this 188-minute film. One of them changes the camera from one character to another, while everyone sings one of the folk songs of Aimee Mann. Sweet, but ineffective, because we do not see what connects them all. Another idea I am referring to can not be disclosed except to say that it is completely unexpected and totally ridiculous. <br /> <br /> "Magnolia" has many great activities. Especially Tom Cruise, which releases a performance I did not know. And John C. Reilly plays perhaps the most decent and really good cop in the latest memory. But all this is nothing. When there was a secret, unexpected event, the girl behind me in the theater could not hold it anymore and said: "This is stupid!" I have the impression that most moviegoers will agree.
