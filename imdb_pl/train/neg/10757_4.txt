I just saw this movie on DVD last night and decided to check the reviews this morning. It seems that "I, Robot" polarized the critical viewer community here on IMDb (and gave rise to many insults and names). <br /> <br /> I find this a bit surprising because the film is not great (or even good), but it is not terrible (or even very bad). What the film really is is ... depressing. It is depressing that the population of filmmakers from the US is so ready to fall disorderly, stereotypically, and consider them spectacular new works. This film is a "retread" written on its entire length, from the narrative line (restless mix of Asimov and contemporary uber-action) to Smith (zinc with an elegant look with the backbone of titanium), special effects (which I borrowed from the Matrix and several others ). <br /> <br /> "I, Robot" is, unfortunately, perhaps the perfect action film for today's audience: a superficial plot, nauseously joking dialogue and lots of adrenaline. Smith is mediocre, but we already knew it (it seems to be the last unsuccessful attempt to create black Bruce Willis). The story has many holes in it, all sizes, but I do not think that most of the people who are attracted to this movie are critical enough to notice. Perhaps a hit by today's standards, but a very B-movie compared to the real winners.
