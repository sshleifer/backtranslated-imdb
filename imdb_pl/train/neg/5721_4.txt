I was not a fan of the 2005 "Hostel" festival in 2005, and most of these lame assholes are just as bad or worse - but "Live Feed" I managed to have some fun for the first 30 minutes. It started with a lot of sex and dingy settings, followed by good death scenes involving Chinese Organized Organ Crime and a 7-meter butcher with leather skin apron ... What threw me out of the movie is a hard hero with rifle and injuries saving this day ... I would call this movie mediocre, at best, because the premise of mainly nasty young people killed in a filthy porn theater, doubling as a mafia hideout, speaks to me. If only the tortures were extended enough to be completely effective, my assessment would be very different. Unfortunately, most gruesomeness is collected together in one scene, leaving the rest of the film as a scenario of revenge. So, basically, it's just a low-budget "Hostel" picked up from the redeeming use of free sex, almost constant in the first half of the movie ... In general, I would say that do not worry about it.
