After the defeat of the first Sleepaway Camp, who thought that a franchise might be born. SC II is better in terms of aspect. More inspirational killings and much more fun. Although it may not say much (compared to the first movie), Sleepaway Camp II is worth borrowing. <br /> <br /> Pros: fun, not taken too seriously like SC I. Inspired killings. Cons: Crappy acting and cephalettes abound. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: 5/10 <br /> <br />
