(Honestly, Barbra, I know that you click all those "NO" in my review, 22 times, how many people had to recommend you to help you, you have nothing better to do, how do you look at yourself in the mirror all day?) <br /> <br /> Steven Spielberg told Barbara that it was "the best movie I've seen since Citizen Kane." It almost everything says - and serves as a terrible warning! <br /> <br /> What are the components of a certain fire film disaster and which will haunt you, never letting you forget about the tears of both laughter and pain? Ingredients: Barbry Streisand's face, musical, feminism, voice of Barbra Streisand, director of Barbra Streisand and ultra-humiliate / idiotic judgment. <br /> <br /> Hollywood is full of egomaniacs, that's all we know. In fact, almost everyone? according to the definition ?? he must be an egoman in Hollywood. Why would anyone want to act? For "art"?!? Well, if you're stupid enough to believe what they'll tell you in their carefully prepared interviews? And Streisand has the biggest ego of all! This is quite a good achievement. To be surrounded by narcissistic morons, and yet they can defeat them? unusual. <br /> <br /> The film, like all its "solo" efforts, is the journey of the ego straight from hell. Every scene in which Streisand is located is automatically destroyed. Abortive. But because that's not enough, he's singing a whole bunch of Streisand's songs? You know, the kind that has enabled Mariah Careys, Celine Dions and Whitney Hustonom of this world to poison our precious airwaves for decades. It deserves not one, but 100 episodes of South Park mocking her. <br /> <br /> The premise, Streisand dressing up as a man studying Rabbi, sounds like a bad comedy ZAZ. Besides being a clich√©, the obvious problem is that Streisand does not look like a woman or looks like a man? in fact, I'm not even sure if he is a man. How does she look in this movie? it can not be described in words. E.T. for comparison, he looks like a high school referee. It looks more strange than Michael Jackson in 2015. It looks terrible. <br /> <br /> Songs. They made me shake. Especially, "Daddy can hear me squeaking like a mad woman in the heat of the roller?" And "Tomorrow night I will prepare the sequence, YENTL 2: RETURN THE BITCH". <br /> <br /> Did you know that Streisand was considering a job at the beginning of his career, but changed his mind when they told her that her voice could change? Can you believe it? She should do it! Killing two flies with one stroke, just to make it look like it. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in reading my biography of Barbra Streisand and other Hollywood intellectuals, please contact me by e-mail. <br /> <br /> DOES THE BARBAR SHOULD I EARLY PAY FOR A PENSION? CLICK "YES" OR "NO".
