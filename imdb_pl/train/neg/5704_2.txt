After reading some good reviews about this movie, I thought it was time for me to see him. Well, I do not know why I was worried. Essentially, this family was entrusted with a clue that leads to a great supply of the ancient treasure hidden by the Templars during the War of Independence. Apparently, he had to be kept out of the hands of the British at all costs. First, why did the Knights move the treasure from Europe to America? How did the character of Nico Cages understand that "Charlotte" was actually a ship? How to recognize all tips and puzzles in a minute? And how could two people suddenly become masters of thieves and steal what is probably the best kept piece of paper in the world? These are just some of the holes in this incomprehensible Hollywood action. Cage appeared in great action movies - "Face-Off" and "The Rock" - so why did he drop? Is he too old ?! His character is really annoying - somehow this "ordinary" guy steals the Declaration of Independence, overtakes thieves from weapons, escapes from the FBI and generally seems invincible. The whole movie makes no sense and it was a disappointment.
