His spelled S-L-A-S-H-E-R-S. I was happy when the main character flashed her tits. It was quite strained. There are many blows before and after this film. Acting is like an e-list and is well shown in the movie. Not to mention that there is such a low budget that Preacherman and Chainsaw Charlie play the same person. The whole movie looks like it was shot with a camera, not half-decent movie. The only other reason I liked the movie was that Chainsaw Charlie and Doctor Ripper were funny. They said a lot of stupid things that made me laugh. Besides, if you see this movie in Blockbuster, let everyone want to hide it behind Lawnmowerman 2. Anyone who thinks this movie is good should be judged mentally.
