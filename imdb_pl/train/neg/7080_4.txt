This movie could have been an interesting character study and could give some insight into it, but the real problem with this movie is that there is no one in it. It does not give any information or solutions to the problem. This is just a portrait of an "old man" addicted to the male sex and problems that he creates for his everyday normal life and family. Why do you want to watch it? It's all meaningless and meaningless. <br /> <br /> It really does not help if the main character is a wrinkled 50-year-old man. It will be difficult for you to identify yourself and sympathize with him. It just looks like a dirty old playboy who constantly hunts for a woman and sex. She has different kinds of sexual relations about 3 times a day with another woman, and not just with prostitutes. <br /> <br /> There is also no bad visual style, although everything seems a bit forced. But still, everything looks better than most other productions directly on the video. Who knows if the creators of the film would get better material for work, the film would deserve better faith. <br /> <br /> The story is really mocking sometimes. There are really meaningless storylines that are often more ridiculous than they were supposed to be. I am talking about the entire Ordell story line, for example. The situation gets worse when the movie begins to move towards the end. Also the whole way of telling stories, cutting between the events that happened and the sessions of the main character with his psychiatrist seems a bit cheap and simple. <br /> <br /> But when it comes to bad movies, it's not one of them. This is not better or worse than any other random movie with similar concepts. <br /> <br /> It still seems strange and quite amazing that they managed to fill Nastassja Kinski and Ed Begley Jr. simple small, insignificant production like this one. I'm guessing that they were really desperate in looking for work and money. <br /> <br /> 4/10
