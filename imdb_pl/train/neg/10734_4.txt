I have not read the negative professional review of this movie yet. I guess I had to miss something. The beginning is intriguing, the three main characters meet late at night in an empty bar and play with made-up stories. This is the best part. After three separate films, the film is divided into three threads. That's when boredom begins. Certainly the thread with Felliniesque babushka, which make dolls from chewed bread, is at first a curiosity that opens the eyes. Unfortunately, the director beat this one to death, even injecting a wild plot that does not lead anywhere. Bottom line: a two-hour, bodiless plot. If you suffer from insomnia, look her in bed and you will have a good night's sleep.
