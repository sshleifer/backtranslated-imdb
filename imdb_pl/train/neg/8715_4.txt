Primal Species comes from the legend of B Movie by Roger Corman and everyone who watches this must realize that this is a low-budget movie B and he knows it. <br /> <br /> A group of terrorists with a large truck and a truck kill the whole army, they believe that it will contain uranium, but not ..... It contains two Dino with a taste for the Human Body ... Then the Crack team, which might as well he could be called the Delta Force, he will be summoned. <br /> <br /> OK, this is not Jurassic Park, and so Dino is never clearly visible, because it is obviously a guy in a dress that is not too different from Barney Dinosaur - just a bit terrifying ME, but come on the guys had about 1% of the budget of Jurassic Park and as such they do what they can. <br /> <br /> Does it deserve to be downstairs 100? .... FIVE NOT !!! I think that almost half of the voters who give it 1 - is too rough, it is much closer to 4 ... is actually much better than the whole mass of other films not in the bottom 100 and has a similar production value for the production of Sci- Fi Channel. (again Movies that have too much time from critics here on IMDb) <br /> <br /> Acting is as expected in film B, although none of the actors take it seriously, just like the script <br /> < br /> All in all, it's a nice B movie - not for movie snobs <br /> <br /> ** with *****
