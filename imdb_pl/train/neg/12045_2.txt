Hello, <br /> <br /> This is my first post in IMDb, although I use it as a reference for a long time. That's why I would like to greet you all. The fact that I am Greek will inevitably affect my judgment, I hope not for your annoyance. <br /> <br /> I spent 2 years of my life (actually all Greeks) analyzing the epic of Omirus (and not Homers, as you can see everywhere), rhymes through rhymes. If I remember correctly, Iliad (Iliad) in 8th grade and Odysseia (Odyssey) in 9th grade. Warner's Troy was a big disappointment for me and my Greeks from all over campus (I study in the UK). <br /> <br /> Iliad epos is one of the best literary works ever made. It was composed by the Greek poet Omirus for 400 years after the war. Historians placed the Trojan war around 1200 BC, and the real cause of the war was not the beauty of Helena, but the strategically important position of Troy. It said that now you can understand that the Omirus epic does not present real events (because it is not accurate historical data), but this was never the purpose of this work. <br /> <br /> Reading this huge poem, one can reflect on the definitions of honor, love, anger, hatred, heroism, discipline, loyalty and so on. The prolonged talks between warriors before the battle were the best and most educational part. None of them, however, was revealed in "Troyu" <br /> <br /> Warner's Troy was really cheap in my eyes, as well as for other intellectuals from Finnish and German colleagues. It's a pity to spend millions of dollars in such a bad scenario. By the way, the perfect storm was a bad and stupid hit (computer graphics did all the work), yet it is Wolfgang Petersen's best work. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I think it's better to look at something else instead. I would give Troy 2 out of 10. This is a really expensive movie. <br /> <br /> Regards <br /> <br /> Alex
