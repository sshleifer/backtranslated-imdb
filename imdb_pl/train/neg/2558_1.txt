I was going to review it on the website and I was optimistic that maybe it would be cheesy at best, but it would be fun, it did not even do it well enough. <br /> <br /> "666: The Child" is probably one of the worst supernatural thrillers I've ever seen (even worse than "Godsend") with scenes from "The Omen" without shame. The ending is even very similar to the ending of "The Omen". <br /> <br /> Not to mention that acting, writing and history are simply trite. If these films make money, I can see sadly where the Asylum is going. This is embarrassing.
