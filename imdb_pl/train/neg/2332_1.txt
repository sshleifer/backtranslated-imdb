What was the purpose of the movie? I suggest that a handful of actors and their producers and the director receive a great payment for nothing. Even my favorite actor, Bruce Dern, could not keep interested in this boring movie. Braindead ex-pugilist falls into a strange woman and her relatives. It starts as a woman for a woman and ends the fight with a man and is caught in a plan to kidnap. It was so confusing that I can not even write decent criticism. If you see this one, my sweet one, make sure it's after dark so that you can go to sleep.
