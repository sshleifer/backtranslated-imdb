This movie was a total waste of time. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie with a group of cinematography enthusiasts who have different tastes in movies, but are always keen to watch the work of "genius" (as one of my colleagues commenting on this page would like to mark this steaming pile?); none of them found a single redeeming quality. We finished the movie with a thrilling chorus, which I will not print here again. <br /> <br /> I can only guess that the positive reviews here were written by Sir Anthony Hopkins himself. Afterall, how will one of the reviewers tell you, he financed the film himself? because no one else in Hollywood or anywhere else in the world would risk a dime or a good name in relation to this movie. Do not let the semi-famous actors who appear in the movie lure you into his claws? as Christian Slater admits in the special functions of "creation", he signed up for the film without reading the script or not knowing any details (I am sure that stupidity will never happen again). <br /> <br /> I feel sorry for the unfortunate person who falls into this swamp of indulgence, written, directed, produced and financed by a man who is too famous to admit to himself that not everything he creates, is a masterpiece (and if you do not believe me, please google "Hopkins" and art).
