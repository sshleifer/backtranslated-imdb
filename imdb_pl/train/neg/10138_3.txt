Over the years I have seen a few of them straight to Segal's films, and each of them has the same amount of entertainment; unfortunately, the level of entertainment is low. Sure, the action sequences were fun, but it was largely. Seagal was really in great shape when he was making films like; Under Siege, Under Siege 2 and Executive Decision (at least at the level of the action), but in the last ten years, the films of the type in which Segal plays, really do not meet his earlier qualifications. <br /> <br /> He more positive, the film used the time well, as well as some action sequences and the use of wit. As soon as the film seemed to drag, a pretty cool action scene took him out of the gutter. I honestly believe that more of Salla's films would be better if he was not the only one that the fans recognize in the film. Supporting actors and actresses is a very important thing, and if his current films had famous actors and supporting actresses, maybe the film will gain more popular results.
