This movie was so bad that I had to fast forward to get to the good tracks. What are the good pieces? the only thing that was worth it was the ending (those who saw the movie will know what I mean). I was expecting much of this movie, as the underground world meets the dawn of the dead meets Freddy and Jason, but I have this nonsense. The story was forgotten, the cast was badly used and what the director thought when he did it. It could have been great, but it turned out to be the most boring movie I've ever watched. OK, and what if it was cool T and A, I was up and I was bitterly disappointed. Do not expect the film to be good, but if you want a bad horror movie, just look at it and see how the horror SHOULD NOT DO.
