I rented this movie because it sounded quite interesting, but in my horror movie was the worst movie I've ever seen! I have read the comment Gumby-8 and it must be part of the cast or crew. If Gumby-8 is not a 4-year-old child or a deranged member of worship, no one in his right mind would think that this movie has any potential. <br /> <br /> I could not believe Gumby-8 comments. <br /> <br /> Quote: From the "Dune" animation inspired by the rapid pace ... this movie makes the eye move and work so well that re-watching is not unexpected. "<br / > <br /> Animation is the only aspect of the film that was interesting and the fact that the movie makes the eye move, and that's because you're still looking for tension. I mean the Halloween break was filmed with a budget of $ 100,000 and a painted mask, and by the way became an iconic classic. When it comes to "repeating the viewing is not unexpected", I think he did a typo. <br /> <br /> Another quote from Gumby-8 is the only fan: "Acting is also a strong aspect of the movie." <Br /> <br /> With all due respect for the actors, their performance is nothing more than the right talent of Robert Napton . <br /> <br /> Catchy Tagline: "Beware of the hours between dusk and darkness" <br /> <br /> That's because there is no twilight or darkness in this movie. <br /> <br /> Rating MPAA "Rated R for some przemoc / gore" <br /> <br /> The only gore you see is some red paint on a sheet over a dead body that you will never see. As far as I know, it can be a clump of grass. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I've seen horrors from the '50s,' 60s and '70s. I saw what I thought was absolutely the worst, and some very good. The director of this movie either did not make any attempts, either slept or took up acid. Regardless of the case, I think actors deserve applause for trying to save a very bad direction. I would give this film a grade of 0.5 for the film "B".
