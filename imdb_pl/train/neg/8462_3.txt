"Bullfighter" was created in 2000, but for some reason it was released on video 5 years later. I wonder why? Is it possible: the tangled plot, Oliver Martinez's incomprehensible dialogues and the annoying edition? It must be. I think the story was Mary (Michelle Forbes), and Jacque (Oliver Martinez) went on a mystical journey. They meet many crazy characters and also avoid some bad guys. The film looks great and is a lot of style, but it has no substance. Most of the films, subtly trying, do not pay attention to each other with unchanged plot changes and weak special effects. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the cover: Willem Dafoe is in it for 2 minutes the most.
