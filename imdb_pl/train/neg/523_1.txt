What is amazing for me today is entertainment. maybe I'm a dinosaur from the fifties and I'm out of touch with today's film genre, and apparently it's the case with this movie because so many people liked it. I found it vulgar and vulgar. I did not say that about many movies in my life, but it fits the bill. Humor is refined and raw. I'm not a politically correct person and even I found gay jokes, not only not funny but offensive (I'm not gay). The main character of the film is not even a nice person, only pathetic. When the movie ended, I heard how many people commented on how disappointed they were about what they had just paid to see.
