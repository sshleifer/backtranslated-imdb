It's said like a real cooked gangster u'an. The story is not worse than any number of gangster films, but never confused with Godfather I or II or Goodfells. It is not in the same league. <br /> <br /> But what makes the movie periodically painful to watch is that these Italians Americans are throwing themselves around by throwing off bad lines of gangsters in an even worse false accent of u'an. Pacino would be great if they could just name him. I could not wait to see Abraham and Loggia, but their scant accents ruined the fun. <br /> <br /> Well, the script is not too hot either. Don Corleone would make him disappear five minutes after meeting him, smiling and patting him on the back all the time.
