Without plot, hopeless acting and senseless gore .... <br /> <br /> Is this supposed to be a horror movie? There is no fear or uncertainty, only BOM BANG GORE, and then done. Some Marines are in the desert because of some weird, shitty reason and are chased by these mutant beasts from the first movie that was good, and he should have left it. just another excuse for money and the use of senseless violence, just like the sequels 'Saw'. They know, no matter how foolish the story is, and the more you can add, people will see it. I miss good movies about horror. Come Hollywood, you can do much, much better.
