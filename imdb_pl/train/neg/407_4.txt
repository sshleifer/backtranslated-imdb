I love special effects and watch new technologies that make science fiction seem real. The special effects of this movie are very good. I've seen most of this movie because it has been on HBO for the last few months. I must admit that I could miss a few scenes, but I usually get into movies and see some scenes more than once. But every time I see "Hollow Man," I feel depressed, almost like a "movie noir". I do not know why; maybe that I do not want Kevin Bacon to be angry and disappointed. But I think it shows how tenacious he is getting angry. Regardless, I can recommend this movie for excitement (although some parts are moving slowly), but I do NOT recommend it to children under 14 (maybe 12 if they are mature).
