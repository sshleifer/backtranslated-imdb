DRACULA 2000 is a horror movie that has been shown on Sky Movies in the United Kingdom, and given that it seemed to be appearing about three times a week throughout the year, I have no idea how I missed it until it will be broadcast online in the evening television. Actually, because I'm not a fan of horror movies, the reason was probably my theory that it will be tripe. My theory has mostly proved to be right <br /> <br /> !!!!! LESS SPOILERS !!!!! <br /> <br /> What makes DRACULA 2000 such a bad movie is the amount of stupid scripts. For example, at the beginning of the film, bad guys are flying Dracula's coffin from London to America (in a twin-engine turbocharged airplane!), And one of the bad guys is left alone in the hold, where Dracula comes alive. There is a fight, there is a lot of noise, but bad guys in the cockpit can not hear the sound until the scenario requires it. It also appears at the climax of this segment that Dracula can control the weather, but it seems that it is forgotten as the film progresses. Sloppy scripts, and there seems to be a problem with the structure in which many character scenes are in Mardi Gras in New Orleans, and the characters are in a different place, such as a police station in the next scene, and then return to Mardi Gras after the scene what means that the lack of credibility in the story is strengthened. <br /> <br /> There is something else that has jerked my chain - Product placement. There are several scenes in which the logo for a certain record label / store chain network is fully visible. I dare not publicize the company's brands (except that they also run a railway company, which is a national joke in the UK), but I had the impression that this type of advertising was against British broadcasting and I am surprised that the BBC showed this movie if yes is <br /> <br /> There are some positives in DRACULA 2000, such as visualizations. It's a really good looking movie with a good looking cast and a boy who was a hot vampire chick, but this is something we should expect from Hollywood in the last few years - A very good looking movie that's very stupid
