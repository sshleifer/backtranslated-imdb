"Private practice" is extracted from a quite successful and well-written "Gray Anatomy". The cast is fantastic. The premise may even work. But the letter is simply awful. <br /> <br /> The pre-premiere dressed up for the episode of Gray's Anatomy should be my first warning. The plot was just a blahem. I thought it was a coincidence. So I set the recorder on the pilot tape and all other episodes. <br /> <br /> When I watched the remote, I was just wondering how a performance with such a cast of great actors could create a boring pilot. The pilot is to suck people and come back for more. It should be exciting, brilliant, great writing, an intriguing plot with a breakwater that you have to answer for the rest of the season. Amazingly, this concert did not have anything to do with it. <br /> <br /> Thinking it was a fluke, I just watched the second episode with hope for the best. And even if it's a little better, it does not come close to what has to be interesting, it can not miss TV. <br /> <br /> I just scrubbed this program from the list of programs to watch. Not worth the effort IMO and I would be very surprised if this show survived even in the middle of the season. Give it to one people.
