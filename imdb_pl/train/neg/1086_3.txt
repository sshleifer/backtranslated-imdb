Despite the impressive lineage of cast and crew, Gingerbread Man falls apart early and often. The plot is unrealistically intricate, the actors have bad accents, and the share of director Robert Altman is to collect a check. Once again, he gathered an impressive cast (just like Woody Allen, everyone wants to work with Altman), this time the letter is bad. But this is only part of the problem. <br/> <br /> Kenneth Branagh is Rick Magruder, a high-ranking lawyer from Georgia who, in the heavy opening stages of the movie, succeeds in seducing a mysterious waitress from a catering company that convinces him that he is in serious danger from his ex-husband and madwoman. With the red flags everywhere, a clever lawyer is even trying to make his children vulnerable. Fights with weapons and fists go hand in hand with the required car chase, and if that is not enough, a hurricane will be thrown to obtain an absurd final. <br /> <br /> Branagh plays MacGruder with a flourish and unconvincing southern accent. Running in a trench coat in all weathers is blind to what is obvious to keep history. Hipster Bob Downey Jr. it's just as bad as P.I. but with a little more emphasis on a bad accent. Robert Duvall as an old man is Boo Radely, everyone grew up crazier than a bedbug serving thick slices of ham, but at least his twang is credible. Females lead (Embeth Davidtz, Darryl Hannah, Famkhee Jansen) are slim and full of emotions. Even famous lawyers performing episodes (Vernon Jordan) are wooden with several throwing lines they have. <br /> <br /> In addition to not paying attention to his actors, the miming of Altman's scene dripping with Spanish moss is dark and shapeless, his comic scenes. He lacks unconventional accents and observations (he informs the viewer that Stars and Bars are still waving in Georgia), which makes a well-made Altman so special. Unfortunately, Gingerbread Man is an Altman in the worst case, even if the pay is the same.
