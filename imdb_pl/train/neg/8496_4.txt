Have you ever seen a film made only of long shots? No? Me neither. Well, I finally saw one of "Spring in my hometown" and I have to admit that now I know why people do not. The technique is "artistic", but it is definitely NOT mature for public consumption. The technique is very flawed, simply because the viewer has no emotional attachment to the characters, or maybe it can be the director's whole intentions. I do not know, I can not read in my mind, and I certainly do not know enough about the director to pass judgment. <br /> <br /> But one thing in this film, which IS painfully obvious, is its funny anti-American mood. As an American, I am aware of my country's participation in the Korean War and I am well aware that we have not always been angels, but I am damned if I take this guy's version. According to this blind fool, Americans were not only a source of war, we were CAUSING war, and we almost destroyed the country almost individually. Whatever, Headmaster. And I suppose you would still make this film in COMMUNIST KOREA if we did not interfere, right? Talk about forgetting your history. It is almost similar to the fact that the Nazis are "good guys" and the Allied forces become "bad". This movie is so historically naive and so inaccurate in fact that watching it is almost embarrassing. For a man who comes from a country that owes his EXISTENCE to American interference, he certainly comes out as tall, powerful and judgmental.
