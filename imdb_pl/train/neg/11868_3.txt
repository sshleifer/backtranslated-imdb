At first glance, this film has everything the psycho wants: a vampire story with a "no under 18" limitation, full of hyper-violence, drugs, gore, sex (including lesbian sex), fanatics fanatics, and even gay policemen ! But this movie is a consequence of bad history (so thin), bad acting - with an absurd English accent that makes you believe you're watching the wrong Monty Python - bad music (hard rock from the 80s), video recording is awful, the ending is real shame ... Plus sex scenes are ridiculous, the blood is not very impressive. And these vampires are reflected in the mirror and are not even afraid of daylight! You will be very disappointed, unless you see it as "Space Mutiny" or "Troll 2". I hope Bloodlust will one day reach the lowest 100, because this is his real place. <br /> <br /> I would say watching is still nice if you have friends and enough beer. <br /> <br /> 3/10
