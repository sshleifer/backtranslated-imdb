Mae Clarke will always be remembered as a girl whose face James Cagney showed a grapefruit in the same year THE PUBLIC ENEMY. She will not be remembered for this strange little story about a girl with a hood who discovers that her past will always be with her. <br /> <br /> In a sense, it looks a bit antiquarian for 1931, almost as if you were looking at the famous indifferent LIGHT NEW YORK of 1928. But do not be fooled. Although Ted Tetzlaff's photography is still in large stages, there is a lot of movement, which indicates the distraction of viewers in their settings. But in the competition with the rapidly changing things that everyone else seems to be doing in Warner, this attempt to put the woman's point of view into the genre as a tear-squeezer does not work, and Mae Clarke is not an actress who carries this effort.
