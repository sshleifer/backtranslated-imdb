After an impatient wait until the end, I must say that I would like to not join the whole series in the first place. The last episode was everything against the previous seven years. It ruined everything. The trip lasted for 23 years, but Captain Janeway has the power to reduce it ... let's say it's only seven years. Why seven? Why not just one? Or nothing? Why not avoid the whole adventure? Crew members die during the entire journey. Why does he just want to save the Seven of Nine? Others do not count or what? The most absurd part when the crew claims that returning home is not the most important thing for them. By saying "travel is more important than the goal." Unbelievable. And on the final scene are surrounded by other ships of the Federation, and the Earth is in sight. Nothing about landing, return to a normal life. <br /> <br /> The worst ending in history.
