I did not even know that the movie existed until recently when I saw Blade: Trinity, I was wandering around the Trinity deck when I saw a user mention that the Wes Craven series is much better than Blade's 'nonsense', so I I did my quick research: I checked the results on IMDb and RottenTomatoes for Dracula: Ascension, and somewhere in the search I found out that this is a continuation of Dracula 2000. I also noticed that in Craven Dracula's tablets it was really strong following this movie, which is great a contradiction with the scores I have seen. <br /> <br /> Now let's get to the short summary. I remember seeing Dracula 2000 and remember that I did not like her at all, and then seeing the Dracula scores: Ascension further reduced my expectations, but again I'm the type of person who really needs to watch a movie (any movie) so that I can form my own opinion . <br /> <br /> A few things that I knew about when I started watching this movie are a low budget, so that's why I'm going to ignore a lot of v / fx and just compensate for the history and acting, I was also impressed by some castings in this movie (Jason London, Roy Schieder and Jason Scott Lee) <br /> <br /> Oh geez ?? This movie was CHEESY! But trashy can be at least funny, I think it is quite fun, badly synchronized with re-recording dialogue in several scenes, stupidity of the characters from this movie. Probably everyone knew about vampires and some basic things, and Luke even had a book about it, but did it prevent them from intentional "contagion"? No, it's the worst, and then waving hands when the girl has to get out of the shower and check the noise she hears with nothing more than a towel. <br /> <br /> I also had to blink at some point because I'm not sure how "Dracula" dressed in his body, especially since he is big, wild and angry, and I think if I was in such situation, I would not like to be the one who dresses it. <br /> <br /> So the movie ends like every middle trilogy movie? it's not, instead it's a "Cliff's Hangar" where I can now wait for the third part of "Legacy". Oh, the entertainment value of Cheesa's films.
