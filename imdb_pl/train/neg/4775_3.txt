What a complete waste of time. The film begins as a clone of the Saw series, but with even worse acting. Melissa Joan Hart is absolutely horrible. The ending is absurd, and the story does not contain any twists, plot surprises and an ordinary bad ending. I liked some characters and hoped that at the end everything would bind. It just does not happen. This is a total "wrestler" ending in the lack of good acting. I can not believe that I spent this time watching it. This is not "fun", as some say. The guy in the mask kidnaps people who are connected to each other and forces them to decipher. The connection is stretched and he should have first shot the main actress.
