JUST CAUSE presents Sean Connery as a Harvard law professor, Kate Capshaw (does he still work?) As his wife (a small age difference) and Lawrence Fishburne as a racist southern cop (!) And Ed Harris in a totally exaggerated interpretation a fundamentalist southern serial killer. <br /> <br /> Strange casting, but the movie plays seriously ** with the audience. (do not read if you intend to watch this movie seriously or watch this movie seriously because of spoilers) First of all, I felt that I repeatedly roll my eyes to liberal stereotypes: cops are all sadistic and capture the black guy without evidence. The coroner, witnesses, and even the lawyer of the accused collaborate against him (he is accused of rape and murder of a young girl) because he is black. <br /> <br /> Connery is a professor of law at Harvard who gives a passionate talk about injustice towards the blacks and the barbaric death penalty. He turns to the grandmother of the condemned man with a request to defend and reopen the trial. <br /> <br /> Connery is cheated (yawns ...) by small town officials and a good boys' club from IL, but he states that the case against Blair, the alleged killer, now on death row, has been fabricated. The main evidence was his confession, which was beaten out of him. <br /> <br /> The beating was managed by a black policeman (!) who even played Russian roulette to get a confession from him. Connery learns that another prisoner in the death cell has actually committed a murder and after several tetas of serious abuse, Hannibal Lecter - like Ed Harris - learns where Harris hid the murder weapon. <br /> <br /> He gets a rehearsal and Blair is freed. <br /> <br /> I think that ... we're finishing the movie ... <br /> <br /> Suddenly! It turns out that Blair is a psychotic psycho and that he used "white guilt" to enlist Connery. He invented a story with Ed Harris in exchange for Harris doing some murders for Harris. <br /> <br /> now Blair is back on the loose thanks to Connery's illusory rules! Last 30 min. if the strange action movie is included in the legal drama, Connery and Fishburne are fighting a serial killer in an alligator home on stilts (yes, you read it well) on the Everglades. <br /> <br /> It was one strange movie. <br /> <br /> So the whole system is corrupt and inefficient, the cops are just persecutors, and the Abu Graib torturers, but the criminals are really psychotic and deserve to fry. <br /> <br /> Really depressing on every level! The system is completely broken, and the white types of PC guilt that question it are also seriously deluded. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down. Connery apparently had to pay off a mortgage or something like that.
