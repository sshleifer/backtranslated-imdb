Well, if it were not Ethel Waters and 7-year-old Sammy Davis, Jr. (here announced without Jr.), Rufus Jones for the president would be one of the worst performances of African-American stereotypes that were seen from the early Talkie period and would not be worth seeing. Mrs. Waters is great here singing "Am I Blue?" And "Underneath Our Harlem Moon", while Mr. Davis shows us how his childhood experience in show business has prepared him for the status of a superstar as an adult. He is so good that he dances in this place, that for a moment I thought he was a small person with many years of experience. So if you want to ignore the negative connotations here, Rufus Jones for the president should ensure good fun. P.S. This is the fourth time that I saw and heard the song "I'm Be Glad When You Dead You Rascal You" starred in the film, this time Davis. There had to be a very popular song about that time.
