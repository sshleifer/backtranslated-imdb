Hmm, hip-hop music to the western period. Modern phrases, such as "cool" and too many others to follow. "Sistahs are at home"! French manicured nails on hard riders. Microphone sets CLEAR on the back of Li'l Kim. I just can not continue the litany of mistakes made by the director and the editors. <br /> <br /> Acting is not as bad as I've ever seen. The women were doing well with a bad script. <br /> <br /> It was strange to hear Louis Mandylor speaking his native accent. <br /> <br /> The girls are beautiful. Fantastic costumes, though completely incorrect. I just can not believe that it is stupid what could have been a great story. I would feel offended when I believed that this movie was full of such traps that it would play well in the city center. <br /> <br />
