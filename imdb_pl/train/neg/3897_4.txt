Working comedy has I.R.S. agent Tony Randall investigating an eccentric family of farmers in Maryland who never paid taxes; Debbie Reynolds is the daughter of a boyfriend who pushes a taxpayer who is not very interested. Debbie certainly contributed to the worse theatrical series during this period - and this one is neither better nor worse than the rest. The picture starts bright, but the flags at the halfway point become crazy and mindless. Randall is not bad for Reynolds, but the vehicle overcomes chemistry. Based on the novel "The Darling Buds of May" by H.E. Bates, with a bad mix of sounds that makes all the actors sound like they're stuck in the echo chamber. ** with ****
