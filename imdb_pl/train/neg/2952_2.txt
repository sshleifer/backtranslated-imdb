From watching only the trailer to Theodore Rex, you'd think it was a bad comedy comedy with Whoopi Goldberg and a guy in a dinosaur outfit. That's true, but it's mainly a futuristic story that looks very much like Batman Forever with his directional style and strange character designs. It was unmatched and should be sold as a futuristic story, not just a lame comedy of a policeman. Regardless of whether this movie is unmatched, it's still a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> In the future, dinosaurs have been brought back to life thanks to the amazing technology, and they talk and walk like people. Teddy is a detective of dinosaurs who is never taken seriously, but after murdering the dinosaur he got the job to do, but he must be the partner of the hardest of them all, Katie Coltrane (Whoopi Goldberg). This unmatched duo must be the solution to the murder, and the audience can not fall asleep long enough to go through this piece of crud. <br /> <br /> Teddy starts the picture as a normal character, but at the end is unbearable. For some reason, being a detective, he is also a bad comedian and a bad performer. He makes imitations of famous people and accents, and has some really awful lines. Whoopi blames him for farting and says: "This is not my trumpet!" Wow! What a childish, immature line, even for a children's movie of that caliber. Whoopi is also annoying and rude to everyone. I hoped Teddy would bite her head the whole length of the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie never knew what he wanted. When futuristic scenes and actions appear, there is no comedy or humor. In each scene without action, the characters try to be as much fun as they can, which results in constant boredom straight ahead. Action scenes do not work because they are too weird and are not violent enough, and as said earlier, comedy is just a few massacred jokes. Nothing works here. <br /> <br /> Having a detective / human duet seems to be quite an original movie, if nothing else. No! This movie is a big rip off Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Just replace the dinosaurs with fairy tales and set them in the future, and this is exactly the same plot. The man is killed, the dinosaur is killed. The dinosaur and the detective solve the murder, and Toon and the detective solve the murder. The bad guys at Roger Rabbit are Christopher Lloyd and Weasel. Bad guys are a guy who sounds like Christopher Lloyd and guys who act like weasels. The club scene at Roger Rabbit, in which Jessica Rabbit leaves the stage, is imitated by dinosaurs. It's a huge scam for a much better movie! <br /> <br /> In general, this is a bad movie, not even deserving to be referred directly to VHS. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/2 out of ****. 90 minutes. PG for mild violence, language and stern humor.
