This review is based on the Shock-o-Rama dubbed movie, which appeared in the unabated world in 2002. It's awful, which represents "1" on the IMDb scale - but it is much worse. It is nice to imagine that the original print in German can improve the situation - comedic dubbing in English is not at all fun - but truthfully it is one of the worst amateur films in any genre that you probably will. Zombies in the movie are as slow and clumsy as ever and do not seem to have the ability to speak or think about anything except their next meal. However, they are also intelligent enough to handle chainsaws and malicious enough to know that the western taboo of the genitals will undoubtedly enliven the conversation at the table. The land of the dead George Romero took on the zombie nation, which kept a shred of social cohesion; here, zombie is nothing but an empty canvas for the perverse imaginations of director Andreas Schnaas. Completely without redemption of social value, and even worse, completely devoid of entertainment, Zombie '90 is a bad joke for anyone who wastes money on it.
