I saw this movie a few days ago and boldly jumped during the terrifying parts. I must admit that I found this to be quite decent ... until I started to THINK about what the characters say. Logic problems: <br /> <br /> 1. Her boyfriend, who seems to be quite a good guy, does not make any sound while killing. Do not you think he would at least try to take the killer? <br /> <br /> 2. When you see that the teacher is "SOOOO in love with Lisa", I almost shouted at the screen. When your best friend's family was KILLED by a TEACHER WHO WAS LIKELY WITH HIM, you do not make such comments if you have half your heart. <br /> <br /> 3. As soon as Nash asks his uncle how much to get out at home, and the uncle catches that he may be in danger, would it not be a wise thing to Donna, boyfriend, aunt and uncle fall into the car and drive far, far away and then bait the HRT home and the police so that the killer can not get out? <br /> <br /> I can go on. And on. And on. Basically, the plot was decent, the characters were not profiled enough so you could feel some empathy when they were killed, and there were too many mistakes. <br /> <br /> HOWEVER. <br /> <br /> This movie can be good for teens or young couples who are looking for fun. If you do not take into account all the fools, this is an average movie.
