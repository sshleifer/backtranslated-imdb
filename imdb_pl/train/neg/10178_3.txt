How ever do I appreciate this sequel noise? Just throw balls! Worst of all, it can not even match the first part of the series! Comedy is not fun. Where were all the unintentional laughs going? Long enough slapstick action in the field. Bob Uecker literally saved it from the complete closure of nine rounds. What's next, MAJOR LEAGUE 4: BACK TO SMALL LEAGUE? Eh, it can be! Leave it on the shelf and plan a trip to the All-Star game. This one had three strokes too much.
