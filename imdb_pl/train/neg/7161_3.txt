A young American visits her Irish roots and repels a druid witch who is supposed to possess her. It sounds intriguing, but after an interesting start I got lost and spent most of the time thinking about where it is going. The film seems to be shaking in two directions - are we watching the problems of an Irish-American woman struggling with the alcohol problem, or are we watching a horrifying horror about the evil witch who comes back from the past? The director does not seem to decide. These two do not seem to gel, and in the end there is no one. It could have been much better, and the story seemed to be pulling towards the end. It was the most boring and disappointing.
