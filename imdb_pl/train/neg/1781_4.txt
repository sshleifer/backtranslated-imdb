Written by Stephen King, but this treatment is not as solid as most of his film stories. Mother and son move into a small town in Indiana with a secret. They are sleepwalkers, creatures of cats that feed on young virgins. This small story has its share in gore and special effects; plus incest tips. <br /> <br /> Alice Krige is outstanding as a mother. Others appear Madchen Amick, Brian Krause and Cindy Pickett. Look for very small roles for John Landis and Clive Barker. Stephen King appeared as a cemetery caretaker.
