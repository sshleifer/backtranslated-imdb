This film probably had some potential; My amazement is how these completely prosaic, obscene motives go to the movies, as if ideas were processed only because generations are. Really stupid stupid things like most of the movies are like dogs, they come back to swallow their own vomits. Well, now they're 19 bucks richer. It was not at all ingenious, there was no moment of redemption, something funny was shown in the trailer (and there was nothing funny in the trailer), the performances were strained (especially Molly, totally unconvincing). What theoretically was meant to be some comic relief is a homoerotic friend with a love for Disney movies; none of his analogies came home, his little moral speeches were flat, I was literally waiting for them to say something meaningful, only to see that he was done. The so-called "hard 10" is the most bland plastic creature that exists (except that it has a horse face with a strange smile); Honestly, her friend Patty (referred to as Hamburglar) looked much better than she. But on the other hand, gentlemen prefer brunette;) Well, the whole assumption is that society is superficial and if love is true, it exceeds all social facades; the way they showed it, with a guy shaving some scrotum and premature ejaculation premature ejaculation with a million horses mutilated and beaten to death (with obvious allusions to American Pie and Happiness - the latter in a disgusting scene with a family dog). I feel as if the film resembles absurd jokes in an unformed unfortunate ball of raw sewage. He goes to show marketing, he can push everything, shine the stinking mass and call it gold, people will come (they worked for me). Done with tirade.
