The summary sums up everything. It is not as good as the original. With the script written jointly by Stallone and James Cameron (at the same time he also wrote Aliens). Most of the action was written by Cameron, and political aspects were written by Stallone. <br /> <br /> Sly was in the best physical condition when he did it and Rocky 4, and he looks great or raised to the steroids, depending on his own point of view or opinion. <br /> <br /> Rambo begins in prison and is visited by Colonel Trautman, who asks him to go on a special mission that would give him a presidential pardon. In the end, he agrees and goes to Charles Napier's information camp, playing a suit from Washington, trying to pass on as a former ex-force to appease Rambo. <br /> <br /> The mission is to find out if there are any missing prisoners still living in the camps in Vietnam. Rambo was elected because the camp he was checking in was a prisoner somewhere earlier. It is said that this is not a rescue mission, and he is just to take pictures of the reconnaissance. <br /> <br /> After a bad attempt at parachuting from the plane, he loses most of his set, meets with his contact (who turns out to be a beautiful woman) and travels down the river with pirates to the camp. <br /> <br /> He discovers that they are still prisoners and save one. When 3 escape from the half of the Vietnamese army on their river boat, they are betrayed by pirates, but Rambo kills them all and they are forced to walk to the reception point on foot after their boat is rammed and blown up with Rambo. on board. <br /> <br /> Rambo is again betrayed and abandoned when Napier orders the rescue helicopter to be withdrawn. It is clear that Trautman returns to the base to rebuke him, that no survivors were found. <br /> <br /> Steven Berkoff appears as the Russian Spetznatz. Vietnamese troops and Spetznatz. Killing many of them, Rambo finally steals the helicopter and saves most of the prisoners to return to his base. <br /> <br /> He resists the temptation to kill Napier for abandoning him, but he destroys the Operations Center. <br /> <br /> Poor storyline and very poor ending when Rambo goes off into the sunset as a free man.
