I have never watched a movie in such a short time. The only saving was the fast-scrolling function in the DVD player. It was like watching a poorly produced CBC movie. Of course, there was no money for lighting, filming, sets, location, screenwriters, editors, actors ... Oh, there was no story either! I have to write ten lines of comment ... Bad, terrible, horrible, miserable, tormented, winding, disgusting, bland, disgusting, repulsive, disgusting, weak, disgusting, nasty, smelly, stinky, stinky, vile, rotting - badly and I do not know Can I finish all ten lines about how bad this piece of mushy production was?
