It was one of those late night hours, "There it is." Sometimes they are great. It was awful, but it really should not be. <br /> <br /> The movie had a really good cast. How can you fail when you have Charlsten Heston and Jack Pallance? We're talking about an Oscar winner here. He had good special effects. He even had really good tits! And I mean, nicely shown, full breasts with a full nipple and at some point even a beaver. But that did not compensate for one missing ingredient - history! The conspiracy was ridiculous. I do not mean the sun's exploding "solar crisis", but it was bad enough. It was the rest of the thing - oh, so stupid and completely predictable, a bad corporation. Man, just STANK! No amount of good acting or cool spaceships or battle scenes could go around this. <br /> <br /> I saw the same cast members who were incredibly good. I've seen great science fiction movies that have tiny casts and budgets. The difference lies in writing.
