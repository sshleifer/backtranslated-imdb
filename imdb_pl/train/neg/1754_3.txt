Why did stories of Mary and Rhody have to be so stupid? Divorced women with indifferent daughters. And why very little reference to the original series and characters? Her daughter's characters were stupid and uninteresting. Why can not there ever be a daughter who likes her mother on TV? It makes sense that Mary will leave Minneapolis, and Rhoda will return to New York, but why can not Phyllis or Sue Ann Nivens be stars? It seems like a pathetic way to remember such great characters. It was good to see Mary and Rhoda, of course, but it could have been better, much better. Well, there's the Mary Tyler Moore Show Reunion, the Dick Van Dyke Show Reunion, hopefully Mary will do better next time she looks back to her old Mary Richards dam.
