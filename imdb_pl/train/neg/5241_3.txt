Tell me the truth I'm a little stunned to see all the positive reviews of so many people, which is also the main reason why I decided to see this movie. And after I saw him, I was really disappointed, and it comes from a guy who loves this genre of film. <br /> <br /> I am totally surprised by this film - it's like a movie for children with nakedness there is absolutely no reason, and all this is associated with swearing and cursing small children. I'm not fair at all, but it really went too far in my account. <br /> <br /> Summary: A story about two guys has been sent to the older brother's program for their reckless behavior. There, they met with one child obsessed with tits and the other with a medieval weirdo. <br /> <br /> Only the name itself is not related to history at all. They are not a role model and do nothing else but serve their time for what they did. History is very predictable (though expected), and humor is poor. And we have not seen the same characters (Mc Lovin's play) in many other movies (such as Sasquatch Gang?). I think I laugh three times and almost fell asleep. <br /> <br /> Well, the casting was okay after all that he was the author of the script. And it works the way we expect it when you watch this type of movie. And the direction of what to expect? It's the same guy who brought us Wet Hot American Summer, and this movie sucks too. But somehow he always managed to get a star to attract his frightening movie. <br /> <br /> In any case, I did not feel completely spoiled, but completely waste of time. Only naked scenes seem to be the best part of the movie. I really do not see any reason why I should recommend it to anyone. <br /> <br /> Pros: Elizabeth Bank? Two topless scenes. <br /> <br /> Cons: not funny, horrible story, nakedness and children do not mix with each other. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3,5 / 10 (Grade: F)
