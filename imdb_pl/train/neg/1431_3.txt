!!!!! POSSIBLE SPOILER !!!!! <br /> <br /> You would think that the story involving Archie Gray Owl - an Englishman who pretends to be a red Indian - would have a great mood. In fact, I would say that the only way to treat this type of film, in which an unusual person is opposed to a credulous audience, is to treat him as a comedy. However, Richard Attenborough commits something similar to crimes, making GRAY OWL a serious drama. What's worse, he also made an extremely terrible movie. Pierce Brosnan does not have the charisma needed for the title role, and the romantic plot between Gray Owl and Pony (played by the equally wooden Annie Gaupeau) is devoid of any kind of chemistry on the screen. But to be honest with the cast, the scenarios that do not portray Archie as an impudent chappy, who would deceive anyone to believe he was a native American, did not help him. Producers and screenwriters have made a serious mistake, because the movie center around the story of Archie is an Englishman - that's why I wrote "Possible spoiler", in fact it was not revealed until the end of the movie that the title character is English, but it is obvious that everyone who watched the movie knew that there is nothing strange in this before. <br /> <br /> Yes, I agree with everyone that the scenery is beautiful and that it has a deep ecological message, which is not really a new concept. Theodore Roosevelt was the first major ecologist of the 20th century, if the truth was told. It should also be remembered that with the exception of SOYLENT GREEN (and probably TWO TOWERS, if you want to classify them as a green message), it was not really a great ecological film. In fact, the most ecologically conscious films suck and include GRAY OWL, a film that did not surprise, he had a serious problem with finding a distributor
