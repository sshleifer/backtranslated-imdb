If it was ZERO ranking, I would give it to this movie. Today for the second time I tried to watch it and still could not go from beginning to end. I can not believe that many celebrities given by others and can only assume that they either know actors or are a disguised columnist! Acting is awful all around, the script is real, the Kid playing on Nichole shows zero emotions, even when it is at risk. The "southern" accent of the actress who plays Mama Amber is funny - I am from Georgia and I have friends from Texas - believe me, NOBODY says that way! None of her emotions seemed real in any scene. The subject matter is very serious and deserves much better treatment.
