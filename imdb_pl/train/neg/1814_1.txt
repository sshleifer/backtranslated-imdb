All these reviewers are on site. I've seen a lot of bad movies for many years, believe me, and it beats a lot! <br /> <br /> It's not just "so bad, it's good" exploiting the waste of time, but the authentic, funny, cruelty of the movie. <br /> <br /> VERIFY a white thing like a furry monster! <br /> <br /> YOU CAN DILUTE in Thom Christopher's "spell-weaving" game! <br /> <br /> GAPE IN SHEER A ** E-CLENCHING DISBELIEF! in worn sets! <br /> <br /> This is one of those "European coproductions". No wonder we have so many wars. I swear, some people taking part in "Wizards of the Lost Kingdom" are not really aware that they appear in the movie! <br /> <br /> FACT! Originally, I watched this movie on HTV Wales late at night when I had a concussion and lack of sleep. I had to track down a copy a few weeks later to make sure it was really terrible. It is. Even worse than Lee Majors in The Norseman, more fun than all of John Derek's films, it's really Citizen Kane of Trash.
