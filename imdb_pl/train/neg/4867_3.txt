That's what we need! Another remake of the classic Hollywood movie, in which Eddie Murphy again made a mistake for the second time for THE NUTTY PROFESSOR. This shows why we lack special ideas in creating high-quality film, ladies and gentlemen! He has some signs of hope for nice and delightful photos of animals that can work and talk to people. Unfortunately, things can be even worse. Bathroom jokes and sexual references immediately kill this piece of "family fun". Even parents and children saw the advert of the trailer on The Family Channel, followed by total anxiety and disgust at the cinema. It is sad to say that this is a more progressive era before the millennium, but enjoy it when it lasts, because things can get worse over time. More went wrong with the completely new DR. DOLITTLE. It is absolutely uncompromising, too flat. I also hate this annoying voice of Chris Rock !!! We need more talented lectors than a group of overpaid celebrities who do not want to declare bankruptcy. I will have to agree to my local newspaper, giving it in the top five of the worst films of 1998. On the other hand, the original version was not good either. Murphy's next project may be PATTON if he is not careful!
