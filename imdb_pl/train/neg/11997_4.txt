this movie has a lot of flaws and that's all I've seen. it is painfully long and terribly oriented. I saw the whole audience getting impatient and waiting for it to end. working time is over 3 hours, which can be edited to less than 2 hours. <br /> <br /> the transition between stories is medium. most people confessed that he was in the seat, expecting something better. <br /> <br /> it's fun only in pockets. ambitious design and implementation below the standard. govinda is doing a good job, anil kapoor disappointed me, rested the way we expected. if you are expecting something close to you or love, then there is no where close.
