Alright, damn, MooCow reluctantly confesses to the truth: a bit like this cheap, cheesy parody of the '70s. The idea that huge hordes of deadly tomatoes destroy the United States is a great idea, and yet moovie provides some decent giggles and, above all, a view of terrified extras escaping from large, obviously fake tomatoes. This film, along with The Kentucky Fried Moovie, is one of the earlier attempts of falsification, which became so popular in the 80's and 90's, mainly thanks to Airplane !. This, like a false parody, is quite weak. Many attempts at humor are fatal failures and will cause many moans. But thanks to the hordes of predatory tomatoes, the nasty song "Maturity of humility" and the amazing scene of the helicopter crash, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes provides some good, albeit largely for the wrong reasons. There is so much wrong with this movie ... and yes, it's hard to explain. Pretty people had to like it, because Tomatoes came back in two of Moore's films and the animated series !! Large pieces of time spent away from tomatoes are quite boring. And kick those 70's clothes, old !! ; = 8) This tomato is grainy and tacky, but worth chuckling or two; the MooCow says to take a pizza and pop at Tomatoes !! : ??
