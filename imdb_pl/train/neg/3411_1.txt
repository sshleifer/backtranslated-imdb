Mix exotic tropical locations, babes in skimpy outfit, explosions, nice-looking Dudley Do-Right clones, movie star with the best years behind him (Martin Sheen), small martial arts and sexy rage (Tracy Lor .er, sorry ... Tracy ELIZABETH Lords) and you would think that you would like to have escapist fun. Not at all! It's a gloomy TV movie, and although it likes to promote itself as "Charlie's Angels", it's not as good as the original series, or even the gawdawawny, irrevocably stupid, the latest C.A. cinema. This abomination is best described as the film THIRD RATE Andy Sidaris. Nowhere is it as good as Andy's Hard Ticket To Hawaii, although some fighting scenes are decent enough. Girls spend too much time posing and try to look prissy and after a while it gets annoying. There is better species material. Oh yes, and "babes" are not as hot as they like to think. A terrible soundtrack ... when it's there.
