When it comes to Spaghetti Westerns, I put This Man Can not Die on the boring side of the genre. It's not that the movie is particularly bad, but it lacks the brilliance and glitter of some of the other SWs I've seen. Guy Madison does everything in his power, but he lacks the charisma on the screen necessary to do it. With one notable exception, the rest of the cast is not particularly good. The direction is not very inspired and offers few moments that I have not seen before. There is not much excitement. <br /> <br /> The exception I mentioned is Rosalba Neri. She is the only bright spot in this otherwise average movie. Unfortunately, her screen time is limited to less than 15 minutes. (Note: the IMDb site for this man can not die.) Rosalba Neri is not playing Jenny Benson, she is Melin's character instead, I'm not sure how anyone would mistake Rosalba Neri for some guy named John Barth as listed in the IMDb credits for the movie .)
