I go to UCSB and take part in classes with executive producer, Alison Anders. She is a great teacher and director, so I found everything she put on her name to be quite good. This film as a choice at the Santa Barbara Film Festival seemed a good choice. <br /> <br /> While this movie included some cool shots and photos, the lack of a story and consistency really took away everything he tried to achieve. My main problem was that it was the first movie of someone else and it could be said. Bad acting and an even worse scenario stopped this movie from breaking to the ground. The soundtrack had cool music, which gave the feeling that the main characters were struggling with the sadness that led to his departure, and now he returns to the place where he grew up. I just have to say that despite some of the better features of this movie, the lack of history and performance really prevented him from being good.
