Although this is a R-rated movie, I really doubt you'll really like it unless you're a teenager. <br /> <br /> Why? Because there is no real story, there is no character development, no funny jokes. <br /> <br /> The only thing that this movie has a lot of is nudity. Tony and tons of naked or almost naked chicks (quite nice, which I can add) to enjoy your eyes. <br /> <br /> I really can not understand why this movie has the title of American Pie, because it's just a bad combination of erotic movie and comedy without success in being one of them. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is to watch this movie only when you want to see naked chicks, but you're too shy to borrow / buy an erotic movie. <br /> <br /> It gave 1/10 for 2 smiles that I had in the whole movie and another 2/10 for nice chicks
