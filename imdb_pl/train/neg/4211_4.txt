About 4 years ago, I liked this movie. I would watch it over and over again. But now ... I do not. Actually, I think this movie would be great for Mystery Science Theater 3000. It has many hard-talking actors (Macaulay Culkin, Christopher Lloyd, Patrick Stewart, Whoopi Goldberg) and a pretty bad story. My favorite part is that Culkin is riding a bike and encountering a gang, and a gang member says, "Hey, Tyler! Where are you? Also pay attention to the classic line "Do you have a feeling in your fingers?" <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it is better than "Good Son".
