Wow, I'm a big fan of Henry VIII / Tudor age and, well, it was ... interesting. The only one I watched was Catherine of Aragon. And wow ... just wow. I've seen bad behavior before, but it has reached a new level. When did the acting actress Catherine cry? she cries and screams and I must admit that I have scrolled many times ... many, many times .... fun, funny things. The only person who showed even a bit of talent was Anne Boleyn actress (although I may be prejudiced, I have a slight obsession with Anne Boleyn, she was a really clever woman, she read it, it's worth it!) I also read a lot about Tudor time and I think that characters they were not very accurately displayed, they were all very stereotypical. See this movie only if you are prepared for a very important period of time, and the important life of the people involved has turned into a laughing stock.
