The film itself is not so bad; many comments indicated obvious defects in the script, but it is possible to see. However, what really gives me a creep is that people like Justin Timberlake are even throwing up on movies and, in addition, on such films. I must admit that I never heard the name of this man before I saw it, but at the same moment he appeared, I was just annoyed. The voice is ridiculous, the face is a bad separation of Legolas, the attitude is terrible, and he can not even properly coordinate all three. I said that I was delighted when he jumped after leaving the disco, because I hoped that from then on it would be only Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey. It is a pity that I was wrong. These two, as well as LL Cool J, give a very decent performance and are the main reason why I give it 4. <br /> <br /> I see many upcoming movies with a small cast of Timberlake ....
