I just finished reading a book about Dillinger. This movie was terribly inaccurate. It's as if they got a list of names and invented everything. His robberies and trips were well planned, until the second - when the time passed, they left whether they had all the money or not. They had notes on every way, where to turn, etc. Purvis had never seen him in the restaurant, he was told that Dillinger had paid for his meal after Dillinger had left. Purvis never even saw Dillinger before the night killed Dillinger, only his pictures. The way in which its members were killed was fictitious. Dillinger never robbed the bank himself, like in this movie. If I never read a book, maybe I could enjoy the movie. Acting was a bit better. The action was too exaggerated. Secondly, I doubt if I would like it, even if I did not read the book.
