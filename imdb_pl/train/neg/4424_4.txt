Oh, oh! Another gay movie. This time it shows the black side. Put your last dollar, it will have an unfortunate ending! But why? With the exception of just under half a dozen exceptions, ALL gay movies must end with death or the end of the "addio". It's like all European Noir Film publishing houses in the 40's, 50's, 60's and 70's. Lead ... a man or woman must die or go away alone into oblivion. Why, for God's sake, writers, directors and producers have an audience leaving theater with depression? After all, it's gay ... not grim. Maybe the category should be changed to a "gloomy" movie. A large percentage of homosexual relationships continues, and couples leave together at sunset! Regardless of who writes or produces, it only shows the disadvantage of gay life and gives a false impression of gay lifestyle. This movie only proves my point. If you rent a DVD, take an antidepressant because another "gay" movie is coming! It's bad!
