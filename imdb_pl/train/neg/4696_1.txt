I know people and I did some animation and graphic design, and the show is awful! They are rich little kids who have no talent and probably begged Nick to accept them! Alex played drums for one year, I played for 4 1/2! The movie is horrible, just like the show! This is the craziest comedy that is not even fun. It's so stupid that I want nonsense !!! It's so crazy that Nickelodeon will ever accept something like that and so stupid! They are so stupid and weird! I hate them and their show and I think that when Nick realizes how stupid he is, he will probably take it off!
