My favorite part were the moments when you started throwing credits. I wish I could give her. Ten million of 10. I really would like to have this hour and thirty minutes back. Do not waste your money or time on it. I could really watch the grass grow and feel better after the wards. <br /> <br /> Nadia was really pretty and I hope the movie did not destroy her career. But she decided to participate in it. <br /> <br /> In total, it drew more than any other movie. More than combined Kazaam and Glitter. It says something. <br /> <br /> Nie <br /> <br /> Is <br /> <br /> it !!!!
