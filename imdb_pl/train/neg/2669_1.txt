I rarely move to comment on an online movie. But I can not understand how it happened. Who did it? How could they think that they are able to make a feature film? Did they do a weekend course at a film school, get a nice check from Daddy, and kidnap David Badiel's family one by one until he agreed? Or maybe he was a long-time friend of a family / distant relationship who did it out of sheer, bad kindness? I do not care, I do not want to know. Even he looks completely embarrassed to be in it, mumbling something and hiding his face in front of the camera. In the meantime, DOP had to be a gentleman from Neighbors, it seemed that there was absolutely no sound project, the script, direction and editing were terrible and to be honest, the apathy that overwhelms me now means I can not worry about spending more of mine of life thinking about this film.
