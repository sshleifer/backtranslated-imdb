Although it is a strange good joke, humor is usually quite dry, and panel members often pull their faces or resort to a coarse language and wait for the crowd to applaud enough jokes. another comment says that I do not think it's the best RTE ever made, it's really dry and sarcastic. Sarcasm is the lowest form of joke, there are some really funny smart gags that will make you laugh a lot. People seem to be convinced by well-known comedians, instead of evaluating the quality of gags that are not so good. In general, it is average, with a few good laughs, but can often be quite average. This is not as good as Jasper Carrot or Dave Allens. I think Benny Hill is more fun.
