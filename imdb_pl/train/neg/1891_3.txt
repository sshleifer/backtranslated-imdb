A document about nomadic Persians who make a treacherous journey through the massive mountains to bring their flocks to the grass. Watching this quiet, black and white function, partially distorted by the Twink-twink-twink Oriental party, which could not be used in the original exhibition, is even boring than it seems. The spectacular scenery is lost on a small black and white screen and there is no complete chance to create any plot line. I loved Nanook of the North and March of the Penguins, but I despised the film, despite the similarity of the subject. Physical difficulties alone are not so interesting.
