During the civil war there were many cases of divided loyalty; of course, many occurred in "Border states", where the North met with the geographical situation in the south. From the border, young father Owen Moore goes to the Union Army. Soon Confederate soldier Henry B. Walthall, separated from the regime, wanders into enemy property, desperately seeking water; finds a stock in which the young daughter of Unionist Gladys Egan is sitting. When the Yankee soldiers track him, Little Gladys innocently helps confederate hiding. Later, when he comes back to kill her father, the kindness of the little girl is remembered. A sweet, small story from the director of D.W. Griffith. Photos from the location and humanity are beautifully displayed. <br /> <br /> **** In border states (6/13/10) D.W. Griffith ~ Henry B. Walthall, Owen Moore, Gladys Egan
