There are some bad movies there. Most of them are rather fun. "Criminally Insane 1" was one of those movies. It was so bad that it was pleasant and looked at it again. "Criminally Insane 2" must be one of the worst films ever made and come from me. That says a lot, because I'm not the type of person who says that everything is the worst. But believe me, it was just terrible, and running only 1 hour is 1 hour too long. <br /> <br /> The film has a rather incoherent plot, but who cares about history when all you want to see is a big fat woman running around killing people because she is not fed. Well, you can not see it in this movie, except for all flashback sequences that come from the first one. The new plot could be really fun if Ethel was sent to a part-time home and murdered everyone, but nothing happens until the last 20 minutes of the movie and you are already falling asleep. <br /> <br /> The work of the camera in this movie is simply awful. It literally reminds me of what I was shooting with my friends when I was 15 years old. Sound quality is something else because you can not understand the word that most characters say. To give an example of how bad it is, go to the subway in New York and try to understand what is being said through the speakers, that's what this movie sounds like. It does not mean that it matters anyway, because the actors are as dry as a dead piece of wood. <br /> <br /> Now I know that saying that this is the worst movie is quite harsh, but words can describe how bad the movie is. If you do not believe me, see for yourself. 1/10
