I think I've seen things like this before: college graduates not realizing that they have a damn good, all the time complaining that their lives are sucked. <br /> <br /> This movie is very derivative of The Big Chill and Reality Bites from what I can do with it: they have practically the same story. <br /> <br /> If something good came out of this hoarse fest, it was music. That was it. <br /> <br /> As for me, I'm not impressed ... but then I did not expect anything less. This film was directed by the same person who directed Batman and Robin; another film that should only be viewed with a blindfold in tow. <br /> <br /> Now the verdict: it is 1 in 10.
