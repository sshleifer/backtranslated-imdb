This movie is just children against the evil genre. Thunderbirds is just a hook that people can see, but they are almost accidental to use. The fact that the action takes place on the island of Tracy is just a catch that attracts the audience. It was interesting what the filmmakers would see about the future of London and how the world suits each other. <br /> <br /> The best part of this movie are some of the Lady Penelope comics that are very funny. They provided a slight relief for those waiting for a TV series replay. <br /> <br /> Having said that it's 90 minutes or more in a "fun" way, so maybe it's just worth watching.
