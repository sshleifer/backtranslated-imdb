I would like Spike Lee to choose a different title for his film. "Summer Of Sam" gives the impression that the film is about the infamous serial killer, David Berkowitz. This is not. It is a rough, earthy portrait of New York street life during the hot summer '77, when Berkowitz terrorized this city. <br /> <br /> The film follows several young fictional characters from the Italian-American neighborhood and their reactions to the Threat of Son of Sam. He is Vinny and his wife Dionna; is Richie and Ruby and several other characters. <br /> <br /> The problem is that these characters are not sympathetic. They are routinely annoying and sometimes unbearable. Lee then talked about their high energy, chaotic life, which is full of anger, desire and general confusion. Between Vinny and his wife are at least two protracted fighting scenes, unnecessary disco dance scenes, innumerable gabfests ... I kept wondering: where is the movie editor? <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, with this mass, the film passes the chance to convey any real sense of fear or fear resulting from the threat of Sam's Son, which is too much in the background. Lee is more effective at showing a different type of threat than the one that comes from neighborhood groups. <br /> <br /> Acting is equally good. This, combined with 1970s disco music, and abundant devotion to costumes and production design, make you feel like you're in an Italian-American neighborhood in New York in 1977. <br /> <br /> The atmospheric authenticity of the film is not enough to balance the chaotic, overblown scenario of life of annoying people.
