I watched this movie because I'm a big fan of River Phoenix and Joaquin Phoenix. I thought I would try their sister, Rain Phoenix. I regret that I checked it. She was embarrassing, and the movie has this strange plot if you want to call it. Sissy was just weird, and Jellybean is just sitting in the toilet, who is sleeping with the old man in the mountains, what's going on? I have never been so dissatisfied in my life. It was just a lot of trash. I can not believe that the actors agreed to do such a loss of film, money, time and space. Let Sissy be "beautiful", she will not get to me. I thought it was all. Those thumbs were just stupid and why do we want her to hitchhike? WHAT IS THE SENSE??? 0 out of 10, it's a pity that the survey does not have 0, does not even deserve 1. I hope Rain is better in other movies, I forgive her for this one performance, I mean I would not do it better with this movie.
