I really liked the film, emotionally, intellectually and visually. It does not contain violence or sex, drugs or special effects and does not need them once, all the time paying attention to visuals, history and intertwined words of wisdom. <br /> <br /> However: 1] some accents in a foreign language made dialogue difficult to hear and understand; [2] it is unnecessary to abuse curses (especially the word F, which is the only reason that this film was rated as R). [3] The movie is balanced with humor and emotions, but the majority of emotions that keep you in the whole movie, except the final resolution of the last minutes, is unpleasant due to the exaggerated long-term dysfunctional response of some characters to a loss that lives too deeply in the depths of bitterness and depression. [4] I do not recommend this movie because of the 5-second narrative in the background, which did not add a bit to the side character to which it refers, nor the movie - it just turned me into a movie and stuck in my brain throughout the movie, then : mother of the German ancestor of the main heroine, watching old movies from World War II, "secretly roots for the Germans". If the Nazis won the war, there would be no "local color" or art. I do not know any Germans today, except for radical skinheads, who think that the world would be a better place if the Nazis won the Second World War.
