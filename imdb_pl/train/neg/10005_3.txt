The second attempt of a New York intellectual in less than 10 years to make a "Swedish" movie - the first was "Carl Carl" Susan Sontag (who was born in Sweden with Swedish actors, no less!) Results? Oscar Wilde said it best, referring to Dickens's "The Old Curiosity Shop": "You must have a stone heart not to laugh out loud because of the death of Little Nell." Almost the same. "Interiors" are full of charming intruders. ("I am afraid of my anger." Looking at the middle distance: "I do not like who I am."). Director's quotes (to use a well-defined term) Bergman are close to a parody. The unbelievably involved family reminds us how brilliant and talented they are to strangulation. ("I used to read your poem. I was in - I do not know - The New Yorker." "Oh, it was an old poem. I made it over.") I do not care much about these people, but I found them quite funny. Much of the dialogue is just like the ridiculous things from the earlier Allen films - it's just that he got his actors to play. Without going into the movie, poor Mary Beth Hurt copies all his theological tones, intonations and neurotic habits, turning her into an embarrassing surrogate (just like Kenneth Branagh in "Celebrity"). <br /> <br /> The basic plot - a dysfunctional family with a quietly dominant mother - seems to be raised more or less from Bergman's "Winter Light", the basic family tricky melodrama with many existential fears. All this takes place in the shop visual / sound tricks: the deafening scratching of a pencil on paper, the powerful surfing that eclipses people walking on the beach. etc., etc. <br /> <br /> Later "serious" Allen films are less embarrassing, but also much less entertaining. I'll take "Interiors." Woody rarely made a more fun movie.
