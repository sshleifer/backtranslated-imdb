I admit that I do not expect much from Roger Corman's film. Generally, I expect a lot of walking and bad scenarios. However, in this case I am pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> Gunslinger is a story of a woman (played by the brave Beverly Garland) who takes over the sheriff's role after brutally murdering her husband. Mrs. Garland is quite a good shot, killing one of the murderers the next day at her husband's funeral. Her first task is to close the local bar that violates the curfew. The owner of the bar tries to buy land in anticipation of buying over (expected) railway line. But Mrs. Garland is a thorn in her plans, and the babysitter hires a man to kill Mrs. Garland. <br /> <br /> Because of Mrs. Garland playing her role in a fair and realistic way, there is absolutely no temptation to go to the jokes "She's the Sheriff" Suzanne Somers. With the exception of a few faux pas (flat doors that open from the inside, jeep tracks and two riders waiting on the screen to make their cue travel around the corner), the film becomes quite good as a fee for the film. However, Corman could not resist a movie with equestrian scenes, as in other films. <br /> <br /> Sterno says The Gunslinger is a horse opera worth your time.
