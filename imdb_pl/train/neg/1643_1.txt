"Bita" is one of the worst films of all time. It is a vile, hateful piece of trash that forced me to stay in the theater more than any other movie from 2000, Maybe outside of "Grinch". This is not what people have called it, an insightful portrait of contemporary relationships. That would be a small movie "High Fidelity". While this film was honest and pleasant, "Bita" is an enemy, cynical, misanthropic kinetic poison. Avoid this, just like many plagues, unless you want to see how "comedy" really can look bad.
