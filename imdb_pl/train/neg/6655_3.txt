The only salvific feature of this long unsuccessful melodrama is the scenery of southern France and the voice of Nana Mascouri singing the theme song. Stephanie Powers is mistaken and betrayed by a false accent. As already mentioned, is she too old to play the 18-year-old and looks too young like grandma with her granddaughter in school age? Lee Remick is good, although it is also timeless in later years. The talented Joanna Lumley is not fully exploited, and her young middle-aged son (Robert Urich) manages to marry her grandmother Stephanie Powers. Stacey Keach's constant arrogance makes you wonder what these women saw in him. You do not know how each viewer could relate to his excessive image? The most reliable performance is given by Ian Richardson, who makes the rest of the cast look like amateur amateurs. It impresses credulity that handsome male suitors in this epic will always be lonely, while they patiently wait for their feelings to finally agree to accept them. Can anyone believe that handsome Robert Urich will remain single for decades, waiting for Stephanie Powers to finally accept his endless marriage proposal? The involvement of World War II between the Wehrmacht and the Marquis is ridiculous. First, the Germans did not occupy part of Provence in France until the late war, it was controlled by the French puppet government of Vichy. We see how the French resistance organizes a daily raid on Mistral's villa to steal sheets, then everyone rests under the bridge, waiting for a truck of Nazi soldiers to surprise and destroy them? If you want to see a well-played mini-series set in a foreign country, do not watch Daughter of Mistral. A much better alternative would be The Thorn Birds.
