Witchy Hildegard Knef imprisoning a group of people in an isolated hotel and taking them one by one in a twisted, disgusting way. I thought I saw it all until one unfortunate man was crucified and then set his head on fire. Hildy is also a good jester: he takes a nagging harpy and sews his lips ... then he hangs her upside down in the chimney just in time for a roaring fire! "Witchery" did not feel good. It made my eyes hurt. I was ready to write this as the worst film ever made by competent people ... until the final. I must admit that I loved the ending. It's about the boy and his toy tape recorder, cornered by Linda Blair, fantastically possessed. The scene only lasts about a minute and the movie ends, but you know the old saying: "If you have a great ending, people will forgive you everything!"
