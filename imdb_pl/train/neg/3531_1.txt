This movie is now my indicator, according to which all other films will be compared ... as in, "was it as stupid as a revolver?" Also yesterday evening I was in the audience at the Toronto International Film Festival, where a room full of more than 2,000 people came out amazing silence, after he was completely stunned by 2-hour nonsense. Jason Stratham would be amazing if only he had a goal. During the first 10 minutes, he put forward a suggestion for Andre 3000 and Big Pussy (about Soprano), which DOES NOT GO WITH ANYTHING! Then there is some shooting, and then Ray Liotta is wearing an embarrassing bikini panties, then there is animation, Ray Lay's naked butt, a lot of shooting, gnashing teeth, the house of art wants to be pretensions and more of Liotta's embarrassing body that caused laughter at every show. No I'm sure if the reaction he was looking for ... was not 5 times. Everyone in this movie thinks they're smarter than the average bear, and Guy Ritchie thinks he's playing the yoga bear. The plot lines could disappear, but appearances were not visible! The only way the movie could have been worse would be the presence of Madonna herself.
