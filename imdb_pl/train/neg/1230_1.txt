Words can not describe how completely stupid this story (and therefore a bad movie)! Basinger, Del Toro ... what did you think ?? There is a shopping center, and its parking space is completely full. Basinger's character buys tea and wrapping paper. <br /> <br /> When it comes out, the whole place is so empty that no one can hear two shots nearby? Although he lives there, when he leaves the bad, he goes to the most distant and forgotten place, instead of the nearest police station or at least a crowded place? COME ON !!! I will not even enter the infamous red toolbox because other people have already done so. Not to mention how he kills the moronic bandits one by one. <br /> <br /> It is so stupid, without the least logic, I can only warn you that it is THE TOTAL waste of time, honestly!
