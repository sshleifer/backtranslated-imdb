This movie is the biggest loss of nine dollars I spent in a very, very long time. If you knew how often I went to the movies you would probably say, it's hard to imagine, but no less, that's true! After watching the trailer of this movie, I knew that I had to see it! If you're a fan of horror, mystery and tension, why should not you do it? The trailer is no less intriguing and exciting; Unfortunately, the film is not one of them. <br /> <br /> From the movie, through the script, to acting, this movie is a complete flop. If you read this, you plan to go to the movie expecting a thrill, mystery, action, horror or something other than wasting an hour and forty-five minutes. I'm afraid you're disappointed. <br /> "Why is it so bad?", You may ask yourself. Let me say. The film was neither mysterious nor full of tension. Nothing in the film has made me a bit "on the edge", scared or curious. The script was fun at best. In the film there were many times that the dialogue was so absurd that I started writing it as a comic relief, to find out after a few seconds that it is not. Acting was absolutely terrible. I like Nicholas Cage, but it was a miss. Without exception, every performance in this film was unbelievably below average. The photos were terrible with one moment of uncertainty and mystery. Finally, the story is completely transparent. You can see the end of this movie, which is about a mile away. <br /> <br /> I'm usually not too strict a critic. Honestly, when I go to see a comedy, I want to laugh, and when I go see the mystery / suspens / horror, I just want to be surprised. This movie was boring, badly made, badly written and overwhelming disappointment. Do yourself a favor and go see something else.
