As far as I understand, TIW WATCHER is the first work of a young director. I have doubts whether this is the work of an ordinary guy who just loves movies or whether it's a student of cinema, because in the end points there is a reference to Oporto School of Arts. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, director Ricardo Pinho shows this film with a complete unconsciousness of the basic concepts of cinema. What is a movie? How to tell a story? It does not matter to the novice director. One of the first things you learn at school when you study cinema is how to tell a story. You learn that, like in novels, you should also construct your story in three films: introduction, development and conclusions. You learn that your story should have a hero and antagonist, and that there should be a climax. You will learn that this is important for a 3-hour epic, for an ordinary movie, for a short movie, or even, believe it or not, for a 30-second ad. You will also learn that subtle levels can be used in the approach to the academic structure, and eventually you can even deconstruct it. <br /> <br /> Approximately, TIM WATCHER presents us with his main character, and then the film ends - the whole movie sounds like introducing heroes to Jerzy Jerzy. There is no second or third act in TIM WATCHER. This is not a parody or an artistic film, so you can not even try to justify disrespect for the academic structure. You are expected to tell a story and it will not happen. The worst part is that TIM WATCHER is defined as a warning; and one without a real purpose. It does not make sense, at least it is not important. His point is childish, with a sense of revenge. The presented situations are completely simple and their approach is Manichean. <br /> <br /> I was expecting a lot more from this short one. The film starts with a pretty nice sequence of subtitles and you quickly realize that you are watching something about better production values ​​than a regular Portuguese short film. I do not know the budget for this film, but judging by the letter of thanks in the endpoints, the merit must be passed to the production team for such good contacts in a country where it is difficult to open the door for young filmmakers. > <br /> TIM WATCHER seems to be an exercise in style, color and carefully selected plans, combined with a good result. That's all. There is nothing else. There is no story. It is a pity, because it is a waste of production values. You can barely see in the usual Portuguese short such a variety of locations and so many extras available to enrich the story. <br /> <br /> As absurd as it may seem, I must recommend BMW shorts as a good example of how you can tell a good story in a very short film, conditioned by product placement and cinema style.
