If I could, I would give him a negative assessment. I went to this movie without expecting much, but I had an open mind. The whole thing is stupid! Snakes are obviously false, and the first two things that bite are boob and Johnson. Oh, how original; If I was a twelve-year-old boy, I could laugh at it. I have no idea how this movie has become so popular. Seriously, the worst thing I've ever seen. I was not funny, it was not funny, I was not even bored! I was nothing. It was not so bad that it was good, just bad. Funny. Do not waste your money on this movie. Do not even borrow this movie. He has no idea how to get such a high rating.
