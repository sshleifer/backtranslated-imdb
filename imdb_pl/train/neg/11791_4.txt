I do not understand this. Of course, the film has a pretty good budget. He has very good photos. It has a nice pace, good editing and pretty good management. In that case, WHY OH, why did not they hire someone to finally rewrite the script so that he would not be so damn shoddy and WHY OH Why did they hire such bad actors who can not get out of the paper bag? This movie could have been good. At best, it looks good and feels good, but in the end you realize that the movie was not good at all. <br /> <br /> So I would say it's a good production, but a bad movie. Detriment. <br /> <br /> And eels? Come, really!
