Lame, a cliched superhero drivel action movie. I had high hopes for this film, and the HK copter genre is one I do not despise, but I rarely see a story as banal and funny as this one. It would be forgivable, as it always happens in this kind of films, when the action compensates, unfortunately, no. The action carries with it the surrealistic character and superior nature of the HK action, but it is not too addictive, obscenely bloody, and actually often completely incoherent (perhaps due to a re-edition for the American edition, it shows a lot of patchwork space). I was very disappointed.
