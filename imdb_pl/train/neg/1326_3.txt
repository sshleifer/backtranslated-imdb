Mindless dribbling about the second coming of Christ in the form of a hippie and an albino looking like Sandra Locke. You have no idea what's happening on the screen with the annoying themed song "Suzanne" played over and over in the whole movie, until "Second coming Suzanne" ends, you know it hard, no matter how hard you try to forget the whole this case. <br /> <br /> This off-the-wall movie producer, Logan, Jared Martin, intends to make a movie of the century, but he is so rude and nasty that nobody in the banking world wants to finance his project. When planning his own Logan, he meets the couple in a seaside cafe and is fascinated by the young woman Suzanne, Sandra Locke, who reminds him of someone he knew in another life: Jesus Christ. <br /> <br /> With Logan's assistant and Clavius ​​gofer, Richard Dreyfuss, somehow getting a loan of $ 740,000 from the bank to finance Logan's masterpiece, he starts working on Suzanne, flattering her talent as actresses to get interested her movie. This leads to the fact that Suzanne not only leaves his boyfriend, the artist Simon, Paul Sand, but later Simon is so depressed and feels completely alone, takes the gun to his mouth and blasts his brain. <br /> <br /> The film also has two somewhat unrelated threads that concern a young Dorothy autistic girl, Kari Avalos, who cured herself from Suzanne after all the others in the psychiatric hospital to which she pledged , she failed. You really do not know what Suzanne did in the hospital, but there seemed to be some Ordinarian or volunteer there; Was it to show us in the audience that she, like Jesus, could miraculously heal the sick? <br /> <br /> There is also a newspaper writer and business mogul, Jackson Sinclair, Gene Barry, who seems to be either going through a very difficult midlife crisis or seeing a biblical vision that changed his life forever. Sinclair was looking for the meaning of life and what the whole film was all about, and he wanted to know why it was suffering all over the world, like the movie he was in, and apparently he found the answer when he first put his eyes on Suzanne. Sinclair also made sense when his private chauffeur David, Mark Rasmusser, who fell ill and tired of his strange and crazy hallucinations, almost led him out of the Kamikaze cliff, like riding along the Pacific coast. <br /> <br /> The film "The Second Coming of Suzanne" has many unconnected sequences, probably in order to fill or pad at some point by its director and editor, and then proceeds to the final scene in a Christlike crucifixion hill, on Logan has all the cameras. It turns out that crazy Logan has so much carried away his masterpiece, trying to recreate the actual crucifixion of Jesus Christ over a helpless and bound Suzanne some 2,000 years ago. <br /> <br /> It's hard to sit down and it's almost impossible to follow "Suzanne's Second Coming" that makes you give in to the torture that Logan and the filmmakers submit to Suzanne. The film tries to be artistic, but it's just an excuse to hide your mindless and non-existent plot, and even worse - the terrible and amateur acting of everyone.
