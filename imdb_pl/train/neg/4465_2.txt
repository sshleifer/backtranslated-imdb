After the overrated success of Amenabar and Balaguero, Spanish horrors have spread like a disease in the increasingly sad world of horror films. The result is like in movies such as El segundo nombre, television production of evil written, but it worked and managed even worse. I have not read Ramsey Campbell's book, but I'm sure the author of The Doll Who Ate Its Mother had little to do with this horrible production. Avoid it at all costs, unless you're looking for a quiet, sleepy night in the fresh cinema. 2/10
