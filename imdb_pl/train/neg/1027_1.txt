I usually have much better things to do in my time than writing a review, but I was so disappointed with the movie that I spent an hour registering in IMDb just to take the chest off. a movie with names like Morgan Freeman or Kevin Spacey would be a bank bet ... well, this movie was just awful. It is impossible to "suspend disbelief"; I really wanted to enjoy it, but Justin Timberlake just did not let me. <br /> <br /> Timberlake should stick to the music, what a horrible performance - NO presence as an actor, NOT a character. You can not blame everything on Justin: the film can also boast a terrifying plot and a badly planned edition; it's definitely "F". <br /> <br /> After watching this, I have to think about what really motivates the actors. My point is that Morgan certainly read the script before taking part. Did not he see how poor it was? So what could motivate him to take part? Money? Of course, acting is sometimes more related to who you are seen with than with a truly developing quality of work. <br /> <br /> LL Cool J is a great actor; he gets a lot more time in this movie than Freeman or Spacey and really tries to reconcile with a bad script. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, the audience says: "What the hell is going on? made - very disappointing.
