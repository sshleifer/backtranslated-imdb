This movie was not too funny, certainly NOT WHERE so original or as good as A Christmas Story. The heroes (except the youngest) try to imitate the previous actors, and they fail. Hillbilly neighbors appear out of nowhere because they were not part of the first movie. It really sucked, it could have been good with the original cast, and maybe not because the story is so bad. Skip it.
