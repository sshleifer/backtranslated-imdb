I really despised the movie when I saw him around 6 or 7 years old because I was a big fan of Robin Williams and nothing he could do was bad. Additionally. This complete garbage ruined Robin for a long time. Recently I am getting better with his funny but serious part on Father's Day, but then he created another mistake, Bicenntinial Man, I think he was named, but the point is. Robin should already have a lot of better work, and now he has returned to making slime, which was created from this "classic".
