Because some people, like me, like to know EVERYTHING about the movie, even if they plan to see it, including the ending. Anyway, this is the ending I remember because I could not have been more than eight years old when I saw him for the first time and the only one on TV. But let me tell you that I was certainly scared of the little kid I was, and I thought about it many days later, and it still stands out in my mind, even if some details are a bit vague. Abe Vigoda was in this movie? I do not remember this! I did not even remember that the huge Barnabus was in this movie, and I loved Dark Shadows. In the end, the main character (Belinda Montgomery?) Is lured by the judge (Joseph Cotton, I'm guessing, though I remember it because he was an old family doctor or something other than a judge, see how memory disappears?) To the wedding venue, which I remember is he in a cave? Maybe I have it wrong; and Shelley Winters laughs and the Judge is wearing a cape, and the angle of the camera is like looking at him, and he throws away the coat, and he has the goat's legs, and he announces that she is actually her father, the Devil, and played in their hands (a devilish cult), because the "deadly" guy she fell in love with (probably Robert Foxworth) turns out to be the guy with whom Satan wants to marry her, The Demon with yellow eyes and yes, of course, show Robert Foxworth, and his eyes shine yellow. In the last minutes of the movie there are many close-ups. Everyone laughs and rejoices, except Belinda Montgomery, who is very unhappy, and cries or screams, or something, and that's it. The bad guys win.
