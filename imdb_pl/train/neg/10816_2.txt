Oh, just what I needed, another movie about nineteenth-century England. It is almost like an ordinary England, only no one destroys football stadiums. In this picturesque scenery of lords, ladies and other randomly selected titles, Charlotte Gainsbourg goes aimlessly as Jane Eyre, from a novel that no one has ever read willingly. in a Mr.Rochester cot, where he tries to teach a French girl to look at the empty blackboard all the time. One day Mr.Rochester (William Hurt on the autopilot) comes back to fall in love with Jane and all of this, but it's still a matter of his wife with fruit that's locked in the attic. No, it was not in the brochure. After some people are thrown around and some people cautiously spread the fire (they probably hired a set), the movie finally ends. Everything looked really authentic, it's probably something. But then again, no.
