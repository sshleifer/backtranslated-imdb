Some argue that Steve Irwin's larikin antics and herd personality are just an act. Watch this video: it's obvious that it can not work. <br /> <br /> Steve Irwin, dangerman's star on the small screen in his * Crocodile Hunter *, * Croc Files * and the title * Crocodile Hunter series * (see here the naming trend, or is it just me?), rocket his larger size personality on the big screen with the help of * Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course * (yes, there is a specific trend of words beginning with 'C') - basically the episode * Crocodile Hunter * connected to B-Movie. <br /> <br /> During the mission of transferring the big croc to save him from being shot by an eccentric farmer (Magda Szubanski), Steve and wife Terri are not aware that American spies are following croc (Lachy Hulme and Kenneth Ransom) to recover the spy satellite signal that he swallowed. Would it hurt my credibility to say, "They are on a collision course with crazy"? (what a credibility? - Ed.) <br /> <br /> The plot is irrelevant because Steve's animal magnetism drives the film. If you think that his personality is trying, the movie is a failure, but if you're a fan of him (as a businessman, activist for nature conservation or just an ordinary asshole) or his TV shows, expect more of the same on a wide screen budget. <br /> <br /> John Stainton, a faithful servant, the best partner and helper of Crocodile Hunter * (can you call it a simple face?), writes and directs the same provincial rebellion that made Steve a home-made clown for wild animals. <br /> <br /> The most disturbing aspect of this movie is that Steve (one of the few people for whom you can hear an exclamation during his speech) and Terri (Steve's spouse for 10 years, the strongest ally and closest friend) treat this like one of their documentaries, breaking the "fourth wall" and talking directly to the camera, while all other characters behave as if they were in a bad movie (right ??). Would not it be so absurd if Steve and Terri were separated from the rest of the character? but when Bad Americans are constantly threatening Steve's life, we, Confused Viewers, have to ask ourselves why an indifferent camera crew will not call the police, if they do not try to poke the bad guys in the eyes using boom microphones, or run screaming bush ?? whatever, but continue filming casually with perfect lighting, clear sound and seven angles of action. <br /> <br /> While Terri is unjustly painted as a gently incompetent Steve's midfielder (her acting consists of boldly inept lines and talking in pear-butt-tipped jeans - in the end, I do not complain), Steve talks about your business show-and-tell with beings who intend to kill him by doing all their tricks, because for him they are not really acrobatics, just Day At The Office. <br /> <br /> Of course, watching the adventures of this madman's cot after his tragic death in September 2006, he throws a strange distance to the proceedings. But for those of us who have never met him, this kind of malarkey (as well as the various incarnations of the * Crocodile Hunter series * in constant repetitions) keeps him alive as in our crocodile burrows. The shocking reality of his absence will be visible only to his relatives. And I really wish them all the best in following his big footsteps? <br /> <br /> So enjoy this entertainment for what it is? half-baked movie with a full legend. He died doing what he loved? interacting with wildlife - and he could never ask for his first feature film more, showing it this way. <br /> <br /> (Movie buffs, visit: poffysmoviemania.com)
