I must say that once I was a big fan of the series. The first three were great and others had their moments, but this new BETA HOUSE is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's a pity because it was a great series and it keeps getting worse. I know that they are made for DVD movies, but a little effort would be nice. <br /> <br /> There is no laughter, only a few good one-liners that will bring a smile if so. There are quite naked and very hot chicks. But neither sexy things nor jokes really work. <br /> <br /> Add to it all, it's also a RACIST or racist movie that you can do without asking you to call yourself a racist. I am not one of those people who think that everything should be politically correct. But presenting minorities is very offensive. <br /> <br /> I would not waste my time on this trash. See previous versions that will make you laugh not sick.
