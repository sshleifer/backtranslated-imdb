What did I see? I spent 90 minutes of my precious life watching one of the stupidest films I've ever seen. The concept of serial killer clown is actually pretty scary, because there are many people who are afraid of clowns ... but having 300 pounds of kindergarten, reciting the clown's killer, mockery of the genre. I'm still wondering how Mark was not able to run away from Clown ... he's got 300 pounds, he must finally get tired. The whole ending made me stand up and say out loud, "What did I just watch?" Apparently Brandon is a cousin of Denise ... and they did it almost halfway through the movie, which means he had sex with his cousin ... yes it is something that people want, so look * trembles *. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I found funny stupid was the opening scene, in which the clown stabs a woman and says: "What did you do?" Well, what do you think he just did? The last thing that was stupidly funny was the second when the main character hit the hitchhiker and called her ac * nt, then 5 minutes later saying that violence does not help ... did the script author give the line to the wrong guy? Anyway, none of these films makes sense. <br /> <br /> The movie was more or less stupid, low-cost porn that pulled me into buying (all 3.99) and I did not get any entertainment outside the sex scenes. I am surprised that a fat clown has not joined the orgy, he would have liked it. I was hoping that the movie would have some entertainment value, like other B films, but I was wrong. It's a moronic piece of trash that is not even worth seeing. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10
