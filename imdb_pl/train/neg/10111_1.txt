Horrible acting, Bad story line, bad makeup, and this is just the tip of the iceberg. I've never seen a worse movie in my life, 5 minutes I decided to speed up to see if something happens ... No. (Apart from a nice picture from the breast) The film apparently was filmed in some furniture store, and the same magazine was used for at least 90% of the sets. You see even the same red chair in several different "locations" If you intend to make a movie at least rent an office building and flat, not some warehouse that will reflect your actor's entire dialogue .. (Note for producers) Renting a small office space and flat per month they are much cheaper than the entire warehouse, and both are a bit more comprehensive and reliable). If you spend the money to hire these people, I hope you have received them with a refund guarantee ... I will demand a refund ... I spent only 2.99 USD today for rent and I feel cheated.
