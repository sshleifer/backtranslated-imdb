I came to this movie really wanting to put it together. I thought that the premise has a lot of potential and was ready for an interesting movie. Do not get me wrong here, I did not expect Citizen Kane, I was taking it for B, which is it. Having said that, it still did not live up to expectations. The historical aspect of the story is transparent, and the ending has frozen me a bit. Acting in the film was very wooden. To sum up, I give him 4 for a great idea, but the movie could have scored a lot more with a bit more attention to the basics of making movies. Is it worth seeing? I did not want two hours back, but I do not know if I would recommend it to others.
