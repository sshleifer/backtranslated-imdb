My dear Lord, what a movie! Let's talk about "special effects" first. Do not get me wrong here, I'm not one of those effect fanatics, but I really thought the imposition was a long-lost practice, mainly the 1960s. So for some time I thought that they could record this movie a long time ago and it took them forever to cut it out and spend it. But as far as I know, they did not have mobile phones in the 1960s ... <br /> <br /> What I'm looking for in films is, above all, a good story with really good news. The operation is secondary, the effects are secondary, I do not even mind a few small inconsistencies. However, in movies such as bad acting, unbelievable etc. They add up to make the bad movie even worse - that's what happened to me with Celestine Prophecy. <br /> <br /> My wife said that the book is really good, and although I am not all spiritual, I can somehow convince myself that it can be conveyed in a reliable way - the film did not do it. <br /> <br /> There may be one reason to watch this one. If you really love bad movies, it will be the right movie for you. If the IMDb stars were for cheesiness instead of quality, I MUST rate the film ten stars. <br /> <br /> By the way, three stars are for worse movies like "Critical Mass" (look at comments on this topic - fun). Celestine Prophecy is at least somewhat funny.
