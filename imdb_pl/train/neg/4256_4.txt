The Ascension is actually a step forward in terms of what the original film in the story and special effects was. Jason Scott Lee He's good as a vampire hunter looking for the count himself (if you remember him, he came from the movie Dragon, The Bruce Lee Story). far away from Dracula's body stealing from the plate. Diane Neal is good as a woman who steals Dracula's body to find a cure for a dying boy, and Stephen Billington is as great as Dracula himself. Providing better performance than Gerard Butler made the number in the original movie. Roy Scheider complements the rest of the cast in this film and performs a decent job as a mentor to the character of Jason Scott Lee. This is the second continuation of the trilogy that begins well. It is in the air whether the last film will close the series to a good note.
