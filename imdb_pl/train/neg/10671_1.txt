MST 3000 should do this movie. It's the worst movie I've ever seen. First of all, you discover that the shooter has no bank account or history since leaving the army in 1993 and he pays the rent in cash. There is no way in hell for such a person to be so close to the president, not to mention high-level work. In addition, the head of POTHUS protection would not be so emotional that he would start to drink in the haze if the president was shot. This movie sucked. I can not express the extreme that this movie was. Each actor was terrible. Even a cane in a trailer park. I'm wasting my litter. What a waste of time.
