I received the TRAN SCAN from the library and brought it home. We considered going east and thought it would give us a sense of how it is. The film was a total waste of time. If I bought it, I would call it TRAN SCAM when I saw it cost $ 49. <br /> <br /> The DVD lasted 8 minutes and showed a rollercoaster ride all over Canada with my stomach feeling bad when they came up and down, and they were filming at high speed. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of material that they probably shot on this movie and you'd think they could have made a better product. If I wanted to do this project, I would like to give more footage, refrain from road signs, let people know where they are and stay in places to see the landscape. To make such a movie, it should be from 60 to 90 minutes. Oh yeah, the case said it was in stereo, the whole movie was a hissing sound from the accelerated sound of a car, he could at least put some music in it. <br/> <br /> If you want a good movie in Canada, watch the Railrodder / National Film Board of Canada with Buster Keaton (one of the last movies he made) in this comic movie Buster Keaton goes to the rail trackspeeder in Nova Scotia and travels to British Columbia
