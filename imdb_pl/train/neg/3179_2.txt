I saw this movie by accident in the cinema yesterday. I was hoping for this movie because I really like Spoorloos (The Vanishing) and the book on which it is based. The film starts well because initially it seems to be a nice thriller. Quickly, however, the film becomes a mess with uninteresting threads, characters that have never evolved and anyone from the audience who did not care (like Marjoke) and terrible editing. The film has disappeared into black bits, which are simply too long, a confused chronology that jumps back and forth and many scenes that simply do not add anything to history and can be easily rejected. After reading the story you will be treated as one of the worst endings I have seen for a long time. It should also be mentioned that the film has many explicit sex scenes that you are probably used to if you watch many Dutch films. It's hard to mention good things about this movie. About a third of the audience has already left the theater in the middle of the movie and I did not hear a nice word after the film ended. Avoid this movie at all costs. he really destroyed all the faith I left in the Dutch film industry.
