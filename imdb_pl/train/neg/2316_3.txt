Having read for many years about how great the film is, how he created Ruiz among French critics (especially in the snobbish crowd Cahiers), when I finally watched him about a year ago, I thought it was quite disappointing (but then, probably expectations were sky-high). The intentionally deliberate brain movie (created for the needs of the television, and fortunately only an hour) is narrated in the form of a conversation between the art connoisseur and the narrator from outside the screen when they are thinking about a series of images (which are shown in the style of living images) ) and try to find out if they have some clues about hidden political crime. (The horrible Kate Beckinsale Uncovered movie has a similar argument). Borgesian is a word that I read a lot in reviews about this film, but I would say that almost every Borges story is more interesting than this film.
