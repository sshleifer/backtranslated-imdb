This is a movie that wants to be good but sucks. First of all, what the hell are the punks trying to do with the school? I think that children do not realize the gravity of the situation. Deker's guy tells the girl that he's under his responsibility when he asks why he wants to come back to them, but then he passes a pistol from a wheelchair colleague and wants him to repair the telephone line himself. Where is the responsibility? I understand that poor actors have to pay for food, but why not just give them money that is needed to make a silly movie, or give money to charity. Oh yes, and none of them knows how to aim. A stupid punk guy shoots into the canteen nowhere like crazy. Everyone wants to look professional, but everyone sucks. One more thing that I do not believe is that there is no emergency exit at school, the children are trying a few doors, but all are closed. What happens if a fire breaks out and the proud bodyguard is dead? An emergency exit at school is not allowed. In any case, there is much more to say, but it would be too long. I spent some life to watch nonsense.
