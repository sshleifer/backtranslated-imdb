This movie was ridiculously bad. A friend rented it from Netflix and told me to watch it. There are so many blunders and fools that you can not even interfere with getting to know the character and story. Or maybe for example ... <br /> <br /> "Vermont Airport" surrounded by palm trees <br /> <br /> A wonderfully appearing Ben shirt during a telephone conversation <br /> <br /> A priest's office of the priest ... with a folding desk on the table <br /> <br /> Behind a very bad movie is a decent story. But even if you watch technical errors, you'll find scary acting and casting. I was the most tickled cast of an extravagant gay actor who played the right-wing religious zealous brother. His opening scene, sitting in his immaculate apartment, stroking his cat, was hilarious. <br /> <br /> Brawo wrarzowi / director / producer / editor / gwiazdce / creator / staffing the dentist / composer (and whatever else I did it in this way) to actually send such a movie. If you have nothing better to do, it can be a fun group movie or even a base to drink, but do not rent it for a powerful story of homophobia and homosexual marriages.
