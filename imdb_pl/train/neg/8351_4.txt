Fairly average even according to the standards of monograms, this secret (remake of The Sphinx) has a bizarre plot that will not develop too much - you will see it after about ten minutes. At the beginning, the two leaders have a nice dialogue, but John Hamilton is hopelessly boring, because the villain (well-manned Lionel Atwill derived from the role) and the frail thread of Warren Hymer is quite annoying. However, it is worth for five minutes to look through the unrivaled Mantana Moreland as Nicodemus, a janitor who gains an advantage over the lawyer during the courtroom's playful appearance. You must give it to Bill "One-Take" Beaudine; he was not a director too much, but he always hit a routine programmer with some stupid vaudeville.
