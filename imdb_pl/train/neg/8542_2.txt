I'm working on a collection of Chilling Classics 50 Movie Pack and THE WITCHES 'MOUNTAIN (El Monte de las brujas) is something like the 17th movie in the set. <br /> <br /> The movie had nothing to do with your focus. The plot was inconsistent. The dialogue seemed to be improvised. Acting was poor. The heroes were unpleasant. <br /> <br /> The best scene is the beginning, with an irritated woman who is forced to burn her seemingly ugly daughter. However, the only combination of this scene with the rest of the movie is the main character Mario, who has the most amazing mustache. But that's all. <br /> <br /> The movie was not effective at any level. The music was too intrusive. The lighting was very dark, so some of the scenes are almost completely black. It is really barely to watch - what more can I say?
