This "movie" must be the biggest pile of C * ^ p pairing I've ever seen <br /> <br />. What more can I say than BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD. Nothing has nothing to write this "movie" and I pray that they NEVER even talk about creating a sequel. If you think about watching this, you should know that the plot is that two people are getting involved in saving the earth. Films like "Men in Black" were torn to pieces and collected together to create "Comedy", but TOTALLY failed. Avoid this movie (save).
