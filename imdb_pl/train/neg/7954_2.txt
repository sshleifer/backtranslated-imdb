OK, this movie was really "special." Carrie Fisher was by far the most talented in the film, although it is said that she had a problem with the coke during the movie. but she said she can not remember much. Well, that's her excuse, but what about everyone else? I can not imagine that everyone had a problem with the coke. Whatever it was was not so bad, I think the plot was fine and had some fun moments. although the part where the guy gets what's been shoved into his head was a bit too violent for my taste. oh I think I was disappointed because Carrie Fisher is so amazing and this movie did not do anything for her.
