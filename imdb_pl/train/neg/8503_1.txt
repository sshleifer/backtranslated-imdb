considering all European studies, you would think that at least you will get some nice photos; but the local color is kept to a minimum. <br /> <br /> Irritation # 1 is Mira Sorvino using a Russian accent to play a Spanish policeman - WTF? History is hopelessly confused. There is an alleged romantic story behind, which is deliberately confused - is she or is not a lesbian? - without any purpose. The cops in the film are the stupidest who have long adorned the serial killer movie. There seems to be some news about the Spanish Civil War in the mid-1930s. But because almost everyone involved in this is dead, there is no sense in it. <br /> <br /> Despite fighting with the bulls of the narrative part (which part - who can say), you never even see a bullfight. Serious Hemingway would hit the director in the nose - my blessings.
