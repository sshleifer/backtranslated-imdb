As one of the few commentators who did not see the first movie, I found this a very disappointing movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a funny, awkward kind of humor, if you can stand the (very) morally dubious premise. However, in important areas he fails to do so. <br /> <br /> There is a thin and nonsense storyline that includes a generous friend Gordon Sinclair who may or may not be involved in a conspiracy to deliver dangerous electronics to Third World countries - perhaps on slow computers ... or maybe not . Ambiguous, long-lasting and ambiguous. The lack of any significant ending is so annoying, and what is present is pompous and completely illogical. The film is half finished. <br /> <br /> It is extremely difficult to suspend disbelief when we see a very attractive teacher (Maria Doyle Kennedy) who can be attracted to the impressive character of Gordon Sinclair, especially when he pushed her away from progress. Funny. He deteriorates later in the film, when he achieves his romantic ambitions, and then throws it all away for certain ideals based on very little evidence of ambiguous value. <br /> <br /> Few movies make me feel cheated, but I felt my time was stolen.
