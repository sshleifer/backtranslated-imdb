What do you like about this movie? <br /> <br /> It's in color! <br /> <br /> He has an impressive underwater photo! <br /> <br /> Has a rhythmic music score in the background that sometimes works well! <br /> <br /> So 3 out of 10! <br /> <br /> Sometimes the music is accelerated! Especially when a shark or villain are to enter! <br /> <br /> Sometimes it is slowed down! As if to convey the audience, it's time for compassion! <br /> <br /> As another dust bite! As if in "Western spagetti" it has this similarity! <br /> <br /> It is not the case that Italians can not produce high quality production! There was a series of TV movies with the headline "Octopus" numbered from 1 to 7, displayed on SBS TV in Australia in the 90s on mafia-type conflicts! And they were perfect! But unfortunately you will not find it here !!! <br /> <br /> I assumed it was around 1960! Unfortunately, it was 20 years obsolete, as evidenced by the funeral scene at the end! <br /> <br /> Then there was a razor-sharp quick shark bite that makes the dust appear in the bluish waters! <br /> <br /> In the midst of it all, whether in a bar fight or watching the latest bloody demolition from the sea by the inexorable hungry shark, the hero's partner looks through his glasses without much interest, he was also bored in his steadfast role in the absence of evidence for the story or character development! <br /> <br /> At least the protagonist points to fleeting anxiety for his ex-wife! <br /> <br /> But of course, even if the music does not awaken our realization, we have an evil voice in the voices of the evil, as if wanting to push us, that soon another dark act will appear! <br /> <br /> And at the end someone thought about the turn! Just when we thought it was completely predictable! But be vigilant, people, because you can find a different phrase! If you watch carefully! To warm your heart more or less! <br /> <br /> Follow the hero's directions and drink a few beers! Make watching "Night of the Sharks" be more enjoyable! <br /> <br /> Then you'll be ready for something like movie "007" to make it easier to return to reality when it's over !!!
