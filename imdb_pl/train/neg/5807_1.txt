Do not even worry about this movie, it's bad when it's judged on its own merits, but compared to the original in 1972 (Which is a classic) it's awful. And by the way, someone commented that the movie from 1972 is bad compared to the book. It's stupid, movies should never be judged on the basis of the books they come from. They are two completely different forms of art (as if it had to be emphasized, but apparently it is so). If you used these criteria for all movies, then "2001" will suck, as will "Forest Gump" and "Silence of the Lambs".
