The thing that really makes me this movie (it's about the movie that makes me physically sick) is that someone actually paid to make it. There is absolutely no purpose for the existence of this movie. It is not terrifying, it does not provoke thinking, it is not fun, it is not good. It's a sleeping pill with cyanide. The DVD case compares it to Blair Witch, Evil Dead and several other decent movies, making the filmmaker's desperation obviously blatant. This is no other film ever made; it's far away, much worse. The claims of "an extremely shocking ending that you will never forget" are the equivalent of one ton of smelly horses. Please, do not waste your time watching this piece of garbage, because it can make you sterile. The man who wrote the movie should be erased from the list of guild members and never be allowed to film again. Because if he thought THAT was a movie worth doing, there probably is not much to offer in the future. Zero stars. Let Grod will have mercy on the soul of anyone who sees it unhappily. I'm going to vomit now.
