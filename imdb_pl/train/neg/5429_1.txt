The movie starts with a cool song. It looks like a thriller, with Arbaaz Khan walking in a suspicious manner, but suddenly we are forced to comedy with routine stupid idiots like GOLMAAL with Tusshar, Sharman, Kunal and Rajpal behaving like adults. Their scenes are quite fun, then boring. He's bored with the sub-thread of killing Tanushree's brother. At the end of the movie, we try to take seriously the villain captivating our heroes, but here it is still stupid. HERA PHERI and wait, there's also a long chase at Payala's house. <br /> <br /> The movie is so boring that it falls asleep. <br /> <br /> The director Priyana is a very bad music (Pritam) is a routine, except the first piosenki <br /> <br /> Cinematography is bad, the movie has a cheap look <br /> <br /> Rajpal Yadav is good in his first scene, where he goes to pay the rent and I was glad that the actor is not loud, and outside like other movies. But no, he becomes his usual annoying most of the time Tusshar should not speak in the movie, his shield delivery is terrible Sharman is a saving grace, he is the only actor who works very well in this movie Kunal Khemmu tries hard in his first comic movie as an adult, but little does Tanushree is angry as usual Arbaaz Khan has less freedom and usually Payal is not an actress Murli Sharma is horrible
