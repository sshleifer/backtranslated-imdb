I could give the film a higher rating before Peter Jackson's trilogy appeared, but seeing them two side by side, there is no comparison. The pace of this movie is hasty, many important scenes from the book have been omitted, and the character development is small. Animation is a strange mix of traditional cartoon drawings and live action scenes that were painted, which distracted me. And the most disappointing in this movie is that it breaks down in the middle of history and has never been completed. There are some good points - battle scenes are exciting to watch, and dialogue follows the book almost to the letter. Follow this if you are in a hurry and you can not spend 10 hours watching the new trilogy. But if you have not read the book, you will probably be confused because this version lacks a lot. 4 out of 10.
