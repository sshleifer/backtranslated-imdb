Although there were funny moments, I thought the movie was pretty bad. The longer it lasted, the worse. When the action entered Monument Valley, I discovered that I am looking at wonderful outcrops more than ever more stupid and unconvincing character interactions. <br /> <br /> Her daughter's character was particularly inconsistent. First, he takes part in the transaction and then discovers the truth and she punishes. Then she came back and then left them again. Then she came back. There is no clear motivation for any of her decisions. There were interesting characters, some interesting scenes and many missing possibilities. I must say that the pictures were much smaller than the sum of their parts. Apparently, people who liked Repo Mana liked this one. Searchers 2.0 do not match Searchers.
