Lame, lame, lame !!! 90-minute festival, which lasts 89 minutes for a long time. A mature setting with the atmosphere and the possibility (abandoned monastery) is wasted by a stinky script filled with awkward, senseless dialogue, which is difficult to be hip-hop. Usually, it's just embarrassing, and the gonzo attempts of horror are falling (a sample of dialogues with this movie: after demonstrating the artillery, quickly approaching the approaching Barbeau hero? She: "no questions?" Hyuck hyuck hyuck). Bad acting, idiotic, homophobic jokes and judging from the effects of the created, it looks like the director has watched "The Evil Dead" too many times. <br /> <br /> I owe my friends a lot of time to hire this turkey and submit it to ninety wasted minutes that they will never come back. What a fool.
