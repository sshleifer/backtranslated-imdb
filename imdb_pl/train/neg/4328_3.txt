Every movie with the title "National Lampoon" is absolutely guaranteed death in London, England, Paris, France, Rome, Italy and everywhere in Germany. It may be an institution in the USA, but in Europe it is practically unknown to a wider audience. "European holidays in Lampoon" will not really fix this situation. The frightening Griswald are simply terrifying. They are not funny. Apparently Mr. Chevy Chase thinks he's funny, because Miss B.di Angelo is laughing at his jokes, but he gets paid for it and does not have to collect Â£ 2.50 for the privilege. The section taking place in England is typical. The same old TV artists, gentlemen Idle, Smith, Coltrane, Miss M. Lippman, twist the same old tired stereotypes, Mr. Chase gets lost in the hotel corridor ... yawns, yawning, yawning .. Bucking - ham Palace, Big Ben ...... I feel cheated that we have never seen bobbies on bicycles two by two ......... rosie red cheeks on a small chil - a drain, do I have to go on? The English are buffoons, the French are malicious and haters of Yank-haters. Germans pompous and puffed up, (do not mention the war, Clark) and Italian lascivious tongs. Have I forgotten something? Any possible "comic" situation is brought to death, Mr. Chase desperately desperate, Miss Di Angelo interjects sweetly, children are embarrassingly evil. The fact that this franchise has lasted so long must bring consolation to those who claim that you never lose money by underestimating public taste.
