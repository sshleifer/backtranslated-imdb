I must say that when I saw the trailer, I was excited. Futuristic soldiers, taking the wrong ass Vampires run by the veterinarian of the species Michael Ironside .... In space. I mean, I did not expect high art, but it looked like a classic B movie. It was without a doubt a TV pilot, reworked some time later for a feature film after it was not picked up. Okay, let me start with a few good movies, the action was right for a movie with a lower budget, and the CGI and locations used were satisfactory. Now the bad Michael Ironside was in this barley, and his performance here ... well, it was bad, but not in a good way. But as I said, he was gone, so I can not blame him. One of the things that was really stupid was the PETA group for the Vampires, "no, I'm not kidding, it's the stupidest, most incredible thing I've seen at the time, and it's taken seriously. This film also commits one of the main sins of the film B, teases the lesbian scene and does not deliver. First of all, what is sinking this movie, nothing happens. Because he was supposed to be a pilot, the script is almost non-existent and does not have a regular ending. Even the main villains only enter at the end. If there is ever a movie that will require Sleaze and Gore, then Vampire Wars. In conclusion, I will say the main crew of the spacecraft, they were all very talented actors and could very well put this mess behind them and move on to bigger and better things. They just had nothing to do here.
