Vic (Richard Dreyfuss) is the head of the mafia who leaves the psychiatric institution, returning to his world of gangsters. How does the director have a cast with Richard Dreyfuss, Ellen Barkin, Jeff Goldblum, Diane Lane (very wonderful), Gabriel Byrne, Gregory Hines, Kyle MacLachlan, Burt Reynolds, Billy Idol and wasting time? This movie is a comedy that is not fun, it has a constellation in the cast. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Prazer em Matar-te!" ("Pleasure in Killing You!") <br /> <br />
