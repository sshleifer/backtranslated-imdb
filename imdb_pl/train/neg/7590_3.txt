Great bodies, great colors and camera work, pretentious dialogue, a banal plot. The name prima donna, Camilla and often appearing title flowers are enough to remind us of the plot similarities from the novel Dumas "La Dame aux Camelias", the movie "Camille" with Garbo and (I think) Robert Taylor, and recently but not only the opera Verdi La Traviata. Beautiful, not very virtuous young ladies, social outcasts for one reason or another, beloved, separated, connected in time to die for tuberculosis in the last scene ... One forgives trivial intrigue and stupid unrealistic dialogues in opera, but why waste Hayak? Don Sutherland, beautiful interpretation of LA in the thirties, earthquake deus ex machina, which conveniently kills another woman, and all the beauty of this average turkey, where there is not even beautiful singing?
