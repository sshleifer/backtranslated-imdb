This is not one of those reviews about weak special effects or technology, or about dates that only dorkiest people can associate with, but rather a review of a story story that most of us are really interested in. <Br /> <br /> The plot is about joining members of the Allied and German navy from World War II and two civilians (hero and heroine) who are pushed to the German U boat and end up in the wild land of dinosaurs. /> <br /> Manipulations are not so bad in film standards and we know from the story that realism will not be high. What kind of films need it are credible and sympathetic characters, as well as the appearance of reason in actions. <br /> <br /> This movie is missing both. In the case of a full-length film, only 6 characters are served at any time, and 3 of them are barely viewed. The hero of McClure is out of "routine" and does not make much sense in any age. <br /> <br /> The woman seems to be looking for the answer to the puzzle about the land of dinosaurs they entered, but the puzzle is not too much of a puzzle and we can worry about it. <br /> <br /> A lot of defeat in the movie, which should have been better, even for your time.
