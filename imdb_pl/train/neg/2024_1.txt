Trying to earn the success of Deal Or No Deal and 1 Versus 100 comes this bad excuse for entertainment - Show Me The Money, in which 12 sexy "dancers" flares in a shiny red whore costume. The player receives the beginning of the phrase, for example "Which team lost ..." with three options: A, B or C, each of which completes the sentence. The player has three chances to answer one of the 3 options. The host - William Shatner, in his unbearable smarmiest - asks the player if he wants to "block the answer", and when the athlete says "yes", he chooses the "dancer" to whom he shouts "Show me the money!". Opens a scroll that has an amount, and if the answer was correct, add that amount to your winnings; if he was wrong, the amount is deducted. (So ​​it is theoretically possible that the player on this bleak defeat will actually end up with Shatner's money.) There is also a "Killer card" and if the player chooses a girl who has this vile scroll, but responded correctly, nothing happens. If he answered badly, the game goes into Sudden Death and has to answer another question. If he misunderstands, he leaves with nothing. <br /> <br /> Before going to the ad, Shatner screams, "let's dance", and Shatner, the player and 12 dancers shakes the booty. At the end of the concert, Shatner asks the ladies for the "last dance" and everyone shakes him even more. <br /> <br /> I give this program up to 6 episodes, when I hope that this pathetic excuse for the game will be shown through the door. (It could have been worse - they could somehow bribe Goodie Jr for the host, although I bet he is a better dancer than "Shat", as they call him now). <br /> <br /> 7/08: Guess what - I was wrong! It lasted only 5 episodes. There is hope for the world.
