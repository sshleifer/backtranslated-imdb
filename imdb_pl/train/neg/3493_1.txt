I rarely write reviews for IMDb.com, but I feel compelled to warn potential viewers that this movie is awful. Just horrible. I like Shaw Bros movies. (I'm not hated.) And I had high expectations for this movie because I found it on many pages of "10 Best Kung Fu / Martial Arts Movies". (I am now convinced that the top 10 lists are all "cut and paste" works). First of all, there is almost no action in the film. Most of the movie is about talking about the story, which is an amazing feat because it's thin at best. And the action itself could have been impressive in 1978. But according to today's standards it is routine. Special warning for Netflix users: The DVD they send is terrible; the picture is frightening and is not even strengthened by 16: 9.
