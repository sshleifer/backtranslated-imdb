What this film can not answer is how bad this war is (and most wars in the US have recently led to only a little oil). <br /> <br /> How many innocent civilian casualties were killed, how many victims were killed and how blatantly stupid the perpetrators are. <br /> <br /> So, let me ask you - if an American soldier kills women and children without an enemy, that's OK, but if the government accidentally kills its own forces with deadly chemicals, killing many civilians as well, is not it? Your logic will fail, gentlemen. <br /> <br /> I will give her 5 for solid performance and 1 for everything else, a total of 3.
