Possible spoilers, Maybe. I must say that "Cinderella II: Dreams Come True" is one of the worst films ever. First of all, the movie was made during Disney's biggest madness. It was created at about the same time as "The Little Mermaid II", "The Jungle Book II" and "Peter Pan II". (Disney also did "The Hunchback of Notre Dame II" and "Atlantis II", but I intend to abandon this subject because their original films have never really been classics.) Let me go ahead and say that I am a strong advocate of good Disney movies and absolutely love the original Disney "Cinderella." The continuation of "Cinderella" was, however, a waste of time, and the figure of Cinderella in the sequel was so different from the original girl, who in the original Cinderella was kind and loving, and the new Cinderella had very unusual moments with phrasing in the present era, like: "I'm going to do this a banquet in my way! "Let me tell you, this new Cinderella (as I call it affectionately), says:" Ewww! "This is anti-Cinderella. I try to find the best in people, but in the sequel of Anastasia, one of the half-sisters, is good! hell, why? It so happened that they were like Lady Tremaine and Drizella, it's just terrible family members for poor little Anasta sia. My question to the world: did people from Disney watch the original "Cinderella" while creating this sequel? Well, it certainly does not look like that. If I remember correctly, Anastasia was as offensive to Cinderella as Drizella and Lady Tremaine. I am for redemption and forgiveness, but in this film there was no sense of redemption for Anastasia. At first, Anastasia was angry. The other is good. You simply can not leave such a story. I hope that Disney will realize that this movie, among other films, shakes the name of Walt Disney. Perhaps now, when Michael Eisner has gone, things will start forming around the Mouse House.
