Kill Me Later "has an interesting initial premise: a suicidal woman (Selma Blair) on the verge of jumping from the top of the office block protects the bank robber (Max Beesley), who promises to" kill her later. "<Br /> <br /> However, the actual implementation of this assumption is not possible, because almost every action serves only as a tool to move the story towards a predictable conclusion. The lack of character depth particularly reduces the performance of Selma Blair, whose character Shawn ranges from the bleak to behave "cool" and eventually become confused dolt. <br /> <br /> Things that are complicating to worse are the pressure of the director Dana Lustig on the use of fast cuts, inappropriate special effects (for example, the search for an unintentional amusing motorcycle chase for infrared at the end), and a hip hop soundtrack in the hope of appealing to the MTV crowd's short attention. Certainly Mrs. Lustig proves that she is able to master the technical side of the direction, but in no way does her ability to overcome the inherent problems of the film and why the film continues to the end, of course, Lu stig has a clear visual style, but it may be better suited for music videos than for feature films. <br /> <br /> Producers (Ram Bergman and Lustig) can be praised for their ability to make this film: they managed to horrify $ 1.5 million to finance the film, ensure a good cast and get domestic and foreign distribution. This is not a small feat for an independent movie. However, taking into account the quality of the product, a mixed bag is created.
