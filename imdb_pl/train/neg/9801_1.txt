I remember that program on television when I was a kid in the early nineties, and it was such a rage for children with stupid kung fu jumpers and plastic dinosaurs. He was called the guardian of power. I remember that small children walk around, hitting each other, and then the shirts and items from the exhibition were banned in many school districts around the country because this show taught the children how to fight each other in solving their differences. <br /> <br /> I never really thought about it as a program, especially when better programs like The Tick played on Fox Kids. Most older teenagers have always looked at commandos in an absurd and contemptuous manner and it is not hard to wonder why. The material is ridiculous at best. Colorful guardian costumes look like the things you're working on, and dinosaurs look like plastic nonsense. Then you go into acting and of course those really funny hairstyles. All the boys run with earrings, half of them are wearing girls of the 90s, and they always wear the same clothes every day, and then they turn into a leotard in power suits. <br /> <br /> The toys are especially funny. and he was a joke of many night talk show hosts. And of course, the two worst films ever made, and I mean the two worst films ever made, were based on this program, almost every critic was destroying both the films and the programs on which he was based. <br /> <br /> Power rangers is nothing but a bad television, especially in the case of bad toy merchandising. As an adult I do not look at it with tenderness, but rather as another embarrassment of shows for children from the 90s, fashion and earrings.
