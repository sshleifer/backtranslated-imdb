Although Bette Davis did a great job as Mildred, I felt that the movie was not the best I saw. At the end of the movie, I felt something missing in it. <br /> <br /> However, Bette Davis did a perfect job and forced me to hate her and take pity on her all the time. Leslie Howard did very well as lovelorn Philip Carey, and I felt so much for him throughout the movie that I was in love with such a terrible bride. It's such a sad thing when someone falls in love with bad sperm. Especially if it's someone like Philp Carey who is a sensitive person, though pathetic. <br /> <br /> After all, acting was what happened, not plot. The final scene was particularly good, but I'm not the one who gives it away. Although others may find this movie good, I was the one who found it. I should recommend this film to those who like bad seeds so that they can see what can happen to them if they find themselves in love with this terrible person.
