Well, they say that nymphomania leaves you unsatisfied. I do not know if Stella James (Sean Young) qualifies as a clinical nymphomaniac, but she is certainly in a sexual relationship with men. She's still researching, trying to find "more data" so she can see what she wants from life and men in her, though it seems that at her age she should have a pretty good idea. (I can not agree with anyone who says Young is too old for this role. If that's the case, we should all get older so nicely.) Most of the time this movie left me cold, although it's not the worst kind of thing you'll see . And unlike the recent "Eyes Wide Closed", at least something is happening in this.
