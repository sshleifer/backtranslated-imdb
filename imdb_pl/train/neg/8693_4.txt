I come from near Dallas / Fort Worth and have lived in Arlington for several years. This movie was so far away that it looked like Arlington. I saw mountains in the background of one scene! Texas has no mountains. It seems to me that this happens when a movie in Texas is filmed in Texas. The accents are very bad. They should have captured actors from Texas who played these parts. There are many aspiring actors from Texas in Hollywood. The film is really sad because it is a real story. I pray that the killer will be found and condemned. The only good thing is that her death is over, we now have Amber Alert to help quickly find missing children after their abduction.
