Avoid the US version. It's with added US material and the worst dubbing you've ever heard, probably made by New York amateurs. Dubbing is so bad it sounds like Mystery Science Theater 3000. I think the black Bronx guy is making Chiba's voice. I could not watch the whole movie, it was so bad. Instead of this Americanized version, take a look at other Chiba characters like The Streetfighter and Karate Warriors.
