This movie has the core of a really good story. The work of men and women of the Coast Guard, especially in the North Pacific, is the work of heroes and legends. This film deals with a good story with three endings (lack of satisfaction), a few unnecessary and pointless fights in bars and two alleged "romantic" relationships that have as many sparks as a dead bonfire. The rescue scenes are great - even if the computer generation is hokey, and the scenarios are quite unreal - but the story is bad and disappointing. Costner is good - especially his hand (watch out for it). Ashton Kutcher is flat, but not terrible. The main female figures are one-dimensional. The best woman is one of the Coast Guard sailors in the rescue center, and she is in the camera for about two minutes throughout the movie. It could have been a great movie - and Costner needs it!
