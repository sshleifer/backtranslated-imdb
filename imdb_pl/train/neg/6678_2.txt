It is a copy of Doris Day classic from 1948, Romance on the High Seas. <br /> <br /> The plot is more or less the same, but it is contemporary. Govinda plays an acute smart guy who replaces her husband during the trip. While Rani plays a friend of her wife who does the same favor. They are supposedly trying to catch themselves, while the real husband and wife are trying to stumble over each other in Mumbai. <br /> <br /> While traveling, Govinda makes a mistake with another girl for his wife, Sanjiva, and is spied on by the captivating Rani. <br /> <br /> Leverage fulfills the dual role of father and son, both lawyers specializing in divorce proceedings. They are against each other for a fighting couple. <br /> <br /> This is a poor attempt to copy the original classics, and the songs are quite scary. The comedy is a slap-stick and will not make you laugh too much.
