I could not recommend a Christmas movie more than this worthless piece (trust me, double negatives are required - it's so bad). This movie was in trouble because of the opening credits, when it turned out that the screenwriter was the same person as the songwriter. Musical numbers are much too long and none of them are good ("Thank You Very Much" has a decent melody, but the lyrics are stupid except words). I would happily carry the chains worn by Scrooge in the bizarre hellish sequence of the movie, and then sit down again on this insult to the film musicals. <br /> <br /> The only funny part of this movie (by the way completely unintended) is Alec Guinness as Jacob Marley. Dressed in a silly, white costume, Guinness struggles in his scenes, trying to make him look as if he is floating like a ghost, or showing his total contempt for being in this awful movie. Meanwhile, Albert Finney combines the best of Alistar Sim and Charles Laughton to create his hopelessly disgusting character, Quasimodo / Scrooge. Finney's scrooge is so repulsive that you can not believe in his transformation. <br /> <br /> Avoid this abomination of making movies at any price.
