I bought this movie for $ 5 in a container for bargains in my local video store for one reason only, Chase Masterson, but I should have had a five, throw it in the toilet and rinse it off. The film tells about twenty people who reached the summit in high school and united on the anniversary of the death of their idiots who got drunk and went into the forest and died. The problem is that the reptilian monster hunts them one by one. Acting is hopeless, these worthless people were apparently rejected at shows like 90210 and Dawsons Creek. The director was on a par with the twelve-year-old, and the script was probably made by a thirteen-year-old. The whole set looks like someone's backyard in Malibu. People who praised this film are, of course, friends of the director and / or actors. Avoid this pile of garbage at ALL costs.
