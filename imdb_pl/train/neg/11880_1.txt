Office work, especially in the age of computers, multifunctional devices for copying, e-mail, voice mail, cochile mail and "temps", is a mature territory with satirical possibilities. Office space "and very effectively. This latest addition to the temp / humor pool, "Haiku Tunnel" directed by Josh Kornbluth and Jacob Kornbluth, does not meet its predecessors and leaves the laughter behind the door, waiting for the chance to sneak in. Unfortunately, this opportunity never comes for the audience; So what you get is a nice test, but as a man once said, without a cigar. <br /> <br /> As the narrator / movie star, Josh Kornbluth (playing Josh Kornbluth) indicates in the first frames (in a monologue delivered directly to the camera) this story is pure fiction and takes place in the fictional city of "San Franc'l" ISCO ". This is an innovative, if not very cleverly presented, claim, not so much fun. But this is a harbinger of what is to come, all of which - just like disclaimer - are simply not so much fun. <br /> <br /> Kornbluth plays Kornbluth, an aspiring novelist who supports himself in his work as a "temp". It is a work that suits him and gives him time to work on his novel from time to time. But when he goes to work for a lawyer, Bob Shelby (Warren Keith), he does too much work the first day, and Shelby sends Marnelina D'Amore (Helen Shumaker) Kornbluth to Marlinina's secretary to convince him to leave. However, the thought of working full-time for the same company initially arouses fear in Kornbluth's heart, but he collapses and signs on the position. Because of this he is nervous, but at least now other secretaries acknowledge his presence (which of course would never happen with the pace), and if something becomes too rough, he has seventeen important letters he has typed - now only need to be sent by mail - to come back to action (postpones it for later, because sending messages is an easy part, and he needs that "something easy to do" in reserve, in case everything becomes too much for him). These are, however, "important" letters and at the end of the week Kornbluth still has them in reserve, on the desk. And you do not need a genius to know that when Shelby finds out about it, Kornbluth's days as a fair-haired boy will end. And fast. <br /> <br /> The brothers Kornbluth, who not only directed, but also John Bellucci wrote the script for this film, should have taken the Ben Stiller Book of Comedy book with them. `If ​​you play it straight, they will laugh. 'But they did not do it, and the audience did not. Because in a comedy, even looking at it as objectively as possible when the main character (and also most supporting characters, in this case) `Game 'fun - like in, he` knows he is funny - he is never. And that's what Kornbluth is doing here; instead of being "funny", it turns out to be an insincere and pretentious, serious mistake in the assessment of the Kornblutów, because by allowing it, they sabotaged their own film. <br /> <br /> Trying to understand exactly why this movie does not work, it boils down to two main reasons: a director who - if not necessarily "bad" - is at least careless; and second, performances, from the performance of Josh Kornbluth. It's just that Kornbluth seems too impressed to be effective here. Unlike Stiller and even Steve Martin - both of them are really joking with humor - Kornbluth apparently has an ego that just will not let himself in that light; he seems to need his audience to know that he, the real Kornbluth, is actually a lot smarter than Kornbluth's character. And not being able to go beyond what he does, just like a movie. Instead of giving millions of office workers who can see this movie, someone with whom they can relate or whom they can identify with, Kornbluth affects the condescending way that only serves to alienate the same people he tries to reach. It all comes down to the case of poor directing and unconvincing action, and when one considers that the script itself was weak at the beginning, with an inexplicably narrow attitude (considering the potential of rich subject matter), it is easy to understand why it simply does not happen . <br /> <br /> The only advantage of the film is Warren Keith's appearance as Shelby, whose subtle delivery is convincing and which in itself is quite funny. However, the effectiveness of this is reduced because Keith needs to share his scenes with Kornbluth, which will automatically cancel his positive contribution to the project to some extent. <br /> <br /> Shumaker and Sarah Overman (Julie Faustino) are also able to keep their heads above the water thanks to their performances, which are praiseworthy, if not entirely memorable; at least, they make their scenes are watched, and Overman even manages to raise Kornbluth's performance, if only for a moment. But it is still not enough to save a day or a movie. <br /> <br /> Supporting cast is Amy Resnick (Mindy), Brian Thorstenson (Clifford), June Lomena (DaVonne), Joe Bellan (Jimmy the Mail Clerk), with an episode by disheveled Harry Shearer, like Leader of Orientation - a role that begs for the answer to the question: "What did he think when he agreed?" In every work environment there will always be situations that in one way or another will become a feed for someone's comedic act, and films presenting these situations will always be with us; good (see first paragraph) can become classics in themselves. `Haiku Tunnel ', but it will certainly remain among them for a very long time, because its destiny lies somewhere else - in a sphere known only as:' Darkness'. I rate this 1/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
