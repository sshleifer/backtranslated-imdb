I almost fooled myself when I was going to start this review, saying, "This movie reminded me of BILLY ELLIOT," but then I checked the biography of writer Lee Hall just to find out that he was the guy who wrote BILLY ELLIOT so it's Mr. Hall doing a fool z siebie, nie ja <br /> <br /> Am I cruel to him? No, because Lee has something that most aspiring screenwriters in Britain do not have - he has a foot in the door, he previously wrote a successful British movie that won prizes and earned money at the box office and what's next? Give the audience more of the same <br /> <br /> Young Jimmy Spud lives in some sink kitchen. He is persecuted at school and no one loves him. The only thing that sustains him is the desire to be a ballet dancer. In fact, he does not aspire to become an angel, but considering his home, he may well be a ballet dancer. Ma macho of the father's leader who thinks: "Ballet dancers are a poof band, while his grandfather says:" Ballet dancers are as hard as any man you can meet. I remember seeing Bolshoi's ballet ... "Yup ballet is the main point of discussion about the neglected British estate at that time - NO. Think about it, or about left-wing politics that seems to be the exclusive domain of the middle class. benefactors who live in nice big houses, so everything about this setting seems absurdly false at the same time. <br /> <br /> Another serious criticism is that it is a film that has no idea who it refers to. he criticized Channel 4 for broadcasting films in completely inappropriate times (for example THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT at 6 am), but they showed it at 2 am and for now they got it in place. Consideration of history concerns politics, ballet dancing (Gawd I hate this) cancer lung and poverty can not be considered suitable for family audiences, but because the main character is an 11-year-old child and has angels and ballet dancers (do not blame me if I'm obsessed with this topic - there was no need to target them) here too much for an intelligent adult audience. <br /> <br /> Of course, if Lee Hall was informed by producers at the writing stage that he should write a story with a student and an angel and he firmly refused to say that he wants to write about other topics and I will apologize, but throughout the film you get the impression that after the film is finished it will be sold to exactly the same audience that BILLY ELLIOT liked
