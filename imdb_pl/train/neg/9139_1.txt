I do not know what's going on with this movie director Sam Mraovich, who somehow got mixed up with almost every aspect of the movie. Normally, I would say that it is a movie that should not exist, but this movie may be the most important in history. This film should only exist for the purpose of "The Worst Film Ever". I've seen bad movies in my life, but it somehow breaks what I thought was bad, something much harder to imagine. <br /> <br /> Everything in this movie is fun, but the funniest thing is that Mraovich himself considers it a great movie. <br /> <br /> Oh wow ...
