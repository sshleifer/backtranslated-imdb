It looked good on paper, Nick Cage and Jerry Buckheimer collaborate again, this time on a mix of heist, Da Vinci Code, American History 101 and Indiana Jones. But oh my, this is Indiana Jones, Speed ​​2 is Speed. A reasonable cast (including John Voight and Harvey Keitel) fights against the childish script and loses badly. The film is nothing more than an expanded Freemasons ad. However, these freemasons are not ordinary shopkeepers who use funny handshakes and play golf, these freemasons are natural descendants of the Knights Templar (and no one mentions "From Hell" or Jack Ripper.) I do not think I reveal any plot, because they're not here. There is virtually no tension, no surprises or culminations - it just stops. The national treasury is aimed at Dan Brown, but hits the same intellectual level as the Scooby Doo sans humor episode.
