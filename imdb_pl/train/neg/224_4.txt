The worst thing about Crush is that it did not work well, or that the plot is virtually non-existent, and it's not even bad that the camera could be better. <br /> <br /> No, the worst part of the movie is that it has some absolutely brilliant moments that make you hope there will be more. <br /> <br /> But in the end it is not enough, too late. If you're a fan of violin music and cheap tearing scenes at the age of 40+ women crying and cuddling and talking about babies and marriage - then do not miss it. <br /> <br /> I am not exactly delighted to see the things mentioned above in the film, and as a result I had quite a terrible time. A few absolutely genius jokes can not compensate the rest. <br /> <br /> Verdict: 4/10. Guilty of wasting time. <br /> <br />
