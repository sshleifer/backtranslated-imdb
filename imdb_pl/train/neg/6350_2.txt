I've seen my part in Woody Allen's films and although they are not always great, you can usually be sure that you will have fun. Probably the last really good were Bullets Over Broadway ('94) and Mighty Aphrodite ('95) - since then, the ones I've seen were inconsistent, but you can watch them. So when I was invited to watch the new film by Woody Allen Melind and Melind, about which I did not even know he was released, I went happily. I really did not hear much about it, so I was hoping that I would be pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> What I got was by far the worst Woody Allen movie I saw. The premise is over-explained, the cast is terrible, the scenario is slow and lifeless. Too many scenes have not said anything, and yet they have been stretched, I assume that I will fulfill what would otherwise be a 15-minute short film. <br /> <br /> I do not mind the concept of this film - two directors discuss how a simple situation can be interpreted as a comedy or tragedy, and of course the film shows us this by playing both scenarios. The problem is not one of these two "movies". Comedy is not fun, and the tragedy is not too tragic. It looks like Allen came up with a good idea, but then he ran out of steam or time to finish the film properly. <br /> <br /> The overall level of acting is particularly bad - Will Ferrell is the only one who brings something to the table, which is basically the impression of Woody Allen. Previously, good actors such as Chloe Sevigny just got angry and the worst of them is Radha Mitchell as Melinda (which is a shame because her character is in almost every scene!). <br /> <br /> To be honest with the actors, the script they work with, is missing if it does not exist. Definitely far from Allen, who we know and love from classics such as Manhattan or Annie Hall.
