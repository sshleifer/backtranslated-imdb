I should warn everyone that the movie should not be watched. The unique tribute fails in such a wonderful way that it is almost an insult to the memory of these brave people. The special effect was horrible, I did not expect that the total failure of the director would appreciate military technology. How is a machine gun that normally fires at 600 rounds per minute at 1/10 speed? How can soldiers fall forward when a grenade explodes in front of them? How can people survive when there are artillery shells falling from a distance of 20 feet? How is it that artillery shells only fall on both sides of the road, not on the road itself? <br /> <br /> Not only this lack of respect for the weapon was frightening to me, but the situations related to the clash and the inconsistency of the dialogues made me shout about the murder. There were standard dialogues such as Ye bhi kisi ka bhai hai, ise laath mat maro and Pakistan se jyaada musalmaan to Hindustaan ​​me hai and LOC cross mat karo ye mera hukum hai. Silly at least. <br /> <br /> What Shobha De wrote is true. The director worked without a script and it shows. There is no flow to the movie. There is no gradual transition from one battle to another. This is just one shooter after another without any connection to the general scheme of the war. The explanatory scenes are awful. The head of military personnel looks unconvincing. What's worse, people from the theater had an imperceptibly cut out material to match a four-hour movie to three hours.
