There are no spoilers in this review. There is nothing to corrupt. <br /> <br /> No plot, nothing; most of the clip shows are at least trying to tie clips to the story for some frail episode, but it has not even done it. Clips, three lines leading to the next endless sequence of boring clips ... OK, so maybe they were too short at the time of production, but it would be better to skip this episode completely. What a waste of time. <br /> <br /> I do not know how it happened. Scrubs is usually much better in challenging tracks, but somehow it survived .... <br /> <br /> Thanks to the heavens they returned to form for the next episode.
