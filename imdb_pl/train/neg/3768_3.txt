That's right. Film written, directed and produced by Fred Tepper and his family. (Fred should have known better, working on the "Titantic" and "Dogma" sets.) <br /> <br /> So the storyline. There are several scientists, a few foresters and a hot chick with huge fake breasts. Everyone is really angry at their work, including a hot rod (which I think is supposed to be a photographer, but who cares because he wears a bikini). One of the rangers comments that scientists are "professionals", which is good, because it would be horrible if they were professional grubs or jellies or Ewoks. <br /> <br /> They roam the forest looking for some strange monkey bones, and nobody even mentions that bones can simply be the infamous Big Foot. They simply wander around and one of the commandos shamelessly hits the hottie. We all hope that he will soon die (along with his sister, who was supposed to be a charming naive, but she is really irritating). Then they * catch their breath *, find Sasqua ... I mean, the place of burial of animals similar to monkeys. Of course, it is not mentioned that they can be the Bigfoot bones they are struggling with ... I think scientists and foresters simply do not think about these kinds of things. <br /> <br /> Then Sasquatch and his tribe get angry and kill all the people you do not like, chase other losers and bury your Great Aunt Muriel and Cousin Josh (who died in an unfortunate trout accident). <br /> <br /> Boring, boring dialogue (I lost a few times), awkward plot, unlikely characters, bad CGI (a man in a monkey suit would look better), and acting, which was not very good, all together creates a movie, which I do not watch again. <br /> <br /> However, you check it; this is good for unintentional laughter.
