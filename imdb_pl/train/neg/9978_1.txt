My girlfriend and I were stunned by how bad the movie was. After 15 minutes, we would call him if we were not too curious if the movie could be bought back. No. <br /> <br /> I do not understand the praise given to this film. Writing was horrible and caused by some of the worst acts I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> One thing that particularly annoyed me in this movie was that people often talked to each other was an unnatural gap between the lines. I understand using a pause to create a feeling of awkwardness (as in the case of Happiness). It was not such a break - it's just bad targeting. This film can actually be much better for subtitles, or maybe the foreign market is the best for this movie, because then the internal dialogue and bad acting will not be noticed so much. <br /> <br /> Generally I like this kind of small, bizarre movies (Real blonde, Walking and talking, Charming and Amazing), but this movie failed on so many levels that I consider it one of the worst movies I've ever played over the last years.
