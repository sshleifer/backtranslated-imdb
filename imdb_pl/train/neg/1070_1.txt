I've seen a few bad movies (Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me, Batman Forever), but this movie is so horrible, so BORING that I managed to get halfway and I could not stand watching the rest. Detriment. Boasting talent like Kenneth Branagh, Embeth Davitz and Robert Duvall, and the story of John Grisham, what went wrong? Branagh is a lawyer who occasionally throws himself with Davitz. Her father (Duvall) is a psychopath who hanged his cat, etc. Etc., So Branagh sent him to the nuthouse and escapes immediately. Somehow (I could not understand how) Robert Downey jr, Daryl Hannah, Famke Janssen and Tom Berenger are mixed into a story that moves more slowly than stationary. I wanted it, and being a big fan of Grisham, I read everything about this film and (stupid) I expected something interesting. This is honestly the worst movie I've seen so far and I would like to be able to get my money back. * except *****.
