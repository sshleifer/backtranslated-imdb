I really did not like this movie at all. It was not really fun, and in some cases it was just stupid. Rob Schneider is definitely one extremely talented person, and although his acting was good at it, it seemed to him that playing in it was a real loss. I mean, there were some elements that were fine and a bit funny in a sweet way, but that's it. The only thing that caught my attention during this hard joke test was that there were very good looking women and I'm not the only one who watches a movie just because of it, but in this case it was the only corner where you can even find the smallest case of redemption. All in all it was a few degrees below the average movie! <br /> <br /> Final query: <br /> <br /> Theaters: I am glad that I have not wasted too much money on this topic. <Br /> <br /> DVD purchase: Ummm, let me think .... no! <br /> <br /> Renting: If you have a prehistoric sense of humor, why not.
