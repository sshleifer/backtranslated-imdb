This is one of those movies you see in the video store you MUST get because it looks so badly bad. And indeed, we could not do it for the most part. There were many rapid upheavals. <br /> <br /> But then we came across a scene in which Robert Englund seduces a female heroine (her name somehow eludes me). Cripes. I have never watched any of the movie scenes so many times (I estimate that it is around forty). And I've never laughed so much in my life. You see, Englund has it to show his loins. I last saw this movie a few months ago, but I can not stop laughing while writing. In any case, the scene is a photo montage - Englund rips off the girl's underwear, Englund rides naked on the horse, and some mysterious woman knocks down the snake's head. He is an absolute genius. You must see it yourself.
