First of all, I would like to say that the users' comments themselves have left me with tears in my eyes with laughter. One comment that bad SF movies are good comedies is right. MST3000 made it last. <br /> <br /> If you look at THE ANGRY RED PLANET as a dream about the fever of a 10-year-old comic book reader from 1959, you'll have the handle of this sucker. All elements are there: pseudoscience, sometimes logical, more comically infantile. Teenage boy geared for sex, with the "gigolo" captain (good for it, guys!) Looking at the rebel "scientist" with hair so red that it is strange that it does not trigger fire alarms. The funny concept of Mars as a planet so alien that everything shines red, but one alien monster has a mouse face, and an alien with spots has an eye revolving like a child's toy. A comical relief, an overweight astronaut (!) Who sounds like he never finished the eighth grade in Brooklyn and has a psychotic fixation on his radius. And of course the very fact that strangers = dangerously angry. If these people met E.T, they would bake him flat in two seconds! "OW" indeed! <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong. I rated this movie as low. Still, it's never boring (except when the scientist tries to explain everything - just to make everything sound more and more ridiculous), and you have to admit that you jump a few times in your child's core. <br /> <br /> Okay, do not admit it. You probably have never been 10.
