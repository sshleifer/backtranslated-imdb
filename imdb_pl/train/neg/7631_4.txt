I am not going to comb through the obvious flaws of the TLPS peterbogdanovichian. Instead, I will look at the positive aspects of this overrated celluloid pygmy film. <br /> <br /> 1. Peter Bogdanovich has managed to make a film that can be lifted in its entirety. This fact alone makes the film high up and up to the height of its lame filmography. <br /> <br /> 2. Bogdanovich showed how surprisingly generous can be happy boys, sharing with the male audience the wonderful body and breasts of Cybill Shepherd (his then gala) - and not just one, but twice. Brava! Undoubted advantages of this cinema festa del siesta. <br /> <br /> 3. TLPS has just a stage without stereotypical country music in the background. (Peter tried to make the obvious point that the film is taking place in the Deep South America (as if it were not obvious), so he stuck this point to infinity ...) How is it an advantage, can you ask? Well, when the film finally ends and the monotonous country music finally stops massaging your weary drums, you start to experience a strange joy: "The movie is finally over!" It's pure joy. <br /> <br /> 4. The movie gives all women who look like the hope of Cloris Leachman. I hope that they too can one day tear out a much younger and maybe even pretty boyfriend. <br /> <br /> 5. Biography Cloris Leachman (which, as I realize, is not part of the TLPS), gives hope to all women who look so that one day they can win the Miss Chicago beauty contest. (Provided they have enough money to bribe a jury.) <br /> <br /> (You think I'm joking about Cloris, winning a beauty contest, right? Well, check out her bio, and then we'll see who laughs ostatni ...) <br /> <br /> 6. The film was shot in black and white, which saved us the view of Cloris Leachman's face in its original, natural, non-glory.
