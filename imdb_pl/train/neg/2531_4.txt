The title song for this movie ........... is the biggest free ballad ever written! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time in 1978-79, when I first subscribed to the cable. In 1979, the cable began to be more and more common in homes. (or at least when it became common here in Missouri). <br /> <br /> This may be the first movie I've ever watched on a paid channel called "The Movie Channel" - which was called "The Star Channel", in the early 80's they changed their name to "The Movie Channel" ... I received a free month of "The Star Channel" thanks to my new cable subscription. "The Van" was one of the films that at that time were heavily rotated in this network. <br /> <br /> I remember watching the movie and thinking that it is a typical teen movie (according to the same rules as other medium-budget youth cinema) ... those where the plot revolves around nudity and events. <br /> <br /> I completely forgot that this movie existed until I saw it again after I did not see it for a decade (I found its copy on DVD in a cheap container) I recognized it and bought it for only 4.99 USD. <br /> <br /> It looks like I remember that this movie is much better (it is). However, watching it in those days was a different experience than watching it now (over 30 years later). <br /> <br /> It was nice to see children exchanging rock n roll music, smoking pots and having sex in the back of a fancy van (often everything at the same time). That's what a good movie for teenagers should look like. <br /> <br /> There is not much story except the fact that the main character fantasizes about sex with his beloved rival, a pretty girl ... he blows all his savings in college to buy a cheated Dodge Van (with shaggy the walls of the rug, the mirrored ceiling and the waterbed) to attract her attention, and he finally has sex with her. But his rival learns and seeks him (so that both could settle the differences, dragging his vans) .... he and his rival archer finish destroying both vans and instead of stealing his friend, rival, wins with the supernatural (less attractive) girl that half / back through most of the movie, and he decides that he is happier / better and the movie ends. <br /> <br /> the movie has fun times. But watching this movie 30 years later, it becomes more a journey down memory. Because I still remember the salons of the pizzeria, the salons of the one-armed bandit, it also brought back the memories of a small town cruise while we were smoking a jug when we were screaming for good-looking girls and we were hoping that we would lie down (sometimes I was lucky and got a decent looking girl, which would share a link with me, and we would put on the back words, I also remember many songs from this movement (when they were new) ...... this movie serves as the perfect time era capsule in these aspects (przyniosła wiele wspomnień) <br / > <br /> the only thing that is presented in this movie, which I honestly do not remember, is ... I never remember the time when full-size vans were popular as this movie that portrays them as being, I remember this era very okay, and I do not go around young men who want to have a van, instead I remember young men in flying h 70s (including themselves) who want to have a Pontiac Trans Am, Chevy Camaro or Ford Mustang with a hot rod, but never a van - this movie gives the impression that the van was the most popular item and that every young man wanted it (which is not it was true in those days)
