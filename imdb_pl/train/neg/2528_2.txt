Van is a movie about a guy who tries to lure girls to his new van to seduce them. The only thing that this film does not disappoint is the accurate presentation of van fashion in the US in the late 1970s. It looks like it was created by amateurs. It's rubbish, but I liked it! I must admit that I am a fan of rubbish from the 70's! I hope this one will go to the bottom 100 IMDB! <br /> <br /> 2
