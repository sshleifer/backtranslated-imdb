This "movie" is the culmination of all that is bad in a modern movie. unnecessary slow motion, unnecessary shifting / jumping / somersault, unnecessary characters, unnecessary dialogue ... basically unnecessary. (is that word? well, it just was invented by I, Robot.) <br /> <br /> What happened to practicality? (ie car garage, skin spray) The only tool that shows the combination of a futuristic and realistic function is to drag the card in the cafe. <br /> <br /> What happened to showing respect for women? (ie the blacksmith's character does nothing, only degrades the doctor for the most part of the film, and yet he still "wants" WHERE IS TENSION? I will tell you where, good looks, not admiration or common ground) /> <br / > What happened to the detective who is detecting? Smith did nothing, just sat and repented, complained about other people, and when they said something that made him think he was not at home. it's such a bad way to get history from point b-c-d-etc ... it was OK once, but not several times in a row. (saying a few times in a row, what was "I snore and do not listen to your joke? Two times in one scene?) <br /> <br /> What happened to the small parts of the movie, which are slightly significant Shia LaBeouf (child) in the film, he is not only a tool that promotes rescue scenes, but in total he has two SCENES, we know that A-on degrades women, and B-knows that Smith ....... so COURSE we should take care of him and whether he harms , <br /> <br /> What happened to Hero? Just forget that everywhere there are people, women and children attacked by robots and selfishly save the only person who has my opinion that I have knowledge of. And why he had to ride a bicycle in the air, showing off while the doctor was somehow in able to reach the same distance in a few seconds on foot. <br /> <br /> do not get me wrong, I'm for the show, but I'm also for a bit of realism and meaning. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I have never laughed quite so hard in the film for a long time. so thanks Alex. <br /> <br /> I am praying for the return of the social pendulum back to simpler techniques, simpler stories and simpler everything else in the movies ...... but mainly simpler techniques. <br /> <br /> Large Films about budgetary activities: "you have to die"
