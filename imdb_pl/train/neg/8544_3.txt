I've never been quite sure where it happens. These people seem interested in what is happening on some mountain. They investigate, have narrow escapes, go out, come back, go out, put themselves in danger, sleepwalkers, are attacked by witches who have coherent wardrobes etc., etc. The guy seems to like a girl, but leaves her without protection many times. He is taken off, takes her back, leaves her again. You get a point. It seems to me that the whole thing needs sacrifice, but I'm not sure, nor do I turn people into witches, but I'm not sure. It's just boring and never-ending and not worth the time. There are several mood scenes, but the printout is so bad that sometimes it happens that twenty seconds of black. Is this due to age or excessive use of night filters.
