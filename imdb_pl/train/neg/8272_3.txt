At the end of "Dragon Heat" everything I could think of, why I was worried about all this. <br /> <br /> The creation of the film is interesting and - just like Maggie Q - it attracted me to the film in the first place. But have you ever been disappointed. Screenwriter and director Daniel Lee can not light a candle for John Woo, Ringo Lam and Corey Yuen. <br /> <br /> It must be one of the most annoying movies I've ever seen. Lee is so absorbed in his visual style - and I use this phrase extremely loosely - that he fills the film with completely unnecessary black and white frames, frozen frames, slow motion, fast movement and other visual nonsense. I suppose he did all this to compensate for the lack of a good story or dialogue. <br /> <br /> Action scenes are nothing special and they play like some scaled music video more than anything else. There is nothing to worry about - any two allegedly professional snipers who could not hit the middle of the barn from the inside! - who are then burdened with the hottest dialogue I saw in one of those actors from Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> The plot is devoid of twists - from the initial configuration, everything is predicted by fashion - and Lee feels the need to remind us of the story with the characters in case we did not receive it several times. It's awfully amateur writing and making movies and wasting the talents of Sammo Hung, Michael Biehn and Maggie Q. Although, to be honest, it's hard for me to remember that Biehn is in any good movie that was not directed by James Cameron. <br /> <br /> If you really feel like a great actor from Hong Kong, it's better to stick to some staples - "The Killer" by John Woo (1989) and "Hard-Boiled" (1992), "City on Fire" Ringo Lama (1987) - who stole Quentin Tarantino for "Reservoir Dogs" (1992) - or his remake of "Point Blank" (1967) "Full Contact" (1992). Or even check "So Close" by Yuen (2002), an extremely funny and at the same time ridiculous popcorn movie. And there is always a wonderful French police activist "The Nest" (2002). <br /> <br /> It is true that most, if not all, are a bit exaggerated, but these were films that remain exciting, exciting and even full of tension. They have characters we care about and thrilling action sequences. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, "Dragon Dragons" are simply terribly mediocre. The problem is that Lee did not make a bad action movie, he got boring.
