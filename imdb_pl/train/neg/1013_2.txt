If you watched this movie, you know why I said "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus." Hehehe !!! Every time they said "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus" ... I laughed thinking, "Jesus, Jesus, why did I borrow this movie"? I can not believe that Oscar winners such as Freeman and Spacey appeared in the background while Timberlake and LL Cool J grabbed the screen. WTF is Timberlake? Dreaful working! I think someone like Joshua Jackson could do a much better job! This work was perfect for Joshua Jackson and believe me, I'm not much fun for him ... but I really prefer an actor, not an android named Timberlake. And his girlfriend was shallow, empty and annoying as hell. I was happy when both of them were thrown out on the street. <br /> <br /> The story was fine and I think Dylan Mc Dermott did his part very well. The movie was fun, but I think Timberlake destroyed everything. Without it, it would be very pleasant. <br /> <br /> By the way, the music was OK, but suddenly every time the music appeared, the video turned into an MTV video clip with flashes, low movement and the like. Something lost in the police movie I was thinking about. Maybe they wanted to make an MTV video for Timberlake.
