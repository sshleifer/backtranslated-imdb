I think I found the most misogynist film of all time: Darklight. <br /> <br /> The essence of the film - Lilith was Adam's first wife and was considered imperfect and banished from the garden of Eden, because she considered herself equal to Adam and refused to submit to him. You see, I took these words straight from the script. Then the movie is still going on, and although it's the heroine of the movie, the only time it becomes acceptable is when it does what its men have to do! Ends the movie under the control of The Faith - the whole male group! <br /> <br /> In addition, the scenario was predictable and the FX was terrible. In addition to the obvious hatred of women, which is usually more subtle in a modern movie, there was nothing original in Darklight.
