This story about three women is a very sensitive study on Muriël (Charlotte Van Den Eynde), the youngest, Laura (Els Dottermans), who is about 37 years old and Martha (Frieda Pittors), the oldest who is the mother of Muriël. They live together in the same building. They have different expectations for life. A vital Laura wants a child. Muriël comes from the village and wants to change her life in Brussels. Martha dreams of her youth when she was a young girl. In fact, nothing happens in this movie, so wait for something - in case of an accident - that could improve this story. Over time, you discover that director Dorothée Van Den Berghe only wants to create a psychological portrait of three women and nothing more. This film is disappointing because women are expected to learn from their experiences, which is not true, so a sense of emptiness remains.
