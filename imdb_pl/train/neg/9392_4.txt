... and Ethel Merman enthusiasts will love her loud, overbearing vocal as a wicked Mombi witch, but this sequel of the cartoon "Wizard of Oz" is devoid of real imagination, replacing fantasy and emotions with noisy action (and cheaply repeating her material like a bad music video) . Little Dorota returns to Oz, who fell into disrepair and meets old and new friends. The inelegant animation got stuck somewhere between the weakest Walt Disney and the less-inspired Hanna-Barber programs, but many songs are good, especially the sweet lament of Dorothy "It's a Far Away Land", superbly made by Lisa Minnelli. You can count on Minnelli for energy, which is why the movie draws in when Dorota is around. Many of them are unnoticed, and I'm not even sure if the baby boomer will get a payment because it has not been in circulation for so long. As a subject of trivia, just honest. ** with ****
