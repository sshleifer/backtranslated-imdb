There are films that are horrible, and there are films that are so horrible that they are considered long forgotten and can not be watched. In addition, a lot of violence and bad things (not just shoddy things, you know what I mean) also add to the mix. What is the effect of bad movies with such lewd content? Of course, "Final Justice"! <br /> <br /> Do you remember "Mitchell?" Joe Don Baker was the star of the movie, and Joel and the Bots riffed him in the "Mystery Science Theater 3000". This time, when Mike took Joel's place in Satellite of Love (but with the same bots), the trio could make fun of Joe Don Baker's second "Final Justice" MST3K. Of course, many of the naughty things I mentioned have been removed for TV, but I still want to watch this episode (and "Mitchell"), because what does Joe Don "hate" the most? Why, none other than "Mystery Science Theater 3000!" <br /> <br /> P.S. If you have a Big Lots nearby, check to see if there is no uncut tape! LOL This happened to another user!
