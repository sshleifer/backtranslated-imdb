This is not a good movie. Too tender in parts, and the plot was below normal. 3D was OK, but not great. I almost fell asleep in this movie. <br /> <br /> The story tells you about 3 young flies who want to experience the adventure and continue. There are no heroes, I really do not care about these characters and I feel that there is nothing that could interest adults. Pixar is not. <br /> <br /> I would like to see more special 3D effects. I would also like to see more jokes about the fly than my mother repeating constantly: "The Lord of the Flies" Pretty sexist showing women wives and fainting.
