The plot has been changed several times; "A breath of life in a retirement home". Several plays, movies, novels, short stories, poems and newspaper articles are endless, but this is still an excellent platform for character research. <br /> <br /> If "Gideon" was created with more enthusiasm, he could be brilliant, but the dialogue is painfully boring, and the story is completely flooded with clich√©s (even the subtitle and summary of Gideon's "simple wisdom" almost made me laugh in his ineffectiveness ). The weak influence on this weak film is mainly due to the neutral acting, but the rest is so lackluster that the lack of focus of the actors is almost meaningless.
