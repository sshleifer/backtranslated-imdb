I do not agree with what has been written and said about this "masterpiece" of the German New Wave: <br /> <br /> 1) There are serious disadvantages in the simple exposure, in the basic communication of critical points of the plot, as regarding the abortion of Maria and secret agreement between Oswald and her husband. How many viewers understood that the husband agreed, in exchange for a significant financial salary, not to come back and get his wife back until Oswald died? <br /> <br /> 2) The ending is highly unsatisfactory because it is arbitrary and accidental. The original scenario required Maria to commit suicide after reading Oswald's will, when she learned that her husband had in effect sold their marriage to Oswald. However, in the final version Maria flows with tap water on her wrist in a gesture of suicide. Maria is then quickly blown up, instead of confronting the consequences of her illusion and moral compromise. <br /> <br /> 3) Fassbinder tries to force society to be private, political to be personal. Contrary to what critics and "experts" claim, I do not think it works. The mere interfering with historical radio news or the sound of the hammers of German reconstruction in the soundtrack of dramatic events in the film does not make these historical events an integral part of the drama. <br /> <br /> The selfish ambition of Mary's transition from poverty to prosperity is to be parallel to the so-called economic miracle of post-war Germany. Maria is, therefore, to be a specific woman who reflects her time and place, but is in fact unoriginal and unspecific. Women have long maintained their independence, using sex for promotion. <br /> <br /> 4) Finally, there are several examples of unforgivable sloppiness and amateurism - addiction to Fassbinder's drugs and impatience and inattention resulting from it. Unknown people talk to the screen without ever seeing them; the music is clumsily obtrusive in places; and melodramatic attitudes occasionally replace acting. Oddly enough, in the case of a film condemning the country for the deliberate collective amnesia of the Holocaust, he never mentions it once.
