This film is a glaring attempt by the left in Hollywood to portray the Reagan administration as incompetent and inept. Some mistakes may have been made during the crisis, but I'm sure not to the extent in which it was presented in this lame movie. My first reaction was that this movie had to be directed by Oliver Stone, but this time I was wrong. Apparently there are many others.
