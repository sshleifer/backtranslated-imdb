DOWN TO EARTH / (2001) * (of four) <br /> <br /> By Blake'a French: <br /> <br /> "Down to Earth" is such a deceptive and desperate comedy that it makes Sitting at home on the couch watching television comedy Chris Rock looks like heaven. Speaking of the sky, the film is based on a film from 1978. "Heaven can wait." It was a good movie, and it's good to show how a group of aspiring screenwriters can take decent stuff and turn it into rubbish. Directors Chris and Paul Weitz miss almost every goal. From the idea to telling the story "Down to Earth" fails miserably; this is one incredibly bad production. <br /> <br /> Chris Rock is a poor comedian, both in this role and in real life. Game of Lance Barton, whose manager (Frankie Faison) even regrets him when he boo him during an amateur night at a local theater. Shortly after the script determines its lack of talent, the character is killed by a speeding truck. Death, played by Eugene Levy, made a mistake, taking Lance before his number. God's assistant (Chazz Palminteri) is very angry and decides to give Lance the rest of her time on Earth, if she only takes the only available body of a 60-year-old white millionaire. <br /> <br /> the old man's name is Mr. Wellington, whose life has his own problems. His wife (Jennifer Coolidge) has an affair with her assistant (Greg Germann), who robs him of his money. But that's okay, because Lance, inside Mr. Wellington, fell in love with a young black woman named Sontee (Regina King). In the meantime, there are conspiracies to kill Wellington, Lance is trying to get a better body, and Sontee's disoriented feelings are in a hospital situation involving Mr. Wellington's finances. <br /> <br /> "Down to Earth" has some good ideas, but they are in a senseless and unconvincing love story filled with ideas and recycled material. The biggest problem we face is how we perceive Lance as Mr. Wellington. Chris Rock is an actor of popularity and publicity, so he will not be absent in most of the film; all characters see the new Lance as Mr. Wellington, but we see him as Chris Rock. It is convenient for a love story; We believe that a young woman would fall in love with Lance, but in reality she is in fact an old, gray-haired geezer. This is not so convincing. <br /> <br /> The only humorous comic situation is to remind an old man doing funny things that a young black man really did. But what inspires laughter is that the characters fall into conflicts without their knowledge. Just look at "There's something about Maria". In funny scenes, the characters are exposed to awkward experiences, not their will. Here Lance knows that he is in the body of an old man and does things that people do not normally do. If Lance did not know the body he was in then, he could have potential. <br /> <br /> Another problem with the concept: we never knew Mr. Wellington, so how can we compare Lance to his body when we do not know how he was originally. In addition, Chris Rock has to be the center of attention and makes the character too similar to Rock. Recites simple routine jokes that are tedious and painful; his dialogue is so obvious, wooden and simple. I hated the sense of humor of the movie. There are so many unreasonable jokes and terrible comic situations. It's like watching Chris Rock as Chris Rock, not the characters in the movie. <br /> <br /> Let's emphasize the positives in "Down to Earth". Mark Addy does not do anything worse here than in "The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas". Eugene Levy and Chazz Palmentari are well manned, but they are at the mercy of a scaled script. These are all good qualities that I can mention at this time, and if you give me another week to remember, it's not likely that I will come up with something more.
