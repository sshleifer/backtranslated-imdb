The nature of the companies lies in the attempt to use the success of others. Here is a film with elements from the earlier "Dracula" (1931) and "Frankenstein" (1931) - in the Germanic city, the village leaders believe that vampires (in the shape of bats) were the cause of the last deaths of a bloodless sacrifice. Even though it was filmed at Universal (and in Bronson caves!), It's a Poverty Row feature; it's not fair to compare it with earlier, more expensive films. <br /> <br /> From the well-known and exciting chilling music of the main titles (which had to be by Mischa Bakalienikoff), through the talkative but well-made opening sequence, we anticipate the appearance of Lionel Atwilla, Fay Wray and Dwight Frye ' and to give us a good movie with a secret from the 1930s. Unfortunately, this is not happening. It's a disappointment. <br /> <br /> We get a little more than the formal elements of such films, but with slow pace, low budget, insufficient Dwight Frye, exaggerated presence of Maude Eburne (Aunt Gussie) and premise for Lionel Atwilla (Dr. von Niemann) requiring human blood or how it shows mind control over his servant Emil (Robert Frazier) has never been very clear. <br /> <br /> Do not watch the technique "Dr. X '(1932) - in which there are also Lionel Atwill and Fay Wray, but as a father and daughter - before seeing it in the same way; for comparison, he is an Oscar winner. So look at it first. Structurally, "The Vampire Bat" is still not very good. It touches too much talking or unnecessary comic relief, without focusing heavily on vampire rascals. <br /> <br /> Besides X 'and "Mystery of the Wax Museum" (both in 1932, and in Fay Wray), the most famous performances of Lionel Atwilla are the one-armed gendarme in "Son of Frankenstein" (1939) and Moriarity in "Sherlock Holmes and the Secret" The Weapon "(1943). Dwight Frye steals all her maniacal scenes in "Dracula" (1931). As "young lovers" Melvin Douglas and Fay Wray have a nice kissing scene, but that's all. You can see him in "The Old Dark House" (1932), and Fay gets sucked in by Joel McCrera in "The Most Dangerous Game" (1930). Then there is her classic screamer from 1933. It is a pity more time, money and alterations that were not available for this film to better show the talents and chemistry of Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray and Dwight Frye. Unfortunately, this grim disappointing movie only gets 4.
