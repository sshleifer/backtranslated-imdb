I have seen many, many films from China and Hong Kong. This is the worst. No, the worst was "Unknown pleasures". I watched the "Platform" last night and thought that the other two films of Jia Zhang Ke must be better. Tonight I was disappointed again. Tomorrow evening I will not watch "Xiao Wu" because I just put all three movies in the basket! Whoever gave this movie, "Ten-Ten" Platform, must watch more cinema! The photography was very poor: it was very difficult to distinguish some characters because of the lack of close work. The plot was so chaotic that I quickly gave it to the end of pure frustration. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Give me Zhang Yimou or Chen Kage every day. These are the real masters of Chinese cinema, not pretentious opponents!
