I would give him 2/10. <br /> <br /> I was really, very disappointed. <br /> <br /> The plot was poorly developed, for example, events were too short and short, hence the moral was not clearly disclosed. I thought Brenda Song did a great job, but Shin Koyamada seemed to have difficulty handling his role. I saw the need to introduce western elements in the series, but there are some parts where Chinese elements were also needed! Black character, for example. His physical appearance resembled a robot, not something of Chinese culture. The final and worst drawback was the incorrect and distorted facts posted in the series. standards. However, there are other Disney shows, such as Mu Lan, which were much better in terms of the development of history and presentation. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I think that Disney movies should be better researched and better planned. A good program is not enough, just a series of martial arts movements you can rely on.
