*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** From the very beginning this fantastic movie sets the record: it is a classic classic. It does not take long to realize that this movie is big, bigger than "Kindergarten Cop" or "Police Academy 7." She was speechless when she left the cinema and went back to the ticket office to buy a dozen tickets. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that just needs a lot of reviews. The first watching will definitely leave you with this strange "Huh?" Feeling, but do not be ashamed - it happens to be the best of us. The story is so diabolically clever that one has to wonder about the mortality of its authors. What seems like a simple story of an idiot infiltrating the FBI turns out to be an allegorical story that works on several levels and teaches us everything about really important things in life. The complexity of the plot structure will surprise you when you first watch, but do not give up! It was only after the sixth or seventh viewing that I began to unravel some of the hidden secrets of "Corky Romano". And watch out for an unexpected turn at the end, otherwise you will be completely surprised when the FBI agent Brick Davis is the most wanted FBI criminal, Corky is not a real FBI agent, Pops Romano is innocent, Peter Romano admits he is illiterate, and Paulie Romano comes out of hiding as a homosexual. Surprised with me, I can tell you so much. <br /> <br /> Chris Katt's comedic talents are second to none because he leads his character Corky Romano through a maze of completely unpredictable situations. It resembles the performance of John Reynolds in "Manos, the hand of fate", Kattan takes over countless personalities and deals with all scenes with a perfect comedic sense of time. However, Kattan is not just a comedy. He is also a drama master because he controls the feelings of the audience with the smallest facial movements. His mimicry reflects life in a sense. For example, in the scene in which he faces the brothers, one can see the expression of social injustice and alienation clearly reflected on his tormented face. At that moment, it's hard to find a dry eye at home. <br /> <br /> Screenwriters David Garret and Jason Ward are the true heroes of Corky Romano. With a history of such proportions, it is easy to understand why two experienced writers had to be recruited to carry out this ambitious project. Their skillful storytelling and unconventional structure make Pulp Fiction look like the average Saturday Night Live sketch. The story of Garret and Warda is so appealing and attractive that it grabs you by your hair, swallows you completely, shakes you and spits you out. At the end of the experience outside the world known as "Corky Romano" you are in another person with different worldviews and different ideas, with only one question in mind: <br /> <br /> Why, God? Why?!?
