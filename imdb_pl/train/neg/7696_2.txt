Yes, stupidity! I just finish watching and I still have a bad taste in my mouth. Too many colors, too many unnecessary "additions" to the story, too many stupid characters (I suppose they wanted to achieve a comic relief, but I just wanted to cry) ... too much of everything. Shame to spoil one of the divine stories from "Arabian Nights" in this way. Childish, naive (both in a bad way) and with many magic errors, I do not think that it could keep five children longer than ten minutes. The princess is beautiful, but she should be without tongues, because the actress does not know how to act. The rest of the cast is even worse ... our "bad guy" is REALLY angry. It is a pity that "a good guy" is not better. The only light in this darkness is of course David Carradine, who unfortunately goes deep down from this level, but at least he retains the skills of the actor / "warrior" at the top. I'm still sorry to see him in this kind of thing, but I'm glad I had something to watch in the whole charade, so thank you David. Only, ONLY for him, I give this 2 stars to this fiasco ... I would give more for him, but it would cause the final result of the whole movie. The rest is so bad that maybe I would like to rate it, but there is not one lover here, and I think it would be too much.
