I've seen this movie for many reasons, the main one being Mira Sorvino. With her in the cast can not be so bad. It even seemed to have a secret, and Olivier Martinez was her boyfriend then and he was quite good at the "Infidel". The story takes place in Spain, so it can be an exotic entertainment film with one of my favorite actresses. <br /> <br /> If you think about the same, let me warn you: this is really awful, uninteresting, boring movie. The only adjective that comes to mind is pathetic. <br /> <br /> The story is made up of sub-chapters that contribute nothing to the narrative. They try to build a slasher / thriller with a look at fascism in Spain, but they do suffer a terrible defeat. Returns have no credibility and the so-called investigation leads nowhere. <br /> <br /> Characters are paper! Nobody cared. What's more, they are annoying and hateful people. <br /> <br /> Acting is terrible. Mira, what's wrong with you? Why Mira? You are the winner of oscar! Preserve your dignity! Her character was weak, but that does not justify such a horrible performance. It seems that he is sleepwalking the whole movie. Think about it, I think I saw her eyes slowly close in some scenes. I used to think that this woman is sexy. She is not here. If you want to look at some skin, try Romi and Michelle, because there is nothing to see here. And this accent? Mój Boże ... <br /> <br /> Olivier Martinez is even the worst. It is too painful to remember his performance to describe it here. Sorry but I can not. I suffered enough with this trash. <br /> <br /> This whole movie is depressing! It's so bad in every way, it's weird how it was done. A miserable band that creates a bad script and earns money on behalf of the actor. Do not be fooled. <br /> <br /> Avoid this! <br /> <br />
