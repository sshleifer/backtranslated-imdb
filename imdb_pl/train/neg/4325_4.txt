The second of the Vacation series is the easiest because Clark Griswold wins a trip for the whole family to Europe. <br /> <br /> No taste, below the humor of the belts, which worked so well the first time, it practically does not exist here. This fault certainly lies on the side of director Hackerling, who apparently is not a good director like Harold Ramis and a very uninspiring scenario, which has only a few decent lines scattered around. <br /> <br /> The staff does what they can; Chevy Chase introduces some form of life to acting, but it's just not enough, and the very funny Eric Idle is completely wasted in the small role of an unlucky Englishman. Some potentially funny moments are not fully used and leave the viewer mostly sharp. All images of Europeans are one-dimensional and almost not funny at all (for example, as the English are kindly SOOO). <br /> <br /> In addition to a few scenes, almost no laughing and the end is changing. one in a complete slapstick. But if you're a fan of Chevy Chase (like me), the movie is watched, but not more.
