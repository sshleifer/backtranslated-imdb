The 1980s were not very nice to the once-big star Charles Bronson. Beginning with "Death Wish II" from 1982, and ending with this truly macabre film from 1989, the Bronson Slayers seemed to try to mutually reach each other in a progressive gross. "D.W. II "little left the imagination in the image of rape and suicide of Bronson's daughter (the rape and murder of his host was also shown in disgusting details). "10 to midnight" is a kind of hideous movie that made you later want to take a bath. It does not allow anything. Other films, such as "The Evil Men Do" and the other films "Wish of Death" from this period, covered the line between the high camp and the high barf with their serious images of brutality and revenge. I'm not sure if the producers (usually Pancho Kohner) got a kick showing tired, older citizen Bronson, who was destroying young punks to be his grandchildren, or what, but shabby craft (and horrible scenarios) these films usually destroyed a small amount of energy they could have generated. <br /> <br /> "Kinjite" - the last of these films - is quite well made, but really takes away the cake into the misery of film. In this movie, Bronson: sodomizes John's perverse; he forces the pimp to eat the Rolex watch; allows a male prisoner to be raped by another prisoner; it makes, among others, incredibly xenophobic remarks, which I fortunately forgot. Rape was also presented on young Japanese (fortunately it was off screen, though well implied). <br /> <br /> What did people think when they created this movie? What did Bronson think when he decided to ruin his career with these horrible movies? For all those interested in his best films, check out the majority of films he made in the 1960s and 1970s, including "The Mechanic," "Death Wish," "From Noon til 3," "Once Upon a Time in the West," Red Sun "," The Great Escape "," The Magnificent Seven "," Rider on the Rain "etc. Etc.
