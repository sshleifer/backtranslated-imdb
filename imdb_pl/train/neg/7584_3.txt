I recently saw a revival on Broadway "Blithe Spirit" with Angela Lansbury, Rupert Everett, Christine Ebersole and Jayne Atkinson. This is a great production and shows what good actors can do with the less than perfect game. Angela Lansbury is extremely funny like Madame Arcati. <br /> <br /> Then it was probably a mistake to check the film version of the play with Rex Harrison. The film has no energy or laughter of good stage production. <br /> <br /> "Blithe Spirit" is probably one of those plays that works better with a live cast, in an audience full of people who have to laugh. Actors can improvise, add accents and nuances to perform and deliver lines, and engage audiences on a personal level that can not be found in a movie theater or on a DVD where the audience is separated from the story of the Fourth Wall. History: Charles Condomine (Rex Harrison), a successful writer, lives with his wife Ruth (Constance Cummings) at home in the English countryside. Searching for information about his next book, a book devoted to the supernatural, Charles invites Madame Arcati (Margaret Rutherford, who revived her role from the original production in London in 1941), The Local Spiritual Medium, to his home to conduct the screening. Charles believes that spiritualism is a fiction, but he hopes for "trade tricks". But then Madame Arcati restores the spirit of Elvira (Kaye Hammond), the first wife of Charles, who died of pneumonia seven years ago. Elvira refuses to leave and develops a rivalry with Ruth about Charles (complicating the fact that only Charles can see or hear Elvira). <br /> <br /> On stage actors can give performances that invite you to laugh. But on the screen the actors in "Blithe Spirit" tear the lines as if they did not know that someone is listening to them. They mumble lines that were supposed to laugh on the stage. The performances of Harrison, Cummings and even Kaye Hammond are flat and lifeless. It seems that only Margaret Rutherford has kept the spark and humor as Madame Arcati. <br /> <br /> Oscar visual effects in the film are impressive - not only according to today's standards, but according to the standards of 1946! They consist mainly of Kaye Hammond walking around fluorescent green costumes and make-up, photographed in special lighting to make her look like a glowing ghost. <br /> <br /> The operator deserves credit for creative lighting. But compare the boring visual effects of "Blithe Spirit" with the real breakthrough effects in the "Song of the South" Disney, which qualified for the awards of the same year. In "Southern" people and animated characters share the screen without problems for several minutes. Compared to "South", Oscar, who received "Blithe Spirit" for special effects, was completely undeserved. <br /> <br /> In any case, I can only encourage you to catch Broadway's reactivation of this play against Angela Lansbury before it closes. Regarding the movie with Rex Harrison, skip it.
