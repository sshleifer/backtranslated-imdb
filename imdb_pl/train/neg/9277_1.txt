I saw an omen when I was 11 on television. I liked the trilogy. So when there was a chance to see one in the cinema, I did not give it. I went to the cinema knowing that what I saw was not a cinematic release, but a TV movie. However, being a fan, I could not resist. But this Omen movie, which I saw at the show at midnight, did not bring chills that brought laughter. Risible Dialogue, such as "it is written that if a child weeps at baptism, reject a god." What nonsense. No decent sets. Faye Grant, so Good in V is wasted with this script from hell. No surprises and no fun. However, I laughed loudly a few times in our bad laughter. Truly pathetic 1 in 10
