Although the beginnings suggest that All Quiet on the Western Front, this stupid and superficial version of the war is far from its much better present day. It presents the funniest war ever waged, with the first hour and a half devoted to romance and good times. <br /> <br /> When we finally see a battle, it's bad: an enemy plane arrives? Shoot it (one shot). Sniper on the tree? Kill him before he shoots. Enemy soldiers in the forest? Do not worry, they willingly give up. Ho-hum. <br /> <br /> Summer, turgidalna, predictable ... <br /> <br />
