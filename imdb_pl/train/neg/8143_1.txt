I was dissatisfied with watching this film at the 2006 Vancouver International Film Festival. I have been participating in this festival for over 5 years and I have certainly seen bad movies at times. However, "First Bite" has reached a whole new level in the field of film. Despite filming in beautiful places, with the occasional, exquisite close-up of fabulous food, the film evokes an excessive number of twists and residual characters until I practically begged for its ending. <br /> <br /> The lead actor, David La Haye, has completely failed to show any character development throughout the film, showing the pompous chef from beginning to end. Additional subdivisions, such as eating disorders, were developed so poorly and completely that they did not fit into any context that the film had shown up to that point. <br /> <br /> The motive for mysticism was a weak attempt to hide a film that accomplishes nothing, goes anywhere and completely disappoints.
