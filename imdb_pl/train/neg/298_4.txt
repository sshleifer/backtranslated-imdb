Daraar took off quite well. The first scene really left me on the edge of my seat, wondering what would happen next. In addition, the first half of the movie is BORE. The first part of the movie is the first Rishi Kapoor in love with Juhi Chawla. By the way, do not you think she's a bit old for her? <br /> <br /> Things are finally piquancy in the middle of the movie when Juhi tells us about her previous husband; and wow, what a crazy! He was an overprotective, shapely freak about really HOT TEMPERATURE! He used to beat poor Juhi for no reason! One of the reasons I really do not like this movie is that I can not stand the view of Juhi (my favorite actress) who is so abused. This film generally has too much abuse and bloodshed; I consider it so disgusting !!! <br /> <br /> In any case, I'm just trying to say that if you are thinking about renting Daraara, you should put it back on the shelf, where you found it and choose something else!
