It was not funny in 1972. This is not fun now. <br /> <br /> Unlike many other people, I do not fight the movie because it is incredibly sexist - I quote that I liked this piece, or rather I liked the reaction it generates in annoying people on PC - I struggle with this because it is badly written and works. <br /> <br /> The only truly memorable character is Blakey, whom the British at the age of 25 recognize immediately, since he has been liked by the Impressionists for a long time. <br /> <br /> Avoid. <br /> <br />
