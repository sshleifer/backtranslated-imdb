It's a great idea for a movie, but unfortunately it has not turned out to be a great movie. What begins with a sweet and almost stupid romantic comedy about Fluffer in love with his Fluffee, gets out of control in a bizarre combination of genres and real stews of threads, with liberal borrowings from BOOGIE NIGHTS, THELMA AND LOUISE, SHOWGIRLS, FRISK, and even an interesting 400 BLOWS "dash" thrown in the end. (At least the director has carried out his research!) The result is not necessarily boring, but in the end this neat, well-made film does not really add up. However, all actors do the work with the material, and there are a few good laughs behind the scenes of gay porn. <br /> <br />
