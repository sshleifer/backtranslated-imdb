It's the worst movie I've ever seen. Let me say it again: THIS IS ONE VARIOUS MOVIES THAT SEEN EVER. <br /> <br /> He had all the earrings in the wrong movie: errors of continuity, bad writing, bad behavior, bad value of production, bad music. I thought there were a few points in horror movies. The first is that it should be taut enough to scare you. This film gets and F in this category. The second thing is that when a character dies or something bad happens to them, we should worry about it. This movie also has F in this regard. <br /> <br /> The first story, the woman is maimed by the wolves for fear that it will happen to her. Next story, OCD guy dies without being careful and talking to his dead friend. Oh, and then there is a terrible, hideous story about an evil roommate. Come on, could you choose more interesting and less common topics than being alone at home, being anal-retentive and having a roommate? It turns out all those stories in which hallucinations, virtual reality are caused by the Doctor, who in turn uses them himself. Wow, stupid. <br /> <br /> Let me explain something, I like to watch bad horrors and laugh at how bad they are. I could not do this with it. Sitting and watching was a total pain. Do not watch this movie under any circumstances. You will regret it.
