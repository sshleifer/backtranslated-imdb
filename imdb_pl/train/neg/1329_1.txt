This movie is horrible. I did not laugh so loudly from a movie that for a long time was involuntarily funny. Leno should stay up and late at night. The cars in the movie were cool, but the movie itself is the stupidest movie I've ever seen. it's pathetic, the acting is terrible, and the conspiracy was able to write a four-year-old. do not get me wrong, jay leno is hilarious, but not in this movie!
