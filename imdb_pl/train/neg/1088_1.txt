I rarely witnessed such an unjustified loss of talent. There is almost nothing constructive to say about this hopeless swamp of film. What few interesting threads seem to promise a movie, at first turns out to be little more than red herring. Actors of growth - Robert Duvall, Robert Downey, Jr. - they are deployed in roles that do not go anywhere; the director of the occasional genius produces a film that looks like it was filmed by a camera lens stained with coffee; the writer (John Grisham), who has never created anything, discovers a new depth of insufficient inconsistency. The film has a cheap, lustful attitude to it - but barely at the level of the commentary - it really is part of the aesthetics. I usually come to IMDb to write balanced, generally appreciated comments. This scandalous film disaster makes me want to create a never-ending, disgusting hysteria. I will not, but only because I do not want to occupy my "mind" with this trash.
