Frank Capra's work had to be almost exhausted until he made the film. Although he has some lovely moments and many great performers, Capry's total recycling of not only the script, but also the material from his first version of this story, Broadway Bill (1934), is downright trashy. It is understandable that he would re-use the footage from the climactic horse race. But he uses whole dialogue scenes with smaller actors, then he restores these actors and apparently expects us not to notice, for example, that Ward Bond is 14 years older! Unless you want to see one of Oliver Hardy's last performances, skip this one and watch Bill Broadway.
