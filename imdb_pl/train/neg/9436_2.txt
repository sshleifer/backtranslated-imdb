Unhinged follows the typical plot of the early 80's. Pretty Young Girls In Peril. I have to give up this for a filmmaker who has used a helicopter for some early pictures of car travels, you think that for a moment there will be quality in production. Watching "Unhinged" was like watching an amateur acting class during the warm-up. Some of the most awkward, badly lit, long scenes are played out with the appetite for the overdose of Valium. I wondered why they just did not put the memory cards in the camera, so the actresses would not have to change their eyes constantly. The two main girls were of course chosen because of their T & A factor, not their talent. Laurel Munson as the main cane Terry is as exciting as watching dry paint. Two naked scenes create a youthful thrill. Janet Penner and Virginia Settle as a crazy / terrifying daughter and mother, whose chicks are in a difficult situation, are fighting for the worst acting. Long breaks, strange expressions, emphasis on the wrong word, everything is there and is a joy for those of us who love bad movies. Scenes change suddenly with long power outages, through which you can enter the Mack truck. Lightning bolts crash into arrows, not even trying to show the sky. Eye shadow of the eighties attacks the viewer. But you know, it grew up on me. I was sorry about that. I wanted to hug her, kiss her boo-boos and improve her. The ending does not compensate for the damage he caused, but I smiled anyway. I have my own theories about the whole "forbidden" noise and I hope that everyone who decides to watch this movie does it with a lot of substance abuse and a sense of humor. Otherwise, go.
