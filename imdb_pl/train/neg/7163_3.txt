<br /> <br /> After watching "Trance" or "The Eternal", or whatever the producers call this movie, I was wondering, "Of all the bad movies I could see, I could not at least see one that would be funny? "Even if the movie is not well done, when it comes to acting, directing, writing or what you have, it can be at least fun and that's why it's worth it. But this film is not only bad in artistic terms, but it is incredibly boring. For the plot of this thinness it moves very slowly, with a small dramatic tension. At least, while trying to entertain, the deaths of heroes could have been fun and / or bloody, but the creators of this drama also failed in this section. <br /> <br /> What does this movie affect? Almost nothing, unless you get entertainment from watching Christopher Walken, who is capable of being a genius, puts so little effort into his acting that he falls into self-deprecating mode (WHY did he decide to do this film anyway?) Br /> <br /> I'm giving this movie 3/10, because, God, help us, in fact there were worse films before.
