Another film that uses the unjustified nudity of the male leader; terrible acting, plus love scenes are the most non-sexy I've ever seen (and it's not that I do not combine the idea of ​​two young loving men because I'm gay). <br /> <br /> Again, as in Mil nubes de paz, Julian Hernandez has directed an extremely pretentious film with a story that is a sufficient argument for a short film lasting about five minutes, but manages to make a 2-hour movie with him ... And this time there is even talk of racism and commodification in the Mexican gay community! God, have mercy on us!
