Avoid this shit at all costs. Bad script, bad directing, bad acting, bad editing, bad sound and bad music. You have an idea? This movie is trying to be western, it is not. He's trying to be a brutal core, he is not. He is trying to give a fresh look at the old genre, he does not do it. The actors try their best there, and my heart comes to meet them. But thanks to such material for work it is difficult to shine something. For me, it all looks like "a fresh film school that will conquer the world". Modern filmmakers often bite more than they or their budget can chew. The best thing they can do is step back a few steps, re-evaluate what is possible, and work within a limited budget next time.
