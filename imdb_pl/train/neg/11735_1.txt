This movie really pissed me off because the main characters or all characters have a southern accent. I have lived in Iowa for 29 years and I know that people do not have a southern accent here. This movie is about a guy who's making a run and I do not know the real story or what the movie is about. It has quite a nice graphic use of drugs and is really offensive, so see how these people use the finish line, how it was with sugar. I lost my brother to the finish line and this movie makes me sick to my stomach because this is a charming drug. The film makes using the drug look good, but I was happy at the end when the guy almost crossed the state line. I also know that most women who have experienced traumatic rape do not want to make love to their boyfriend or husband the next day. The film is simply bad in all directions. I would suggest "The Basketball Diaries" if I were to suggest a movie about drugs.
