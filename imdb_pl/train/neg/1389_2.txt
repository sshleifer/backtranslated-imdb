I was very disappointed with this film. In an artificial sense, it was weakly bordering stupid: Souls that can influence reality in the way they do it? Mission apparently critical of Soul Hunters entrusted to one of their younger members? And the whole story of "B" with "holobrothel" and the lawsuit against the station were so horrible that at one point I threw out the TV set "Why do you waste time?" <br /> <br /> Thematically speaking, "River of Souls" in fact, he did not delve into the question of the soul more than the original episode of "Soul Hunter". We see that Soul Hunters can make mistakes, but we still do not feel their culture. (Are there any female soul hunters?) Acting was fine, considering the material they had to work with, and the special effects - especially the planets in the first act - were impressive. But generally, I would say that I miss it.
