This horrible movie combines every Asian stereotype that you can imagine in one hideous package. Clearing money, cunning Japanese businessmen are sending a stupid but nice policeman Pat Morita to regain industrial secrets in Detroit. Here he meets Jay Leno, who immediately refers to the murder victim as a Japanese woman and calls on Morita Tojo. From there everything is down.
