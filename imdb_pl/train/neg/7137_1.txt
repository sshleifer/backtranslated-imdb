The cars in this movie are amazing. Acting in this movie is terrible. Scenes and rides do not make much sense and are just as bad. If you really care about movies where someone is changing and suddenly it's going funny faster, save yourself trouble and money. A good movie for racing fans? Well, there is a part where they make a mistake, referring to the NASCAR driver as a rally car driver. If you can not tell the difference, watch this, you will have a great time. It really comes down to the fact that there really are really nice cars in this movie, they are horribly driven and they are totally unrealistic. Acting is terrible mainly because of the very bad plot. If you want to see hot girls, enable mtv or vh1. I am disappointed that such nice cars will be represented in such a bad movie. If the class of cars fit the class of the movie, they should race with rusty bikes.
