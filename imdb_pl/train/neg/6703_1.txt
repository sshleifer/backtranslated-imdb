I noticed that this movie took on the burden of many insults. He probably made a few of them, but it was not that bad. I will be honest: I never want to watch this movie again. It was a bad movie. But I do not hate this movie, he tried to tell a story. As a drama, this movie can really work well. I just think that the filmmakers badly figured out which way to go when they did (they should add more funny pieces if they wanted it to be a comedy). With the makeover, it could have been a great movie. But as a satire it did not work in its present form - many scenes were not in the context of the story: for example, the scene of the robbery does not make sense in history. Still, it was not the worst independent film ever made - is it in the Top 10 Worst? This is debatable.
