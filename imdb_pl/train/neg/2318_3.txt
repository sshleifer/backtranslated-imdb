A child found as a child in rubbish and brought up in a martial arts academy has the talent for sinking baskets. With the help of the man who found him, he enters his studies and promotes the mastery of real parents. An infinitely better comedy action is a real mess as a whole. It looks like he is aiming for a hip-hop version of Shaolin Soccer, but the comedy is scattered, and its focus is more so than the ADD Chihuahua on a quadruple espresso. I kept asking, "What am I watching?" I watched it from beginning to end and I still do not know what the hell happened. It is a pity, because there are some great action scenes, funny jokes and occasional moments, but nothing, nothing ever happens to me, I would do it.
