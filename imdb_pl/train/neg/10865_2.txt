I love Munna Bhai MBBS, but "Lagge Raho ..." SUX really SUX. I've never seen such a boring movie in my life. And these high marks really amazed me that Wat came to the taste of Indian cinema viewers? <br /> <br /> ** MAY BE A SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> An educated girl needs advice from Bhai, people discussing about their personal problems. people come from the telephone, which part of the world are you from? I agree that the films should be fictitious, but these things are really indigestible. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 (2 stars are good for 15 minutes)
