What a terrible, awful movie. The worst collection of film that I have seen for a long time. Not that I saw a lot. I left the theater screaming after about 40 minutes in search of a stiff drink to calm my nerves. Meryl Streep was terrible as usual. How many injuries and torture can one person have? Aidan Quinn's talents were - so often - completely wasted. And who told Gloria Estefan that he could work? The attempt to correct the political correctness of this film still enforces racial stereotypes. (A brave, inexperienced lonely music teacher teaches children from poor children in a poor school in the neighborhood). The children were not even cute! Just written to fit the terrifying scenario. Aaargh! Wes Craven really caused me to be ashamed once. a real horror!
