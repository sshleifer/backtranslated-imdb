The Three Stooges in the western comedy-musical? Perhaps "Rockin 'in the Rockies" was to combine the Stooges comedy with a western Matin√©e musical; if so, it was a nice way to break Saturday afternoon. Jay Kirby (as Rusty) is a handsome young hero; and Mary Beth Hughes (as a blonde June) and Gladys Blake (as Betty's brunette) are pretty women. Hoosier Hotshots is a harmonious group; their songs are quite melodic; however, it was the forties, not the fifties, so the film was not "rock." There are a few laughs; but Stooges' mood is more subdued than usual. The talking horse is also underused. <br /> <br /> **** Rockin 'in the Rockies (4/17/45) Vernon Keays ~ Moe Howard, Larry Fine, Curly Howard, Mary Beth Hughes
