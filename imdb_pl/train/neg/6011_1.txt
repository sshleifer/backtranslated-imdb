I did not expect much after this film, but about brother, what a smelly one. <br /> <br /> I found this gem in a gigantic box of horrible $ 5 DVDs in Walmart (somewhere else)? As cheap as this disc, I feel cheated. Special effects had the appearance of high school, the work of the camera was distorted by wobbly tripods and sketch lighting, and acting was a perfect example of "Christian school." One can imagine the long and exhausting "prayer meetings" of a production company after we see the noise coming back - people who went bankrupt with this thing had to have seriously anti-biblical feelings about the ineffective production company that started this thing. Think about their torment when they saw that their $ 949.86 investment would rise in smoke. <br /> <br /> Someone asked why Christian movies are so bad - maybe Xian filmmakers need to look at GOOD movies and try to copy some things that make them so good. Believing stories and figures, less hysterical waving hands and fanaticism, oh, and a story that appeals to everyone - not just true believers. It means. Stop The Sermon, Save It For Church. Take, for example, the Omen or Prophesy series. Excellent movies with fascinating storylines, great photos and intense music. No hysterical wave of hand. Without preaching. <br /> <br /> If this movie had laughter, it would be much better.
