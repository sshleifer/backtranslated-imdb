I saw this movie for the first time and never heard about it before, probably because of its poor news. <br /> <br /> First of all, the directing itself is quite good, the actors played well, and CGI (I'm not a CGI fan) is great. But that does not make the movie. No history, no news for beautiful, exploited talents. <br /> <br /> Or maybe I have to remember that the art of the director is not only your vision, but also the ability to tell stories. And this is missing in 7 minutes. <br /> <br /> There is a simple rating there 4.
