Wow! Only this terribly horrible movie can inspire similar "Showgirls". I mean, where to start? Extremely horrible theme song? No expression of Pii Zadory in the whole film? The fact that despite being imprisoned in Los Angeles, or "the land of the foundry couch", EVERY man (and a woman!) Sits around to sleep with Pia Zadora, using all imagined means? Or what about the fact that every person in the movie is completely unpleasant because he is either stupid as crazy (Pia) or an obvious wicked probe (everyone else)? And considering that this movement was written by real "screenwriters", it shows a shocking lack of understanding for the film industry (who the hell would admire and kiss SCREENWRITER?) <br /> <br /> But it is (unintentionally) fun damn it, but the scene of "breakdown" will make you giggle, and after seeing the climatic "I'm not the only one who had to ****" Awards "(all made according to the normal level of operation in the basement, which we expect from such qualitative thespians like Pia), I sincerely hope that our dear Pia really used her speech again when she "won" her Golden Globe. create my day. <br /> <br /> In any case, if you're a fan of a bad, dingy camp, try this kitsch movie.
