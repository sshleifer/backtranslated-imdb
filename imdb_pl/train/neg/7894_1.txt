Unless you are an Evangelical Christian, then be like an Egyptian and avoid the biblical plague. <br /> <br /> Awful - why oh why IMDb lists the most favorable reviews at the top of the list - it is the result of one of the ones I just wasted at the end of what started as a good evening on this claptrap. <br /> <br /> The story began strongly enough - I was drawn into the movie and I was interested up to this point where Bible preaching took over. What a waste. <br /> <br /> This movie has infuriated me that I registered for the first time in IMDb just to complain about it - I hope that at least I will save someone this evening. <Br /> <br /> Hay - what a Christian act on my part ;-)
