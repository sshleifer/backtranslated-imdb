I really wanted to like this movie, but it ended with boredom and disbelief. The first shot is the transmission of a camera from a robot traveling in the direction of the bomb and is naturally unstable. But then the rest of the movie stays in shakycam mode, even in quiet conversational moments, until ridiculous. Is there a lack of tripods and steadicams in rental? The fact that it was shot at 16 mm does not help because the whole film is grainy and shaky. <br /> <br /> Throughout the effort Bigelow puts into accurate vehicles and equipment, there are enough glaring errors and inconsistencies that undermine the credibility of the film. <br /> <br /> - The car will not explode in flames after one shot, and once absorbed it will not extinguish with a small hand fire extinguisher. <br /> <br /> - A single Humvee would not drive around Baghdad in 2004, but would be supported by other vehicles in the event of a breakdown or attack. - It would be extremely unlikely to hit a running insurgent from a long distance, where the projectile apparently takes more than a second to reach the target. <br /> <br /> - I believe that the bombs have been brought to designated disposal sites at or near the base, not an accidental place in the middle of the desert. <br /> <br /> - It was found that the tanker's attack took place in the Green Zone, a very safe area that experienced very few attacks from the inside. The zone is mainly offices and palaces with several residences, but it is presented as a dangerous labyrinth of dark streets and lurking insurgents. Oddly enough, James never hassles because of the absurd tactics of telling his two companions to take the path themselves and thus attempt to kidnap. <br /> <br /> - And for that matter, the 3-person team is always presented as airplanes for cleaning buildings, prosecuting insurgents, etc., even if there are clearly dozens of soldiers. <br /> <br /> - How many hours does the band have to stare at the dead insurgent coming out of the window to find out he's failing? <br /> <br /> There were no fixing shots to show the viewer what was the size and layout of the base or where Baghdad was. I had no idea who the EOD team came to, nor any other characters were invented. These are the things characters will know, so we should also. <br /> <br /> Many "surprises" and scenes are completely predictable. Yes, it's obvious that the colonel's psychiatrist will get in trouble with the Iraqis he's trying to transfer, that choosing cereals back home will be overwhelming, and the kidnapped driver will not wait for you when you leave the vehicle. br /> <br /> Finally, there was almost no development of the character. Renner from the beginning has a restless relationship at home, is reckless and addicted to adrenaline. It's exactly the same at the end of the movie. What is going on? <br /> <br /> If it is indeed the best so far in Iraq war movies, it is an apologetic group. Based on half an hour I saw that instead I would recommend Generation Kill on HBO.
