It's really a terrible scam in the movie. His 70-minute working time is very well filled with film material. The rest are indescribable to the outside and gray interiors of the scenes. The plot's exposure is very poorly rendered. They are all only apparent scenes that are interrelated. There is no attempt at drama in the selection of the scene, but the drama is conveyed by the intensity of the actors. Please do not ask. <br /> <br /> The story is about a rocket that radiates millions of degrees orbiting the Earth five miles up, threatening to destroy the earth. This is a real-time threat that must be redirected if a custom atomic bomb can be modeled and placed in an experimental rocket within an hour. There is nothing to report here, except for the scientist's mad speech against the project, because there may be some life on board and thinking about scientific possibilities, but the speech of the obligatory idiot of the liberal was quite passive. /> <br /> What saves this film, in a unique way, IS a film material. I have never seen a larger selection of jet planes from the 1950s in any other film. This is not a complete list, but only some of the planes I have seen. It is short captured alternately by the flying pilot, F-89 Scorpion and F-86. The first purpose is to intercept interceptors by the Royal Canadian Air Force at Hawker Hunters and F-86 Saber Jets (or Canadian CF-13), and even a pair of CF-100 Clunks. <br /> <br /> Then for some reason there are B-52, B-47, and even B36 are visible during the start. More padding. <br /> <br /> "These Canadian jets are moving at 1200 miles per hour." I do not think so, because one of them looks like the World War II Gloster Meteor, the rest of the F-80. The meteors press on the attack and one of them changes into a late F-84F with the flight of the early F-84 wingers attacking in the formation. <br /> <br /> There is a strange version of the F-80 in the tandem cockpit. It seems that this is the type of training T-33, but a kind of temporary variant that captures all weather with a nose radar. They are mixed up in a snowstorm. <br /> <br /> The angled aircraft carrier is visible from a distance of about 500 meters. It triggers the F-8U crusaders, F-11F tigers, A-5 guards and the A-3 skywars. The Air Force mixes F-86s and F-84s and more F-89s you've ever seen in your life, as well as F-100 Super Sabers and F-102 Delta Daggers. <br /> <br /> The F-100s are pushing their attack with a lot of padding. F-89 discharges their rockets in their wings in slo mo. Fire F-86, F-102 lets you lose Falcon, even some F-80s (F-94s?) With half-launched rocket wings. There is a very strange approach to the late F-84 model (prototype?) With a simple wing of the early F-85 model over it, of course the producer's advertising film (Republic Aviation) showing the differences between the old and the new improved models of the F-84 ThunderJet. As it came here, it is the guessing of foreign bodies. <br /> <br /> There is another great movie material from Ottawa in the old days, when the capital of Canada was a broad point on the road, and especially a great material from the time of New York Square during one of the civil defense exercises in the early 50's . <br /> <br /> I think we also have to deal with the fact that the film was shot in Canada, with the possible exception of the chase that appeared late in the picture, because the Pacific seems to be in the background. The use of Jowett Jupiter is somewhat amazing and you can also see a nice TR 3. Canada had to be cheap and quite often used in the background. <br /> <br /> When it comes to the actual narrative of the film, you can not really recommend Ellen Parker with the finger at the end of the picture, except secret. And she definitely pushes someone away. Is it possible, R as in Robert Loggia? A director who dies before the release of this film? Her career as it was her last merit? <br /> <br /> Just like the newspaper in which the gift was packed, it was more valuable than the gift.
