It was hard to watch this movie and be completely honest and objective because I am a big fan of the original 1944 movie. For me and for many others it is one of the greatest film noirs ever made. Realizing that this is just a shortened TV movie and that most people destroyed it, I did not expect too much, but you can not help but compare it with the 44 movie. Scene by scene, I found myself comparing what I was looking at and remembering how she played with Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, Edward G. Robinson and others. Now I have seen these famous actors playing their famous roles replaced by Richard Crenna, Samantha Eggar and Lee J. Cobb. <br /> <br /> When it was over, it turned out that it was not as bad as I expected, but it does not fit the original from 1944. The two main areas in which this TV movie was not so good were: (1) there was no electricity between the two wires and (2) there were only 90 minutes, they stumbled on the story with difficulty to develop the plot, characters and chemistry between these tracks . Crenna and Eggar were flat and just did not equal MacMurray and Stanwyck as "Walter Neff" and "Phyllis Dietrichson" respectively. <br /> <br /> Where this repetition had its own character as "Barton Keyes" and "Edward Norton". Cobb was great as Keyes and Robert Webber as Norton, head of the insurance company. It was also interesting how the time frame changed, so houses, cars, telephones, dictaphones, etc. They were the early 70's, not the mid-40's. Otherwise, the plot was very similar, simply cast. <br /> <br /> However, one viewing was enough and I will be happy to return to the original version for the rest of my reviews of this classic story and movie.
