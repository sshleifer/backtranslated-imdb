It's one of the worst acts I've ever seen. I love Nadja Almereyda, but it's just an absolute dream. Apart from a few moments of interesting cinematography and music, this film is just a non-stop bad actor and stupid material. Jared Harris is particularly angry, but no one is good at it. The plot is a joke, but not haha. I do not even know if you can forgive movies that are so bad. Please erase the last hour and a half of my life. How did the director create Nadja and Another Girl Another Planet?
