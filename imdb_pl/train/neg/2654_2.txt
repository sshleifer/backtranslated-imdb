Although the cast of the movie was admirable, especially Dianne Keaton and Tom Everett Scott, the quality of writing was so poor that no actor or director would be able to make this film. <br /> <br /> My wife and I decided that the reason why we watched the whole movie was as if it was a train wreck, and turning around was almost impossible. It could happen that we "hoped" that the message would eventually become visible and that we would be able to gain some meaning from this effort. Unfortunately this did not happen. <br /> <br /> Of course, the audience could be able to "understand" this intricate story, the merit of human brain ingenuity to understand the absurd. However, the writers have not done anything to facilitate this innate need that we seem to have to find meaning. <br /> <br /> It was obvious that the people involved simply go through the movements of their crafts and that any inner passion for the character or story was either secondary or non-existent. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, films made especially for television seemed to evolve over the years. While communicating to the public may have been the main interest of writers in the past, contemporary writers and producers seem patronizing towards their audience, focusing primarily on manipulating us to stay tuned by incessant advertising that seems to be the only causing film, such as Surrender, Dorothy are created.
