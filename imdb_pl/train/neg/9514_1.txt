Please, save me those movies that teach us that crime is funny and legitimate. Combine this with a pointless script with an intense desire to be brother of Farrelly or Coen, and also a life of ANOTHER group of people who are supposed to have school age, playing their anger at Dawson Creek along with the soundtrack of GenXYZ, who pitifully tries to make the film "feel" "cool, and we have intense and painfully inept satire. <br /> <br /> It is not even a watered "Ferris Bueller" ... I prefer to watch the change of lights. <br /> <br /> Only one scene stands out as close to the price of the party: when the Betty Masked girls meet the masked friend Richard Nixon. This is a surreal moment. Priceless even. <br /> <br /> But for the rest I would rather have toothache. At least I can use some Benzocaine (tm) to stop the pain.
