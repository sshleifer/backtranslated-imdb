A good cast (with one main exception) breaks through the intelligent satire of Epstein. Mansfield has never been better or funnier than she is here with Walston, who is a veteran who is determined to become a Congressman to get out of the war. He and his buddies - including the kind concierge Grant - go to San Francisco on vacation and start the most swinging party in the city, while trying to escape the service through industrial speeches. The only thing that is not amazing in this film is the one-note performance of Suzy Parker as Grant's love interest, which takes too much time and slows down the pace in the second half. Walston and Mansfield have good chemistry; The trick is that she begins to love each soldier (of course, to fulfill her duty for the war effort), but is a married man who, however, loves his wife. They steal a movie with little trouble from Grant (who is funny in the first part of the movie when he's not paired with his star-actor).
