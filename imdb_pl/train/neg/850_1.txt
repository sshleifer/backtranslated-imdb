It must be the stupidest movie I've ever seen (front spoilers)! First of all, the plot is stupid. A small child is strange and moves to a hotel because his father is his guardian. It turned out that the kid has the gift "Shining." This gift has nothing to do with anything but to make your child look cool. Then the movie becomes more boring and boring until the man goes crazy. It's crazy to kill a kid and his wife because ... well, I feel it. Why did he do it? Suddenly we see a naked woman in the bathtub. The man kisses her and realizes that he kisses a dead corpse, which is completely disgusting. Somehow a black man enters the hotel and is hit with an ax. Then the child and the woman take the black man's vehicle and leave the father who dies within a few minutes of hypothermia. Most movies are not a complete waste of time, but they belong to this category. The music is trashy, the characters are trivial (except for Jack Nicholson, who is a good actor), the plot is twisted and fits the description of vomit, the ending is very predictable, the story is slow, boring and boring. This movie is very overrated. AVOID THIS FILM AT EVERY COST. I am surprised that he received such a high IMDb rating.
