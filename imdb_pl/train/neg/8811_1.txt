SPOILERS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> I watched half of this movie and I did not see it, I like it. <br /> <br /> The first reason: boring. Hardly anything happens, women sit and discuss how terrible their lives are and how they do not have hope, burn weeds, read magazines, take care of their sick friend and cut off the dead body from time to time. BORING !!!! <br /> <br /> The second reason: there are too many unexplained things. Many scenes are dedicated to a zombie hunter who kidnaps random men, stops them in the chair and interrogates them. Who are these men? How do they know anything about illegal activities related to sick meat eaters? Why does he kill one and let him go? <br /> <br /> There is also a guy who at first thought he also had a disease of eating meat, but he puts a fist through the wall with superhuman strength, suggesting that it is not quite what we originally thought - it never was explained! How frustrating is that? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I find women annoying, the story is uninteresting, boring duologue, and the action does not exist. Also, the cover is misleading because it makes you believe that this movie will be cool when it's gone. I rented this movie based on some of the opinions of other people on this site, and although I respect the fact that some people could enjoy this movie, from now on I will make sure that I have read more than two reviews in the film to avoid borrowing the next movie I regret.
