OH MY GOD! The only reason I give it to 2 instead of 1 is that Tom Hanks is as entertaining as Elvis-in-the-box. Besides, how did this decent film come to such a bad movie? Maybe then it seemed like a good idea ... There is no laughter to mention, stereotypes are pathetic, cast is wasted, the direction is amateurish. Now, when I think about it, most of the blame lies with the director, Joel Zwick. It brings out nothing but flat performances. Do not waste time, like me; but then I'm happy about the good train wreck. Shit, now the system tells me I need more lines - here you go: This movie should be called Return to Sender. Okay, now it was more fun than anything in the movie ...
