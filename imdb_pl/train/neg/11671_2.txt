I must say - it's smelly! (I gave him a grade of 2) <br /> <br /> Watch it only when you suffer from insomnia. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of scenery and scuffle chewing, but not much else happens in this movie. There is no tension, no deep, shocking mystery is revealed, there is no real threat to the heroine's prosperity. A few misunderstandings, a slight raise of votes - that's almost enough. Secrets are nothing that could not happen to anyone - the last "secret" revealed in the film is completely predictable up to this point. <br /> <br /> The plot, as it is, revolves around a young woman named Faith (Meg Tilly), who is an artist employed to paint a series of wall panels in a huge ballroom in an extensive residence by a very, very wealthy, elderly widowed woman and growing mother / daughter relationship that an elderly woman wants with her. <br /> <br /> It turns out that the daughter of an older woman, Cassandra, is dead. You can match the rest of the elements quite well. <br /> <br /> Even a scene with a mysterious man threatening our heroine does not reach the point where you are really afraid of her safety for a second or two. Why he still hung years after Cassandra's death is a good question. <br /> <br /> There is also a question that in this vast residence there is only one servant, a faithful butler who seems to do everything - cooking, cleaning, serving the meal, receiving the door, etc. Everything except the visible blocking of the door - because it would be this is the only explanation of how one of the characters enters the room where there is faith. <br /> <br /> There is nothing that would make you grab your arms and lean forward on the edge of your seat, because there is no "growing" tension in this movie - simply bland, pathetic revelations that they are thrown away from time to time. <br /> <br />
