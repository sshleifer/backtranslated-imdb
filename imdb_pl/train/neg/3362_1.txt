The Haunting is another bad remake of a horror movie with fake, overgrown special effects and a lot of favorites on the screen, and there are no advantages at all except in cinematography. Yes, remakes are not bad, but the remakes directed by Jon Da Bont are definitely. I suppose that the actors of A-List (Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta Jones, Owen Wilson) are there to distract us from the boring plot, funny special effects and terrible attempts to scare her audience, but this is a movie, not a tabloid magazine, which one does not care about in which of us the characters and the story care two things that were missing in this film. The plot is like taking the classic novel The Haunting Of Hill House and breaking out four chapters, and then using what's left for the movie is so boring and many of them are unexplained. The characters are quite thin and while acting is good, you do not care about any character at all. Lily Taylor gives a terrifying performance and sounds like she was eight years old when she delivers her lines, not to mention who the terrible screamer is. Lily Taylor is not made for a horror genre at all. Ghosts are stupid and cheesy, look like a group of Caspers The Ghost's ghost spirit Hugh Cain looks like a fat guy in Halloween outfit dressed like a grim reaper. On the roof of one of the rooms there is a gigantic purple mouth and it is not even funny, unintentionally just sad. The house is pretty and well-designed, which is probably the only positive feature of this movie, it looks nice, but it does not save it from brutal everything else. I can honestly say that I felt like I was wasting my time watching The Haunting on TV without a price so I would be even drunk if I paid to see it, but luckily he was on the Scream Channel. Overall The Haunting is a boring remake that tries to overwhelm you with the bad special effects of a bad horror rehearsal.
