Geez, another Lifetime movie, but once again it is not the worst film in the world, but far from the best. I think the main problem is that it is obvious who is responsible for what, and it is generally quite predictable. Worse, some memories are confusing and the viewer wonders, "Okay, how much do I care?" One thing I liked about it is that the movie shows that it is never as simple as "good are good," and the bad are bad ", and sometimes it is rather bad than evil than good and evil. Hadley did not do what she did out of sense of justice, she did it because she thought she was entitled to work for being a family and to eliminate competition. As for Alicia, it simply proves that the victim is not always a good person. Some of them really "have it", even if "it" was a painful, terrible death. "The Burning Bed" is a perfect example, but the difference is that the wicked man in "The Burning Bed" got exactly what he deserved. But did Alicia "have to come"? Some will say yes, but others will not agree, and the law will not usually. <br /> <br /> When it comes to acting, it's a mixed bag. Some do a good job, like Mia, but others have simply been indifferent to their roles. They were mostly wooden or simply unconvincing. The music was pretty cool, and some of the scenes are nice and exciting, especially if you like girls / girls. The film is not badly filmed at all, but given its glaring weaknesses, unfortunately the strengths are in the background. <br /> <br /> I have heard rumors about the sequel, but given the years, I doubt it will happen. But I would not be surprised if a sequel suddenly appeared. If Alicia is so BAD, smart and scary, as people say, I do not think she thinks: "YAY! I woke up from a coma! Oh, Hadley was responsible? Oh! Fine! and I want the fees to drop! "There is no way that Hadley would be in prison for so long, if he did it at all, because there was no murder. <br /> <br /> In any case, it's worth checking at least once!
