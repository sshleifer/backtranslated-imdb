Words fail me. This movie was extremely difficult to watch, and in retrospect I really would not like to do it. Although I tried to sit through it to the end, I must admit that I could not stay longer than an hour, so my opinion may be unfair. However, this film would require the most impressive last place in the history of film production to get a review that is not bad. <br /> <br /> Do not watch any part of this movie.
