By far the worst movie I've ever seen ... Can anyone tell me where I should laugh? There is not a single hint or shadow of an idea. The three leading actors are hopeless, especially this (I think it's Aldo) from Sicily, who can not make a Sicilian accent !!! Not to mention the dream-like contribution to Dracula ... this is another goal, taken from the worst cabaret tradition, that this "film" lasts a bit longer. Massironi and Littizzetto do their best, but this so-called film was really too difficult to save. I would give him "0" / 10, but the lowest mark is 1/10, so I had to overestimate him by one character.
