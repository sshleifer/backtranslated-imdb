This movie is unworthy of the title Omen. It is so bad that it actually damaged the classic character of the first three. It should never be done, they should change the title. <br /> <br /> They did not even spell Damien Thorn's name correctly !!!! And there are no daggers, the most important element of all Omen films. Pull it out of the shelves and burn it.
