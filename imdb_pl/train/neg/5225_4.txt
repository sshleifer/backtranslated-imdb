Drummond's entry lacks continuity. Most of them have their own elements of stupidity, deferred wedding and so on. However, this has an endless series of events that take place in the dark when the characters run from one place to another. The house seems more like a city. There is also Leo G. Carroll, who is such an obvious suspect, which nobody even looks at. He is a stranger and behaves suspiciously, but Drummond and people do not notice anything. Nevertheless, it is quite a good action and quite a good ending. <br /> <br /> I know that Algie is supposed to be a comic character, but like Nigel Bruce in Rathbone Sherlock Holmes, he is so crazy that it's hard to imagine anyone around him having a taste or intelligence. Is there a story behind him that will explain how he and Drummond became collaborators?
