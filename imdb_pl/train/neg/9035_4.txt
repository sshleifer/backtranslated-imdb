Born in the 1960s, I grew up watching TV Movies of the Week in the early 70s and loved the scary movies that were routinely shown, including "Crowhaven Farm", "Bad Ronald", "Satan's School for Girls", "Kolchak" the Night Stalker, etc., but this one is simply stupid. Of course, the writer is trying to use Manson's horrific murders from a few years ago. The film stars Dennis Weaver from the renown of "McCloud" and "Duel" as a father who takes his family to the campsite. The family encounters hippies who for some reason decide to terrorize the family. This reason has never been explained, and the Weaver's pacifist posture is difficult to swallow. For God's sake, call the police, beat them hell or something like that, just do not sit down and whine. Acting is pretty bad, unbelievable story, etc. Susan Dey looks pretty in a bikini, but that's all. Ignore this if it's ever broadcast on TV.
