I am looking around the video store in shock, how Steven Seagal and his films about bad movies can still have 3 movies on shelves in less than a year. The strength of the attack is the third no less promised for the first time entering the Sci Fi Genre on our ever-wider Seagal. Visions of bad film entertainment have flashed before my credulous eyes. This is not a case where there is no entertainment and film as bad as they appear. <br /> <br /> Seagal jumped a bit from Trashy, but a nice Shadow Man when we last saw him. However, the strength of Attack must be his worst film ever! Do not argue about killing, Ticker, and even people from Black Dawn. bottom of the septic tank here. <br /> <br /> Anyone who says it's Steven Seagal's return to form, should be forced to write a 100-page essay on the word Taste. <br /> <br /> Seagal is another agent / I'm again a bad asshole named Lawson wanting revenge for killing her team that leads him to a nefarious conspiracy to send out a really bad drug for unsuspecting not to mention that the dealers are not here. <br /> <br /> All production from directing to acting is poor. Was this movie filmed in the dark? This must be the lightest film from Howling 2. The action is terrible and badly done. <br /> <br /> The producers have also unwisely decided to do what fans hate the most: throw a stunt double stunt after a double and monstrously named Steven Seagal. show me little enthusiasm here. Can you blame him? <br /> <br /> Although it was said that the attack power was not the film Stevie signed on (originally a Harvester) and must be better than the attack power. - manipulating production did not make it more coherent and made Seagal look worse. I feel bad because of Directer Michael Keusch and the writer Joe Hall. Pin, because they will be forever judged for reckless re-production. <br /> <br /> So now he leaves Seagal in an impossible situation to come up with something that can atone for this mess. But after seeing how it turned out that the bad attack forces, do you really want him to make another movie?
