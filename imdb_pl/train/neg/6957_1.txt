Avoid this unless you want to watch a road but a badly made movie. Example? The sound is good, but the dialogue is not clear - the cardinal sin in the French film. <br /> <br /> In this movie, you try to combine epic, western, drug intrigue and ancien regime. What? Consider this. Cowboy music is fun when fighting for swords. How about a woman in underwear, holding a knife and bouncing on the bed? <br /> <br /> Someone should do "What Up Tiger Lily" on this bomb. Rewrite the script, then either copy it or use it. Heck, it's almost like that. (BTW, Gerard Depardieu and Carole Bouquet, both well-known to the American public, have roles.)
