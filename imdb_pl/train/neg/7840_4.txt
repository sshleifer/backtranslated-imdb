This film is told through the eyes of a young teacher at a Catholic school, watching as the RAWANDAN genocide surrounds him. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a short explanation of Rawand's story and competition. Then he jumps into the story, says a young idealistic "NEW-COMER", a young teacher who does not take life or situations too seriously. When he and the driver approach the road block, he plays with his drivers, I.D. not realizing that this is a serious moment and that if the driver can not identify himself as a proper tribe for soldiers, they will be killed. In this way, he treats the developing history of chaos and develops around him. He suddenly realizes that every Rawandan (including his driver) is involved and that soldiers and tourists from Europe can not and will not help. Media cameras can not stop a machete and there are too many machetes who also shoot at the militia. the title comes from the army's captain, saying he will shoot the dogs eating dead bodies around his complex, but they will not shoot militia soldiers who kill people around the complex. Mainly because they have not shot soldiers yet. In the end, he realizes the hopelessness of the situation and the guy who tells the evacuation team that he wants to give up space for one of the intended victims, escapes with his tail between his feet, instead of facing immanent death with school children he promised he would not leave behind. <br /> <br /> It's more a study of the character and the moment of Jesus coming for one character than the story of genocide in "RAWANDA". This film did not have to take place in RAWANDA, every hellish hole could have happened at the same time.
