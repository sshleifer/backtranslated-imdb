First of all, there is the Gujarati Theater, and then Bollywood. Both have their strengths and follow the fans. Director Vipul Shah should look elsewhere instead of the Gujarati Theater during Bollywood production. First, he created Aankhen (adapted from the Gujarati game) - which had a unique story, but could not serve as a Hindi movie. Now he adapted another Gujarati art and called it Waqt - a race against time. In summary, emotions are foreign. The development of the story is not intended for Hindi movies. For example, it is best to leave roles between father and son in the Gujarati Theater - do not enter it in Hindi. Even a comedy song is best left on the Gujarati stage. All performances are average - there is nothing to shout about - forbidding Shefali Chhaya Shah who is fantastic.
