I do not know where to start. Of course it was a TV movie, so my expectations were low. I was pleasantly surprised by the general direction of the second hour, but everything before or after it seemed to be a paint by type of film. <br /> <br /> And talk about bad chemistry between lovebird detectives. .. <br /> <br /> I would like to go deeper, but this movie does not deserve it. Rating: D + (IMDB assessment 3/10)
