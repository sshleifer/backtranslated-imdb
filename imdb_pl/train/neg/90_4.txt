: Spoilery: <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed with Love's Abiding Joy. I've been waiting a long time to see it, and in the end I got the chance when I re-broadcasted Thursday evening at Hallmark. I love the first three films of "Love", but this movie was not what I thought it would be. The whole movie was sad and depressing, there was a lot to do, and the editing was very weak - to many scenes from the context. I also think that the death of little Kathy happened soon, and the appearance of Clarks in the movie simply did not fit. It seemed that none of the actors really wanted to be there - they lacked emotion. It seemed that Missie and Willie did not have any interaction. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that screenwriters should go a step further. It seems that every movie that has been produced so far, is moving away more and more from the writings of Janette Oke. I mean, in the film, they never mentioned the mine and the two boys or Clark, who were injured because of that. And I think the reactions of Missie and Willies to Kathy's death could be shown and heard, not just heard. <br /> <br /> Of the four films that have been made so far, I have to say that Love's Abiding Joy is my least favorite. I hope that along with the next four films we will go further, and if the character Clarks is in them, I hope it has a bigger role and I hope that its part is not so bland. I also hope that there is more Scottie and Cookie, and maybe even Marta, but who knows what writers will have in stores.
