After watching FIVE ACROES THE EYES, I have to be honest ... I just did not like it. I have read so many good reviews about this movie, but I just did not understand where these reviews come from. <br /> <br /> I have a lot of time for beginners to film, and I'm sure that the directors will do well for themselves, but the budget they had was the main problem, two cameras were used throughout the film (which was OK), but they seemed really cheap cameras. Another problem was the sound, you make all these girls scream and shout at the same time, they all talk one on top of the other - you just can not hear what they are saying. <br /> <br /> a good idea, in a nutshell, they hit a parked car and then they left, soon after they chased their car, they were driven by a crazy woman who wants to kill them and has plenty to do it! ... On the other hand, girls have many chances to escape, but no! <br /> <br /> Very frustrating ... I've just scratched this one!
