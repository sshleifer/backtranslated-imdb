I gave these 4 stars because it has many interesting topics that many have already mentioned. From domestic violence to sexuality and many of these taboos. Beyond gore, I would not really call this horror as much as it would be science fiction. <br /> <br /> It's grim, depressing and hopeless. Although I do not mind joyful ending, I am very tired of the stereotype "people are sucking", which is crucial in every film. I know that today you can not get a degree of liberal art without changing your hatred of yourself as a member of the human race, but how is it that as a writer / director we pretend that we are different than everyone else in the herd Note that ALIENS KILLING HUMAN RACE are bad! At the moment, if you read this and believe that humanity deserves to die, just go out, find the lake and swim until your shoulders are tired. That way you will not be around to direct the next movie or write another book that tells me that I deserve to die for being alive. It's stupid, not thought out and boring.
