Whale hunters choose the evil whale. <br /> <br /> A group of yahoo whale exploiters grabs a woman and pulls her by the tail. A friend of the whale sees the whole thing, including the moment when the unborn baby girl slips and slides onto the deck. "Captain Nolan" (Richard Harris) could say that the big man is really angry at the way he looked at him as if to say, "Get out of town before the high tide." <br /> <br /> This story of revenge has the presence of Harris and the beauty of Bo, but not much more. It was the first "released" movie of Bo, although her first acting job was four years earlier in "And Once Upon The Love" released in 1981 as "Fantasies" (directed by John Derek). <br /> <br /> P.S. Today, the date of this review (November 20) is Bo Derek's birthday. I hope Bo has a "whale" of fun ... I understand? ..... whale? ..... hee-hee.
