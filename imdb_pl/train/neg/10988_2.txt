If I had never read a book, I would say it's a good movie. BUT I read the book. Whoever ever wrote on the screen ruined the plot. There are so many changes that it was not really worth the title. Character changes, story changes, time line changes ... <br /> <br /> First, who was Henry and the researcher? They were not in history. Henry had some of Mitch's character, but Mitch was not a cop. No, you did it so Roz, he helped "sink" his body and used it as blackmail Zenia against Roz. The real so-called blackmail was Roz, who thought that Zenia was sleeping with her son and wanted her to run away from him. Her son was also blackmailed because he was hiding from Gay in front of his mother. Her son was not even mentioned in this story. I do not believe he was his lover, the secretary Roz. <br /> <br /> Tony and West were not together at the beginning. In fact, he was with Zenia for the first time in college. The painted black apartment was their idea, Tony just visited. Here Zenia and Tony meet, they become fast friends. Tony hides his love for the West. Then Zenia went west, with cash from Tony, and then West and Tony meet. Finally marry, at some point West leaves Tony to Zenia for a short time. Only to become a broken heart again. Then come back to Tony. Tony's blackmail for Tony consisted of Tony writing a test for Zenia. Being now a college professor, she did not want it to work out. I will say that the character who played Tony did it wonderfully. <br /> <br /> Charis was blonde, not that it really meant anything. Zenia did not fool her cancer while Augusta was alive. No, she was there when Charis had a lover named Billy. Augusta's father was a cautious man during the Vietnam War. Eventually, after Charis has been looking after Zenia for many months for what was actually a drug withdrawal. Zenia and Billy have an affair right under the nose of Charis while caring for both of them. Then Zenia turns to Billy to the government and leaves with him on the ferry. Not with Augusta, Charis was pregnant with her. Charis also had a split personality, Karen was her real name. <br /> <br /> Zenia did not die from being cut into pieces ... she fell or was pushed (we never really know) from the balcony and landed in a fountain. She had almost pure heroin in her blood, and she probably took some without knowing it and dropped out when she left. This time, she was really dying of cancer. <br /> <br /> She did not show any childhood memories or anything that would attract the characters to the reader. The book was spread all the way to her naked bones. Then again done in someone's vision. Why can not you just write your own story like what you did in the movie. It was different enough and I'm sure you could do it more.
