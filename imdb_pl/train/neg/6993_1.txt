What a horrible movie. I can not believe I've wasted 90 minutes of my life watching this replay. Tell me why Ving Rhames and Mehki Pfifer appeared in this film? Mehki Pfifer is great at E.R, and Ving Rhames probably did not know what he was doing. I feel terrible for them. Background music, which I must say did not fit the AT alllll to this story and it's amazing how you can find those directors who have absolutely no life in creating a well-balanced film. I hope that in the future no director as horrible as this one would be able to distract such a great classic movie. This film should not have been in the first place. Advice for anyone who saw it, tell me that I'm right, because I could not be the only viewer who did not like it. <br /> <br /> BOOOOOO !!!!!!!! -10 out of 10.
