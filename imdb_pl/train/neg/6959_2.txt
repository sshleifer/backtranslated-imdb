I went to see it a few days ago and it's hard to forget this movie ... for the wrong reasons. This movie is supposed to be funny, it's not a single laugh in the theater (maybe on josé garcia and gérard Depardieu), and it's boring, boring, boring. Sometimes it was even difficult to understand what they were saying. They just talk quickly and do not open up enough for us to understand. I was with a friend and more than 4 or 5 times I found myself talking on a line that was supposed to be funny "what he said" and I'm French. I hate to talk about it, given the fact that it seems to me that good films are made here, but I apologize in advance for all foreigners who will go to see the movie (if they are ever shown outside of France). "I am so sorry for this cr @ p. 2/10
