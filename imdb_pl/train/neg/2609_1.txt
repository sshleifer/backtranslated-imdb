This movie did not give anything new or valuable. After seeing this, my wife and I agreed that the studio simply threw it away and could care less about whether it was fun. This is a good example of a "just conceptual" movie - they have a movie concept, and other details are irrelevant, because exec KNOW will make $$ be based on the initial concept. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Cruella's departure from prison and parole. She does not hate puppies anymore, but she has been programmed to worship them - she just could not hurt the fleas. It does not last long after its release and returns to the old customs. Period. <br /> <br /> The most annoying aspects of the film were the accompanying characters. Eric Idle as Waddlesworth's voice made the bird hate him - and that's TOUGH, considering I'm an avid fan of Python. It was obvious that he did it because they gave him a lot of money (there could be no other reason). Tim McInnerny, the servant of Cruelli's low self-esteem, was entertaining at Black Adder shows, but here he is completely wasted and unaware. It took several bucks to get GÃ©rard Depardieu, but he was also completely wasted. There were also a few other supporting actors, but considering how characters were poorly written, I try to block them. <br /> <br /> In general, it's better to let the children watch TV than bother letting them see this crap.
