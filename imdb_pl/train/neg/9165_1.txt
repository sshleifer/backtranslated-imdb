There are no spoilers in this review because everything has already been shown in the movie trailer. I try to be balanced in my review because I strongly support local films, but I can not help but support the reaction to this film. It is slow, boring and borders on pointless. Even "almost nice and credible moments" were immediately undercut by painful stereotypes and bad acting. Vernetta Lopez and Wong Li Lin, whom I usually love, were tolerable in this film. I felt like the director tried to create a melodramatic soap on the TV, after which he was kidnapped and decided to put it on the big screen. Leap years should come with RA (Rated Awful), but this has not changed my belief in local movies. There will be more good movies until more such films are made.
