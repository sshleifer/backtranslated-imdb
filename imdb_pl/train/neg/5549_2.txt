"That can mean the end of the white race!" Puffs the general when several native zombies wander around the battlefields of Europe during the "Great War." The expedition sets out for the long-lost city of Kennif-Angor to stop this kind of thing and keep the battlefield clean, so that decent honest white people can kill tens of thousands. <br /> <br /> It's difficult to say when there are zombie people in this movie because acting is so wooden. Even according to the standards of 1936, Acting in this film is bad. From the previous decade. It looks like it comes from a textbook to the correspondence school "How to Act" <br /> <br /> ------------- Chapter three: Emotions ------- - ---- <br /> <br /> "How to express fear and disgust (woman) Clench both fists. Place the fist of one hand on your heart. Open your mouth to scream. Hold the pose for 10 seconds longer than comfortably, then quickly turn your head 90 degrees from the direction of the hated object and sob. <br /> <br /> "How to have a difficult, emotionally charged scene with a former fianc√©e explaining his love for someone else. DO NOT make eye contact. Do not move. Do not show any emotions. Do not move your eyes too much when reading lines from the studio wall. "<br /> <br /> To give us a break from the lead actress, the director cleverly interrupts long breaks in which nothing happens, except that the movie is still running through the projectors, so the 35-minute story is filled to 60 minutes. <br /> <br /> The zombie rebellion, when it comes, is so slow! The armies of former zombiefied minions released from mental captivity are throwing themselves at their former master, slowly moving up the hill, then thrusting in the door and smashing the window. "Yes ... let's ... oh, I do not know that. Let's go to him, Frankenstein must be destroyed - manana." (Though I've just found some hidden symbolism.) Jagger is shot by a native as an ironic counterpoint for all the natives shot by the Germans At the beginning of the movement, see, even the oppressed natives do not want the end of the White Race!) The pursuit (as you can call it) through the rear swamp is fun and worth the admission price Roy D'Arcy m and a lot of time to break it, but it's totally wasted, like Colonel Mazovia. <br /> <br /> There is one interesting moment in this movie. A nice little assembly of zombies and white cast members falling under a bad gaze. face to face, they penetrate each other. It works, although in the center of each of them is a strange little flash, like a cut frame. I think they must be Neg Cutters between disappearances. <br /> <br /> Best to watch with friends and in a stupid mood.
