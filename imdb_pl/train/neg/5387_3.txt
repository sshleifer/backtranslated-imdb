In an instant, when it seemed to be interesting, it never got there. <br /> <br /> People go from one point to another, it does not make sense (if it was, it was very boring). There was no action, no tension or horror, and the characters were quite soulless, so there was no concern for them about what happened to them. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was quite boring. <br /> <br /> I give him 3/10. <br /> <br /> I like that it was not shaky, hard work with the camera, and if it was music, it did not irritate me, like really bad movies, and acting was not terrible.
