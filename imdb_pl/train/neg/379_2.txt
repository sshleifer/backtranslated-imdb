The TV guide calls this film a mystery. For me, the secret is how it is possible that a culture that can produce such complex and complex classical music and genius mathematicians is not able to produce one film that would rise above the shameful level of garbage that this film presents so perfectly. This is Bollywood in the best / worst case, I honestly can not tell the difference. Bland, sweet, kitschy stereotypes at every level, story, situations, dialogue, music and choreography. Simply put, you must be delayed to enjoy it. I watched him to satisfy my cultural curiosity, but there were times when I had to leave him because I could not take it anymore. The only advantage of the film is the outstanding beauty of the leading actresses. <br /> <br />
