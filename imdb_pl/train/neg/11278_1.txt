This film is just one of the worst films ever made and is a damned act of accusation not only of the British film industry, but also of talent-free hacks at work. The film not only gained mainstream distribution, but also a good cast of British actors, so what went wrong? I do not know and I just do not care about getting involved in the debate because the movie was so terrible that it does not deserve any thought. be warned and stay away from this trash. but apparently I have to write ten lines of text in this review, so I might as well describe the story. Nobel of a man is founded by his evil friend and colleague from his father's company, which leads to a meeting with the Russian mafia and suspicious accents and stupid, very stupid twists of action. I should have asked for a refund but maybe I was still shocked by this experience. if you want a good crime movie, watch the ordinary suspects or godfather, and what about the blockade, the reserve ... is the pinnacle of modern British crime .....
