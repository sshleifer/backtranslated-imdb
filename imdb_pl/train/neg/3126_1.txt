Mr. VanHook took a good idea and kicked like a football. Unfortunately, the goal was not achieved. The historical topic of the giants is good, but pour the goon milk and finish with a giant cheese wheel. I say, take this reel and slide it off the cliff. I could not even see the whole movie. That says a lot, because I rarely leave the movie. I always like to give them a chance to buy back at the last minute. You can not buy something so bad. Well, at least the acting was good .... NO! <br /> <br /> The only "falling" thing in this movie is the rating. 1/10 and sinking in negative numbers!
