Polynesian flagged males drink, fight and make a stream of sexist, stupid and unpalatable remarks. The real life of the Polynesians is much more fun than the stereotypical, cardboard characters. Apparently the Samoan girl did not look or act like a Samoan, she seemed more like a white female who had sex with someone on a whim. With the weak lines of the water story you can not say anything about acting - even the most prominent actors could not do anything about this scenario. It is sad that Polynesian actors want to play such sad stereotypes in a film without one good scene and only two or three "jokes". What a waste of taxpayers' money Kiwi, what a missed opportunity to make a great movie about a vibrant community. It's better not to make movies if they're as bad and mindless as this.
