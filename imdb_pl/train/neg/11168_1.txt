- A Mexican priest becomes a wrestler to save an orphanage or something - <br /> <br /> I went to see this movie because it was about wrestling other than WWF, so I thought it could be funny. There was no. It's horrible to look. Embarrassing. Every chance for comedy is mercilessly wasted. <br /> <br /> I admit that I do not like Jacek Black anyway. After this I broke my brain to think about one good role that he did. The only thing I can think of where he was o.k. was an indispensable foil for the character of John Cusack in "High Fidelity". Jack Black is one of those horrible, tenacious, clumsy guys in a dressing gown (like a little fat in Abbot & Costello or Jerry Lewis), who should be said that being idiotic idiot is not the same as being funny. <br /> <br /> It's not even a slapstick. It's just annoying. It's not even a stool, it's just stupid. <br /> <br /> I've also heard good things about Napoleon Dynamite, but if it's anything to do, I will not be in a hurry to find it on DVD.
