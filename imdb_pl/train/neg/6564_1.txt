This is one of the worst movies I've seen so far. The best thing was that Christian J. Meoli "Leonard" tried to jump outside the bar, as if I wanted to do it on DVD, to save the rest of humanity from watching this shitty movie. He has a great cast, so you look how long it will be good, I mean Sean Astin "Andrew" (he played his part perfectly, did a great job, it's a pity that in this movie), Kyra Sedgwick "Bevan", Ron Livingston "Chad ", Ren√©e Zellweger" Poet "(they put her name on the cover has a total of 1 line and less than 4 seconds in the whole movie ... <br /> <br /> If the cast had any dignity, they went out and bought all copies of the movie and they smoked it along with Writer / Director George Hickenlooper and Writer John Enbom
