Saturday Night Live, National Lampoon and SCTV graduates are together in a sometimes fun sketchy movie. <br /> <br /> It is very interesting to watch now, at the beginning of 2005. Twenty years after this movie should be done, look how many of their gags have become absolutely true: there is a trial trailer of the movie, which probably was not even wise at that time, for something called "The Pregnant Man" that came true with a silent movie " Junior "There is a commercial parody, which probably was not smart at the time, with something like Sammy Davis Jr. and Jackie Onasis called 'Celebrity Wrestling'. There is a trial trailer of the movie, which probably was not even then wise, in which John Candy appears in the movie about the cut off head. Watch this trailer and see how similar his shots and story are to Frank Hellenlotter's basketball event !! And finally, there is advertising for the late late show about "dead dream, only the other two ..." The name of the movie is ... LAST HIPPES! LOL. <br /> <br /> Four prophecies come true!
