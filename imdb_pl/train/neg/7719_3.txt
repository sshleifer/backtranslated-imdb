The easiest way to describe this movie is as satire. The goal of satire is quite wide, from the US government to corporate America. This is also not greedy satire, but rather stupid. <br /> <br /> Think about this movie as a mix of Kentucky Fried, a series of aircraft and police, done at a much smaller budget, not as ridiculous. I see how this movie is a satire of many films about the sci-fi catastrophe of the 1950s and 1960s. I see this film as a big influence on Mars Attacks by Tim Burton. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite simple. Genetically designed giant tomatoes "go crazy" and start attacking people and cities. At the beginning there is a cover, and then goes into a full fallen war. <br /> <br /> The film has a range of characters and characteristics: Lois "Fairchild" (clone of Lois Lane), very ambitious president. Press Secretary, Clark Kent, Mason Dixon (FIA agent who has not worked since the Bay of Pigs), useless the president (who seems to be able to sign his name and attack New York), even a failed Congress, poor marketing director and Mason's team consisting of an obese East German "female" swimmer, scuba diver, a crazed paratrooper from World War II and an African-American disguise expert (disguised as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Hitler and finally as a tomato). Did I also forget to mention many tomatoes? There are all kinds of tomatoes, from small tomatoes, through enormous plastic tomatoes, to broken tomatoes, to tomato juice and finally to people dressed as tomatoes. <br /> <br /> And besides, you also have music numbers. They are not that good and they seem to be dubbed. The best song is definitely the theme of the movie ("Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"). It is too catchy and you can end humming or singing in public. Be warned. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie is quite funny and shows the absurdity of various real life situations as well as various types of entertainment. I do not believe I was called out laughing, but I mainly smiled and scratched my head. I definitely recommend this movie for fans of B and C movies, but only as a rental company. <br /> <br /> - Rehab rehabilitation
