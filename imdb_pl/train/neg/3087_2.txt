A group of incredibly unlikely holes A-torment lame marionettes that an old night watchman had kept locked in a movie vault for twenty years for no reason at all. <br /> <br /> Many people know this movie only from the point of downloading MST3K. But I saw a real movie and I can say that yes, it's really bad, really REALLY bad. One of the most horrible battle scenes I've ever seen stuffed "alien" toys that suffer from lack of movement (I had a monster My Pet, which was scarier), up to terrible action (I had a My Pet Monster who was more charismatic) that Rick Sloan's films "Vice Academy" are said to be somehow and trust me that I do not have a terrestrial idea, much worse. It does not suggest that this movie is nothing but nonsense, because it is not. I just throw it away. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: no nudity in the film, but the DVD has two pairs of tits.
