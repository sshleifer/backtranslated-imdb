In this movie there was nothing that I liked. It was so low budget with bad lighting and camera work (almost like the Blair Witch Project, but it should not be like this). The plot was not too big, and the movie was just a drug. Actually, I was fast through the last 1/3 of the movies, but it did not help. It looked like it might be good from the box, but I have to say again: nothing in this movie was quite good. No good actors, special effects were so false, camera work was terrible, and dialogue was painfully terrible. On my own personal scale, I give this film 0 out of 10. Yikes!
