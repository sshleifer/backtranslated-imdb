When I saw this movie for the first time, it was entitled TERROR ON A TRAIN and was the back half of the dual function. Glenn Ford, an armaments expert, is tasked with disarming a hidden bomb on a train loaded with high explosives. The voltage is slow and stable; and this black and white film only lasts about an hour and twelve minutes. All these years later on TV; tension and drama have lost most of their influence. This is still a good movie when it comes to standards from the 1950s. <br /> <br /> Along with Ford are Anne Vernon and Maurice Denham. Victor Maddern plays the goldfish / saboteur.
