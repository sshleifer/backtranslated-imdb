I watched the whole movie, waiting and waiting for something to happen. Maybe it's my fault for waiting for evil and horror instead of psychology? Is it a strange repetition of the oedipal myth: I want to kill my father and my mother and marry my uncle and compose music with him? I did not understand why some of the plot's elements were even present: why was the building upstairs, why was there a large staircase with a perfect place for someone who would have been ruined if nobody really intended to do it, why the scene at all with the father in work, why have such a nice kitchen if you intend to eat only for take away, why a boy would like to be baptized, and parents would be those who resist, not the other way around. I see a lot of good reviews about this movie ... has my taste been damaged by entering 70's movies and old sci fi movies?
