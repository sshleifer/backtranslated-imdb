I am a Puerto Rican and this is one of the worst documentaries I have ever seen. You can see that people have no idea on him. They do not know much about Puerto Rico and its culture. They claim to be Puerto Rican because they come from Puerto Rico, but they probably know less than others who are not from there. You can see when they say they deny themselves. If you want to see the real, and I mean a real, real documentary from Puerto Rico, you have to see "Mi Puerto Rico". This is a serious, real document. Not like this piece of rubbish. Rosie Perez based the document on herself. I thought it was Puerto Ricans. They repeat, I did not know. Well, that's the only thing that hit this so-called document. I hate that a piece of rubbish is made using the name of the island. It lowers standards.
