If you really liked the Resident Evil movie from 2002, you should see it instead of giving up 2 hours, you will never come back. I can not believe that nobody commented that this movie is simply a cheap fear of RE. First of all, the "special" force of commandos is a unique defense of the object with a computer matrix that has AI and holographic projection. And this "rip off" has a series of traps that inevitably kill one member of the team at a time. In the code names there is even a reference to chess, which was in the RE dialog box. Despite the fact that there are no zombies, "Rook", the nemesis of the film, is a kind of bio-creature, a very colorful bucket suggesting necrotic tissue, with many components of cyborgs, like the super mutant RE. So, a finger swipe at Mr. Richard Taylor for acknowledging any merit for this story. <br /> <br /> Of course, they are not the same film, but the writer came up with the idea of ​​watching Resident Evil. .
