As a Dane, I'm proud of some good Danish films that have been produced in recent years. It is a pity, however, that this increase in quality has led most Danish film critics to lose their sense of criticism. In fact, it has become so bad that I no longer trust any reviews of Danish films and as a result, I stopped to watch them in cinemas. <br /> <br /> I know it's unfortunate to keep this unfortunate development before any one movie, so let me emphasize that "Villa Paranoia" would be a terrible movie in every respect. The fact that he was fueled by critics, he only added fuel to my bonfire of disappointment with the Danish film. What's more, waiting for the DVD to appear was very unhelpful in stopping the unwavering sense of wasted time and money. <br /> <br /> Erik Clausen is an excellent director with a talent for socialist realism in Copenhagen settings. I particularly liked "De Frigjorte" (1993). As an actor, he is usually funny, although he generally plays the same role in all his films, namely in the working class, which is desperate, partly because it is sloppiness, but mainly because of society and who repurchases by doing something good for his community . <br /> <br /> This is the number one in "Villa Paranoia"; Clausen throws himself at the chicken farmer, which is such a break with the norm that he never manages to make him credible. <br /> <br /> However, it is much worse that the film has to do the twists and break all the rules of telling the story so that the audience understands what is going on. For example, the movie begins with a very sad attempt to visualize the main character's experience using low-budget effects and bad camera operation. After this, the character tells his best friend that she suddenly felt the need to throw herself off the bridge. This is symptomatic of the whole movie; the motivation for heroes is small or none, and Clausen resorts to the lowest form of communicating any motivation: speaking instead of showing. So, at some point, you have a character who speaks loudly to a supposedly catatonic person about how he feels, because the script would not let him play his feelings; later the voice of the lector is suddenly introduced, perhaps as a reflection, to convey feelings that would otherwise remain unknown to the public because of the director's ineptitude. Fortunately, at this point you are about an hour after taking care of any character, let alone the so-called history. <br /> <br /> Acting, which was often a problem in Clausen's films, can be summed up in one sad statement: SÃ¸ren Westerberg Bentsen, whose only other contender for the title was a Big Brother player, is not worse than a few announced actors in cast. <br /> <br /> I give it a 2-to-10 rating.
