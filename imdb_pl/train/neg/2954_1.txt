I watch a lot of bad movies, a lot !!!!!! It's really a hobby. Almost every Saturday I make friends with a group of friends and meet and see litter from around the world - Whatever. Turkish movies about superheroes, movies with vampires from Brazil, Italian films with gorilla transplants, Kevin Costner films, ANYTHING (maybe with the exception of Raising Helen), but I have never seen a movie WORST than THEODORE REX. Never. And it's not even fun bad in the style of Ed Wood - just SUCKS. Now this movie was famous in Hollywood when it was made, because Whoopi took off her gloves and explained to the press and anyone who would like to hear that HATE THIS PIECE = tried to get out of the contract, she moaned, moaned, but still pour her thick ass in this leather skin, a tightly futuristic uniform of a policeman who is awful to see, drives !!!! And you just see him boiling over the shots - he's doing everything, but he's not looking for a camera for his agent so she can scream at him. The dinosaur has about three facial expressions, and the script is so horrible that a third grade class can do a better job if it promises cookies.
