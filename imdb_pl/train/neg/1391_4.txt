Before the TV movie began, I had relatively low expectations. This is because it was created after the release of the last episode of the series and the disappearance of many originals from the series. There is no president Sheridan, Delenn, Lennier, Londo, Vira, G'kar or Lita. If you remember, in the second to the last episode of the series, all regular visitors except Zack, Vir and Captain Lockley left the B-5 permanently. Now they brought Garibaldi (who was not in the last B-5 movie) into the movie to join Zack, and the captain and doctor seem short and irrelevant. But because it has long since disappeared from the old chemistry, this film is already seriously handicapped. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of the Soul Hunters (Martin Sheen) who is being led to Babylon 5 in search of a sphere filled with souls that were stolen from the hidden magazine by an archaeologist (Ian McShane). There are a lot of scary mumbo-jumbo, but to be honest, it was all stupid and pointless. Yes, yes, the station almost exploded, but it was saved and everything, but to be honest, I felt like it was an accident "I did it - and I did it much better in the past". <br /> <br /> The second story, more conducive to comic relief, was much more interesting because the entrepreneur installed a holo-brothel, and those who were in command were not sure what to do about it, and when they tried to exert on them pressure to shut up, they were slapped with a lawsuit. It was fluffy, but it provided a bit of laughter - something that was missing from another grim story. <br /> <br /> Incidentally, Sheen did a good job at first by playing the Potter - with his wild eyes and bizarre supplies. However, many times in the entire episode fell out of character. This should be noticed and corrected. <br /> <br /> So the final verdict concerns only the total B-5 nuts (like me). Others saw that he might suppose that the series was sucked - which is a great injustice. This is a great example of a show that does not know when to finish.
