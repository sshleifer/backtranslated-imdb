Apart from slasher films from the 1970s and 1980s, those about walking corpses were probably the second most popular subspecies of horrors. While the more modest movies had "Black Christmas" and "Halloween" to make it all started, the zombie movies had "Dead" George Romero movies. And it is not surprising that soon after the success of the first two in the series, other directors wanted to earn. Many Italian directors were particularly interested, such as Lucio Fulci, who brought us "Zombie" a year after "Dawn of the Dead" Romero, known as "Zombi" in Italy and some other countries, and there the Fulci movie was known as "Zombie" 2 ". In addition to walking corpses, this is not a Romero movie, but it is a good movie. It was a big success in Europe and nine years later a sequel was born. <br /> <br /> Pros: lots of beautiful, lush scenery. Fantastic result. Acting is not entirely good, but the cast is a game and seems to enjoy this experience. After a slow start, the tempo changes the same as in the case of the action move. A lot of cheese and unintentional merriment for bad movie lovers. Good job with make-up effects. Lots of blood and some decent blood. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: Virtually less plots. Nothing you have not seen before. Glaringly tearing apart some of the first films of "Return of the Living Dead." Cardboard characters. He did not get too old due to bad rock music from the 80s (Not that I say that all rock music from that period is bad), clothing and general atmosphere of the film. <br /> <br /> Recent thoughts: First of all, this is not a true continuation of the cult classic Fulci. Actually, I do not know if it ever was to postpone the movie. For those who do not know, Fulci fell ill during production, and finished and was replaced by Bruno Mattei. Mattei's films are quite fun, but like in this film, many of them are fun at the campsite. And that's all what the movie really is, just something to watch for fun. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 5 (Yes-bad-it-good rating) 2/5 (Very serious)
