It was so bad that I turned off the DVD ... maybe half. It was so weak that I could not even give enough attention to say how far I had gone. Although I really wanted to believe that the description of the young Carlito would be slightly different, I simply could not buy it. I really do not blame the actors, because I think it was a script that could fall. I noticed I was laughing a few times, but I do not think these lines were fun. <br /> <br /> The only advantage is that I bought it in a set of 2 DVDs and I would pay the price I made for the original. This is one of those cases where they should let the classic stand alone.
