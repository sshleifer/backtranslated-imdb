You know you're in trouble when John Cassavetes is working at half speed instead of full pass in the movie, and "The Incubus" is a terrible, worst scenario in which the big actor goes through the movements to pay the bills. Actually, watching the scenario of Hammy and the "baroque" direction of John Hough's art, it's hard to blame him. The movie has something to do with a series of rape murders that take place in a small town with a lot of supernatural confusion. Somehow the direction succeeds in sucking up the tension and interest from each scene, and Cassavetes seems clearly PO 'ed sometimes. Inkub himself, who does not appear until the last scene, is a well-made work, but it is not worth waiting for. <br /> <br /> 1/10
