This 30-minute documentary Bu単uel made in the early thirties of one of the poorest regions of Spain is, in my opinion, one of his weakest films. First of all, let's admit that, 70 years later, Spain is much richer than it was then (and when I say this, I fully admit that wealth can bring its own problems, such as excessive individualism and consumerism, although in wealth it is a far better condition than extreme poverty presented here). And if poverty subsided in Spain, it was not exactly with the socialism that Bu単uel preferred, but with Western European capitalism. But one of the most shocking things in the movie is that in one scene, the narrator says that at school, children learn the value of Pi. Teaching math for poor people, horror! Bu単uela's short-sightedness is the most glaring here, not realizing that access to the latest knowledge and technology will help the poor to overcome their situation. What does he propose? That children learn exactly what at school? Does Bu単uel not understand that the lack of modern technologies has made them weak compared to other people?
