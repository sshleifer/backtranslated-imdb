Very bad acting and a very shallow story. Even a decent movie B <br /> <br /> The events that were supposed to be shocking like people on alien spaceship were boring and very bad. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst. science fiction I've ever seen. I saw 5.0 stars and decided to watch it because I like this genre, but it's so badly sucked. <br /> <br /> Now there are really few good movies in the topic of ALIEN, I think that because most of them have a low budget <br /> <br /> I give it 3/10
