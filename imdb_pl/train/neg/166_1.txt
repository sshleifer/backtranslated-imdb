First of all, I did not sit down to watch the premiere of the "Star Trek" series to see a cowboy flying in space. this is how the normal section of the Enterprise works <br /> <br /> 1 Archer finds a nebula or something and wants to take a closer look, but it can destroy the ship. <br /> <br /> 2 sends the shuttle to the nebula, and the shuttle gets damaged ... <br /> <br /> in all episodes I've seen, all the problems take place because of the stupid Archera bug. Oh, did you see the preview of one episode showing the kissing of Archer and T'pol?!?!?!?!?!?!? I planned to watch this episode, but then I completely gave up the Enterprise and immediately turned to TV. Come on!!!! This is a trek star !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> Also what was with the banana snail? In one episode, Hoshi had a banana snail, but he had to leave him for some stupid reason. Well, a little stupid to bring your pet into space, but whatever. Okay, I thought so until they left him on the desert planet !!!!! A BANANA SLUG CAN NOT BE IN AN EMPTY !!!!!!!!!!!! How stupid are you writers <br /> <br /> In any way, just saying if Enterprise is on DO NOT WATCH IT !!!!!
