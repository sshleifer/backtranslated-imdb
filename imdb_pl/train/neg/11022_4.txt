In a way, Mister Foe (originally and more appropriately, titled Hallam Foe? I do not see him refer to his title character as "mister"), he is a tribute to good acting. Both Jamie Bell and Hallam, physically attractive voyeur / creep, as well as Sophia Myles, like Kate, his perverse partner in sex and fantasy affair, are convincing. The problem arises when you try to combine your roles with anything that happens in real life. A young man who follows the intimate details of people's lives in the way that Hallam does, would be deservedly beaten to a pulp. And a woman in Kate's situation would be repelled and terrified - she would probably call the police. <br /> <br /> These things are not what happens in the movie. Poor mother Hallama died, and his father married a woman with whom he had an affair. Hallam, of course, hates his stepmother and lets him know. He's having sex with him. Kate is an employed person who places Hallam in the works on dishwashing and plays sex games. He looks like his mother's birth. Everything ends happily thanks to Hallam "solving" his "problems". <br /> <br /> Forty-odd years ago, the spectacle and brilliantly played movie Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf had a similarly optimistic ending, and the characters became smarter and better after tearing themselves apart. The problem is that it does not always work that way, especially when nobody cares. In Virginia Woolf, the ending is credible because of the intensity of emotional revelation. In Mister Foe, emotional revelation never really happens.
