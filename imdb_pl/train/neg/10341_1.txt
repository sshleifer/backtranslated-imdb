I rented this movie from the library (hard to find for a reason) only out of curiosity. I am a big fan of Platha and this movie was a complete disappointment. The Bell Jar (1979) is definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The script is horrible, not because it deviates from the original text of the novel, but because it bypasses it without focus or intention. The scenes are poorly constructed and do not lead the viewer anywhere. What about the Plush's hokey voice? Lady Lazarus has little to do with the situation of Greenwood; Plath's poetry was completely abused. Marilyn Hassett is totally unbelievable, like Esther Greenwood (or any twenty-year-old on the subject), partly thanks to the cast (she was 32 when filming, Plath's age when she died), and partly because she can not act. Hassett is all emotions, no craftsmanship, no skills. The direction is mediocre; the director simply covers what is there, which is not much. The only reason I give movie 1 is that 0 is not an option. I'm sorry, Sylvia, you'll have to wait for someone else to adapt your great work to something more appropriate.
