If Todd Sheets had to go out and admit that this movie was intended to impersonate a zombie species, I would change my grade to eight. Try to imagine a movie in which every scene, line and even every nuance of acting was designed as a parody. Probably I could erase the alphabet soup, change what's left of the letters, and still have a better script. Two scenes come to my mind when I think about this film. SPOILER ALARM! One of them is when Mike's dad and other dad are walking, I repeat a jam walk with zombie-filled blocks. It is a small staircase, and even if it freshens up before the waving undead, nothing will happen to them. When they reach the end, the former sailor turns around and says "God, you're a horny bastard" and shoots only one. The second is in the military complex. The girl pokes a zombie with a machete and is immediately surrounded. The camera moves around her for about forty seconds while she is surrounded by zombies at your fingertips. Then he almost casually runs out of the crowd and joins other people. ALERT ABOUT A SPOILER! These scenes must be seen to be believed. Still, I like this movie just like almost any comedy because it's so damn funny. Recognition for Todd Sheets for winning so many people in his film and striving to do it really, but not for anything else.
