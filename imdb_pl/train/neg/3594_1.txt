This is not a horror film, but a boring erotic movie. A very bad movie that every serious fan of horror should avoid. No plot, terrible game and annoying music. If you just watch the trailer, you'll know enough ... It's a pity that such things are available on VHS or video, while there are many good movies inaccessible. If you like vampires, try Hammer Productions or the Italian Gothic Mario Bava and Antonio Margheriti. These are masterpieces, if you compare it with this trash. Score = even "1" is too much! And believe me, not only I have this opinion.
