I agree with the previous commentary, what a disappointment. I rented it, thinking it would be a good movie since Mira and Olivier were there. I was surprised by their performance, I was expecting more because they are good actors. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a slow start, but it got worse. I even laughed at some bad tricks !! when it's supposed to be a mysterious movie. You can even guess who is the killer earlier !!! <br /> <br /> Really what happened? <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to say, but do not even bother wasting time and money. <br /> <br /> Boring !!!
