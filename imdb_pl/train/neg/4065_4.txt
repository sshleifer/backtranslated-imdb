... by the like-minded antics of Eric Stanze. Not very talented, the director directed a not very good film, and yet I still sat in it with the final credits, if not to see what was going on. <br /> <br /> The Rapist escapes from prison and evokes his old flame. After catching her (even though she came willingly) and threatening her with having sex (another event she also wanted), she reveals that he kidnapped three men who had hurt her in the past. Then he decides to kill her (huh?), But he gets wrapped up and dies instead. The girl's mind breaks (or something like that) and takes out the rage because of the unhappy guys in the basement. <br /> <br /> All right, the magazine sucks: it is long, breathless, filled with ten-cent words and there is too much. <br /> <br /> Acting sucks: what a minute, what is playing? <br /> <br /> Filming sucks: home video is bad enough, but 20 minutes of cemetery recordings is just a damn insult. <br /> <br /> And the budget is a joke: take it ... "budget", it was a punchline. <br /> <br /> And yet there was something charming. In the 1970s, such films appeared in cinemas with real budgets and talent related to them, not today. If you want to watch this kind of brutal, sexually abusing junk (do not lie, some of us do), that's all you get now. <br /> <br /> Short sharp pictures in the sex scene, torture with feces, playing with axes, anal rape by a broom stick and a long shot of a crazy babe masturbating with the same broom stick are just some of the better items on the menu. <br /> <br /> This is not good and it will not be remembered, but since the glory days of Joe D'amato people have made such films. <br /> <br /> 4/10
