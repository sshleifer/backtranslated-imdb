It seems that "Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow" takes place in a pristine world, an era that was long gone, and the biggest sin that a kid could commit would be to oppose the law and get a ticket. It starts with a young motoring fanatic who is starting to be interested in his rival who forces her to the car race. That's it when it comes to drag-racing - this B-flick is mainly related to rock'n'roll, man! People from American International apparently liked decent, square teenagers who liked to have fun, but they did not bother decent. There are some funny double entenders and fruit exchanges (Necking Kid: "We thought we would go out into the fresh air" ... Dad: "Where do you think you'll find it, under her throat?"), But the ghost is a little late. Shortly after 65 minutes, the movie cheats us in the climactic car race, which actually takes place off screen and unmasking "Scooby Doo", which makes no sense. However, for lovers of nostalgia, some thoughtless fun. ** with ****
