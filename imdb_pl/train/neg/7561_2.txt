Anyone who did not know about the original British Lion movie from 1973, The Wicker Man, would no doubt leave the cinema with the impression of "Poor" and "Peurile". <br /> <br /> As an admirer of the original I remained impressed with Pure Poor. <br /> <br /> From the bleak reality of haggling toothed inbred lines drawing the power of law and order to a network of pagan barbarian ritual on a distant Scottish island called Summerisle (original) nearby Amazonian colony off the coast of Maine in the US, named Summersisle, remake almost does not hit the target. <br /> <br /> This is a rather sad case of the classic remake of "maybe" classics, which were manipulated to meet the needs of ordinary audience. NOTHING MORE AND NOTHING LESS. <br /> <br /> Gentlemen (or considering the re-context of the movie) Ladies involved ... hang their heads in shame.
