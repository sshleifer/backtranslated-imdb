This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen !!!! <br /> <br /> I can honestly say that I have never seen a movie worse than this !!! <br /> <br /> AND I CAN NEVER !!!! <br /> <br /> I am a BIG fan of "B" horror movies. As you can imagine .... I was exposed to some of the worst things that the film industry has to offer. <br /> <br /> I have been lured to his film by his title. I mean ... what a true horror fan would not be intrigued with the title "Vampires vs. Zombies "??? Images of "undead" fighting with each other for "undead" danced in my head. I thought to myself ... "I have to see" !!!! <br /> <br /> Well ... sorry to say ... "I would like to see it" !!!!! <br /> <br /> This movie title is at least misleading. There were no vampires fighting zombies. In fact, there is no storyline !!!! If you asked me what's going on in this movie, I can honestly say I have no idea !!! <br /> <br /> There was no storyline !!!! <br /> <br /> There was no history !!!! <br /> <br /> This movie absolutely does not make sense !!!! <br /> <br /> At the end of this defeat ... I feel sorry for the poor souls who have invested their money for this project, because they certainly have no business sense !!!
