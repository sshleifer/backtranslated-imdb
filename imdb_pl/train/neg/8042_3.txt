The secret is ... this movie is blowing. I'm sorry, but that's how it was. <br /> <br /> **** SPOILER **** <br /> <br /> In this bad riffie in I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER and SCREAM, Beth, played with admiration by Dorie Barton, joins to a few friends on Spring Break. The group rents a fancy house and tries to spend a pleasant holiday. Then death begins. First one, then the second, and then another friend is murdered, which leads to a sad and banal climax with predictable results. <br /> <br /> One remark, Dorie Barton is Reese Witherspoon of a poor man? He looks like Reese, he acts like Reese and can give Reese to the police lineup. Maybe they threw it like that? Decent pictures and honest acting would not keep up with bad dialogue and horrible writing.
