Why in the world would someone make this piece of a junk movie? The first two Zombie Bloodbath movies were silly enough, but it takes away the cake for the worst trilogy (perhaps all time). Todd Sheets is still a director, but he is no longer a screenwriter, which is neither negative nor positive, given that he is as devoid of talent as the guy who wrote the movie. The letter is too much dependent on the word f, which is used 200 to 300 times in nausea. Acting is almost like the other two Bloodbath movies, so naturally it's one of the worst I've ever seen. The special effects are better than the last 2, but they still look terrible. The plot became too complicated for its own good and it concerned a government experiment that went wrong and produced zombies. There are also cryogenically frozen zombies and school kids who can travel in time, leading to one of the most idiotic endings I've ever seen. After the movie goes to the exit, which is strange because the whole movie is the result. You see it just to laugh at it, because if you get into it with a serious mind, you can possibly kill yourself. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 95 minutes.
