"Chances" is a big mistake. You could know the director Emile Ardolino from "Dirty Dancing" and "Sister Act" and should expect something funny. But I must disappoint you. He made a really, very bad movie. <br /> <br /> According to the story, Christopher McDonald dies to burn himself as a child. The child grows Robert Downey Jr. and Jr returns to his former hometown, where he meets his old daughter, Mary Stuart Masterson (complicated, eh?). <br /> <br /> They fall in love with each other. Then comes the ex-wife of Jr, Cybill Shepherd, and Jr. also falls in love with her. I do not think I even have to mention that he loves Ryan O'Neil. <br /> <br /> In one of his first roles, Robert Downey Jr. is in the worst. He copies Michael J Fox. <br /> <br /> After "Moonlighting" Shepherd proves that it is not suitable for acting in movies. <br /> <br /> Besides, there is one thing that you can use in this hilarious as an antidote to insomnia.
