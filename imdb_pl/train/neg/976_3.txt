I'm generally more likely to think openly about roms than many, but it was not just a good test. This has nothing to do with the comparison with the British original - I have not seen it, and I doubt I will. It has a lot to do with the meandering story, the lack of chemistry between the leading and horrible performance / character of his supposed male advantage (Jimmy Fallon). <br /> <br /> Fallon enters the screen in clothes and the hairstyle of a fifteen-year-old and a working decade younger than that. He's supposed to be the teacher you see, and of course his well-known school districts around the world love to hire people who are less mature than the children they teach. The character is so disturbed and irrational that I have doubts whether any actor could make him sympathetic, but old reliability, such as John Cusack or Adam Sandler, could have been able to do so. Not Fallon, who is neither funny nor an actor, but it seems that he is both. Not once in the whole film you will believe Fallon in his role or you will believe that there is some way that these two people should or will be together. At the end of the movie there is a scene where Barrymore (who was sweet as usual but could not wear it himself - it's hard to have one person's affair) tells Fallon that this is over, too much has happened, and she is moving on. And instead of feeling bad on stage or apologizing for Fallon, you are actively encouraging her - after all, she does what she should have done a few months ago. But of course, the mechanics of the plot will not let it be the end (the end that could actually make a statement out of this mess), and instead we will see a rational girl who throws everything to pursue this childish idiot and encourage his illusions. This, of course, was supposed to be dark and satisfying, but in reality it made me more disgusted than anything else.
