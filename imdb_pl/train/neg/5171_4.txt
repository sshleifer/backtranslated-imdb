It's just a horror story about a nice suburban family dealing with the death of their parents and the "thing" in the basement that they still feed the people they take away from the street. Of course, there is more to it, but saying more would be said. <br /> <br /> It just did not happen to me because it tries to have two ways, both as a family drama and a horror movie. the film is trying very hard to pass the blade between these two genres, but it seems to stumble everywhere, trying to be shocking, something really is not. It does not help that the final revelation is less frightening and then "oh", as in "Oh, that's it?". Maybe if I had not seen so many horror movies lately, it could have been better, or it might have seemed that I would not have compared it with so much. <br /> <br /> I would take it
