First of all, I just want to say that I LOVE this concert !!! But this episode ... this episode mocks the entire series. <br /> <br /> I do not know what they tried to achieve in this episode, but they successfully created the worst episode in the whole series. <br /> <br /> There is no story, everything is chaotic, and jokes ..... are nonsense. <br /> <br /> The way they tried to answer the remaining questions in the game. ... For example, "how furry things look", creating this stupid "earlier ..." ...... is simply embarrassing. <br /> <br /> It is clear that writers are running from ideas and this is really bad.
