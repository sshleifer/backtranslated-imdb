I sat down to watch a documentary about Puerto Rico, and ended up watching a movie about Nuyoricans. When I go to Puerto Rico, I do not see 50% of people living in poverty. When I see people fighting, they are usually Haitians, Dominicans or Cubans who have recently arrived on the island. There is no such thing as spanglish ... or you speak Spanish or not ... and from what I've heard ... no. Pedro Albizo Campos is NOT an MLK for me. The MLK was a great man. Campos is a great man for those who want independence, which is 1%. To the rest as a locomotive as Osama Bin Laden. Puertorics who want independence are a group of fools. If you want to have proof for all those who dream about independent Puerto Rico, see Cuba, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Bahamas, all of South America and Central America and Mexico. It's miracles for them. This documentary is not about Puerto Rico, this documentary was about the Nuyoricans and their struggles. <br /> <br /> For a person who claimed that there was not enough in Africa ... it was supposed to be about Puerto Rico ... not Africa. Denzel will do one short for you. <br /> <br /> In conclusion ... for all these ignorant white people who think we need green cards to come to the USA, and we want to learn how the prime minister is leading the case, this is not a good document about Puertorican culture . Tell your children to pay attention to geography and the class of history. <br /> <br /> *** Update *** <br /> <br /> Bocabonita ... "doc." was about Nuyoricans. She promoted it as if we all felt so. He should have been titled ... "yo soy nuyorican ... lunches ... he can not speak Spanish." PLEASE STOP THE USE OF PUERTO RICO, RICANA, BORICUY, OR ANY SUITABLE LINK WITH NUYORIC HISTORIC LESSON. God forbid, they're playing on the island.
