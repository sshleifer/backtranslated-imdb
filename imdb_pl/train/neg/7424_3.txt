A very, very modest movie fee here with Stella Stevens receiving instructions from someone in disguise (it did not take long to guess who it was) in Old Nevada Town just outside of Vegas to get money at the Circus Circus Hotel in Las Vegas. Stevens runs his three-member group of girls and learns that they must act much faster than anticipated. Despite some shapely glances at Las Vegas in the '70s, a very average but credible acting game from the most involved, and a plot with potential, Las Vegas Lady puts one big boring egg. The movie seems to kick forever on the run, and when it does, it just splashes here and there and never really accelerates. I was a bit disappointed with this movie. Sure, I did not expect anything big, but at least I thought it could be one of those sleek 1970s operating movies or something like that. Not even close. Nobody dies. There is a poor shooting between creaky Stuart Whitman and offensive George DiCenzo, a year before his great performance as Prosecutor Buglios at Helter Skelter. The shooting has all the tension of watching the waterfall. There is one blow and one head hit by a blunt tool. Besides, nothing in terms of action. And as for the girls, do not expect too much. Stella and her girls (both very average and pretty talents, enter the sauna and bath.) What we see? Nothing but a passing side profile. Stella wears those pretty, open blouses emphasizing her true talents, but I would like her to be that way I could write one thing that would recommend this movie, but it was not like that and I have nothing to say in favor of this movie. It also has nothing to do with YAWN.
