There is a really good movie that lurks just under the surface of the layers on layers of "Pagemaster". <br /> <br /> I learned this when I watched it again this morning after neglecting it for years and years. I remember that I hated him with passion when it first came out, but this time I discovered that the special effects are quite good. The plot is simply "A Neverending Story" with creative endectomy, but it is a great little step for anyone who wants really amazing sweets. The animation is amazing, and I especially liked the way animators allow their characters to look and behave more surreal than normal. I give him class three, like me * I would give him two (just for the value of a parody), if I ever decided to watch this movie, expecting to completely dispel my mind.
