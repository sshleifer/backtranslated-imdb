I am a big fan of Stooges, but the only advantage of this movie is that Curley is in it. He did it long before he started to drink heavily, that's why he's his classic "me" (and Larry is not bad either). Moe's character is a simple part (mainly) and this movie would be better known as The Curley and Larry Movie. Not that one of Stooges' films was very good (in my opinion), but as one of the commentators said, it's sad that this movie had real potential. The cast was good, it was well-directed, filmed and edited, but the plot tried to talk about something serious, with only some tomfoolery and music numbers (which were probably good then). do it for yourself in this movie, if you really think it must be better than mowing the lawn and removing the basket (which is the subject of debate), waiting for Curley / Larry's scenes and sleeping or finding something in the kitchen to eat while the rest.
