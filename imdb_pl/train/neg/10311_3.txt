SPOILER ALERT In this general and forgotten action movie, Lorenzo Lamas plays his typical boy / nice boy, and his future real life with Kathleen Kinmont is an asshole digging a hot chick Alexa. OJ Simpson is a detective who has gone from his disappeared audience. Translation: cable TV filler. There is not enough skin to qualify as Guilty Pleasure. <br /> <br /> The script has a few holes. The best / worst moment: in one of the loud scenes, the partner OJ expresses his aversion to the morgue. OJ responds that some bodies are quite hot or words like that. This vague reference to necrophilia is sufficiently offensive; but in the light of the murders committed shortly after the release of this film, it is really frightening and therefore funny in an unintentional, horrible way. I was so surprised that I laughed until the champagne came out of my nose. Now THIS is guilty of pleasure. BC
