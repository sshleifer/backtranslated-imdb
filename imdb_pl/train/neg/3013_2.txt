Starting from the long opening of the endless row of production line workers at the Chinese factory, Manufactured Landscapes attempts to show the devastating impact of industrialization on the natural and traditional societies. His painful narrative assumes that industrial development in China and elsewhere is completely unprecedented, as if there has never been an industrial revolution in Europe and America, and Karl Marx never visited the British Museum. The fact that there may be a connection between modern Asian striving for industrialization and wealth, and previous experiences of hunger and terror, is never mentioned. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Edward Burtynsky's photographs of industrial waste are being tried as "beautiful". A significant part of the film is a slideshow of these images. They are well-made, have the size of a museum and apparently appeared on several exhibitions. However, for me they only show that almost every picture can be beautiful, if it is well presented. Industrial waste is still industrial waste. The relationship between the pictures and the uploaded video remains unclear. <br /> <br /> I do not want to suggest that there are no real and sometimes desperate problems when countries are growing industrialized. The produced landscapes, however, offer only a strange and bitter hopelessness. It's like a two-hour lecture by Noam Chomsky. Maybe it has some value as evidence of what is wrong with the American (and Canadian) Left.
