This movie is once again one of those movies that someone thinks or tries to convince others that they understand it. Anyone who tries to understand this is MORON! I would advise you to take TWO not one, but TWO hits of very strong acid and at least you'll get a visual thrill out of it! Although at the end you can kill yourself for wasting acid !!!! Since this comment requires 10 lines of information, let me write something for those who will try to defend the film. Incomprehensible. Garbage. Schitzoid. Loss of talent. The film is ice, with paper on the spot with the clouds calling, on a sunny dive in the pudding .... Sounds like a lion in a red light with the vision of hair. Now explain it to me !!!!
