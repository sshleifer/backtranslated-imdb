My friends and I went to this movie, not knowing what to expect, but hoping for the best. When we left, we were only a little more informed about what the plot of the film actually was. Although this is not the worst movie I've ever seen, I definitely do not recommend spending money to see it in cinemas. Maybe you want to hire a friend for you (it's not even worth the cost of renting) if you really want to see it. <br /> <br /> When the movie is so intricate that you have no idea what's going on until there's really little to say in defense in the last five minutes. Acting was decent, more than one would expect from this film, and some shots were good, but all this got bogged down in a lame story and a bad script. <br /> <br /> This movie was actually so bad that as soon as it got out, I went and bought a ticket to see a good movie to clear my mind. I recommend everyone to simply skip the first step and see a good movie instead.
