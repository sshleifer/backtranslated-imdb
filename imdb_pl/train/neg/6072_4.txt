DeNiro is a master ... one of my favorites. And I love GOOD sports movies (not so much in baseball, but hey, its sports movies, right?) I was expecting much more for this movie, it seems to be going well: DeNiro is what I expected, Snipes {I do not really like } Role of Barkin was OK for me, she is a good actress, but she seemed out of place in this role, for me it always seemed to hurry up with the scenes, and then it went on a little longer. Given the cast and the story, it could have been much better, I rated it as "4" and I was generous ~ I'm tough with numbers!
