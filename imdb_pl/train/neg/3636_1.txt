I am very open to foreign films and I like to think that I understand what they are trying to achieve, although some things are lost in translation. But the simplicity and "intelligence" of the film were boring. I often thought how interesting it would be to make a movie that shows a typical day or period that did not make sense. Now that I've seen such a movie, I will not think this way anymore. There are tons of society, racism and some desires ... but South Park has it. And when I watch South Park, it really makes me feel emotions. The next thing I felt during the thrill of this movie was the yawning I experienced after the first five minutes. I estimate a typical movie for seven or more, because I like every film the most. I gave this movie one.
