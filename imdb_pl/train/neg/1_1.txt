Robert DeNiro plays the most unbelievably intelligent illiterate of all time. This movie is such a wasting talent that it is really disgusting. The script is unbelievable. The dialog box is unreliable. Jane Fonda's character is a caricature, not funny. The film moves at a snail's pace, is photographed in a wrong way and is extremely instructive. He also connects every film in the book. Swoozie Kurtz is excellent in supporting role, but so what? <br /> <br /> Equally annoying is the new IMDB rule requiring ten lines for each review. When a movie is worthless, it does not require ten lines of text to let other readers know that it is a waste of time and tape. Avoid this movie.
