I do not think you can get much worse than this. Collect bad actors, false limbs and three stupid stories, and what will you get? This senseless excuse for the movie. <br /> <br /> The first story immediately shows bad video quality, and acting is simply pathetic, especially when you bring a 25-year-old pose as a grandmother usually grandmother's grandmother over ears. Besides, the man is okay, but the woman is rather ugly. "You look great!" NO! The werewolf in this one was the best of all three that I would say, but it still is not impressive because it was a bad costume. The woman's face was later decent enough for Halloween, but not for a werewolf movie. <br /> <br /> The more stories you survive, the worse. In the next two are two lesbians who are completely delayed in ridicule. The whole "I want to be a werewolf" "How could you do this to me ?!" I was stupid to say. You asked for it now, finish it! You will not even tell the werewolf ... he's a rat! <br /> <br /> The third one does not make sense ... almost forty-five minutes of running and boring narration create this story and the whole change still did not make it interesting. Boring! <br /> <br /> Music, yes, bad ... who could not even hear some parts, it was stupid. The animals had either rats or pigs, which was stupid. They could not use the sounds of a lion? Guess no, GOOD uses this. Well, I'm glad that B-rates are good for you. I have this movie because I'm a hardcore werewolf fan and I will buy EVERY WORLD movie and watch it more than once, but it's just me. If you prefer good, do not waste your money. I beg you!
