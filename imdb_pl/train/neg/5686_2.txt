Good day. This is my first review for every movie that I've seen. I did it to tell everyone that it's literally the most disgusting movie I've ever seen. It seems to me that the film was made very meticulously, which will give me some understanding due to the budget constraints associated with its implementation. I felt that I was watching a very bad movie remake. I agree, I also saw that it is very graphic, but I liked the movie. <br /> <br /> The scene in which he takes the hammer to the head of the bound victim on the chair is the most disturbing scene I have seen. the scene lasted almost forever, well, it was probably about 5 minutes, but still. I want to note that I like some horrors and I admit that they are good. this director, uoll boll, and his group of people who made this film should think about it before doing another similar one. one last note haha ​​!! FOR ALL PEOPLE WHO LOVE BEATIN ANIMALS TO DEATH, ALL ROT, WITH WOMEN AND CHILDREN AND FIVE MINUTE SCENE, EVERYONE GOT A HEATED HAMMER, and then you'll like this movie, and if you like horror, go to a movie with a higher budget, for example, saws. I can not believe that people actually do such films. Anyway, I apologize to anyone who loves the eve and took it to heart, it's just my opinion about the movie.
