Dubbing / translation in this film is simply funny and is the only entertainment in this otherwise boring and derivative zombie. I did not laugh as much in my life as I just watched Zombi 3 (and I saw some really bad dubbings in my life, believe me). Seriously, the filmmakers could re-edit the movie and release it as a comedy and earn millions of dollars. It's just fun. <br /> <br /> But ... If falling out of the couch laughing at dubbing in a zombie movie, Fulci is not your cup of tea, then AVOID IT IN EVERY COST.
