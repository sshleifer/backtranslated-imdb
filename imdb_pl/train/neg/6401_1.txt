Can I do this until I need glasses? at least proves that everyone can make a movie. Talent is not taken into account. People who unleashed this unfortunate pile of vomit in the world have no appearance of talent, taste or intelligence. Target group of recipients must consist of recently labotymized and babies who play with their own feces. Someone else would be too clever in the world to jump out of this movie. It consists of a series of sophisticated skits in which the punch does not even extend to the obvious. It ends unreasonably. Jokes are types of jokes that children from elementary school say (usually potty or sexually related), where they do not know the meaning of all the terms they use. You know, like the one about daddy's and mommy's garage. The use of any more stringent method of criticism would be pointless, because creative "minds" have never heard of the usual standards of acting, writing, and the like. for this mess. Not to judge, but anyone who liked this movie should seriously reflect on his goal on this earth. <br /> <br />
