I love Alec Guinness. That says a lot after this movie. Actually, he is not mad at it. It just seems to stand aside, be polite and ordinary, delightful, but invest. It is obvious that the girl she is dealing with has a feather weight, even as an inexperienced young French lady. Sir Alec would not have chosen her when he was young, and apparently he is not too happy about it. <br /> <br /> An interesting character is the angry brother of the strange "Suzanne". "Donald" aspires to the role of the French Heathcliffe and in vain I waited for the source of his mystery. What deep darkness was hiding behind this forehead? Was he in love with his father's lover? Why did he jerk at Suzanne's hair when she planned to collect different parts of this turkey on a country estate? Or maybe he just had enough of her nasty acting. <br /> <br /> The film would be charming with Guinin and the "older woman" who remembered and saw Paris together. That would be a great story! Two charming people experienced in a beautiful city after the destruction of World War II. Why did not someone come up with it? I suggest to watch Alec Guinness in the "Card", a little-known but valuable film.
