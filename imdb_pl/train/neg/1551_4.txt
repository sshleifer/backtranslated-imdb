Ladies Man is a funny movie. There is not much thought behind this, but what do you expect from the SNL movie? In fact, it is better than most SNL movies (eg Superstar or A Night At The Roxbury). Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell were very funny. Chris Parnell was also funny in his short scene (one of the funniest in the movie). Besides, the rest of the cast is mediocre and it is there that Meadows supports. I definitely saw more fun movies, but I also saw stupid ones. Again, this is not exactly a deep movie, but it's good for a few laughs. But it was funnier than in a skit. But still, if you're looking for a pretty funny movie, I recommend this one. Just do not think about it too much, or you can not stand it. <br /> <br /> Rating: 6/10
