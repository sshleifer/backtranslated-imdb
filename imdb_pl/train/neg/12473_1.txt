This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen, everything in it is weak and inconsistent. Acting is absurd, the costumes are even more fragile, and history does not exist. The "adventure poem" adventure sword and adventure movie aimed to capture the success of "Beastmaster" and "Conan", but does not give us any reason to go further. The main character is cool and dull, he can not even fight with the sword, and the sword comes from the sixteenth century. All action sequences are so slow and unrealistic, not to mention the castle and horribly outdated music playing on a horse. Do not even bother with this shit.
