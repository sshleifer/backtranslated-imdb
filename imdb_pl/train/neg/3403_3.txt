This movie should be fun. Young Lea Thompson, young Joaquin Phoenix ... and Terry O'Quinn. In the space. But it dragged on, had intolerable characters and had no target audience. Some children go to a space camp and accidentally get shot into space by their robot friend (named Jinx, respectively). The cosmic scenes are then long, repetitive (the same case happens twice) and either trashy or frightening depending on the point of view. Adults will be bored and delight, children can be scared because the way it's filmed really leaves an amazing sense. <br /> <br /> There's a budding romance, but unlike a shuttle - it never sticks out. Why is it included in the first place, it is unclear, maybe except for the additional tension between the characters - but it failed if that was the idea. <br /> <br /> Young Lea Thompson should be bizarre and attractive, right? I mean, "Back to the future" is great. But no, she was annoying and average looking. Not someone you would like to date, have as a friend, or even consider a model to follow. Joaquin Phoenix? He is really happy that he has ever appeared in movies again. Maybe he can act like Mikey's ads in Life Cereal, but he does not seem to know how to be a normal boy. It does not fit the screen and I do not think we can identify with it at home. Actually, I would be happier if he never came back to Earth. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie to anyone.
