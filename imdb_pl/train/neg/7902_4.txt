Sweet and fun, but cheesy and cheap. "Munchies" is another Gremlin clone that will come out of the 80's. I'm not a fan of imitation. <br /> <br /> First it was the perfect 'Gremlins'. <br /> <br /> Then came the very average 'Critters'. <br /> <br /> Do not forget about the bad 'Ghoulies'. <br /> <br /> But all the pits would have to go to 'Hobgoblins'. <br /> <br /> Is there anything more? <br /> <br /> Now for me "Munchies" would have to fall somewhere between "Ghoulies" and "Hobgoblins". I probably think it's more entertaining than "Ghoulies", but I preferred the more dark tone. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning he plays his stupid nature (which is better for him), but because of this character, Hammy's actress (Alix Elias and Charlie Phillips) may be rather bossy, that you would rather prefer just see munchies running in amok. That's where the fun comes. Mostly light fluff, because the story focuses mainly on munchies (who are either hungry, horny and destructive) in a whole series of alleged comical encounters (some moments work) in a small desert town, as several people are on the hunt. It's stupid, but strangely addictive thanks to impulsive stimulation. The creatures themselves look rather bland and poorly detailed, because they are basic dolls. Where their personalities come from, they can speak ... and with attitude. <br /> <br /> Charlie Stratton and the feisty Nadine Van der Velde (who was in "Critters") were honest tracks. Harvey Korman was acceptable in two roles. Robert Picardo also appears. <br /> <br /> Funny, low-quality entertainment for those less demanding.
