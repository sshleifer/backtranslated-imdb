Great actors. <br /> <br /> Poor script and not very good direction. My main problem was that I just did not care about any of these people. Not a killer, not a victim. Settings were quite gray. The figure of Dennis Quaid was so badly written that I did not even care when the end came. He regained his child. Great thing! I wanted to get my money back.
