In this brief, a city man and his wife have their strange life mutilated when a man is wearing his old mother's red suit. <br /> <br /> I watched it with the hope that I would see why it was done or why other reviewers found it to be fun. For me it was a total waste of time. <br /> <br /> Not everyone's taste is the same, but apparently not mine.
