I watched all four of Bo Derek's vehicles now directed by her husband, John; of course, everything is terrible, but they are certainly pits. Has a simple story plot, bad scripts? by the director, of course? and acting, not to mention the unreasonable nudity of the star, she deals with the loss of much older husband Anthony Quinn (accepts his suicide with a rifle, saying he always admired Hemingway !!), but who still appears and talks to her. In fact, he wants to go back to a different, younger body, but he really only does it in the last scene! Derek is beautiful as always and still plays naively (!) ?? especially during the tangled central part that the hired killer in the spa was pursuing. Quinn is also typically bigger than life (read: hammy), but it's easily his nadir; besides, most of the time, it works from behind a piece of shiny plastic (probably suggesting that it is in some abyss)! His "replacement" is therefore a handsome looking stud dog who has neither a bit of talent nor even personality. The cast also included the Hollywood veterans Don Murray (as Quinn's best friend and Bo business consultant) and Julie Newmar (as the guardian angel Quinn in the afterlife)? plus the startling appearance of billionaire Donald Trump (who probably needed it in his CV)! It is obvious that John Derek was his own cinematographer for the film, that the end credits are filled with useless (and simple) expressions of gratitude to many people who have given a helping hand and that SPIRITS CAN NOT MAKE the board at the Razzie Awards 1990!
