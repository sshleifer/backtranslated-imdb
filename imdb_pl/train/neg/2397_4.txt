Nicolas Roeg? He directed the classic supernatural thriller DON`T LOOK NOW NOW, no? Oddly enough, the movie was broadcast on BBC on the weekend, which during today's COLD HEAVEN show has not been conducive to what ever. <br /> <br /> You see that you can not not compare COLD HEAVEN with DON`T LOOK NOW, because they both have the same director and the same structure, and for the first third of COLD HEAVEN I thought that they have instead of a dead child replaced the same plot, with the exception of the dead husband, in fact my mind was focused on this film revolving around a grieving widow seeing her dead husband running around Venice in a red anorak. This does not happen, but about one third of the road during the race is a huge turn of action, and despite the fact that it is a fundamental turn of action, it is not explained at any depth. In COLD HEAVEN little has been explained, which destroys the film. <br /> <br /> People have mentioned the rather weak values ​​of COLD HEAVEN and it is impossible not to notice them. If I did not differ, I would think it's TVM, because it has the impression that it is on TV, up to white uppercase letters in the sequence of titles. Roeg also tries to introduce pretexts to the art of using the spoken thought processes, but it does not help the film at all. You can not help feeling Roeg, who should put all his effort into action twists that are completely flat on screen <br /> <br /> Cheap production values, disinterested directing and a really bizarre assumption and scenario make up a bad movie
