Ohhh man! I'm talking about it now! When it comes to bad and bad horror movies, this movie was really in its class. A real gem! <br /> <br /> First of all, the movie was not originally in English. Okay, because voice dubbed was really special! Here is my favorite fragment from the dialog (and where did it come from is much more)? "I feel a bit better. I'm just thirsty? DLA TWÃ“J KRWI! "<br /> <br /> And what a drama! Here is a summary of the interaction between the army and scientists? <br /> <br /> Scene 1 ?? Scientist: "Can not you do this? It will be a disaster! "- Military officer:" It's just science fiction "(then it causes a total disaster, as the scientist predicted). <br /> <br /> Scene 2? Scientist: "If you do, many people will die !!!" - Military officer: "you do not know what you're talking about." (he does this and many people die). <br /> <br /> Scene 3 ?? Scientist: "Do not do this? Kill everyone! "- Military officer:" It's nonsense "(then kills everyone) <br /> <br /> Scene 4, 5, 6, 7 ?? (You have an idea). <br /> <br /> If it was not enough ?? there were several scenes that really stood out as instant classics! In one scene, the army has literally 10 guys pointing at two unarmed people. The leader screams: "Go for no!" And all 10 soldiers of the army, one by one, drop their weapons and fight with two enemies! Instant classic! <br /> <br /> And do not worry. No attention was paid to details! This movie even had a hip-hop / optimistic soundtrack for the 80's synthesizer to set the mood! I realize that this review may contain several spoilers, but in this epic there are so many additions that I really scratched only the surface. This caliber film only appears once in a decade! A real experience when watching movies! Masterpiece! Wow!
