I expected a movie based on Grendel, a book written by John Gardner in the late seventies. It was based on Beowulf's epic, but told from the perspective of the monster. <br /> <br /> Whatever you think about Gardner's book, a movie based on Beowulf's epic should not be called Grendel, when he says nothing more about the monster except for a few pathetic scenes in which the CG monster is shown as a modified Predator. <br /> <br /> What's more, the authors should be punished for dropping the original story so badly and contributing to the continued, growing ignorance of mass television in the United States. <br /> <br /> Typical Hollywood to do it wrong. <br /> <br /> A very disappointing and complete waste of time.
