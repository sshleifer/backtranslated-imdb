Amelia and Michael are a marriage that betray each other. Amelia has a longtime lover in the hospital, and Michael employs a prostitute who does not satisfy him. Two smolders because of their infidelity, but in the end they manage to connect with each other. <br /> <br /> There is not much in this short summary. The direction is simple and dramatic, which is good, the acting is sincere, but the story leaves a bit to be desired. Why do we care for these two people exactly? It is a little difficult to see how this story is different from any other history of infidelity, except that it is much more reduced and does not look for meaning in it (nice change of pace, if anything). <br /> <br /> I do not know, it's possible that I do not connect with these stories because I have never experienced them. I noticed, however, that blocking these narratives is usually the same, i.e. the Couple talks to each other, avoiding eye contact, pretending to be immersed in magazines, etc. Nice things related to short films are that they provide a bit more space for trying something else and I would like to see a different shot. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
