Sitcom The "Gentlemen's League" tracks the lives of several bizarre people in the fictional village of Royston Vasey. Different scenes are connected to each other by their mutual setting. <br /> <br /> In the first series, the sketch, the main story is about the new road that will be built by Royston Vasey. As a consequence, more foreigners visit a small town. But Edward and Tubbs, the owners of the "local" store, which is actually far from the city, do not like foreigners. Whenever visitors enter their store, they kill him. In my opinion, some scenes are somewhat tasteless and are not funny, for example, when the couple consume two engineers who want to build a new road. Edward drums while Tubbs dances half-naked around the victims. <br /> <br /> In addition, Pauline lives in Royston Vasey. He works at the local Labor Center. Although Pauline hates people with whom she has to work, the woman does not want to lose her job. So when an unemployed man gets an interview as a fireman, he will not let him go because he is not ready for work yet. <br /> <br /> Then there is Barbara Dixton, a transsexual taxi driver who goes into great details about "her" sexual conversion. <br /> <br /> In addition, the vet, Mr. Chinnery, always kills animals instead of curing them. In one case he comes to the farm and is led to the living room, where the dog lies in his basket. The farmer goes outside. Assuming the dog is a sick animal, Mr. Chinnery kills him. A second later the farmer opens the door, holding the "real" sick animal, the sheep. <br /> <br /> The next inhabitants are the husband and his wife, who are visited by their nephew (by the way, his friend is killed by the store's owners.) The couple is very neat, for example they have towels in different colors. In addition, they have thousands of keys, marked with different colors and accurately classified. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the actors are playing very well.When playing women, the scenes become comical.The costumes are also suitable for the actors.T Tubbs is wearing a scarf and some crazy characters, such as Edward, have unappetizing black teeth, the show has a lot of dark humor, typical British.The set design reflects the mood of the series.The village and all the houses are gray and broken.There is often a fog around the local shop that strengthens the dangerous effect. Even the sign of the village is ominous: "Welcome to Royston Vasey. You will never leave." <br /> <br /> Though I think that the actors of the performance it's a great job, this type of show is not my taste.
