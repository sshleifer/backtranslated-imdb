Description: Corny, completely stupid and worthless. It's so cheap and bad that you'll wonder why these abnormally stupid people have wasted up to two months to spend a budget (I'm guessing ...) probably no more than $ 700 to make this movie. Watching with or without the Mystery Science Theater was simply hysterical. I give you the best advice in the world: <br /> <br /> Save yourself, save time, life and money, NO - I repeat, I DO NOT even consider if you should see this movie. This movie is so banal that your face will turn into a purple of outrageous boredom. If you have a one-digit IQ, then be my guest and watch this absolutely vile movie. You can admire it. (As I said earlier, IF you have a one-digit IQ) <br /> <br /> With about 12 own actors, some dolls that you bought in the garage, and of course, with cameras and music you will do a bit more fun home video than this piece of absolute nonsense .
