Think about the "stage play". It's worth seeing once at the performances of Lionel Atwill and Dwight Frye. Prepare Melvyna DOuglas in "Ghost Story" with Melvyn DOuglas of this movie. Are there loose vampires in this "Bavarian" village or is there a more natural, albeit equally sinister explanation? Dwight Frye is Herman, a red herring that is planted as a particularly moronic character. It's nice to look at his different mimics in a form that is really actionable. For a long time, little is happening, but we discover that the real murderer is a doctor who smokes Atwilla. There is too much "comical relief", but this is paradoxical to the course in this era. Fay Wray looks really good.
