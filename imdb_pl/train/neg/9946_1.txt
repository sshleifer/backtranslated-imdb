HERE SPOILERS <br /> <br /> My high school did everything in their power to motivate us for exams. But the most memorable method we used to put us in the state of mind was a talking guy who was none other than the favorite son of Australian Kickboxing, Stan "The Man" Longinidis. The first mistake they made was to give this guy a microphone because he was screaming for half the time, even though we were sitting no more than 3 or 4 feet away from him. Now his speech was full of ordinary "if you can not prepare and then prepare for failure," but there were different instances when I really developed. The guy stood before us, proclaiming how he did everything for himself and anyone else all his life. In the past, he was offered a lot of offers to give up kick-boxing, but he never got away from the reward of becoming the biggest kick-boxer in Australia. He said he was not being sold off, he was happy and retired, he was never involved in any other activity except Kickboxing? then he connected his movie. Yes, you heard it, it turned on your new movie. When he talked about it, he persuaded the woman to come in and pick up a poster advertising it, and then he showed this shitty 4-minute clip of that wicked movie called "Trojan Warrior". (That's all before he was defeated by Gurkan Ozkana in his final fight for a career) <br /> <br /> A game of Ajaks, a former agent of special forces, who is dragged into the dingy underworld of Melbourne. Ajaksa's cousin, Theo (Arthur Angel), has recently sold (well, at least Stan has not moved too far from EVERYTHING) to federal, and as a result, he is running away from all crimes of organized crime. Ajax and Theo fall into various absurd situations, ranging from fighting in a kebab shop to pretending playboys at a bondage party. It's all quite ridiculous, but if Silverstein was going to create a reliable movie here, this man should never be put back into the camera again. <br /> <br /> I must admit that I was really pumped to see it. I love action movies, even if they are kitschy, and especially if they're embedded in my own backyard. But what was presented to me is a film with an actor who was terrifying with the word "go" and continued it after the words "out of love for God, please, stop it!", Thematic themes were introduced, and they were not even touched after they went out into the open, the characters were simply thrown in for no reason, and the most choreographic fighting scenes that did not even reflect Stan's real talent in Kickboxing. The cast consisted of useless episodic performances of almost every famous REMOTELA (Dermot Brereton, Mark "Chopper" Read and Greg Matthews). You're sitting there all the time and you're playing guessing who's standing in the background. It is a pity that the film is largely based on the performances of former stars in fractions of a second. Do you remember the holes I told you about? Ajax was apparently shut down once, wrongly accused of murdering his wife. Now we hear that Ajax was in special forces through ONE single sentence in the WHOLE movie, and then left him in error. The following SINGLE statement follows, which convinces Ajax to help the same people who unlawfully closed it. Then, finally, Ajax was revealed that his wife was not actually dead, but she was sold to prostitution. Do we see her? No. Does Ajax go to find her when she hears? No. Now THIS is marriage! <br /> <br /> Amid all this annoyingly childish nonsense, on some websites this movie was described as "the intersection of Jackie Chan and Guy Ritchie ??". Has this man ever sat down and watched Jackie Chan's movie ?! Does Chan show more agility, taking a stack than Stan did? And Guy Ritchie is the crime film of the Messiah and you compare him to Salika Silverstein !? This movie is more like the mix of "Pizza" and "Enter The Ninja." <br /> <br /> And where does the whole "Trojan Warrior" title come from? Fierce Ajax martial skills, such as the ancient Greek warrior? No. Unifying gangsters to find Theo, just like the Trojan Empire? No, that's why? wait for it ?? Theo has a condom with him. Yes, that's right, because THEO is ALWAYS PREPARED with Trojan BRAND RUBBER in his pocket, he is Trojan THE WARRIOR! <br /> <br /> I was dissatisfied with watching "Trojan Warrior" on DVD, as well as its "special" functions: <br /> <br /> ?? Music video for the song "Chop Chop" rap rap Mark "Chopper". Read: Chopper did it only to prove that EVERYONE can rap. The funny thing was that Chopper just raped for 30 seconds, then he tossed them to two teenagers from Doncaster, using words like "dis" and "dope" etc. In their Australian accents. Face people, rap has been developed in the States, LEAVE THIS! The clip looked like something that the 31 Channel 31 cameraman combined into ecstasy. <br /> <br /> ?? Bloopers: There was no real difference between them and the real movie. <br /> <br /> ?? Status of "The Man" Longinidis Kickboxing Featurette: It was not so bad, considering that it was only 6 or 7 different battles shown from different angles (I think I saw Dennis Alexio over 15 times in 3 minutes). <Br /> <br /> I do not want to say that this movie contributes to the fact that this country goes to hell when it comes to film, but ... oh, wait, that's what I did. My advice to anyone who reads it is to go out and buy 4 or 5 copies of "Trojan Warrior", stick them together and use the paperweight because this movie is so damn bad.
