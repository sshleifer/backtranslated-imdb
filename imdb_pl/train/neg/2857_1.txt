I've seen a lot of original Sci-Fi Channel movies since I started watching them in 2002 (My first one was Sabretooth - which I think is one of the more entertaining features of the Sci-Fi channel). Their quality varies. Some of them are mediocre, but decent (Sabretooth, Dragon Fighter, Never Cry Werewolf, Swamp Devil), some are ridiculously bad, and then there are some that are really terrible. Raptor Planet lies in the latter. <br /> <br /> Raptor Planet, a loose continuation of the original game Raptor Island from 2004, is a barely observed movie mess with really awful acting and a lazy scenario. The effects that enliven dinosaurs (a combination of puppetry and animatronics, as well as CGI and footage from the Raptor Planet) are some of the worst effects I've seen in a low budget movie. The gore effects are even unconvincing. <br /> <br /> The plot includes a group of commandos who for some reason (I forgot why) travel to the planet of alien dinosaurs. That's right, dinosaurs are aliens. Dinosaurs in space. What's next, sharks in space?!? The rest of the plot is simple. The human cast is picked and eaten. Until now, we have expected this in numerous films and novels about dinosaurs that have been released, but this is the first movie of the deadly dinosaurs I've seen in which all dinosaur attacks have bored me. /> However, there are a few chuckles. There is one scene that stands out when the man is fooled by Carnotaura (animated by the film material from the original movie), which later becomes a giant predator. Besides, a bit of curiosity, it's a scene in which Steven Baur spins his own death scene from the first movie. <br /> <br /> While Raptor Island was not a good movie at the beginning, it's a masterpiece compared to its continuation. <br /> <br /> Believe me when I say it's probably the worst Syfy movie ever to be seen. It's damn unbearable.
