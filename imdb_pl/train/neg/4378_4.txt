Given the title and the bizarre box art, I was ready for anything. Perhaps my expectations were a bit too high because I was a bit dry. <br /> <br /> A film crew working on a soft core erotic film goes to a strange house when they get lost in the fog and decide that the best way to spend the evening is having sex. Where was the set not used before? The difference is that sex is perverse. It is not allowed to show all the goods (photos in the groin were for a long time illegal in Japan, what was shown is fogged up), the film tries to show the viewer how unnatural sex can be. <br /> <br /> In the midst of all perverse activities, there is a mud monster (whose origin I can not comprehend) and begins to murder men and rape women ... then also murder them. Some of the monuments are a bit too much, especially a woman having her intestines stretched out by the vagina or another woman spitting sips ... things, but otherwise the blood is quite a standard dish. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the movie is downloaded by your own projects; it's too sexy to be an image of a horror strait and too macabre to act like sex. Media can work, but you need to keep your balance. <br /> <br /> 4/10
