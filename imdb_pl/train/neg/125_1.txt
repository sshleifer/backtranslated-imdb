If only to avoid this type of film in the future. This movie is interesting as an experiment, but it does not tell a convincing story. <br /> <br /> One would feel virtuous, sitting on it, because he touches so many IMPORTANT issues, but he does it without any visible motive. The viewer leaves without any new prospects (unless someone invents one, while the mind wanders, as it always will be done in this senseless movie). <br /> <br /> You can better spend your time staring at the growing tree window. <br /> <br />
