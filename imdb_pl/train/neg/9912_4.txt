I agree completely with another reviewer who was satisfied with the "For The Birds" award, which won an Oscar in 2002 for "Best Animated Short", and not from this sick material that is pretentious at best and speaks to anyone who of course, there is no faith in heaven or hell. <br /> <br /> The animation was good, but many animated short films. By the way, I love the dark humor, but it was just unattractive from the very beginning. <br /> <br /> Regarding the story: a guy walking and surrounded by nothing but gray (the symbolism here) is told by the TV (which appears every few hundred meters away) that he is in heaven, hell or purgatory. Every time he hears the news, he puts the gun to him and shoots him. I think it would be fun in two of three cases.
