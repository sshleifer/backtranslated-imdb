Shame really - I rarely watch a movie and at the end I feel disappointed. I saw a lot of Ira Levin's adaptations - "Rosemary's Baby" and "The Stepford Wives" - and I liked them, but I did not like them. <br /> <br /> When I read the outline of the story - the award-winning playwright (Michael Caine) decides to murder one of his former students (Christopher Reeve) and directed his script for his own success - I was excited. I like thrillers, Michael Caine is a good actor, Sidney Lumet is a good director, and Iry Levin's work is generally good. <br /> <br /> I will not spoil it to anyone who has not seen it yet, but let's all say there are LOADS of turns and turns. There are so many difficult to explain in detail the plot of the film without giving it away. I liked the first ... 45 minutes before the twists and turns began to appear, and at this point my interest and pleasure began to fade. Although I must confess to Lumet the very funny ending that made me laugh. <br /> <br /> The main cast - Michael Caine, Christopher Reeve, Dyan Cannon and Irene Worth - all were great in their roles. Though Worth's fake Russian accent took on some nerves (nothing personal Irene, I think any actor's false accent would irritate me). I'm not sure if Cannon's character was going to be annoyingly funny, but Dyan managed to get upset and amused - at the same time. <br /> <br /> Anyone who reads this - I do not want you to be discouraged to watch it, because my views - give him a chance, maybe you'll like it, maybe not. It's about opinion.
