Almost every detail of the story in this movie is illogical and unbelievable. There is no semblance of true human history, dead and boring. It's Hollywood parody, with trumpet music pieces that resemble Denzel Washington's film, shaky camera shots and focus, racist stereotypes, absolutely unnecessary and comical shots and gestures of famous people in clothing catalog items. It was created to meet the needs of many zombies whose sense of life results from viewing the names of the stars. The only good thing about the movie are the final credits and funky that accompany it. I feel like an idiot for watching this, save yourself.
