When I watch a movie, I realize that it is "only a movie", but I still like to allow myself to get as much as possible in these circumstances. I think that's what makes us weep, we cry, laugh or otherwise react emotionally as members of the audience, although deep down we know that it is "just a movie". I do not want the film to remind me that it's just a movie, so I can not slip into the above-mentioned origin, regardless of the quality of the film. The director of this film often decided to use many camera shots simultaneously on the screen. Maybe it's just me, but I think it's terribly distracting and even annoying. They may as well display a continuous banner at the bottom of the screen, "Note: it's just a movie. Do not let too much interest or be absorbed. " If I want "picture in picture", I activate it from the TV remote control, but never during the movie I want to watch.
