In the third entry in the Phantasm series, Mike and Reggie continue to chase Tall Man, supported by a 9-year-old lucky trigger, black G.I. Jane and the ghost of the late brother Mike (he died in the original Fantasia). Number 3 is a rather disappointing continuation because the gore and black comedy is far less inspired and exciting than in Phantasm II. I have the impression that stress has simply been put on Reggie's incompetence as a lover and his talent as a comedian. The humor of the previous movie was much more dry and oppressed, which fits better with this story. Also the settings are not so gruesome here, and the constant presence of Tall Man (Agnus Schrim) is not so obvious? There are still a lot of gore, but not half as satisfying. By the way, beware of the seriously cut version, because it shows the most delightful killings off the screen. The entire Phantasm series is a lifelong achievement of Don Coscarelli, who has written and directed 4 episodes so far - the fifth in production. The first of them is a half-cult classic, the second is a festival of horror and violence, and the rest can be easily overlooked. A. Michael Baldwin returns as Mike, although James LeGros presented his character much better in Phantasm II.
