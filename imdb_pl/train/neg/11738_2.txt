"Iowa" wants to be "Requiem for a Dream" for the Met Midwest, but it turns out to be a hard "R Reefer Madness". <br /> <br /> Yes, drugs are bad, and meta is terribly harmful, as addiction and how it destroys people, families and communities. But those heroes who are either stupid or ridiculous, and the intriguing story does not teach anyone this lesson. <br /> <br /> While the screenwriter / director / star Matt Farnsworth has charisma on the screen, his partner Diane Foster plays an incredibly silly, wide-eyed, innocent, rotten drug that has already been satirized by Susan Sarandon in " The Rocky Horror Picture Show "I really felt sorry for all the unnecessary nudity that she was defeated by. It was only at the end of the movie that I realized that I should think that these two were high school graduates to explain some of their naivety, because we are bombarded with their school photos, but if they did, they even looked older than the people from "The OC." Although they have good chemistry on the screen, they are a fake imitation of the Badlands pair. <br /> <br /> Celebrity stars are badly used. Michael T. Weiss, who was so good at TV The Pretender, is completely ridiculous as a corrupt officer on Conditional releases, and his brutal violence is simply crazy because his character largely destroys the social meaning of the film. Rosanna Arquette must be even more carefree than she did after David Cronenberg as a very low rent Livia Soprano. John Savage must even say old demographic booms that I made a pot, but this is worse. A gothic chick appears, with a strange explanation that he is a stripper from Des Moines. Is there a compulsory Latin drug dealer in Iowa? <br /> <br /> With a limited budget, the view of the use met is presented rather lively, with rather terrifying hallucinations. We certainly see them going crazy. <br /> <br /> While the locations in Iowa are used very well (including the funny scene of a propane gas attack), the accents and references to the church are misleading Southern Baptists. The guns seem to be used by law-abiding and breaking citizens' rights more than in any internal drug cinema. <br /> <br /> The songs of Greg Brown's most-renowned bard Iowa are used throughout, but strangely, they are not mentioned in credits. I hope they have been used with permission. <br /> <br /> I caught it on a commercial show in New York because I missed it at the Tribeca Film Festival, where it became a significant - and inexplicable - buzz.
