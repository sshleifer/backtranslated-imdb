This is the worst sequel in the world of movies. Once again, it fails. The killer is still killing for fun. But this time it kills people who make a film about what happened in the first movie. Which means it's the stupidest movie in history. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this. If you value one precious hour during this movie, do not watch it. You will want to ask the director and the person next to you, which forced him. Because it simply does not combine the original brands of horror, action and crime. <br /> <br /> Do not let your children watch it. A teenager, a young child or a young adult, this movie has such an impact on people.
