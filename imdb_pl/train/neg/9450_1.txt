Spend your time in a different way, even housework is better than this movie. Jokes are not funny, there are no fun rhymes that are Dr. Seus. A very bad way to waste an evening. My children, 4-16 years old, laughed a bit at the beginning, the younger got bored and went to play Barbies, and the elders left to play ps2 and surf the net. My wife left and made dishes. I finished it myself. It was the worst movie for children I've ever seen. If you want to watch a funny movie for children Shrek 2, this movie is fun for children and their parents. AVOID THIS FILM. It's not funny, it's not cute, cat makeup is the only good thing in it and you can see it on the disc label.
