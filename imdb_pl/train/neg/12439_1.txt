The first "Home Alone" was one of the funniest films of the 90s. The second one was just as funny with the same cast and jokes! Now comes "Home Alone 3". I was curious to see how they could continue the same story, considering that Kevin would be 17 years old until 1997. So what does the director do? He takes the child just as annoying and makes him sick. The kid is 6 years old and his mother leaves him alone at home? What band of burgerlers are you idiots? I really do not want to go into details if you want to see this movie, unfortunately. But please, I would advise you to stay away from him. It is not worth your precious time. Fold a piece of paper, do housework, balance the pencil on the nose or take a nap! It is better then to watch "Home Alone 3"! <br /> <br /> 1/10
