No wonder this movie never saw the light of day. The moment of the release was terrible. The Gong Show has already "jumped a shark" before the movie was released, so who would pay the money just to see some censored clips from the original series? Showcases are just a little of this mournful 90-minute groaning of Chuck Barris about how hard his life was to host the program. Did he really expect us to sympathize with him and his confused millionaire's life? Did he really think that we wanted to KNOW about his life? (Of course, because later he wrote his strange autobiography about his career as a CIA agent.) Did he think that the gag of having everyone, everywhere the hearing for him would stay fresh for 90 minutes? Or a network director chasing him every step of the way? This could have acted as the plot of the 30-minute episode of the series, but not as a full-length feature. It was nice to see Rip Taylor again, Gene Gene and Unknown comic (although to make the film "spicy", it contained only its most vulgar procedures). And as someone else has pointed out, this is the first significant part of Phil Hartman's movie (though it only lasts a minute). Note that his name is written HARTMANN in the subtitles with which he was born. You can not miss his voice and face, although he is much thinner and younger than in the days of SNL. Ed Molinaro (Hill Street Blues) also has a small part; one of his first after leaving the world of soap.
