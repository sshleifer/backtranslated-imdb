I really like Christopher Lee, but that did not match his other performances ... and he was one of the better actors. <br /> <br /> The movie does not meet its assumption. It's not so scary, it's too melodramatic, and it's draaaaaags. Every time I thought, "Oh, TU, a good part comes," a good part has never come to an end. <br /> <br /> The bad guys are not convincing at all. Most of the other characters were not in-depth either. <br /> <br /> Maybe if I was in a good mood, I could enjoy some MST at the cost of the movie, but ... Naaahhh ... It really did not seem worth the effort. It was not very good, it was not really bad, it was just mediocre.
