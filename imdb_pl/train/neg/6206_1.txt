Thomas Clay mixes with the wrong types. This is a problem with young people nowadays, they have no respect. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this movie should be avoided at all costs. The action in the main part of the film is slow, quite heavy and embarrassed by the crazed drug ending, as if, like his director, there is nowhere better to go. We are introduced to the main title character, who is a bit of an outsider, we see him at school and at home, who does not fit together, feeling uncomfortable in himself, like many teenagers. Robert falls into bad guys and starts failing at school and taking drugs, and before you know it, he is a psychologist rapist. <br /> <br /> The film is really about Clay's total failure in understanding the links between the images of violence and acts of violence. Clay seems to think that a generation of crazy youth is angry through the war scene on our TVs. nevertheless, he filmed the most disgusting piece of SIMULFUL violence. Is this guy real? <br /> <br /> If Clay has not seen YouTube, maybe he is naive and unaware that he will do it with the brutal climax of his movie? Everything he wants to see is the most hideous scene from the end of the movie and I'm sure what will happen to people. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie makes no sense in committing such an act of violence in the film. Clay not only curses young people who are actively involved in the prevention of war, but also condemns themselves as the perpetrator of extreme, tasteless violence without a better reason than his personal star status. <br /> <br /> He is ashamed of everyone.
