The last post here, by a woman claiming to have a military background, included the commentary "Women's life is not more valuable than a man's life". <br /> <br /> This politically correct mantra is not true as history, as well as a biology show. The communities have managed to recover from the severe losses of their male population, sometimes with amazing speed. The Germans were ready to fight in the next war in 1939. Despite the war of 1914-1918, which killed over two million of its people. In the war of the threefold alliance in South America (1865), Paraguay encompassed three neighboring countries until practically all of its male population was erased, but it fought against the impasse in the Chaco war in 1932 with much greater Bolivia. No society, however, could survive the loss of the female population. Only when the life of the nation is threatened, women are sent to fight. Israel faced this situation in 1948, but since then has never considered Coed combat units as its Defense Forces despite the popular image of an Israeli soldier girl. <br /> <br /> "G.I. Jane "is Hollywood fluff.
