There is one big moment in * Surviving Christmas, * which almost makes him worthy of pain: James Gandolfini breaks the shovel on Ben Affleck's stupid head. <br /> <br /> This movie serves as another unfortunate example of James Gandolfini, who proves what a great actor who simultaneously destroys his career playing in this film. <br /> <br /> A young and rich advertising performer, Drew Latham (Ben Affleck), is inclined to never be alone during Christmas. (And from the very beginning there is a problem with our suspension of disbelief in this idiotic movie: how many people from Drew's social position, in 2004, I really care in one way or another, whether Christmas is issued alone or with half the family or Storyline discovers that Drew buys a family to spend Christmas with her, provided that they pretend to be his own, ignoring all the opposite indications that his money did not buy the emotions he was looking for. <br /> <br /> For $ 250,000, a surly suburban truck driver, Tom Valco (James Gandolfini), and his disheveled wife, Christine (Catherine O'Hara), agree to be an ad hoc family against Drew, their son, Brian (very one-dimensional Josh Zuckerman) and daughter, Alicia (very soft Christina Applegate). Drew spends the rest of the movie allegedly regaining his youth or something. The news in this film is just as distorted and illogical as its dry story. Drew overwhelmed by overt psychosis draws a false smile on his face and blindly denies any malice he allegedly bought for the Valco family to avoid. <br /> <br /> What raises the question: if Drew pays these people to regain the appearance of happy family emotions, how must he be psychotic to pretend happiness among his spines and mental anguish over his presence? It is not that the Valco family hides their true feelings and pretends to be happy when around Drew - three of the four members make it obvious that they despise him. Is he so incredible that he can not see that his money does not buy him the "family" atmosphere he inculcated in believing he was the truth? As with all videos that are offensive, one may wonder how * four * screenwriters could get so caught up in their own narcissistic dreams of appearing in the sequence of subtitles that they will overlook all appearances of credibility or intelligence. <br /> <br /> Director Mike Mitchell, who was responsible for * Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo * - he stopped there. "Nuff said. <br/> <br /> Gandolfini and O'Hara somehow manage to shine, proving their peace among this mess. Christina Applegate is slender and slender, blond and fiery in all the right places, cutting Drew sharply into small pieces of the carcass throughout most of the movie, then making faces and falling in love with him, because the script tells her to. br /> <br /> And I would not even go so far as to say that Affleck is a bad actor, but John Schneider looks better over his shoulder. The city has a completely new level of Desperately Seeking Talent.
