I am very surprised by the positive comments, because there were four of us who saw it at one show and we all left. We personally thought that watching the movie was painfully slow and we could not sit in the whole movie. And we really tried to keep him. In particular, those in the group who really wanted to please because of personal sexual orientation alienation in the presented school years did not like or identify with it at all. :( <br /> <br /> Having said that, it's great to see that this movie really resonated with many people here on the boards and reviewers, it's the beauty of the subjective form of the movie :)
