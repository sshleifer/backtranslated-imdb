*** spoilery *** spoilery *** spoilery *** spoilery <br /> <br /> There are bad movies, and then there are movies that are so horrible that they become affectionately comical in their ineptitude. This is the case with Columbia Pictures' The Grudge. This film cruelty began when the American, who on the other hand had good intentions, saw the Japanese filmed for the television movie "Ju-on" and was inspired to rewrite the film in English. Virtual tsunami of bad decisions that circled the globe began until Orlando landing on October 21, 2004. <br /> <br /> The message, and I use this word loosely, is about a home in Tokyo haunted by the skinny ghost of Mummy, who looks like the intersection of Margaret Cho and Alanis Morrisette, along with her ghastly helper, plump, noisy but inadequate. Is there anything terrifying than a terrifying 8-year-old Japanese boy? Sure it is! Count Chocula comes to mind. With this capricious group, we must add a mysterious black cat, whom I call the Chim Chim fondly. (Do you remember Speed ​​Racer?) As you have already guessed, they were murdered in this place of doom and now want to kill all who will enter the area. You see, as the Japanese detective explained, when someone dies in anger, their spirit seeks vengeance on everyone who enters the lines of property identified by the county commissioner or something, I forget. <br /> <br /> The story begins quite innocently, and thespian Bill Pullman jumps to death from the balcony. I guess Bill Pullman got this job because his children were begging him for a trip to Tokyo Disneyland. Then we end up with a slightly interesting saga of Yoko's sister, "oh, do not go there", the audience shouts, but unfortunately she does not listen to horrible warnings and can be extinguished like a magic lantern. About 30 minutes after the film, we finally see the American character Sarah Michelle Gellar as Karen. Sarah Michelle Gellar may be a competent actress, but I could not stop thinking about Buffy the Vampire Slayer, so much so that she was distracted. This is the equivalent of star Jennifer Anniston in the movie about the adventures of six friends in New York. Try as you can, you just can not stop thinking about another project that made her famous. But digressing, Karen, the nurse is employed as the deputy of the original guardian who disappeared with us. <br /> <br /> Snoops around, meets ghosts, dies in a coma, and other things happen. Watching the fair-haired vixen looking for clues, I expected him to find a ghost and take off his mask to discover that he was the old Gower who owned the abandoned amusement park! - I would also accept it if it was not for you interfering children and your dog! <br /> <br /> Director Takashi Shimizu, who fights for the title of Ed Wood of Asia, made two unfortunate decisions regarding sound. First, he chooses the soundtrack only when someone is to be killed. This is a great idea to eliminate any tension, because the audience receives a two-minute warning to prepare for the next murder murder. Second, he gave the ghosts a weird, guttural noise that sounds like a rinse. After the film, I heard several people leave the theater, making a sound and laughing. <br /> <br /> Sarah Michelle Gellar is the only survivor. And, of course, we find out that the fire she prepared for burning the house has expired for the time of the compulsory next chapter. However, taking into account the humorous reactions of the audience, they did not want a sequel, but an apology. "The Grudge" can be easily changed into a comedy, perhaps then it will be appreciated for the value of the camp. In addition, it will be the biggest film thriller since "Godzilla vs. Megalon. " I suggest you wait for the film to reach your local discount theater, where it can get the public ridicule that it deserves so much.
