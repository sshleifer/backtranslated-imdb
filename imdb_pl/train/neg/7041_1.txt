What else can you say about this movie, except that it is terrible. Tina Louise and Adam West are the reasons why you should see it, but that's all, but their talents are wasted in this garbage. some of Adam's scenes, for example when he runs because you do not see his face. If Adam was embarrassed about being in Zombie Nightmare, just think what he must have felt when he appeared in this ??? If it was before or after, I'm not sure, but despite this, Zombie Nightmare is a classic (check first the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version) compared to that. actors. The rip off of The Wild One with Marlon Brando, of course. Tina looks stunning. I hope she and Adam will get a good payout !! Pass!
