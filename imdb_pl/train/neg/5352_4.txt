The Honey series, I Shrunk the Kids was very interesting and not to mention very famous. I loved Honey, I shrunk the kids when I was little. It was an original story and had such an exciting story! The scenes were so amazing, and the cast seemed to enjoy their company. Now, dear, I dropped the child, so I think they wanted to go back to the story that everyone loved. <br /> <br /> Basically, Adam is a little bit more grown up now, and mom goes on vacation to leave her husbands with children. But when Wayne's favorite object is threatened with trash, he wants to reduce it and stop it, but he and his brother interrupt. But when the wives come back after forgetting to give their son a little, they are also trapped in the machine, leaving the children alone in the house! it was just a family movie that I think could happen. The original Honey, I Shrunk the Kids is the best, I think everyone could agree. The third one was not so bad, I would recommend him at least in the movie Honey, I Blew Up the Kid, it was at least a little more fun. <br /> <br /> 4/10
