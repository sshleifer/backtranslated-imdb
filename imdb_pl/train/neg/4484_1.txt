As soon as I started watching the posters and hearing the conversation about this film, I was immediately excited. The Matrix was amazing, and I could not wait to see the second one, especially after watching trailers in other movies. However, when I saw this, I left the theater very disappointed, as did many other spectators in the theater with me. While the action scenes in the movie were amazing as usual, there were simply too few of them. In the first film there was a constant fight, but the second had a much more (and unfortunate) point of view. To sum up the story, there were not many things that were not expected. Machines kicked in the direction of Zion with the intention of destroying it (this is not a spoiler, everyone saw it in advertisements). The dialogue of the film was absolutely terrifying. If you're not the main psychologist, you probably will not understand most of what has been said in the movie, and that's why it will not be important to you. It became something of a romantic film with a show of events in the life and relationship of Neo and Trinity. Agent Smith, as angry as in the first movie, seemed to be religious and preaching. Personally, I do not have to hear about it or pay money to listen to it. The movie was a serious waste of my time and I do not think I can see the first one. Dialogue and continuous boring and dry monologues from essentially every character made me lose interest in the movie quickly, and a small amount of good battle scenes pushed me closer to the edge, and the end of the movie immediately pushed me. What movie ends with "To Be Concluded"? How original people are. I wonder if the Wachowski brothers had to burn oil at midnight to invent such oil. In conclusion, the film was bad and that's the end.
