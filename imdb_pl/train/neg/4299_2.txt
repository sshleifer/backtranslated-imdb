It's one of those horrible, sex-driven B movies that could not be played near the theater. Women run around dressed in scantily clad "rabbit" outfits. Extremely fat woman is the cause of many unpalatable jokes, and all work in the restaurant of a dirty old man who has a strange son (Jim Hanks, who of course Tom's brother), whom the man wants to "put". Hanks is really good, but this movie does not make sense and does not make sense. You have to wonder why it was even created? Nevertheless, due to Hank's performance and some funny moments (but no more than a few), he received the star "2" from 10. However, I think I was nice.
