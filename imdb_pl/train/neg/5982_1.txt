I'm very sorry about that, but "Thunderbirds" does not even make loud pop, no matter how much thunder. At one point I was seriously thinking about going out of the cinema, I remained in the hoped-for hope that the film could improve. I was to be disappointed, it was not better, it was worse if it was possible. If I went to watch a movie with the thought that it would be a "parody", I would still be disappointed. They had a great opportunity to make a great series of movies here, they completely wasted this opportunity. Bill Paxton and Sir Ben Kingsley should be ashamed that the movie is accompanied by names, and Jonathan Frakes well, what can I say, he should be embarrassed and ashamed will not be far from the truth. I saw this movie at the pre-premiere show, I waited impatiently, growing up in the sixties with original programs. To say that I was disappointed would be a kind of understatement. The last thing I will say about the film were dolls in television programs, which were slightly more wooden than in the case of the actors in the film.
