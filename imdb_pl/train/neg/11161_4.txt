"Nacho Libre" (2006) <br /> <br /> Director: Jared Hess <br /> <br /> Starring: Jack Black, Ana de la Reguera, Héctor Jiménez and Darius Rose <br /> <br /> MPAA rating: "PG-13" (for some brutal actions and harsh humor, including dialogue) <br /> <br /> Tell me what you want (I know that some people despise this endlessly), but I always thought that "Napoleon Dynamite" is a funny movie - not the brightest brick on the wall, but still a funny movie. Jack Black is also a very funny man - sometimes annoying, yes, and extremely overrated by an adolescent audience who practically honors him, but is fun. Jack Black's comedy was rare, and I did not like it to some extent. So I was very happy when I heard that Jared Hess, the screenwriter and director of "Napoleon Dynamite", and Jack Black joined forces in the film about a Spanish brother who becomes a wrestler to save an orphanage. My only caveat was that the plot seemed a bit too thin. Unfortunately, my one booking turned out to be the fall of the whole movie. This plot, if it was made as a skit on some such programs as "Saturday Night Live", and maybe even "Mad TV", would work without a hitch. Unfortunately, the plot is much too thin in approximately an hour and a half, and this jocular comedy is falling. <br /> <br /> Nacho grew up in a Mexican monastery and became a pious man of the Lord. Nacho (Black), currently a cook of the monastery, feeling avoided by the whole monastery, decides to follow his dreams to become a professional wrestler. Because the monastery's finances have reached the lowest level in history, Nacho decides to take part in a wrestling tournament so that he can win a cash prize and provide good food for the orphanage in the monastery. This plot sounds so sweet and caring. It looks like the perfect movie for Jack Black. In the end, look what he did with the School of Rock. Well, to my displeasure, this plot is almost completely ruined by offensive and thick humor that simply distances the heart of the movie. Once again, the Hollywood way of showing that they feel that teenagers will only understand jokes and stupid humor, of course, as far as I know, maybe this is the general thought of teenagers, because many seemed to enjoy this movie. Watching an obese woman running like a mouse on the floor will certainly make people laugh, but do not expect a reward for putting her in the movie. A seven-year-old can come up with the same joke. <br /> <br /> The performances in "Nacho Libre" are really good. Jack Black proves once again that he is absolutely hilarious and that he can make even the most idiotic, worthless poems be comical. Unfortunately, this movie was not enough for him. It did not give him anything to do, and the only reason his jokes worked was through him. I have never seen or heard of Ana de la Reguera before, but now I can say that she is not only very talented, but she is also one of the most beautiful women who ever graced my eyesight. She just clicked the part and acted great. Héctor Jiménez, who plays the incompetent partner Nacho, Esqueleto, still laughed at me. He did a very good job and was very effective when he cooperated with Jacek Black. Darius Rose, who plays an orphan named Chancho, did not have many lines, but what I can say, I just liked him. He was charming. The rest of the cast did their job. It is a pity that they have been wasted on such a sub-movie. <br /> <br /> "Nacho Libre" simply does not work. His plot is too thin. The heart of all this is contaminated by stupid humor and disgusting jokes that just do not work. I very rarely dared, and if so, because of Jack Black or another cast member. And that brings me to the bright side of "Nacho Libre": yes, cast. This cast was simply "good" for lack of a better word. Everyone clicked, they had perfect chemistry and pumped as much life as possible into a flat script. After "Napoleon Dynamite" by Jared Hess entertained me to the end of the movie, I was surprised that I got bored "Nacho Libre" so often. Something is missing, and I still do not understand what it was. I only know that "Nacho Libre" is not a good movie, but because of its cast is completely worthless. There is a small reason to watch, if only to watch the work of Jacek Black. But if you're not a fan of Jack Black, avoid this movie like a plague. I like Black, but I finished with this film and this review. <br /> <br /> Final Thought: Yikes! This is a surprisingly disappointing continuation of Jared Hess after his hysterical "Napoleon Dynamite." <br /> <br /> Overall Rating: 4/10 (C +)
