I grew up with scooby (a bit like runs, where are you). I hate wicked people, I love Daphne and I feel that it is not complete without a whole gang. But it is sad, scooby doo is a mysterious solving comedy - quite a total spy Japanese anime. I like "what's new", they had to give dangerous Daphne makeover sometime :( and try to lose * sex * drug jokes of many generations, but this "get a clue" is hopeless and should not even try to do some bad punk thing with a thematic song. watch my DVD from scooby doo, where you want to wash dirt from this new series.
