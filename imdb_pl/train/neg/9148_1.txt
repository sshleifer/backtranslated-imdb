I looked down at 100 Imdbs, because I thought I'd never seen anything as bad as plan 9 from outside or a Roller Ball remake, I was wrong. Ben and Arthur beat both. <br /> <br /> It's from the many innumerable movies that I've seen, it's the worst movie I've ever seen. Bad Directing, Bad Characters, Horrible Acting, Horrible story There is no reason for no one but Sam to say something positive about this film. Sam was a terrible annoying actor, but his direction was so bad that he could just overthrow Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> The director should be ashamed of his job, unfortunately I have to give him at least one star, but he deserves to be - continuous stars.
