I liked how it started with decent special effects, especially for a film from 50 years ago. There was a little impressive scenery. However, the film falls into a silly dialogue quite early, while men try to flirt with Anne Francis "Altaira Morbius.") <br /> <br /> Watching it in the 90s after a long absence, it was great to see Francis again, actress that has been playing TV shows since the movie's premiere ... and it still works. It was also interesting meeting with young Leslie Nielsen ("Dr. John J. Adams"), which I would not recognize, if not this voice. <br /> <br /> I watched half of this movie before boredom came almost overwhelming and I had a strong desire to go sleep. I appreciate their re-performance of this VHS tape in stereo. but it was a weak effort. This is one of those overrated films in which "elites" think they are "heavy" and "provocative". It's complete nonsense. It just looked "intelligent" because the rest of the sci-fi movies from the 1950s were so stupid !! <br /> <br /> Some if the early scenes would look great on a widescreen screen, which I did not have at the time of writing. Perhaps another look - this time on a panoramic transfer of 2.35: 1 would change this opinion.
