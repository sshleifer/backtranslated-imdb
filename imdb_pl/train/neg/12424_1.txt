If you want to laugh like crazy, rent a Cage. Cage are two war heroes, Billy and Scott, who are best friends. When Billy is shot in Vietnam, he can not take care of himself, so Scott takes him in. <br /> <br /> I've never seen a movie with more gay references to the two main characters. Billy and Scott love to "wrestle" and Scott tells Billy that he is "still sore last night." Pang Pong, cut the sh! T "will make you laugh for hours. Guys from Native Americans who are supposed to play in the Mexican gang members are also at the highest level. As they say, this is "party time. Ba-ba-ba-ba ba-ba ". I could last forever, but just watch this movie and laugh at your money. It was so funny that I went out and bought a DVD for $ 5.99
