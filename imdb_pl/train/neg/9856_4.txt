In an autobiographical story about the adolescence of Romulus, My Father Eric Bana, from Munich's fame, plays the impoverished German emigrant fighting for the upbringing of his son, Raymond (Kodi Smit-McPhee), in rural Australia in the 1960s. The main obstacle to the stability and happiness of the family is his wife Christina (Frank Potente), who blatantly breaks the wedding oaths, shamelessly hiding with other men. Despite her highly unconventional behavior, Romulus refuses to divorce her, masochistically torturing herself in the vain hope of returning to him one day. This is unfortunately good-natured and good-natured Raimond, who must bear witness to all this marital confusion - and this is his memories as the basis of the film (Raimond Gaita later became an author). <br /> <br /> Although I admire "Romulus, my father" for what I'm trying to do, I can not honestly say that I liked it, because while the movie has great performances and serious intentions, it just is not enough to counteract stupid storyline and funeral stimulation, which makes the audience despair and depressed like people on the screen. A serious drama of everyday life is one thing, but this inexorable fall in adultery, madness and many suicides (let alone suicide attempts) is something else.
