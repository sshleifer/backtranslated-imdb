I do not envy Barry Levinson, Rachel Weisz, Ben Stiller or Jack Black for making this movie. In a word, it's boring. Maybe the fact that it's too predictable, more than the lost role of Ben Stiller, or not all funny scenes, make this movie something you can forget about. Even the appearance of Christopher Walken ends in a pathetic way. I was very disappointed. I love Ben Stiller's acting. I loved it in most of his films, the last one I saw before, he was Duplex with Drew Barrymore and he was not so bad. About Jack Black ... Well, apart from High Fidelity, I've never seen him do something good. What about the School of Rock? Oops, terrifying.
