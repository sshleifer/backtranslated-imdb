"Lies" tells about a romance between an 18-year-old masked student and a thin 38-year-old married man, with a pair of protags spending about half the time on the screen dealing with naked sex and hokey, and the other half wriggling through a pitiful plot that seems to be just an excuse for sexual scenes. With a very low production value, including obvious sanitary facilities and false sex, softcore for storytelling, which is a messy mix of comedy and drama, "Lies" quickly becomes unnecessary for nauseam. With almost two hours of running, subtitles, so little content, "Lies" are simply not recommendable. (DOWN-)
