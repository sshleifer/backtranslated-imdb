Daddy's girlfriends Florence Lawrence and Dorothy West receive great messages at the local post office, unaware that they are being tracked by Charles Inslee's burglar. Meanwhile, Father David Miles receives a message (from young Robert Harron) who requires Dad to leave the house; so when the young women come back, can they be? home alone. As a sensitive couple lying in the evening begins the local "Great Ball of Black and Tans√≥w"; and the dark drinker heralds additional danger for D.W. Griffith's dynamic duo? <br /> <br /> Mr. Inslee has one of his better roles in Biograph, stealing the movie from "The Girls and Daddy." Ironically, director Griffith appears as one of the additions with black faces at the ball "Black and Tans." "Biograph Girls" Lawrence and West suggest later "Griffith Girls" by Lillian and Dorothy Gish, especially in "Orphans of the Storm" (1921); and they are overly emotional in bed! The racist tone is unfortunate because the story of a burglar redeemed by saving potential victims from greater danger is intriguing. <br /> <br /> *** The Girls and Daddy (2/9/09) D.W. Griffith ~ Florence Lawrence, Dorothy West, Charles Inslee
