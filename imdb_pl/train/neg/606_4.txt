The potential was there. I saw Creep and thought, "Oooh, it's getting interesting" a few times. However, in some way interesting plot motifs have become unexplained or ignored, as if they never happened. The main character was annoying throughout the movie and at some point my friend and I shouted that we wanted her to die. There are a few really horrifying moments, but they are very dimmed by the moments that irritated me. This is another of these horror movies that appears and intrigues for a while, but ultimately leaves you frustrated and a bit confused as the filmmakers tried to achieve. the movie is a bad guy, but when baddie is more like the main character, you know you're a loser.
