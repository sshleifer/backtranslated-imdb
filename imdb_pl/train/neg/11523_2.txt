"Igor and the Lunatics" is a completely inept and amateurish attempt of crazy hippie cult murder-horror. Apparently, even nearly twenty years later, Charles Manson was still inspiring the over-zealous but incompetent creators of junk movies. This is a typical production of Troma, in other words, there are many boring and completely insignificant filling materials that accompany a meaningless story. There is some accidental blood and nudity on the display? what is not bad? but all this is so senseless and ugly that looking at it becomes frustrating. "Igor and the Lunatics" is so desperate that it even uses material twice, like a wheel. The inconsistent plot tries to tell the story of a hippy cult run by a drug addict and Charlie Manson, who wants to become Paul. One of Pawe≈Ç's lower class students, named Igor, becomes somewhat fascinated by bible stories and drug orgies and gradually makes the whole cult descend into criminal madness. To illustrate, by a small example, how crazy Igor is: he rips his heart out of the breast of a really sexy black hitchhiker girl! There's an annoying synth soundtrack and some really embarrassingly poor pseudoartistic camera tricks like slow motion movies and continuous dream sequences. Maybe there is one sequence that more or less qualifies as a junk fanatics, and this is when a poor girl is cut by half a machete. For no particular reason, the camera holds a blade shot in a bloody stomach for fifteen whole seconds.
