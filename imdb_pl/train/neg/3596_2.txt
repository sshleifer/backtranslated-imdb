To be as honest as I can, The Devil's Plaything (or Veil of Blood or Vampire Ecstasy or The Curse of the Black Sisters or ????) is a complete boredom. The movie has a good premise? the resurrection of a long-dead vampire by the descendant through the help and help of a group of women dressed in black? but the execution is terrible. There are great, long moments of time on the screen, when nothing is happening. Characters simply stand idle. There is no secret, no tension and no plot points to look after. The operation is simply fatal. Most of the actors include a group of women below average, dancing naked, looking at the camera. They do it many times. It seems that a small plot has been designed to get more of those less attractive nude women to join the dance. Although it's not as bad or pointless as a dance or conspiracy in something like Orgy of the Dead, it's getting closer.
