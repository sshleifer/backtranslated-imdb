I'm not sure if it was a language or bad acting, but everything in the film seems to be cheap and false. <br /> <br /> After watching Der Untergang it is a huge disappointment. There is no relationship between different scenes, and acting is so incredibly poor that I could not even believe that people can do such a mess on something that had great potential. <br /> <br /> And above all, everyone in Germany speaks English. A big mistake. The German language has a certain sound, and especially Hitler himself sounds like Hitler, when he speaks / yells in German. <br /> <br /> The way the story is told made me believe that it is improvised on the spot, the characters were empty, and the movie seems to be a collection of random events that could have happened. <br /> <br /> Regardless of whether they are English or whether I have already seen Der Untergang, everything in this film was false and funny.
