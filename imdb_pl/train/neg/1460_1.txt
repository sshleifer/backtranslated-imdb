If there is ever another Hitler, it will be partly due to nonsense, such as this film, which promotes the absurd belief that he was clearly a madman from the very beginning. Far from following such a person and choosing him to the highest office in the country, reasonable people crossed the street to avoid him, and he would die in a ditch, unnamed and unknown. <br /> <br /> Everyone who reads the accounts of close associates of Hitler - for example the autobiography of his secretary Traudl Junge - will strike him with the fact that people have recognized him as a kind, intelligent, generous man. He was also a brilliant speaker, and the fact that his speeches seem exaggerated and appealing to modern ears ignores the times in which they were made when proud pompoms were common in political speeches. The same is true of exaggerated anti-Semitism, which was neither the central board of the early Nazis - who were above all anti-Communist - either unusual or unusual at that time. The film makes it seem that the only goal of Hitler was from the very beginning the Holocaust. <br /> <br /> If you want to identify another person who will kill tens of millions, you can ignore the fleck-lipped life ravers here. Instead, look at the charming, charismatic man whose convincing speeches inspire the entire nation and whose political work clearly and materially benefits the country. I'm afraid his personality will be more like Barack Obama than Fred Phelps. <br /> <br /> I counted a lot here and I had nothing but a caricature. Fools who have done this have committed a crime against reality. This is the historical equivalent of "Reefer Madness".
