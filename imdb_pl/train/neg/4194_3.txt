This film started very promisingly from the story of a director who loses sight and a blind woman to help him. However somewhere in the middle it seemed that the screenwriters did not know where to go. <br /> <br /> One unbelievable event occurred after the second (Russia must be very small, because they all bump into each other all the time) motivation of the female heroine is understandable (why is he still following him after leaving the ship? Why does not he try to borrow cell phone on the ship to call someone?), the side stories were totally ridiculous (was the story with the mother and boyfriend supposed to be fun? And what was the story with the younger sister?). Despite all this seeming arbitrariness of the story, the film was completely predictable. <br /> <br /> The saddest thing is that there was a lot of potential. As I said, the idea of ​​the movie was good, the graphics and the score were very beautiful, and the actors of the main characters were also good. It could have been a really good movie ... but it was not.
