Films from the 70s horror film Schlocky ... you must love them. In contrast to today's boring, spinning movies, these special K-telers do something terrifying and do not resort to a tired formula. <br /> <br /> This is a B movie about making a B movie ... that went terribly wrong. Faith Domergue (Earth on this island) appears as a hilltop, the queen of the B movie, making a movie about a series of terrifying murders that met a family in their home. Her boyfriend / director who looks and acts like a Gordon Jump with attitude, shoots photos on the spot and a busy schedule. Star Ken doll discovers a book of Tibetan songs that work on the script to add "realism". Unfortunately, "realism" is something that they could do without. <br /> <br /> John Carradine, has long since stopped looking for the 17th gland (The Unearthly), now looking for a modest existence as a caretaker for fortunes. It's about your everyday work, but it always seems to beat the director. <br /> <br /> Horror is being built slowly; dead cat here, John Carradine enters the grave there, finally ended with seven, seven murders. (At least in advertising, it's true.) It's just sad that the ghoul did not understand that there was a movie over it. How weak did she know that these damn Tibetan songs would really work? Look in the eyes, you just can not walk around Satan's robes and expect him to put him down. <br /> <br /> Sterno says that he will perform an autopsy at the House of the Seven Dead.
