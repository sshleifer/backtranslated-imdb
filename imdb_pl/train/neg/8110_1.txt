I think Phillip Kaufman read the cliff version of Kunder's novel in the cliff, and then he started to make this movie. Okay, of course he will not have the punch of the original. The Kundera novels are great because of the manipulation of the narrative concept, its ability to enter and leave the stories it creates. This movie does not even try! One sequence of Tereza's dreams, so important to the atmosphere of the book, is transformed and makes no sense. In addition, and this is probably a smaller point, Daniel Day-Lewis looks very similar to Ben Stiller (I know that this is not a real complaint, but hey). A great example of Hollywood literature.
