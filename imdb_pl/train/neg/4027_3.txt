This must be one of the most overrated Spanish films in history. Lack of subtlety and complexity and complete political correction make it really childish, with only good / bad characters. The world is simply not like that, and good films show complex characters with opposite impulses, dilemmas, etc. However, I hate the pain of my father's friend, Pain, the most. The director is trying to teach us a good lesson: tattooists with shaved heads are not always bad guys, in fact they can be better than the average looking dad (wow, it's like ... philosophy or something). Thank you, Achero. I will offer you a Nobel prize in the field of literature.
