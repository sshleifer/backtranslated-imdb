can every movie become more na√Øve? you can not believe a piece of this script. and its soooooo predictable that you can tell the story and ending from the first 10 minutes. the main actress seems to want to be Barbie (but she does not do it, the doll has MORE acting skills). <br /> <br /> The ease with which a character passes and stays in a music school, makes the specter of an opera novel seem like a historical biography. I will not even comment on the shallow character, but ONE good thing about the film is Madsen's performance, which manages to restore the life of a one-dimensional melo-like figure. <br /> <br /> The film is so tacky, it sticks to your teeth. I can think that some 13-year-old girls obsessed with Britney shouting "Oh, give us a break! I gave him 2 instead of just one for Virginia Madsen.
