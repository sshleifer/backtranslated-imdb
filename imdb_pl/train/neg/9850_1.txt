I felt that the brain died, I will tell you. It's the worst movie I've ever bought. (in my ignorance I thought it was a Peter Jackson movie of the same title). Performances are so horrible that they are funny. Special effects have not survived the test of time and they look terrible. The screenplay promotes this type of television movie, staring at the center of the game at a distance. The cast looks like they were taking lessons with Joey Tribbiani, everyone had one look and held on. Besides, I was never confused by the movie until I sat down to watch it. Is it a dream or is it not so terrible that frustration appears in a few minutes. Avoid the plague.
