The only real event in the film is the death of the harassing guy and the reaction of the surviving characters to it. <br /> <br /> In all other respects this film is a very bad rip-off from Jaws, Lake Placid and Alligator, with a bit of Godzilla (1998) thrown in. <br /> <br /> As usual in a 90's horror movie, two non-celebrity females take off their clothes at least once. The female advantage does not exist because it apparently has a better agent. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is surrounded by a movie about a really stupid extreme sport called blood surfing, in which surfers cut and surf in shark waters. In this movie, a gigantic saltwater crocodile is also in the area. People are eating. The movie ends. <br /> <br /> I do not mind a bad horror movie, but I really hate the boring, evil horror that is definitely like that.
