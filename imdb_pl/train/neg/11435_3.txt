I would like to know more about this movie when I rented it. I would put it in my queue based on Heather Graham and her strong position as an actress (IMHO). While parts of the movie were cute, most of the film seemed imaginary, undeveloped or otherwise simply boring or predictable. Not to mention the ICK coefficient for so many people thinking that the siblings were a couple ... I do not care how much of the plot is such that it's still a bit, hmm, disgusting. And Charlie, for a zoologist, certainly does not seem to be very tuned to signals from other Homo sapiens. What was the matter with her (except her zeal and shared interests) that made Gray fall into her? This story could be much more interesting with a bit more depth. The most important points - Molly Shannon (although I agree with the reviewer who turned out to be annoying), taxi driver in drugs and dance sequences (if Sam and Gray were such great dancers, I would like us to see more of this, because the shown fragments were actually better than most the rest of the movie). Could be better.
