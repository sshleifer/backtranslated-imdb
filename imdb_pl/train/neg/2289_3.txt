Unfortunately, Marry Harron decided to make a fictitious report on Bettie Page's life to deal with her own problems with men. As usual in her entire work, every important male figure is depicted as weak, inept or twisted. To add fiction to it, Bettie Page himself designs ideas and problems that are not real. Bettie did not leave biz because she thought it was morally wrong or had religious problems (though later she was born again thanks to the influence of the third husband - minister). She left him because she was 30 years old, her acting career disappeared, and she felt she was losing her appearance. Traces of molestation and rape are unfounded and contradictory to Bettie's words and are an attempt by the director to claim that every woman who did what Bettie did was a victim of men. Harron does not notice that Bettie designed her own clothes on almost all the pictures (not given to her by "sick" fetishists). Harron also can not say that Bunny Yeager, who did many of Bettie's famous photo shoots, also did many "naughty" photos with Bettie and was not a morally honest professional photographer portrayed in the film. <br /> <br /> The only saving grace is Gretchen Mol, who is very similar to Bettie. Otherwise, there are other videos and documentaries more accurate and honest for her life and people in her.
