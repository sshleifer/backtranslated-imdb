so ... it's really sexist and classic, and I thought it might not be in the early stages of the movie, like when Stella tells Steven that she really wants to change and start talking the right way not to change her. Well, he definitely changed the melody and it seems that other reviewers have followed in his footsteps. what seems to be a love story at the beginning is really social placement and women as sacrificial mothers. the end of the movie does not make her a hero, it makes her whole sad. and his sad that people think he makes her a hero. maybe this is a commentary to the movie people should take. positive reception reflects continuous patriarchal currents in the social consciousness. Yuck.
