It is a pity that you can not vote for zero stars on IMDb, because I would not hesitate! In fact, I would say that this movie was in negative stars. <br /> <br /> I, like many others, bought this movie thinking that because it has Michael Madsen, it can be good ... No chance! This movie was shocking! Imagine the length of the movie "The Bold and the Beautiful", well, Primal Instinct did not even come close to this good and I thought before that there would be nothing worse than the length of the movie "The Bold and the Beautiful". <br /> <br /> Michael Madsen, how can you do this to us? The worst thing is that I did not accelerate a bit, I was hoping that eventually they would reveal that it was some kind of joke that they thought it was funny that we were making us watch such a horribly bad movie. <br /> <br /> Where to start ...? Director - Zero Stars, Scenario - Zero Stars, Aktorstwo - Zero Stars, Pictures - Zero Stars, Digital Effects - Zero Stars, Set Design - Zero Stars, Make-up - Zero Stars, Casting - Zero Stars, Edition - Zero Stars, Trailer - Half a Star, graphic design - half a star, DVD menu - half a star. <br /> <br /> But I think it's very important to see bad movies just to know what is really bad film, so that's why I'm happy that I saw this movie so that I have a bad one a movie to be placed at the bottom of my list.
