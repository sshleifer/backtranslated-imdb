What is this sh * t? Power Rangers vs Freddy? It was possible to watch and as good as the first movie at the beginning, but from the part in which the characters get super powers in their dreams, it began to be childish. That sh * t should be evaluated as PG or PG-13 instead of R. I expected to see very mature things, but only for 1/3 of the movie. The rest is for small children. In addition, he focuses too much on Christianity. I know that Freddy is a demon, but there are many religions that have different ways to fight demons. Why must there always be Christianity? It is total orientalism and full of white men / superiority of the West. Do not watch it, show it to little children who love power guards.
