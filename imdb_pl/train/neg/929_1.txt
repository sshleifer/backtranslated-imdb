My wife and I like to rent really stupid horror / science-fiction movies and watch them with our friends laughing. We saw this at fullmoondirect.com and decided to add it to our netflix list. Now, when I say this movie is horrible, I mean it well. Everything including acting, camera work, history, costumes is just such a joyful and low budget, but it makes it so good. I think that in one scene the actors looked as if they were really walking in place. I really hope that the one who made the film was not serious when he made it, because if it was, it would just be sad. If you like to watch really stupid horrors, to laugh at them, I recommend this one.
