"The Brain Machine" will put your brain into a red-hot run, trying to figure out what this is all about. Four experiments of different origins and intelligence levels were selected for the experiment described by one of the scientists as a scientific study of man and the environment. Because the only common denominator among them is the fact that each of them has no known family, should be a clue - none of them will be left out. <br /> <br /> The whole affair is overseen by a mysterious creeper known only as a General, but it looks like he is heading towards a senator who wants to remain anonymous. A good call from the senator. There is also a dark cover, which the camera constantly enlarges, and which later claims that it is not directed towards the General or "Project". It is a pity he was not more effective, he was quite easily defeated before the whole thing went hand in hand. <br /> <br /> If it is nothing else, the movie is a real treasure trove of 70's technology, in which telephone phone shots, room size computers and teletype devices are repeated, which will not be closed. Perhaps this was the basis of the alternative title of the movie - "Time Warp"; nothing else would make sense. As for me, I would like to consider the title suggested by the experiment of the murdered doctor Krisner entitled "Group Stress Project". This applies to both actors and viewers of the film. <br /> <br /> Keep an eye on the general's head by the pool when he asks an agent for a weapon, and a microphone with a boom is visible over his head. seconds. <br /> <br /> You can catch this move if you're a die-hard fan of Gerald McRaney, could he ever be so young? James Best also appears in the somewhat unusual role of the secret Reverend, but do not call him Father. To get something more in your avenue, try to get your hands in "The Killer Shrews" from 1959. At least this one does not pretend to be taken so seriously.
