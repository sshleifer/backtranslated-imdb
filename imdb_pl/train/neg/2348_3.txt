Ashley Judd, in her early role, and I think her first main role shows her rebellious nature in this slow feminist soap opera. Wow, is this a tool of political correctness and extreme liberalism, or what? <br /> <br /> Being an avid feminist in real life, she had to cultivate this scenario. No wonder that the critic of the Left Wing Roger Ebert loved the movie; it's also his political avenue. <br /> <br /> Unlike the reviewers here, I'm glad Judd rose from this moronic down to better roles in torn movies, she did not preach a heavy liberal agenda.
