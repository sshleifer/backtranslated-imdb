Because I'm from Hungary, I heard how many people talked about better and better things about Üvegtigris, but I do not really understand the reason of all the confusion. <br /> <br /> I liked the many points of the movie, some quotes really comforted me, but the stereotypical characters are again present, as in every Hungarian movie, and the story is also boring. I liked the first half, but then I started to get bored, and then I found the whole BORING movie. <br /> <br /> Rudolf Péter is always good, Reviczky is also brilliant, but others are just there ... I do not do anything. <br /> <br /> How old is the time for a GOOD Hungarian movie?
