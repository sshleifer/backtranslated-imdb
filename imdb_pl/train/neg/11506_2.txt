This film story is bad enough, which can happen in real life. I can not understand when they show us this bad movie. I say it was wrong because there is a reason. 1. if Madonna was rich and can do everything she wants, why she falls in love with this evil man. 2. How is the storyline so weak? She was so rich, she could do anything she wanted, but she would not dare divorce her husband, which is very impossible. <br /> <br /> Words I LOVE YOU, it does not mean anything in this movie.
