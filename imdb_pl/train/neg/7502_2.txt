I've always liked Spike Lee movies, but this was a total loss of 2 1/2 hours. I was expecting more about Son of Sam and instead got a movie that seemed to have little to do with serial killings from 1977. The talking dog was funny (you know you're in trouble when all the movie laughs wrong). The whole film seemed very chaotic and not very interesting. Sex scenes were completely irrelevant to the plot. I'm not an opponent of sex in movies, but it should make sense (unless it's XXX). All in all, we were very disappointed with the effort of Spike Lee !!
