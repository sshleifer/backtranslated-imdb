OK, as in the case of the original - that is, rich old geez leaves his property to his adult children, all ungrateful losers and two terrifying servants, provided they spend a week in his terrible old house. What will happen this night will only surprise those who have not seen the movie or TV program before. After a series of murders, in which the victims look like bleeding restaurant ketchups, we have a painfully obvious ending. The cast is led by some once-respected actors who had to desperately seek their payoffs. There are also a few second-level actors who were created at that time, but have long since forgotten. As a result, the film generates the whole drama and the secret of the "Matlock" episode. I will give credits where it is necessary - the final scene is clever and fun if you are not asleep.
