Cheap and incredibly boring history and acting. Not a single good line, not even a bad enough line to be good, and no memorable delivery. Even the blooper disc attached to the DVD showed how inept actors were and how little fun they had. The esoteric and occult basis was apathetically inauthentic, and the antagonists were neither frightening nor credible. The "homoerotic" subtexts were senselessly tame and unsatisfactory, and were limited to young boys caressing their breasts while they flopped down in boxer shorts. I'm not gay enough to appreciate it, but the little action could at least keep me and my girlfriend awake.
