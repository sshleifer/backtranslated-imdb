ba ba ba boring ...... this is next to the battlefield in a science fiction dream. genie francis (aka laura general hospital) has a small role as a reporter and in itself should say that this movie must be bad ... is ben kingsley (award-winning actor academy) in this smelly and several other decent actors. You have to wonder what prompted them to take this awful movie. Music dramatically goes up and down, as it is a big dramatic story. Even if you pay attention, the plot is impossible to track. The effects are also average and seem really outdated. All actors speak in a monotonous voice and have no realism in dialogue. I can continue and talk about what a bad movie is like. At least in Battlefield Earth it's so bad it's fun, but it's just something like that. Avoid unless you want to be asleep.
