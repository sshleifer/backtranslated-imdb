Have you ever noticed how Burt Reynolds' laughter sounds like screeching brakes in his later movies? <br /> <br /> He had to spend a lot of time with Hal Needham. <br /> <br /> And from the appearance of "Stroker As", too much. <br /> <br /> Can you believe that it was based on the book? I could not, but it was. And probably I'm not a bestseller, I bet. <br /> <br /> Burt is another old man in the NASCAR circuit who works with Beatty as a magnate with fried chicken with projects for his team. Anderson assures there is an interest in love, and Nabors makes his next impression of Gomer Pyle as a faithful mechanic / best friend. <br /> <br /> Many people here are friends of Burt's or Hal. Others had to need a job. And even the real NASCAR drivers are starting to act and look more talented than those with SAG cards. <br /> <br /> Regarding laughter, Bubba Smith (formerly "Police Academy") gets them as Beatty chauffeur. And Petersen, in full Elvira mode, gets a lot of grateful remarks as a lady who wants to get to know Lugs well. REAL WELL. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that Burt rejected so much time and effort in the film as "Stroker Ace", where it did not matter whether he took the trouble or not. They did not bother writing a character for him, why bother? <br /> <br /> Two stars. Mainly for Petersen, and finally at the end. Now they are fun.
