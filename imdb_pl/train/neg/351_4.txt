First watched 2/16/2002 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Arne Glimcher): Mystery ?? / Thriller with too many funny twists. Despite the very talented cast, this film is too predictable and almost underestimated by the audience. The film audience is not stupid and I hope it will not constantly fill some of the pockets of stars, despite what they are related to. We think this movie will be about something with Connery's conviction against the capitol career at first, but it turns out that it is nothing but a standard, invented for the good of the audience, a mill run, never stop the thriller. We're drawn into every stupid phrase in the form, because they're introduced to us when it's needed in history, and we're ready to let this thing end before it's over. Yes, there are a lot of good actors here, especially with Blair Underwood, Fishburne and Ed Harris in the role of supportive psycho, but history does not work from the beginning to the very long-awaited end.
