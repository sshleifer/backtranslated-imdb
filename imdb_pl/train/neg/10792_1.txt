this movie offers nothing but the stupidest conversations. in fact, I probably did not imagine how senseless the movie is, how synthetic dialogues can be up to an hour ago, but then I saw the movie again. in the film, which is not dependent on a powerful script, at least good acting and good conversations are expected, and maybe even humor, but in this movie all of them are missing. you've heard that they are missing all. there is not a single point that I would like in this film, none. I hate this. I'm sure everyone will do it too. the name aims to give recipients some ideas about nudity and other things, but it does not manage even in nudity. I do not know how, but I tried to watch it for about an hour and I definitely recommend that you do not do it. the worst movie I've seen in my entire life. if someone will offer you a visit, ruuun awaaaaay saaaaaave two liiiiiiiiife
