Pros: nic <br /> <br /> Cons: everything <br /> <br /> Summary of the plot: the reporter encounters a hitchhiker who tells her stories about the deaths of people killed by zombies. <Br /> <br /> Review: I have never come across a movie as a bad The Zombie Chronicles in my life. The budgeted about 20 bucks, TZC is a totally horrible horror, which is based on lame, forgetful actors who could not save their lives and earn more than frightening. How is this film made? Simply put, avoid TZC as a sexually transmitted disease. <br /> <br /> My Last 2 Cents: Humorously, this movie was produced by the film company Brain Damage Films. The brains really had to be damaged to come up with such a shitty movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1 in 10 (if it depended on me, this movie would get a negative rating of bajillion)
