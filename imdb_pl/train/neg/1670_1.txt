The premise is horrible: a woman got pregnant when a stranger kisses her in a bar. <br /> <br /> But as soon as the movie begins, the horrible opening scene proves that it is a C-type Sci-Fi TV. It's a big Star Trek and some X files, but most of all it's boring. <br /> <br /> When the movie starts working, everything is predictable and trivial. It looked more like the 2nd ground floor in the bad Sci-Fi show. Without tension and emotion, but not due to lack of trials. Just a lot of predictable dramatic conflicts between the main characters. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time.
