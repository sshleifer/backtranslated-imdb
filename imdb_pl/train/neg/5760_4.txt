Well ... I was going to wait for it to appear on the film to see it, and I'd like to have, I really caught a terrible movie 2 on the cable one day, and it made me miss the same as I got the AIRCRAFT on CRACK. .. I mean, if you like Leslie Nielsen plane or other vehicles, you'll probably be in heaven, but if you're used to usually WAYANS COMEDY, you'll be disappointed, there were many more eye candy in the ones that will make the young hormone the teenage boys are raging, probably because it was a hit in the first week. I liked the horrifying movie 2 times more than this feed, and in part 5 times more. Strange that the better of 3 is part 2, but then again I've always liked Halloween 2 better than the original ... maybe it's just me. The funniest part of the movie must be the way Aliens Say Goodbye. But it was not worth the $ 11 I spent to catch my fiancee morning. Save yourself the cash and catch part 2 again on the cable until it is released on the video tape, and then borrow it, do not buy it.
