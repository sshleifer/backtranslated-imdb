I liked Boyle's performance, but that's the only positive thing I can say. Everything was exaggerated until the absurd. Most of the actors spoke as if you were expecting your 9-year-old nephew to speak if he pretended to be a jaded, stony policeman or an ultra-evil villain. A grating voice seemed amateurish to me. I could buy a cheap synthesizer and make better opening music. And what about all the 1984 policemen? It was completely unnecessary and had nothing to do with real events in history. Cox added a lot of things that he apparently thought was really cool, but he had nothing to do with the story. This is a great disappointment, because one of the things that make Borges's stories so good is its minimalism - they are closely related, without unnecessary details. This film is quite the opposite. I stopped watching the scene in which Lonnrot interrogates a guy from Yidische Zaitung, or nearby. I wasted $ 4 by renting it, but at least I can get some satisfaction from writing this review and I hope that I will save others from making the same mistake.
