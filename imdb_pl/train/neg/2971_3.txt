Batman Mystery of the Batwoman is an outdated word. <br /> <br /> The plot says that the mysterious woman-vigilante ("Batwoman") enters the Batman's turf and while Batman tries to fight the triangle Penguin / Bane / Rupert Thorne, he tries to figure out who the mysterious Batwoman is. <br /> <br /> There is nothing strange about it, but there is nothing special about it, noticing that it really is not there. <br /> <br /> The mask of the phantasm has made Bruce's lost love changed to a surface and a mess with his head. <br /> <br /> Subzero was an important event in Mr. Freeze's life. <br /> <br /> Even the movie "Batman Beyond" spins, Return of the Joker, digging deeply with the characters involved. <br /> <br /> But Mystery of the Batwoman had a few small threads, a lot of formula supplemented with a mediocre setpiece on a cruise boat. Honestly, this is more than Scooby Doo than the Dark Knight, he lacks the punch and biting that the animated series had.
