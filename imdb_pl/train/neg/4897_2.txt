This film is the biggest disappointment for me in Tsai Ming-Liang. From each frame emanates laziness. So I will not analyze it either. But some observations: <br /> <br /> 1. If the premise is drought, why should we see the scenery of the city with blooming green trees? I wonder if this was supposed to mean something in the metaphorical context of the film (in which the desire informs about the desire for intimacy, and the watermelon is a trivial substitute, sex). Or it's just a matter of poor film production that does not mind being coherent. <br /> <br /> 2. We do not know what happened to the porn actress, why she is unconscious or, probably, dead. It seems that it does not matter if the message of the highest alienation is successfully (= bombastically) released, but in hindsight, its inert body turns out to be a cheap dramatic trick, a pretext? as unpaid and exploitative as the activity in which he is employed. <br /> <br /> 3. In this movie, nothing has been said that Antonioni did not express himself better 40 years ago? and without unnecessarily humiliating your actors. <br /> <br /> 4. Musical numbers (derived from "The Hole") seemed to be the idea of ​​artistic counterpoint in high school, performed at this level of high school. If that was the case, the point sucked.
