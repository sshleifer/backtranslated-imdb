Slasher films are often seen as derivatives, repetitive and honestly unoriginal. I happen to be a fan of horror movies, but this movie was so bad that my words failed me. The script is missing, the plot is absurd, it works amazingly bad. Just all smelly that I've wasted my time. It had all the entertainment value of the 15th part of the movie, which was first and foremost terrible. <br /> <br /> Who lit this mess? <br /> <br /> I liked only two things in this movie. The first was the murderer's mask - which was nice. The second was an Austrian affinity with a pathetic curse. <br /> <br /> Save yourself and avoid this hideous mess.
