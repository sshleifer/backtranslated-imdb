I saw this film years ago in the group tradition of Fast Forward Film Festivals, where we decided to rent several B films and vote for those who chose the worst. <br /> <br /> At night, when we watched it, he was chosen the best because of the appearance of a fictional and fun costume. <br /> <br /> Certainly it is a stupid, kitschy movie that will be watched with full understanding that you are watching low budget down. Personally, however, I would not recommend additional substances ... this film will leave its own mark on you. <br /> <br /> It made a big enough impression on me that I tried to get my hands on a copy for several years. <br /> <br /> A good choice if you are going for bad movies. This one is funny and I remember jumping music ...
