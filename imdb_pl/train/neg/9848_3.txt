This film has some great nei-ne and neorealistic visualizations and tells a story that is refreshingly free of the Hollywood sugar coating, which was only possible because it was essentially an independent foreign film. But some of the scenes last much too long (especially the wedding), and exaggerated acting and unrealistic dialogues are more appropriate for the scene than for the silver screen. <br /> <br /> The dialogue window was particularly distracting and the movie seemed to get worse. Most of the heroes are Americans, Italian or Italian immigrants living in New York in the 1920s and 1930s, but their dialogue sounded like they were practicing lines for Shakespeare's art, while they were mixing cement and laying bricks. At the end I was laughing, not because the filmmakers wanted me to do it. I think it was possible to defend poetic poetry, saying that the heroes would speak Italian, and dialogue is a literal translation of how they really talked. But that absolutely did not work for me. <br /> <br /> Another line of dialogue made me laugh for a different reason: the son of the main character, born and raised in New York in the 1920s, suddenly raises a charming buzz British accent. I'm guessing that it had something to do with the fact that the film was made in England. <br /> <br /> I give this film "A" for effort and intention, but a much lower score for performance.
