Dave (Devon Sawa) and his friends Sam (Jason Segel) and Jeff (Michael Maronna) were getting through college. When the terrifying Ethan (Jason Schwartzman) discovers his secret, he blackmails them to help him score points with beautiful, good-natured student Angela (James King). <br /> <br /> Stupid and incompetent "comedy" - much more moan-induction than making laughter. The film tries to attract audiences to its target group with its disgusting gags - but NOBODY WORKS. What's more, it is full of worthless, unattractive characters - and the character of Schwartzmana is so repulsive that it is the main rotation. The film even tries to use sex / actress Mamie Van Doren from the 50s and 60s in the most scandalous movie scene. ALREADY !!! <br /> <br /> Further downgrading is the total predictability and waste (once again) of Joe Flaherty's comedic talent - when this guy stops accepting any role that comes and does something worth doing? <br /> <br /> In total, the only thing I liked was James (aka Jaime) King, who was very attractive - and deserved better. <br /> <br /> It gets no more than one of ten from me.
