Margret Laurence probably did not intend to accept any of her novels for the film, let alone the Stone Angel. Hagar, as a character, was a person who constantly questioned the social norm (Gainsay, who would dare, someone?), And almost ended up sacrificing her humanity in this process. Symbols in the book (Stone Angel, Silver Thread, etc.) They are a constant reminder of this old and new fight and the slaughter (so to speak) along the way. <br /> <br /> Although the movie is quite faithful to the story of the book (but this is not really a plot of the story, right?), I think that he missed the sense of capturing the spirit of the film. There was no Hagar rebellion (due to resistance). Bram could have been a lot more primitive than depicted, and Hagar's father could have been played more "traditionally", so to speak. If the creator of the film insisted on stronger portraits, the film would lead the point home. <br /> <br /> In the same spirit, why should we see mobile phones, organic products and other upgrades? Are we trying to get a few points to get some points (eg a Muslim girl and indigenous people). Hagar and what. in the book everything is politically correct, so why should we see it in the film version. Modernization may be an excuse for low-budget operations, but using it as a pretext for sending subliminal, politically correct messages that are completely irrelevant to the novel (and the film) seems to throw blows below the intellect. <br /> <br /> There is also an audience. It seems we were conditioned to see bitter old people as cute and lovely. Why should you laugh every time Hagar is angry with her? I doubt that Magaret Laurence would like her readers to laugh at Hagar or with them. These people are frustrated and filled with anxiety, and we just laugh at them. I do not think Hagar and other people in her situation have any justice.
