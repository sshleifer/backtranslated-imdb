Good people, I came across this film in the evening while evaluating the work. My academic specialty is Anglo-Saxon literature and I can say that no one has ever done the kind of honor it deserves. Icelandic "Beowulf and Grendel" is the least offensive I have seen, and I paid $ 3.00 for my copy. This version of science-fiction belongs to the Christopher Lambert version. Yuck. <br /> <br /> What I did not like? CGI for one. Amazingly wrong. More importantly, loyalty to the story, not to mention slim acting. I'm used to both versions that I've seen. <br /> <br /> Delighted Regardless, Peter
