I can not believe that this series still evaluates 9 out of 10. I saw if these voices were in the first two seasons, but what would happen if someone continued to rate them high? I was a big fan of the first season. I was addicted - all mysterious, uncertain, unexplained events. You never knew what would happen next. In the second season I was still faithful, but I was a bit nervous that some basic things have not been explained yet. And instead of giving you more answers, you seemed to have more questions. I LOVE the suspense, but you have to throw people bone from time to time to watch them. <br /> <br /> Now, I do not even remember what finally turned me off, but somewhere in season 2 he had enough. I'm not a huge fan of watching meetings - and you clearly can not miss the episode, so as not to interrupt what's happening. So it was no longer worth the effort for me. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that they could not be a little wiser and more caring towards loyal fans. I agree with some of the posters that it seems that ABC just became greedy and decided to check how long they could stretch this show. Do not they realize that they will eventually lose more fans than they would gain.
