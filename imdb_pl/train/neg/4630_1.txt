Released in 1965, but clearly filmed many years earlier, this is an inept little crime melodrama with inept sexuality. As usual in grindhouse movies from the era, there is no reason to disarm and dress for no reason, complemented by bad music, irritating narrative and awkward editing. The cafeteria scene puts a lot of emphasis on preparatory work as we slice back and forth between characters to avoid seeing them. All we get is the shots of out-of-screen reactions to the voice! Misty Ayers, 50, several times pulls the French panties before the action begins. It is always accompanied by what is evidently from romantic to western music, from mothers to dishes, mixed up randomly to produce, among other things, the most exciting lighting of cigarettes captured on film. Watch how it does! Watch how it hits the match! Will he inhale or will he be caught by the Apaches? Only time will tell !! The film is about a wicked tale of how Sally gets cheated to work in a brothel, falls in love with a drug and can not escape. For some reason, we are treated as one of the most bored and boring prostitutes who ever engaged in a movie, literally doing nails or knitting, and not playing with a client. Some incredibly bad comedy (the boozja accidentally drinks milk! Har! Har!) And playing in a silent movie does not help. This is one of the worst feature films I've ever seen, even on the Something Weird Video marquee. It's really a movie curiosity for people interested in the history of cinema - very bad cinema.
