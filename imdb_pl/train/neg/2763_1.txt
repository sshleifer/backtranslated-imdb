I went to see D-War with a whim and very low expectations. The film did not meet them. <br /> <br /> I have nothing against the stories that extend credulity - remember Reign of Fire? - but I expect them to be internally consistent. This movie jumped from the way out, without stopping for breath, all intertwined with special effects that were far behind LOTR and even Godzilla. <br /> <br /> A mysterious warrior from Korea, interestingly transformed into a Caucasian antiquarian and appearing like deus ex machina, to lead the unfortunate heroes out of their last mess. Special agent from the FBI, who seems to be totally determined by the ancient Korean folklore because of the excellent "paranormal" division of the Fed, which has not been noticed so far. Lovers kiss on deserted beaches, where someone exclaims, "I never wanted it to happen." A reborn couple of long-dead Koreans who "died like lovers with stars." Mystical pendants, faceless hordes of robotic soldiers (which owe much to the Peter Jackson orcs) and a snake that wasted so much time roaring that every time the chosen victim is in range, something is distracting. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is frightening, the wooden effect and the whole effect was, to be honest, boring. However, for me the final moment was the end, after the finale, when the music to the final credits was - Arirang! It is rather like closing Akira Kurosawa's "Ran" with the performance of My Way karaoke - and let me make it clear that I do not compare Shima's director with Kurosawa in any way. <br /> <br /> In short, indulgence, a vague collection of clich√©s and narrative insurgents that may appeal to the sense of melodrama so common in the popular culture of the Koran, but should not be worth the price of a ticket for any serious filmmaker - or even not such a serious film viewer. I would suggest that you completely skip the movies and go straight to the video, but I'm not even sure if it's worth that much.
