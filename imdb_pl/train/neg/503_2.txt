After the first release of 4 very good Eurotrash titles, REDEMPTION managed to scrape the bottom of THE BLOODSUCKER LEADS THE DANCE. In this movie, I did not find NO Bloodsuckers. <br /> <br /> The story is simple. The mysterious count invites several actresses to her castle for a small vacation. After a few sexual crazies, the girls are cut off one by one. Who is the killer? Who knows? There are more red herring on Friday than on the local fish market. <br /> <br /> The pace is terrible. The story is stupid, and the scenes with the skin are not that great. <br /> <br /> Let me miss it.
