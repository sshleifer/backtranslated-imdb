Hearing such praise about this game, I decided to watch it when I came across it on the cable. I do not understand how it "frees" women and their "struggles", focusing on a given topic. I think that if you are interested in stories about private parts of women and their impact on their lives, this is for you. Otherwise it is rather boring and boring. If anything, I think it's a bit degrading. <br /> <br /> I asked with a friend who also watched it, and she thought it was terrible too. So it's not just the guy who "will not get it".
