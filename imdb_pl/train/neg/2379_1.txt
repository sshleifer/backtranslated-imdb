I'll confess. I think Uma Thurman is the most beautiful woman in the world and made her a mission to see every movie she was in (unfortunately it includes terrible movies Batman and Robin, The Avengers) and this one. /> this must be the worst movie I've ever seen. (yes, even lower than The Avengers). everyone looks lost and is incoherent, unbelievable. <br /> <br /> even if you think that Uma is a goddess like me, PLEASE do not give up this movie. you hate yourself the next morning.
