In 1976, the western was an exhausted genre, and the creators of the film clearly knew about it. Still, instead of postponing the project and saving us from the necessity of watching it, they went any further. Apparently, in need of an interesting story that the audience would come and see the movie, they decided to make it as blatantly violent and unpleasant as possible. Hell, it worked for The Wild Bunch, so why would not it work here? Of course The Wild Bunch had a great script, but The Last Hard Men script is just old-fashioned junk. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to understand what attracted Charlton Heston and James Coburn to their respective roles. Heston plays a retired lawyer who goes after a fleeing group of convicts led by an aggressive outlaw (Coburn). Hunting becomes even more personal when Heston's daughter (Barbara Hershey) is kidnapped by convicts and subjected to sexual degradation. <br /> <br /> It's really a blood-thirsty movie in which every time someone dies, the smallest details are displayed. It's really disappointing, because the pairing of stars sounds like a delicious perspective. The film also has no pace or urgency. It takes an eternity to go on, but when the action finally arrives, it is distracted by an emphasis on unpleasantness. In conclusion, this may be the worst film Heston ever produced. I am sure that this is one of the productions he does not like to put in his excellent CV.
