I have read the book several times and this film does not go exactly as it should. I could let this slide, it's a movie. However, I have serious problems with setting the movie. Nobody mentioned that this film and the book on which it is based are based on actual events that took place in Nebraska. I live in Nebraska. I grew up in the city where this movie is supposed to be based. First of all, the "small" city, which is referred to as the environment, is the third largest city in the state. With a population of around 50,000. Grand Island is the largest city between Lincoln and Denver. Secondly, the scenery of the film is wrong. Grand Island is located in the Platte River valley. Which is very flat with very few trees. I tried to watch this movie, but it was crazy that my home town was so badly treated. It was a real event. Large parts of the city have been destroyed. In the book, they talk about riding bikes from the island of Mormon to Fonner Park. I think you could, if you do not mind 15-km drive in each direction.
