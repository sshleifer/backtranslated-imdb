Feeding the Masses in Providence, Rhode Island strives to be a satirical view of the role of the media in government. At best, it can be applied to how the US is trying to control the media during the Iraq war, but it ends with a feeling of emptiness. There is never tension in the story, and acting is never too good. The worst thing is that the direction of the movie is terrible, focus more on the strange camera angles that do not transmit anything but "Is not a strange way of holding the camera." The special effects are very bad ... at some point the video of the explosion is green in the city and is funny at best. <br /> <br /> The film has a few bright spots ... namely ads for post-zombie services (including reclamation and party bus services). But there is too little for the film to be valuable. <br /> <br /> For a better zombie movie, try Hide and Creep. It has the same poor production value, but there is much more joke, humor and talent behind it.
