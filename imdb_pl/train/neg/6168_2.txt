Hmm, IMDb rating 7.5, good comments, blah, blah ... good, two of my friends and I ordered Pizza, we sat down and wanted to see something as nice as Ichi or at least something mindless but fun like Versus. But the Naga Blood sucked. It's a complete waste. Okay, the scene with a woman who likes to eat is quite special. But that's it. Nothing more nothing less. I will not be a summer plot, others have already done it, I just wanted to stop the noise. But look at it and evaluate for yourself. Maybe we can move the assessment where it should be. One more thing that comes to my mind: the soundtrack is even worse than ever Carpenter - okay, John's cool ... :) 2/10
