I went to this movie thinking that it would be a neat football drama (in the same style as Remember the Titans); however, I left, feeling as if I was just attending Ted Haggard's sermon on Revelation. The only thing that was missing was a request for tithing at the end of the movie. Probably more could be obtained from a TV interviewer than from this bad excuse for entertainment. At least in the televangelistic sermon, there are quotes from the Holy Bible, not quotes from the populist self-help pulp. The plot was completely predictable to such an extent that anyone who had a sufficiently long period of attention could spread the entire story in the first 15 minutes of the movie.
