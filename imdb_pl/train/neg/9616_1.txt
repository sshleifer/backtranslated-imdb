First of all, I had doubts, looking only at the DVD box and reading them, saying that it was a group of teenagers gathering at the lake, where they would find themselves or something. Any film that has such a message unfortunately failed even as a corrective film, except for the first Friday 13. <br /> <br /> I wanted to get up and stop watching the movie at least 10 times, I just thought it must be a little better. No. Usually, I think that every movie has something that you can take from it. It has nothing. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and find something constructive for 80 minutes. I like, give me cutouts or eat dirt.
