I loved this book because my fifth-grade teacher read it to our class many years ago. I read it to all my grades 3 and 5 in the last 18 years of teaching. Apparently the movie was made in the past, but I never managed to locate it. Well, my students and I were so excited when we heard that Disney had brought Madeline L'Engle's excellent book to the screen. <br /> <br /> When I watched the movie, I had the most hope. As the movie became more and more depressed. He spanked me badly! I have never been so disappointed with my favorite adaptation of a movie book. I understand that movies can not strictly stick to a book, but they do not have to change things because of it! Most, if not all, departures from the book were completely unnecessary! <br /> <br /> Initially I kept my opinion and listened to how my students are discussing the film. Well, it's not just me. Almost every one of them felt the same - he revealed the wonderful story that Madeline L'Engle so skillfully created! <br /> <br /> Why, wondering, Aunt Beast looked like Chewbacca from Star Wars? Why were not Calvin's hair red? Why was not the lady who did not have the proper "witch outfit" so clever in her name? Basically, everyone was wondering - why almost every detail had to be changed? <br /> <br /> I've always dreamed about how great this movie would be. I'm still waiting for this movie. This was a wrinkle in time only in the broadest sense. I'm going to write to Peter Jackson and try to convince him to take on the task!
