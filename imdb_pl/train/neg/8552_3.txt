The biggest mistake in my opinion is the effort to give the action a strong support in the news of the early 80s (the fundamental difference between this movement and the more fantastic, ironic, and therefore timeless Die Hard). History is an unsuccessful attempt to glorify SAS commandos.

" In any case, her performance is higher than the others and somehow I feel that the movie failed her.
