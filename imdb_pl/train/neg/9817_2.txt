Wow ... pure brilliance. <br /> <br /> Transforming a thriller / suspense / horror movie into a comedy. <br /> <br /> After watching this, I never laughed so much about the horror before ... an absurd plot with 3 characters that were just wildly developed - either they were not written in depth or too deeply. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch an absolutely horror movie with stupid dialogue, a mixed up plot, useless scenes, wasted characters, bad sound and poor development in general, this is the one to watch. <br /> <br /> Remember to focus on the classic "food processor" scene and completely ineffective police scenarios. /> <br /> This is an amazing new low screen performance and writing, and sitting all the time makes you stupid, brave or bold.
