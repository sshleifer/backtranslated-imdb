It's the worst movie I've ever seen. The Avengers had this dubious honor? but not anymore. Acting in "Jill the Ripper" is terrible and has only been eclipsed by the story. This film is just as intellectually stimulating as Telletubbes. He does not know if he wants to be a S & M movie or a really bad thriller. Watch only under the influence of a strong poisoning or if you are in bed and need to dissociate the skin. This script should be converted into pornography, it would not require too much effort and would have a longer shelf life. Porn, even bad porn, would not harm Dolf Lundgren's career in the way that movie is.
