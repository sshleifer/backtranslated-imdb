Okay, I've always been a fan of Batman. I loved the animated series and even Batman Beyond. I even read a batman's comic book from time to time. So as you can imagine - I was a little excited when I heard about this series, and then I was SERIOUSLY disappointed. This series is nothing. It does not even begin to compare with the original series. It's like one long TOY advertisement. No depth. And what the hell was with Joker? Who, in my humblest opinion, is the best villain of the Batman of all time and killed him. I would like to say that his project was the worst. Actually, I would like to say that in this series there was something that was creative or interesting. In short (because believe me that I can say a lot more) DO NOT waste time on this program or on your money.
