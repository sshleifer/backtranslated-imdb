I could not wait to see this movie for a long time, after seeing "Return to Paradise", which turned out to be rough. I was very disappointed. The most realistic thing in this matter was the unpredictable ending which, in my opinion, was partially stolen from "Return to Paradise". <br /> <br /> Maybe I expected too much. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the Danes, Beckinsale and Pullman were fantastic in their roles. Although I did not like the Danish character and, first of all, I found it very irritating. <br /> <br /> I could not see anything realistic in the movie. This could be done much better, for example, more emphasis could be placed on conditions in prisons and ordinary horror. The film was too joyful to be realistic. There could also be more action and tension. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is the tragic ending. I could not predict it. But until then I did not really care what happened to them. <br /> <br /> 3/10
