I've expected a lot of science fiction and thriller movies this summer, but I was very disappointed with this movie. While some people left the movie, I decided to stay, only to laugh with other spectators on acting, lack of tension, funny ending and difficult to follow the story. I found myself almost as lost as the main character of the film. The only advantage of the film was the soundtrack. This is one of those beginning star movies that they regret later. In retrospect, I would not even rent it, let alone pay more than $ 5 to see.
