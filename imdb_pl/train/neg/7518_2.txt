Horror films can be fun with low budgets, bad acting and a bit of panache. I think the film is simply a lack of panache, because one stupid boring stage in turn makes people grasp ridiculously harmless claws. If it was not so boring, it can be fun. <br /> <br /> Horror can go a long way with a tired concept, such as "kids from college in a haunted house" in a similar way as Evil Dead movies had a lot of fun with a similar standard story. Hallow's End unfortunately does not go too far. Actually, it does not go anywhere. He spends most of the hour creating unnamed and anonymous characters with an endless interpersonal drama. I do not mind the development of characters, even in horror, but they are strictly one-dimensional characters (alpha male, milquetoast, ... um ... characters that exist mainly in sex scenes). forty plus bloodless, buzzing minutes with them were more frightening than when the bloodshed began. <br /> <br /> Well, he suggested bloodshed anyway. When kids from college turn into anything that they dress like in their haunted house (one is a vampire, someone is wearing O.R. scrubs and some white pancake), they look almost the same as in their amateur haunted house clothes; The Dead Hate The Living, using a similar theme, is a masterpiece in comparison. There is really no blood, no real fears. <br /> <br /> I thought about it from almost every approach. If it were to be a tight, tense horror (which would explain why things moved so slowly), pathetic erotic scenes and cheap monsters would invalidate it. If it was to be a real horror of blood and guts (which would explain schlock) ... where is the blood and tripe? And anticlimax is one of the uninteresting endings of the movie I've ever seen. It is a kind of film that, despite the fact that there is no narrator in the film, is recorded by voice-over, because all senseless dialogue was simply not enough. <br /> <br /> It was difficult ... coming out of it, I wonder if I was just sitting in a Christian horror movie. Maybe "I know that hell exists" opening did not have such meaning, but there are some hints (or incorrect targeting - I'm not sure which ones). Despite all the profanity in the film, a line like "gosh-darnit" comes out a bit absurd, like most beloved crucifixes, god-fearing and fearing Satan, especially after some lewd scenes of R & A sex (one heterosexual, one lesbian). <br /> <br /> If it is a Christian company (the Highland Myst logo has even a bit of a similarity to the crucifix), then this movie is heavily pregnant at the atheist camp. An omnipotent being can not be such a bad filmmaker. <br /> <br />
