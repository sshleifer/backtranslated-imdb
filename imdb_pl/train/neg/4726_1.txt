Another film about tortured egocentric, arrogant, insensitive, hateful, self-destructive hero, for which we should care. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong. I am very open to all kinds of off-wall films, which as the main character have a strongly self-destructive character. I am opposed to the fact that there is so little background for this guy. Why did this guy hate himself and the world? If the scenario could handle it, they would be sympathetic to him. Because it is simply an unpleasant, hateful character, not tragic, just hateful. <br /> <br /> After making great efforts to make this guy as mad and antisocial as possible, and his fate was as dark as possible, the writer has the courage to make a happy ending ... <br /> <br / > This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but there's a fight in it! Man! Do not waste time.
