Usually, I know after the first minute of the movie, will I hate him or adore him ... but now I was wrong. <br /> <br /> The beginning was great; "It's based on real history," and blah blah blah blah was fun. After that, the fairy tales and the description of life of the guys with pictures made me think that I made the right choice. <br /> <br /> Then, seeing the fun, fake look from Toronto was cool. Also, the situation and appearance of the house seemed to confirm my first idea. <br /> <br /> It's maybe the first 10 minutes of the movie ... which then looked like eternity. <br /> <br /> Maybe I just do not understand English Canadian humor (it's possible, English Canadians do not always understand Quebec's humor), but hey ... there were enough things for a short movie, * nothing * more. Maybe it can make a difference to the title? In any case, almost everything was fulfilled, and in my opinion, not many things were even funny. <br /> <br /> Actually, "creating" was better than a movie. At least you understand the motivation behind what makes everything wrong. The potential of the idea was great; that's why I rented a movie, interested in "annoying people disappearing". But I did not know that the entire universe would disappear, and with it even the point for the film. <br /> <br /> If you are a Canadian English, it seems that you can appreciate the local humor, considering the surprising number of people who gave this movie for 8. Otherwise, think twice before you lose your valuable time .. .
