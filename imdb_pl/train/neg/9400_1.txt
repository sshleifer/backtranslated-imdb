It is very unfortunate when such a film is made. In the film, which is at best amateurish, a lot of work and money was put in. <br /> <br /> Editing is dragging, there are obvious mistakes that could easily be improved in the second shot and the soundtrack is unimaginable. With this film, much more could be done. It seems to me that they have run out of time or video tape. <br /> <br /> Manual shots have a clear amateur character.
