Was there anything positive about this film? Critics who knew nothing about video games could see the mistakes they made in the games. No injuries are clearly visible at the beginning, which are a prime example. <br /> <br /> And maybe I missed something, but was not Super Mario Bros 3 a game that had never played before? Well, if this is the case, and I did not miss anything ... where does the figure of Fred Savage, and even the girl, know so much about the game? We are talking about things that some people do not know after the second or third playback. <br /> <br /> In addition to actual and gambling errors, there is a general low quality of the film itself. Nothing here is really very unforgettable. The kid was not even as good at playing video games as he showed. Many of the children I knew at that time were much more experienced. In addition, acting and the story are just average in their strongest points. The characters are faint and completely uninteresting, "The Wizard" (the youngest child) is a very quiet, completely dry banality of the child of a small child who hardly ever talks about the trauma. It is not unrealistic, it was a fact that he had to be cast into a movie, even to start creating a story that would exceed 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> Honestly, the only value that you can find here is nostalgic nature. If you grew up with this movie, you'll like it if it was good or not. It was about kids playing video games, and when you saw them, you were probably obsessed with NES. But if you did not love it as a child, there is simply nothing that would interest you, and very little that would prevent you from turning it off. <br /> <br /> No, I did not like it.
