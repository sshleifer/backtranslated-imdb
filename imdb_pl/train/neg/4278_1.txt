I just picked up this movie for PLN 1 in National Wholesale Liquidators and after watching it I feel like I've been cheated. <br /> <br /> I do not know if I've seen a worse movie than this one. Honestly. And I would never write a negative film review if it was not for such a huge respect for the subject, I mean Stephen Foster and his music. <br /> <br /> First of all, what is it? Is this a musical biography? Yes, a lot of Foster's melodies are intertwined here and there are those pseudo-Broadway-Jerome Kern numbers that stink more than the Mississippi delta. I mean, someone has PAID to write this drivel? Second, Foster's REAL story is fascinating. Why do not you even approach this CLOSURE? Third, what did they have for the great Ray Middleton to get him to do this movie? Pictures of him with young boys? With communists? What a waste of great talent. <br /> <br /> So, Foster's friends, the truth and good entertainment, be afraid ... be very, very, afraid.
