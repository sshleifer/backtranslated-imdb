This is the worst film in the Home Alone series I've NEVER seen! Watch the first and second parts, but do not let anyone tell you that it's BETTER than the first two! I mean, you're not really creating a movie, then you're creating a sequel with the same characters and actors, and then you're doing the next sequel with DIFFERENT characters and actors! I mean, it would be good if it was not a "Home Alone" movie, but it made it a Home Alone movie. Culkin is too old, so you have to stop making sequels! God, this movie makes me sick! Buy parts 1 and 2.
