Let me start by saying that I did not watch this movie at the beginning with high expectations. He was recommended to me by a friend of average taste in movies, and "MTV" was stuck on the cover, so I did not expect much. I was expecting tears, too dramatic, but at least effective. <br /> <br /> I was wrong. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me start that I have never read a book or watched any other versions of the movie. <br /> <br /> Acting was my main problem in the film. It is terrible for God. The main girl is quite average, but compared to the rest of the cast is Maryl Streep. The main "Hero", Heath, is simply awful. He can sing well sounding, banal songs, but that's all. His acting broke the "sad" moments, being so bad in points that I just burst out laughing. Isabel's girl was also quite awful, and her brother was just a flat character played by an actor who could not show emotion. And when he tried, it failed. Neil Patrick Harris was the only decent actor playing Edward, although it is obvious that the direction was bad, because even he did not live up to what I saw. Oh, and my father was not half bad in my memory, but he was in the movie for such a small time that I hardly remember. <br /> <br /> The story itself was not very good. More breaks than you can imagine. Predictable history (until the end I barely understood). UNIQUE one-sided figures without real depth ... In general, they are not interesting or fascinating, nothing that we have never seen before, has done MUCH better, and nothing worth seeing here. <br /> <br /> It is supposed that the end is a tear squeezer. Nothing did that. The tip is not built at all, it's almost like reflection. In fact, I had to ask my friends, WHY the end really happened, and when they explained it to me, I had to look at my face, "Wait, when did they say that? What?". Never a good sign. Editing was probably the worst I've ever seen, although I understand that fading is disappearing because it was originally created for television, but there is really no excuse. <br /> <br /> In general, a movie is just junk. I'm a sensitive guy, I cried during two episodes of the Simpsons. I never cried during this shit, not even close. Really this movie is not worth your time. If you really want to see the tear squeezer elsewhere.
