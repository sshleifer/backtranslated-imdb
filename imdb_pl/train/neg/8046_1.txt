No? I did not think so! Well, in that case, all you have to do is stay away from "Do You Wanna Know A Secret" because it's just a senseless post- "Scream" slasher with absolutely no value. The plot is extremely funny; the characters are unbelievably stupid, the gore factor is insignificant, and the whole is simply boring! As you can already deduce from the title, this film is mainly inspired by "I Still Know What You Did Last Summer", because events take place in a similar situation, and the killer's motivations are equally stupid. Why anyone would like to steal ideas from junk like "IKWYDLS" is a complete mystery to me. At least this movie may depend on the valuable stand of Jennifer Love Hewitt, while girls from this garbage are, besides brainless, also terribly unattractive. A year after the still unresolved murder of her boyfriend, Beth Morgan, her new adulterous lover and four other straightforward students, go to Florida to spend their holidays in Spring Break in a fancy beach house. The killer did not make any move for a whole year, but now he follows the pile to Florida and starts massaging them, leaving the title message as a business card. You really do not have to be a horror expert to quickly figure out what's behind an unspeakable funny mask, and writers trying to put you on the wrong track are embarrassing. Because the plot is so thin, most of the film is a purely insignificant fill, including subjective threads about the incompetent police in Florida and the "mysterious" FBI inspector who seems to have a personal judgment to make. Murder inexplicably happens outside the screen (do not you hate it when it happens?), There are not even any free T & A to enjoy it, and better do not start with the quality of dialogues. Suffering through such nonsense only makes you realize that the delightful spirit of the 1980's slashers has passed for good.
