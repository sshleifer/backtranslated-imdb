I was very disappointed with the 1970 film based on the story of Bernard Malamud. This is basically a story of possible redemption, racial prejudice and failure to live a life based on distrust. <br /> <br /> A black Jewish angel is sent to help the struggling tailor and his critically ill wife. If Morris Mishkin (Zero Mostel) only believes in an angel (Belafonte), his wife Fanny (Ida Kaminska) will recover. The problem is that Morris basically gave up on life and just does not believe that Belafonte is an angel. <br /> <br /> When he believes this, Fanny improves, but in the end he has doubts and Fanny suffers because of it. It would be very nice if the last scene was English translation, when dying Fanny speaks to Morris. <br /> <br /> Jan Kadar, who successfully directed Miss Kaminska in her Oscar-nominated grand spectacle from 1966, The Shop on Main Street, also directs this film. Kami≈Ñska is reduced in the film to mainly bed scenes, and her kindness in speech really does not reflect the desperate situation she faces. He calls Ruthie, their daughter, who showed them disobedience, leaving the Jewish religion. For most of the movie, he does not realize the appearance of an Angel in his apartment. <br /> <br /> The scene in the pharmacy is tangled, and the scene in which the Angel's friend confronts Belafonte in their apartment is unforgettable, but everything is too short. <br /> <br /> We do not know why Belafonte is in danger and why he died. <br /> <br /> People watching this movie had to leave the theater in a state of depression and desperation.
