I saw this obvious schlock fest on the shelf in the video store. And before I got my first VCR, I thought I was baptizing him with this little gem and it's bad filming at its best! <br /> <br /> The dialogue is accidentally funny. And it contains an episode with Donald Trump. Anthony Quinn is inexplicably in this. And like Christopher Walken, he seemed to want to play in every bad movie in later years. This movie is Mr. Quinn's National Bears. <br /> <br /> Contains such lines as: "Shut up and let me fight !!!" <br /> <br /> And "You're talking a lot of g√≥wno!" <br /> <br /> And priceless back: "Unfortunately, he is angry, furious sh_it!" <br /> <br /> You will be surprised by the fight scene, as Bo makes SOMMERSAULT through the pool table! And whether a cool kick kung fu appears from the roll! Chop chop socky action and T and A thrills !!! <br /> <br /> What movie fan Schlock could ask for more? Oh, and when Mr. Quinn's character commits suicide and goes back to visiting God as a ghost, he asks him why he killed rather than advised With a debilitating disease, he says: "Real men do not eat quiche." <br /> <br /> Uh, yeah, yeah, if Bo was a smart cookie, she would call an exorcist, right there and there!
