This movie is wearing a TV stink. However, it started with great intentions, including great-looking sets and authentic props and costumes. The film quickly turned into a horrible, tacky dialogue on the nose and threw himself into a television, melodramatic acting act. The heroes were so unhappy that sometimes I thought they were going to turn into a mad puddle of a goat, and the action was so intricate and poorly cropped that it looked like the soldiers were just standing and shooting themselves. The Germans were so unrealistic that watching them was painful. The only thing the German officers talked about is how wonderful the Americans are. Please, take my word for it. I am a big fan of the war genre, and this movie is nonsense. Nevertheless, this DVD has an excellent additional feature, including letters from the front lines of the First World War, so that this rental is not a complete waste of my time.
