Let me first say that I'm not a fan of Dukes, but after this movie the series looked like Law and Order. The worst thing was to fill Roscoe and Boss Hogg. Burt Reynolds is not Bosse Hogg, and even worse was M.C. Gainey as Roscoe, if they ever watched the show, Roscoe was not a tough policeman. He was more Barney Fife than the role he played in this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of ordinary mistakes, the cars break up and continue as nothing happens. The worst example of this is that the general meets Billy Prickett and the general falls into the dirty mountain, clearly slowing down to the closest stop, but he wins the race.
