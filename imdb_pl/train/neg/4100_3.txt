A little disappointing movie, I would say: the acting was somehow tense. In many cases, I just could not feel that the facial expressions match the spoken words or intentions of the scene. An angry (or sad, happy, frustrated) character should convince the viewer that he is angry (or sad, happy, frustrated). It does not happen here. <br /> <br /> Comment on the writers, assuming that you already know that the characters were accurate. They do things and say things that appear out of nowhere: a figure that Andrew accuses his parents of sending signals at dinner; then he blows up and storms, telling his father: "Do not touch me, you ***!". Perhaps if we saw the prequel, we would understand where everything comes from, but there is no prequel, so for some reason we are at sea! <br /> <br /> One strange, bizarre thing Andrew is doing is go to the old quarry, sit on the edge overlooking the "still water" below; then he reaches into his jeans pocket and pulls out a pack of cigarettes and lights one. He did the same three times during the movie; I think we should see it as some tortured act of being lonely and angry? Maybe once, but three times? It could have been up to four times, I lost count. <br /> <br /> Honestly, it is a fact that he recently learned that he was adopted; this happens very early in the film, so there is no point in any dramatic change that he could make because of this discovery. It is not entirely clear whether this is why it is so bitter or when it comes to something else. <br /> <br /> I think that the film has a kind of Lynchian, but is the director really trying to scale such a movie for the first time? mountain so early in his career?
