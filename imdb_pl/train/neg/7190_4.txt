The 7EVENTY 5IVE story includes kids from college who play a cruel phone game that unexpectedly (for them, if not for fans of horror), lets them in. THE 7EVENTY 5IVE STORY, on the other hand, is a horror film that had a little promise, unfortunately overwhelmed by a really bad magazine. <br /> <br /> What could be funny if in a sense the stupid, old-fashioned story about the temptation is derailed at the beginning by mistakenly convincing its creators that the audience will enjoy watching a group of loud, tearful, rich children, who for the most part the time of the film bites each other. With the exception of the police detective played by Rutger Hauer (in a smaller role, which mainly aims to add the only film power), each character on the screen is a different race of young holes. <br /> <br /> Man and woman, black and white, simple and gay, the whole team of shallow and penetrating college kids carries most of the film's narrative. What's worse, because the story is about playing PARTY, which does not work, most of the time the scenes are completely filled with these little b ***** ds. For this reason there are several breaks for the viewer that have to endure the angry shredding of the thinly drawn heroes. Although at least some of these people are supposedly friends, invariably all characters interact in a very hostile way, long before the actual appearance of a real conflict. This leads to the worst possible result in the clichÃ©s: the audience, who is supposed to care for potential clients, instead of not only cries of an anonymous killer, but wants him to come to collect vain brats far earlier. > <br /> The real shame for this poor performance is that otherwise 7EVENTY 5IVE actually had some potential. Visually, it's fine. For the first time directors Brian Hooks and Deon Taylor know how to build a tense mood. They also manage to provide some competent, though rare, moments of the classic style of the 80s. Surprisingly, the production cast is also quite good. It is not the case that actors are unable to express realistic human emotions; just a script (written jointly by the newcomer Vashon Nutt and director Hooks, who performed much better behind the camera than with the keyboard), there are no such moments. <br /> <br /> 7EVENTY 5IVE is difficult to recommend because its familiar assumption and little emotion can not outweigh the bad taste left by the story led by a group of unpleasant characters. In this summer play, the real secret is why someone should take care of a group of young people who can not even like each other.
