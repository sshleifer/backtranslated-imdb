Imitating your long title, the film finds ways to get closer to the 90's sign. Beautiful sets are here with everything that makes Hamer's production a valuable trademark, but Paris sunk in the fog is a sign of lazy neglect. The story is obvious and it can be summed up in a dozen words so that there is nothing unexpected and nothing worth more than 5% of your attention is to be expected. <br /> <br /> The director is heavy as a direct transfer from the stage game, the actors are mostly stiff like wax figures (this is the Hamer function, only sometimes is better described in the whole package). My conclusion: this movie is rubbish, it is not worth the time I spend this evening. Eternal life is a boring thing and I should hope that the guys responsible for programming at Cinemath√®que will know better.
