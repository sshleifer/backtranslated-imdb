What can I say about this film. I do not know what to say. I could keep talking about how stupid this movie is forever, although one thing that I REALLY think about was music. And in addition, someone commented how much they liked it. For them, all I have to say is that he was taken out of one of the best martial arts movies of all time Fistsof Fury with Bruce Lee. If he was still alive and had ever come across this movie, he would have been scared. the rest of the movie is completely absurd and wastes the tape. I'm talking about tape because that movie could not be filmed. Now I feel more stupid that I'm wasting 30 minutes of watching. The only reason I even saw it was because my roommate picked him up with morbid curiosity. What is this world going for?
