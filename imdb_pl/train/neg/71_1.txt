This movie was so relentlessly angry that I could not believe I was watching him. The directing, editing, production and script seemed to be made by junior high school students who know little about movies. There was no narrative flow that made any sense. Big emotional moments and culminations (as at the beginning between Heath Ledger and Naomi Watts) and relationships between the characters (as at the beginning) do not come out of where and are not set, as if they were in an elegantly and effectively filmed movie. The characters are unfortunately poorly developed, which makes it difficult for us to make any connection with them. The action, surprising, is not completely wrong, but the terrible letter will cancel relatively convincing performances. The movie plays like particularly bad T.V. western / epic, and unfortunately it reduces the fascinating (true) story that it tries to tell. I have read many reviews that defend the film as important to Australians because of the subject matter. That's all very well, but only because Ned Kelly is an important Australian historical icon, he's NOT GOOD. Nobody says that the subject is not good, only the quality of the film itself. Pearl Harbor was a very important historical event for the Americans, but that does not mean that I will defend the film and say it was good because it was still bad. A breakdown all around, although Heath and Orlando are great.
