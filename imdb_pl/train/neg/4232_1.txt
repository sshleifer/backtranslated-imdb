Karl Jr. and his father now lead an army on a distant island. They caught three men who came across the island. Who to fight after a while. (well, those who survived) This one has uninterrupted blood, gore and slaughter, which would be good if any of them looked remotely, or if the production did not look like it was made of the week saved money (I could practice there. worth a few days). The horrifying dubbing did not bother me so much and I suspect that if I was really drunk, some of them CAN be a bit funny ... maybe. But in fact, after just 78 minutes, the movie was still too long ... Oh, I do not know ... 78 minutes. Do not waste time. <br /> <br /> My class: F <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Bonus movie: "Zombie '90: Extreme Pestilence"; and Trailers for other Shock-o-Rama movies
