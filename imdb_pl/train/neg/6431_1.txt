This film is a terrible distortion of lies and exaggerations that were created by the most shameless madmen who have ever worked on a television film. History is wrong and a complete lie. In this movie, there is nothing that exactly depicts Senator McCarthy. It's just a terrible scam and it amazes me that someone associated with this production has ever got another job in the industry. The Marxist-Leninists who wrote this trash did it to attack a man who was confirmed by history and their fear that anyone would dare to destroy communism. Unfortunately for these communist nut professions, Ronald Reagan took control of where McCarthy went and could not stop him, the end of the Soviet Union and his cohort. <br /> <br /> Never, never watch this movie looking for the truth about Senator McCarthy. Read Ann Coulter's book "Betrayal" to get to know the truth about Senator McCarthy better. <br /> <br /> It will also be helpful if you read about what really happened to Senator McCarthy, by reading http: // www. thenewamerican.com/tna/1996/vo12no18/vo12no18_mccarthy.htm
