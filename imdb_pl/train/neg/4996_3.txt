I really liked the first half hour of the movie, but, wow, did it change or should I say "just stupid". This is another example of outdated humor. It could have been fun in 1940, but not now .... even close. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell is always interesting. I especially liked it when it started to go from the boyish look and the high voice of Busby Berkeley's musical to the place where it is mature and it sounds as well. <br /> <br /> He was fine as "Jimmy MacDonald", but the rest of the cast played stupid characters, and the worst was the boss (Raymond Walburn) Maxford House Coffee Company, who was screaming all the time. He was brutal to hear and was a great detriment to the film.
