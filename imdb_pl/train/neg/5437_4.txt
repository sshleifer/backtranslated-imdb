Based on Michael Chabon's novel The Mysteries of Pittsburgh, he talks about the young son of a notorious gangster who spends his last teenage summer with two friends. It's 1983, and young Art Bechstein (Jon Foster) is at a crossroads. Completely opposed to his father's life style, Art plans to become a Stockbroker. Visually invented with painful attempts to create beautiful cinema indie movies, the whole movie has the impression that the director - whose previous effort Dodgeball was funny, if not commercial - is desperately seeking independent credibility, combining different aspects of other indie movies, but sprinkling them with stars such as Mena Suvari , Sienna Miller and Nick Nolte. As with many full celebrities, the premiere at this year's Sundance seemed like a vanity project sponsored by the studio, which is to help the director gain several independent points of reliability - in this respect he failed and as a film in itself.
