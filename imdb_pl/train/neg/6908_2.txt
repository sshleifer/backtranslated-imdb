This series had potential, but I suppose that the budget would not let her see this potential. An interesting configuration, unlike "lost", falls flat after the first episode. The entire series, 6 episodes, could create a fascinating 90-minute movie, but the creators decided to drag it over and over again. Many scenes were unbearably slow and long without moving the action forward. The music was very annoying and did not work in general. There were a few characters we cared about because their characters did not grow in time - well, it grew a little bit. The ending was just as horrible as the rest of the series. The only kudos here is for the art department and wizards, they created an interesting appearance, it is a pity that the author and director lacked foresight to do something interesting with this element
