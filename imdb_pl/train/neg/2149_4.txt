Well, the big money machine did it again! Disney very cleverly uses morons like me who feel that we need to have every movie (good or bad) with a Disney pseudonym. Why am I still waiting for these "sequels" that make Don Bluth look like Leonardo Da Vinci in a bad day? Cinderella 2 consists of three threads (already a bad choice!). Is one of Disney's most endearing creations deserving at least a linear story? Of the three, only the last comes close to the quality of the animation and story I would expect. The music is terrible and modern (which means that in two years it will be dated) and adds nothing to history. Why does everything have to be updated? You know, the original cartoon is still popular because of its timelessness, so why not have respect and faithfulness to the original thanks to songs that reflect the same style? Oh dear, I can not wait to continue Sleeping Beauty. Instead of music based on Tchaikovsky's themes, we'll get music inspired by Britney Spears !!! So Disney, if you listen, remember that not all of us are uncritical children here. What about throwing a bone or two supporters who were long enough to know the difference between craft and nonsense?
