I have no idea what it was, but I can definitely say that they did not have a budget. Bad acting, horrible cinematography and a lame story and some decent special effects do not create a good movie. WWF-style cinematography will make you cry ... where is the tripod ?! The filmmakers were aiming high, but they were painfully lacking in trace.
