It was on DVD to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Blazing Saddles, in itself brilliant, but not that. I have not seen Mel Brook's name anywhere and I can guess why it makes a lot more sense to not be associated with this pilot. My gawd, who would find it funny. Sure, there may be a problem with the race, but for me it was not funny, because it just is not funny. It's as if the writers did not even try to be funny, just make money on joining the Burning Saddles. Did they expect this concert to last several seasons when they did this pilot? Flat, they did not care. It was a quick cash cow that thanked God she did not pay. I think this is useful only for historical purposes or just to show how stupid and unimaginable Hollywood writers can be.
