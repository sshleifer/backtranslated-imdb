I often do not make a one-star review, but the computer does not allow me to make negative numbers. <br /> <br /> Initial titles tell us that we are already in deep water. Although it is a low-budget movie, there are 17 producers. No. <br/> <br /> At the beginning of the story, offensive husband Kenneth returns home to his family in an exclusive closed community. The house is a pigsty. His wife, Della (Kim Basinger), let the children run all day long. <br /> <br /> OK We are already in deep water. Mrs. Basinger was 55 when the movie came out. Are these her children or grandchildren? It's Christmas Eve. Della goes to the mall, a long scene that could be cut. In order to master the idea of ​​male eeeeeeevil raging raging in the universe, he goes past players in uniforms playing in the rain on Christmas Eve. Sure. He sees the vehicle as a bonus with a slaughtered deer stuck to it. <br /> <br /> However, in the driving scenes we have some tension. It's raining and the traffic is bad. First, we see Della trying to drive and smoke at the same time. Then Della tries to run and talk on her cell phone at the same time, at some point turning completely to check the cluttered backseat in search of the phone charger. <br /> <br /> Wanders around the mall, sees an old friend from college, tries to buy things, but her credit card is rejected, wounds, maybe her husband is grouchy because he broke down, but it's too complicated to the script could follow. <br /> <br /> Many of them are struggling with the most absurd gang in film history in the parking lot. One white boy (Lukas Hass watches his career going down to the toilet), one black, one Asian and one Hispanic. Imagine the company "Up with People", which went to evil and you come up with an idea. <br /> <br /> Although they have a weapon, it gives them an attitude. The policeman from the shopping center arrives to investigate the confusion and shoot him in the head, firing more than once. The parking lot is crowded, it can be anywhere, nobody notices. <br /> <br /> Della escapes in her car and instead of choosing a police station or a well-lit safe zone, goes to the construction site, where she kills all four bad boys one by one with tools (literally) at hand. <br /> <br /> A large spoiler in front of you. <br /> <br /> He returns home. The car pops up, so it goes through the rain. He checks the children, goes downstairs, and when her husband annoys asks what he has in the mall, he shows him a gun and shoots him from a distance. <br /> <br /> The four-punk experience was supposed to lead to Della's personal reinforcement. Instead, we know that her children will probably spend the holidays in foster care or in the family home, because the state will gather them while she answers the accusation of murder. Four punks can be considered a legitimate murder in self-defense. Husband, another story. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I saw it on the cable. If I saw it in the theater (did it get an edition?) I would be furious. I am sad to see talents such as Mrs. Basinger and Mr. Haas, who are wasting their rubbish. <br /> <br /> A very good thing. It was written and directed by Susan Montford. Mrs. Montford has not received another loan in writing or directing since the release of this item. There is justice in the world.
