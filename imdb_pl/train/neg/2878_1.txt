Do not watch this movie. Bad action and stupid effects. A complete waste of time. I was hoping to see a lot of cool murders and hot chicks, and the director relied on movies about the slaughter of animals to shock you, observer. Disgusting. The murders are pretty bad, basically strangling. One woman puts the worms in her mouth, one puts the raw burgers on her face and suffocates her. BTK = broiler BTK, a new sandwich of the "killer" of the king burger .... ha ha. I think that this movie did not rely too much on facts. I mean, he was the real killer of BTK, he did not wear a bunch of rodents, scorpions and worms ... and oh yeah ... also a slaughtered head of a cow. Conjecture.
