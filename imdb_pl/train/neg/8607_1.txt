<br /> <br /> The film "Snails" is unique, because titular vermin is actually good guys in this horrifying story about nature. You see, these poor snails have been mutated by contaminating bad people and they have no intention of doing anything malicious, they are simply snails - snails with sharp teeth that eat meat and expel poison, but still snails. The real bad people are people who either actively try to destroy our beloved snails, or react too poignantly when they meet them. <br /> <br /> For example, take a scene where a guy puts on a glove full of snails. They just spent time in a comfortable glove when a huge hand came out of them and reacted instinctively, defending and biting the guy. Now, instead of seeking medical help for a snail bite, this guy runs around his greenhouse, screaming like an idiot, pours very volatile chemicals, kindles fire, knocks down the bookshelf and cuts off his own hand - then fire and volatile chemicals mix and his house explode. How can you blame snails? <br /> <br /> This movie paints a portrait of people who are less favorable. The characters in this movie are a stupid sheriff who hates everyone, a drunk hick who is mean to his dog, and an uneven helper whose wife is at least forty-five years older than him. There is also a set of drunk teenagers <br /> <br />, which are attacked during copulation and we have to see the genitals of lean, long-haired freaks. In the meantime, there is a guy who looks like a demonic Leslie Neilson, who yells: "You're not allowed to announce all the best!" For some reason. Eventually, this parade of disgust is complemented by a guy from the classic "Pod People" MST3K, whose face explodes after eating a snail lace salad (another fate that was avoided, blamed helpful, harmless snails). <br /> <br /> People are portrayed as greedy, stupid, racist, alcoholic, and on one pointless stage, as would-be rapists. At the climax of the film, the villains try to burn snails that are helplessly swaying in the sewers. Because they are idiots, people manage to EXPLODE THE ENTIRE CITY. Only they do more damage than snails ever! <br /> <br /> If you hate people and I know you will, you will appreciate "Snails". If you're a fan of bad cinema, you'll also appreciate what the director Pieces and Pod People mean. It's bad enough, silly dialogue, illogical twists, bad special effects, senseless scenes and bad dubbing to attract your attention.
