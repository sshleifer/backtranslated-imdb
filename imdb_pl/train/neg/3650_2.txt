No laughter. Yes, I watched the whole wreck of the train, but only to not later wonder if Cleese came to his senses in the second part. (No, he does not.) <br /> <br /> It may be historically interesting for you young people to see that the British "humor" contained such "jokes" thirty years ago. <br /> <br /> What makes me even more surprised is reading the comments of other reviewers who think that it is not very good, then turn around and give him high votes. If the vast majority of the comedy you've seen is far worse than this, I'm sure I'm sorry for your torture. <br /> <br /> The humor level of this series appears for young children, but the topic is not. Who is it for? People who like repetitive and long-lasting double shots, pratfalls, drug jokes (interesting only as a short trip back to '77) and other 'low' humor. The Three Stooges are still fun and they were also for me as children. They put a little effort into creating jokes. This, however, does not suit schlock. I am afraid that IT is the end of civilization if these things are really accepted as valuable. Then you will tell me that cobblestone is popular. :(
