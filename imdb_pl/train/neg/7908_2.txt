I did not expect much when I saw it at the Palm Springs Film Fest this weekend. It was an alternative choice when two other films were sold out. Nevertheless, I was hoping. It sounded a bit like "Bride and Prejudice" (L.A. guy falls on Indian beauty, parental conflict, blah blah). B & P was not perfect, but it was a nice movie with good laughs and nice characters. <br /> <br /> "My Bollywood Bride" had nothing to do with it. Acting seemed stiff and the way to numbers. The characters were so trivial that the story seemed to be written by a high school student. Technically, the sound really worried me. There seemed to be a lot of dubbing dialogue. I mean a lot. I know that sometimes it is necessary, but it sounded like half of the movie was filmed in the closet and it became very distracting. <br /> <br /> The two stars are a bit generous.
