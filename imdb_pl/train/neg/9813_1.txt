... and I saw some bad ones. <br /> <br /> I do not have anything good to say about this movie. The actress is poor by Jennifer Tilly - as you might expect. Daryl Hannah does a good job, but nothing can save the movie. <br /> <br /> The biggest disadvantage of this movie is that the plot is so weak - although based on a good premise - that the writer has resorted to the "stupid trick of the heroine" to create an elaborate tension. When everything Daryl Hannah has to do is hide, she runs out before the persecutor. The hospital scene is absurd. Without revealing too much what is happening for the plot, I think it would be difficult for a bloody little woman to carry a pregnant woman without being noticed. Lame. Very poor. <br /> <br /> Save some time and choose another movie.
