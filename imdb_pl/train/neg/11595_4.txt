STAR EVALUATION: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Alicja beat Freddy at the end of the last movie, now trying to re-adjust your life. But her unborn child bears a demonic presence - Freddy, trying to enter her world again. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to notice the directors who made the breakthrough in the direction of Freddy's films - Charles Russell (Eraser, The Mask) Renny Harlin (Long Kiss Goodnight, Cutthroat Island, Cliffhanger, Die Hard 2) and here Stephen Hopkins (Lost in Space, Predator 2.) But while Russell and Harlin did a good job, Hopkins IMO did something from a fragment with this entry, which should be quickly forgotten. <br /> <br /> The story is clearly stretched as far as possible, with Freddy's funny father and a funny-looking demon. Even after about an hour and a half, everything becomes quite tiring and, of course, not terrifying. <br /> <br /> The expression "bon appetit, bitch" is the only unforgettable point of this second wise, very forgotten entry. *
