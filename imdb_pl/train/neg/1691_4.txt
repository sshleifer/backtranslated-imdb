This film is nothing more than a well-prepared series of strained sequences interrupted by the inevitable "gotcha!" At the end of each. There is really no character development or real story. There are only the most skeletal motivations so that characters can do anything while they are moving forward to their inevitable destruction. It's just an excuse to show a terrifying ghost kid (who seems to have gotten some family cat mixed up in his ectoplasm) and his mother-ghost (with long black hair hanging on his face, like "The Ring") a bunch of cardboard cutouts, two-dimensional excuses for human characters. <br /> <br /> This English-language version of "The Grudge" is the equivalent of cinematic fast food; satisfying temporarily, but it should not really live. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
