Most adaptations of books are bad, but this movie skips the key parts of the story and changes the description and some characters. They changed the story, merged the scenes and rearranged them. They added to this absurd things that never took place in the book and would never have happened. <br /> <br /> If I had not read a book before, it would have been an incredibly boring movie, it did not make you care about the characters, how they like or dislike them. Turns heroes into jokes. <br /> <br /> Awful. <br /> <br /> Funny. <br /> <br /> Loss of two hours of my life.
