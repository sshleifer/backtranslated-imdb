I like Chris Rock, but I feel he's wasted in this movie. The idea of ​​remaking Heaven Can Wait is fine, but the filmmakers have been following the story of this turkey too closely. When Eddie Murphy converted Dr. Doolittle and The Nutty Professor, he repeated them completely - so they became Murphy movies / vehicles, not just summer modifications. That's why they were successful. If Chris did the same, it could be a much better movie. A few laughter that comes is when he does his stand-ups - so he could have made a concert movie as well. It would also be much more fun if the white man whose body he lived in was a truck or hillbilly driver. So why is Hollywood doing such trash? Because people watch it - because they like Chris Rock. So give Chris a decent script and give us better movies! Do not rewrite movies that were not so good in the first place!
