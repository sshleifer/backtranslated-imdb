I read Thornton Wilder's game last year in eighth grade. I was also forced to sit down with this poor translation on the screen. Let me tell you that this is not a great game, it is easy to surpass it, but man deserves a much better shot. Acting was really missing, the scenery - honest to God - looked as if it had been designed from cardboard by a group of three-year-olds. As if it could not be worse, the sound quality is poor ... there is such a buzzing mind when the actor says ... and I also could not help but notice that the chemistry between George and Emily does not exist. All actors seem very uncomfortable to be there. There is no music. It's black and white, which would be OK, but it's all the more cheesy. In any case, I think that if you are going to see this movie, which I really do not recommend, do not put your hopes high. The performance, however steadfast, is probably better.
