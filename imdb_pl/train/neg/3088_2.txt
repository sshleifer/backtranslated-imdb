Aliens have mastered intergalactic space travel, but they do not know how to open the vault's open door, but they can push the door closed by five people. <br /> <br /> 3.

To impress a prudish friend, you must "save the world ... err ... neighborhood" from strangers. <br /> <br /> 6. All women are whores, openly or secretly. <br /> <br /> 7. Slender nightclubs look like bad eateries. <br /> <br /> 8. Scummy waitresses are doubling up as dancers of The Fontanelles (how did they talk to you?), who can only perform bad moves in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> 9. A number of army secretly dream of being Rambo. <br /> <br /> 10. Grenades apparently have the "flash-bang" setting. <br /> <br /> 11.

Dot. Meat does not have much meat or does nothing good. Even average. Just bad.
