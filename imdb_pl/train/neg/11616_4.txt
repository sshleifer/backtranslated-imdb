I did not like the movie at all, Joshua. Perhaps because I saw another, much better similar movie titled Orphan 2 days earlier, but maybe because the movie was not very good. I'm going with a ladder. Sure, the conspiracy of the bad child is not exactly original, but that does not mean that the movie can not succeed. It could have been tense, funny and chilling, but instead it was slow, boring, calm and really left me nothing more than "it was not very good" when it was over. <br /> <br /> Finally Joshua's motives are revealed. I will not give it up, but the reality is that it has not really achieved its goals, because despite Very Farmigi as his mother, Abby, disappearing about 3/4 of the movie, all shots indicate her return home soon. She was involved in a psychiatric institution because she was losing her mind, but then the father / her husband Joshua was accused of manipulating her medicines, which tells the audience that the institution realized that she was not mentally ill, but rather medically treated. So ... should not she come home soon? Did Joshua fail? Will his mother not live with him, his sister and perhaps his father soon? I ask the Father because his future remains open. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day I did not care about the characters. An evil demonic child, Joshua, was not really scary. The plot moved slowly, and when she rose she was still boring. Each time the tension was suspended. When it was over, I could not believe that I was sitting through the whole thing. <br /> <br /> 4/10 just because acting was good from parents, especially Vera Farmiga as Mother, but if you want to see a movie about a bad "child", go to Orphan. Now it is a movie that took a non-original concept and created a brilliant movie.
