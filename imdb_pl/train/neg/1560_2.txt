You can not even say that this movie is bad, because it is unfortunately just painfully mediocre. There is no real joke or imagination, the thin plot is stretched to the absolute limit, and the "jokes" (which are predictable and worn out) are thrown to such a large length that boredom and yawning quickly overtake the viewer. The next step towards the sad fall of John Waters and the reminder that what "shocked" or amused us 30 years ago does not work the same now. We have seen this before and no longer breaks taboos because they have already evaporated. Big miss.
