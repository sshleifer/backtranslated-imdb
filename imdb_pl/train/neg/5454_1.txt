Wow, this movie was just damned awful. It's so bad that although I did not pay to see it, I still wanted to get my money back. <br /> <br /> The movie is unintelligible. This is a mish-mash of science-fiction slogans that have been made better by much more qualified filmmakers. The performances, especially when leading, were on the top in a less engaging way Ed Wood. Speaking of Edu Wood, he would be proud of character dialogue. He is too taciturn, with no trace of irony or sense of humor. What's more, it does not make sense, nor does it have a story. <br /> <br /> Visual effects are fine, but not enough to go "oh wow, that's cool" and they just seem to be interjected to be "cool", not to be a good story plot. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was another mish-mash of things that really never gave any mood. Again, it seemed that the director was just dropping songs into the movie, trying to "be cool". <br /> <br /> Which leads me to the last point. Perhaps if the director were more worried about the story, the story and the dialogue, instead of trying to "be cool", he would not have done such a stupid phrase of "short film". <br /> <br />
