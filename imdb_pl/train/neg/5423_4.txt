I've been using IMDb for several years, but I've never written any reviews before. However, this movie disappointed me so much (even with a modest score of 6.4 at the time of writing) that I could not be silent anymore. <br /> <br /> The noise is the story of a New Yorker (Tim Robbins) who is so concerned about noise pollution that he accepts the alter ego as a guard, "The Rectifier", and destroys all the cars he finds, with the sound of a car alarm. <br /> <br /> I take the name of the movie is a bit misleading. Although there are one or two cases of addressing or exchanging other sources of noise, the only real goal of our hero are car alarms. Car alarms, car alarms, car alarms. There really is no other focus. When the film attempts to link other examples of noise pollution to the problem of car alarms, it seems that he has just been thrown in to give character to the character of Robbins. <br /> <br /> Yes, we are all irritated by noise. Nobody likes the sounds of car alarms. Of course, we all have the intrinsic desire to take a baseball bat to the screaming vehicle, and this movie uses this fact, actually the very fact to sell the movie. I say "almost" because there is also a grossly coined sexual relationship (including a totally unnecessary three), which is of course thrown in for those movie viewers who need such things thrown in to enjoy the movie. Honestly, it's unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Robbin's character, very briefly in the film, becomes completely unrecoverable. It seems less that he no longer wants to endure noise, but rather focuses on the noise that began to lose mental health. The first half of the movie is basically a story about how he turns away from the bad guy hitting the car in the character of the little guy, The Rectifier. However ... transformation does not take place. It just changes the name of yourself. <br /> <br /> I could continue for a moment. Annoying generalized social commentary appears from time to time to add pretentiousness to the film, and a happy smirk that never leaves Robbins' face does not help either. <br /> <br /> In general, I think it's very obvious what this movie wants to be, because it's almost stuck in the throat, but in my opinion it fails to a large extent. Only one guy, cheers.
