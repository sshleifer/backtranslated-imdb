This is really terrible. There is no weight, all swim in BG. Motion Capture is a great toy, but this movie shows that you really need people who know the animation to do an animated movie. THE MACHINE CAN NOT DO WELL. If you perceive this as a bizarre movie, you'll have fun finding continuity errors ... In A 3D MOVIE !!! It's funny to see a princess dress move like something about different physics. You need animators and 3D animators, not data entries that are familiar with 3D programs. Pay attention to intersections, like elbows, how they lost their volume and are deformed. The person who made the character design very good certainly suffered when he watched them move.
