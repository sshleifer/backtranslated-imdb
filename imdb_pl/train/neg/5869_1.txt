Almost 30 years have passed and HATE everyone who is involved in this film. It remains the worst movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Before I saw it, I never bothered Rivers in one way or another. After watching this movie, I have an allergic reaction when I accidentally saw it on TV. <br /> <br /> I have been drawn into this - contrary to my better judgment - by peer pressure. However, when leaving the theater, these friends swore that they would never annul my choice of film again. Almost thirty years later, we still carry mental scars from this film. <br /> <br /> On my deathbed, one of my complaints will be the time when I wasted the hope that this movie could improve. It never was like that. <br /> <br /> If you ever get a choice, you'd rather look at the person sitting in the movie. <br /> <br /> I have registered in IMDb comments only in the hope that maybe I will be able to warn others before watching this movie. If I can save only one person before watching this, then my existence on this earth will be justified.
