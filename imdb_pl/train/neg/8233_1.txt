It was probably the worst movie in history, seriously. Actually, I could do better myself, even it has not been properly configured. It's as if this movie had a budget of $ 5 and remained with the change. Do not watch this. I could not even go through this movie, I had to turn it off. I gave it 1/10, because it was funny how the producer of this movie wanted it to be a horror movie, but in reality it turned into a really bad comedy. Basically, a group of girls ran into the car, the headlight broke down, and the owner of the car followed them. What I saw is a woman with a gun that tells girls to take off all the clothes, what the hell? it must also be some cheap porn movie.
