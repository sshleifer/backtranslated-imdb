When I watch this movie, it is worth seeing how he marginalizes black men. The film devotes its time to showing how powerless is the most visible Black man (except for the heroic moment). For most of the film, other Blacks (and dark-skinned Black women) in the film are in the background, barely visible. <br /> <br /> The character of Vanessa Williams was strong and sympathetic. The viewer can easily identify and sympathize with her. There are also quite visible and three-dimensional forms of support that are light-skinned, and some white figures with a certain warmth and dignity. But 99% of black men in this movie are just invisible men. Silent shadows in the background, irrelevant. Such a terrible drawback, but something unusual in the mainstream media.
