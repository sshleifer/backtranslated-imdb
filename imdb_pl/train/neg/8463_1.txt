No screenplay, bad actors (poor Melissa Gilbert) ... Beurk Beurk Beurk ... <br /> <br /> Give a budget to do this ... In Belgium, we create ten films that win all prices in Cannes with this. <br /> <br /> The last time I saw such a NULL-Film was Hypercube. But the script was better. <br /> <br /> Does anyone know if the director was a graduate of a school movie or a policeman? <br /> <br /> The better thing in this movie is the word "End". <br /> <br /> Why authorize to sell? 1รง is expensive. <br /> <br /> I paid ten dollars to buy it. <br /> <br /> For me, I paid BIG MISTAKE for the millennium. <br /> <br /> It's a pity. <br /> <br /> Next time I will break my arm, but I will buy this type of sh * t.
