It's like the title of this thread. The only impression I got from this movie is that the character Marlee Matlin was always angry, so cynical and so pathetic. The first date of her heroine with the character of William Hurt, in which they danced, was stupid. In conclusion, I tried to finish watching the movie four times, and all four times I fell asleep. I would still watch this movie with one intention ... to overcome my problem with insomnia, because all I have to do is fall asleep. Sweet dream.
