After watching some great things HBO - Band of Brothers, Rome etc. - I have to say that I had high expectations before watching the first episode of "True Blood". Jesus. Often the script was written by an 8-year-old, some parts are just horribly filmed, (Scene in which Bill saves, I mean walk, he's chucking a guy around his neck and choking him magically! embarrassing, if you want my opinion, or a few moments before this scene, when she finds out that the couple went with Bill, funny, they hear how they plan their stuff and like it 5 seconds later, magic! Three of them disappeared, no fight, no noise or whatever. <br /> <br /> I mean, the idea of ​​the show seemed interesting, mysterious, intriguing, vampires co-existed with man in our modern society ... but to be honest, I do not think they really want to do something more than a small soap show that the average teenager watches all the time, but no one else cares about it ... Unfortunately, the script is poorly written, at best mediocre, shallow and very predictable, I often thought it was a joke or something. <br /> <br /> Actors deliver really unconvincing performances if you want my opinion. It seems that they take this program very lightly, as if it was a regular family television program with a low budget (maybe this is what you get if you get rid of the family part). The only actor that seemed pretty good to me was Stephen Moyer as Bill, given the poorly written, extremely short answers that he had to say "What are you ..." "Can I ever call you ...", I think, that he did well, bringing out a somewhat mysterious frightening part of the vampire that everybody who has the role of a vampire must actually have. Anna Paquin was also fine, but no more. But the guy, though he's playing her brother, jeez, is awful. The scene in which he is arrested is simply a shame for modern television. Acting is bad, building site looks fake, and two other guys, "Why is he arrested? Uh ... I do not know ... "It was quite embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I think was completely overlooked was the way they presented Sookie's psychic powers. They make us hear what people think and say both at the same time, and it's just bad. Often it just seems unnecessarily chaotic, as if people were thinking of something like an annoying radio channel, and when it approaches them, it hits the right frequency level and must hear everything they think. <br /> <br /> And finally the sex scenes are simply unnecessary and this vampire sex tape was just disgusting. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong - I wrote all these comments not because I thought the program was BAD, but because I was very disappointed. I was expecting the quality of things. I did not think it would be like this. It is definitely not a GOOD program. On average at best.
