A really disgusting, vile movie with a touch of real humor. <br /> <br /> In particular, the figure of the father is vulgar in the extreme (deliberately, of course) and presented in the most pathetic, bland way. <br /> <br /> My wife and I found this movie horribly annoying, without any redemption opportunities. Honestly, I regret that I have never seen it. <br /> <br /> I think that this British effort is sick and serious. : joy from the manifestation of deep deprivation and misery. <br /> <br /> Manufacturers should be ashamed.
