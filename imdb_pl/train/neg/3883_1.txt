No, I'm just kidding. It was terrible for God. <br /> <br /> I watched my local science fiction station last night watching movies every month as part of monthly topics. This month it is "Space Turkeys, or: how I learned to stop worrying and love bombs". Movies so bad that they should never be done. It was a good choice. <br /> <br /> Everything in this movie is awful, with two exceptions, gore makeup (which showed the potential) and editing (which made the rest of the movie a bit, in terms of being awful). Acting is awful all around, dialogue is awful, scenario, direction. This is not a good movie. <br /> <br /> It consists of two forms of special effects, gore and footage from space. I will focus on blood. Watching this movie, I thought, "What was the motivation to do this movie?" People like to create things, of course, but I hesitated if anyone who was involved in it could do something about it. I came to the conclusion that this movie was created as a means to take the role of Demo Effects. He (Rick Baker) actually started quite a successful career, he worked on STAR WARS (1977), KING KONG (1976), MEN IN BLACK (1996), and even THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING WOMAN (1981), as well as a number of other remarkable moves . Besides, I can not say I've ever seen a real, drowning man - amazing or different - but I would have to say that it seemed like a fair representation of one. <br /> <br /> Now that I think about bad editing, I usually think about the scene where someone is talking on the phone, and then, in the middle of the scene, the phone jumps on the shoulder or something like that. This film really highlights the fact that bad editing can take many forms. Especially long and completely useless scenes. Almost every scene went on longer than it should, from a bit of dead air to this crazy scene with the Cleaver Girl. And the severed head in the river, the head is thrown into the river (in slow motion), the film lasts for a few minutes, then we return to the floating head and watch it fall down the waterfall. Although I am sure that everyone was very proud of their severed head, WHAT ARE HELL ?? <br /> <br /> At the end I will mention the scene with a fat lady / slow motion movie right in the beginning. The sudden slow motion tells me that they did not take the picture in slow motion, but later they decided that it "does not work that way" and then it slowed down. Oy vey. In any case, if you ever see another movie in which a hysterical fat woman runs down the hall, and then directly through the closed glass door - all in slow motion, remember - remember the AMAZING COMBATING FAME because * this * is where it all began. <br /> <br /> Films like this are best viewed at home with a group of friends. This one is a bit slow most of the time, but it's just more time to come up with your own liners. This is not the worst of the worst, but it is quite strange.
