A movie that makes you want to throw yourself on a sword. I saw schlock in my time, but after seeing the unfortunate mess I do not think I could ever watch another movie. May God have mercy on the souls who have done so. <br /> <br /> Premise - A silent stud from a former army, a model-type figure from underwear (actually well-preserved) is looking for a girl who sent him a holiday card while serving in the army. He lands in his family living in a granola booth, who are right-wing lumbermen. The family takes him home and takes 2 hours of our hatchling to see that it is better than its liberal appearance, French wine drinking, Porsche riding, loud cell phone, lazy, urban slicking, Jewish fianc√©. <Br /> <br /> Bad characters 1d, 1d motifs. Beating the Pro-Military theme over your head. Ed Asner. <br /> <br /> The breaks in good ads were long. Peter Jason. It's over.
