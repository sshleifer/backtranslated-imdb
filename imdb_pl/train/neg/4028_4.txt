It had all the advantages of a very good movie - good actors (Robert Loggia, Ellen Parker), a good plot (a mysterious space rocket threatens to burn the planet) and many film materials (if the air force had a jet-firing film, it was used). Unfortunately, it is ruined by too much melodrama and an impossible timeline. <br /> <br /> The film concerns a projectile from space, which was attacked by the Soviets and accidentally directed to a low orbit. With less than five miles and a speed of more than 4,000 miles, it emits a million degrees of exhaust, burning everything on the ground, including glaciers, Distant Early Warning (DEW) and Eskimos. <br /> <br /> Every attempt to destroy the projectile fails. <br /> <br /> The first drawbacks of this movie appear at the beginning. Although we do not expect too much from low-budget movies, some things can not be forgotten - just a bit of research. For example, both the Soviets and the US are firing anti-ballistic missiles that hit the rocket with infallible accuracy. However, the first successful ABM tests were not carried out by the Russians until March 1961. <br /> <br /> There is too much melodrama. Dr Loring (Loggia) and his assistant Joan Woods (Ellen Parker) are having an affair with almost the same amount of wood as a log house. Parker's figure cries and boo-hoos in the sacrifice of Loggia, as during the screen test. Loggia is just as heroic as a bored businessman. The scientist (Phillip Pine) is so insistent that he makes William Shatner look like thespian. The bus driver is constantly spitting out nonsense from the end of the world in the scene on the stage. The only good actor is the movie narrator, played by a character veteran, actor Lawrence Dobkins ("Naked City"). <br /> <br /> All this can be overlooked if it is not about the timeline. After sending information about the projectile to DC, the Pentagon introduces a group of scientists. General (Larry Kerr) informs that the missile will go to New York in 63 minutes. Then the scientists conduct discussions, and the ambassadors seek a deadly stagnation to see if the missile is an attack on the part of the Russians and whether a reaction is necessary. <br /> <br /> The movie shows the military are fully encrypted. People of Civil Defense leave their jobs and go to their stations. Eight million people flee to shelters while school buses gather millions of children (and we see the smartest New York I have ever seen, although watching science fiction movies from 50 years seems to be the standard). The press is kept in the dark for tens of minutes. Then, unbelievably, a Pentagon man announces that the missile will go to Ottawa in Canada in 51 minutes! All the above-mentioned activities took place within 12 minutes! Then, to add fuel to the fire, Loggia somehow thinks about how to stop the alien rocket. He slowly produces a platoon load, charges it with a jeep, and takes it from DC to a distant rocket base to place it on top of the projectile. Along the way, he is pushed off the road by a wild driver, breaks down and is kidnapped. Finally, he retrieves the platoon and approaches the base to arm the projectile. Again it's all in the same 63-minute time slot. <br /> <br /> The film also annoys the viewer, making it seem that Ottawa can be saved, only to show men, women and children that they are roasting. It is said that the missile has five minutes to reach New York. Loggia still goes to the base (4 miles more to go). A missile gets into the base and defends, and then a two minute countdown is announced. Everything in five minutes. The districts of New York should at least be burnt. <br /> <br /> By the way, the projectile will be destroyed if you have not guessed it. The ABM head destroys it with a powerful nuclear explosion based on a platoon. Five seconds later, the explosion dissipates and everything is clear. Yes, they caused a nuclear explosion of 100 Hiroshima on the outskirts of New York, and nothing happens. <br /> <br /> The film had all the elements necessary to be a good B movie, but he wasted it. Loggia played his character so lazily that he did not care that he finally sacrificed himself. You did not care about other characters, even the picky scientist Pine played. The tension that should have shifted the film was not physically possible at the time allowed (it would still not be today, even with Jacek Bauer). <br /> <br /> This movie is very difficult to find. As far as I know, it has not been re-released on any medium, and for good reason. I do not know if the film was supposed to be, or was it just an ordinary custom, but there is a scene in which the government sends all the best scientists, military and businessmen to deep huts, saying that they are too valuable to lose them. There is not a single woman or minority in the group. Hari Rhodes is the only black man in the film and gets a short piece playing the piano. It was worse than "27 days", when an alien gives five Earthlings the chance to save or destroy the planet and does not contain any blacks or Latinos. <br /> <br /> I saw it on a special Sci-fi night at Turner Classic Movies and I do not expect it to appear again. If you find a copy of it somewhere, you can put it on Amazon.com.
