I saw this movie today at the Haifa Film Festival in Israel after listening to enthusiastic reviews, but I think critics have just sucked in to Willem Defoe and his wife (director) who were present at the festival. This is by far the slowest movie I have ever seen with many senseless, ridiculously long scenes with nothing. Apart from the fact that Defoe was decent, the acting of two and a half others in the film, including Defoe's wife, Giada, was absurdly horrible (the way they cast the role of the saleswoman in the bakery is outside me). This film is less fictional and the lame attempt to be abstract and wall free. The only scene that caused any reaction in the crowd was vulgar and out of nowhere, as if it only added shocking value to the nausea of ​​the movie. I am sorry that I am so harsh, but really this movie is a valuable waste of time and money. I appreciate good indie cinema, but this movie is not worth the time of viewers.
