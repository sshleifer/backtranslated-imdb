this is a perfect example of something big, which is terribly bad ... so I can advise anyone to watch it? Well, I was a bit obliged by the fact that I was playing in a tiff contest (I still can not believe he won) ... and I stayed only until the end because the director was there on the episode, but it was also interesting ... what's going on? Well, the first half (worth watching) presents three characters: prostitute, music and some kind of official ... first two lies about their professions .. but the third is a real liar ... the other half (do something ruin a good evening) contains a few old breasts and heavy drinking .. but maybe you will see it quite differently ... jury tiff (they drank vodka?)
