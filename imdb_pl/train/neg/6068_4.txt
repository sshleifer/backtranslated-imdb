Vodka Lemon is a charming, yet extremely uneven Armenian film that will delight some and bore others. Although the film is quite well made, it lacks a real "zuj", based on many scenes that will seem widespread for the insightful viewer from the house of art. The film contains a handful of moments of pure cinematic splendor, unfortunately they deserve a film worthy of their genius. Too dark to be a dark comedy and a light drama, Lemon Vodka leaves many confused and ultimately dissatisfied views. You can laugh, but these moments will be few among the sea washed out snow landscapes and an endless series of bus journeys. A noble effort, ultimately caused by the lack of narrative coherence.
