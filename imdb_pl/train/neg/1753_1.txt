Dietrich Bonhoeffer's writings have had a profound impact on my life as a Christian and I have been impatiently awaiting watching this film and learning more about his life. Words can hardly express my disappointment. This film was chaotic ... it contained no information about his life, the historical context, and nothing about his magnificent writings (except for a brief reference to the "Cost of discipleship" of a colleague at the beginning of the movie). Instead, we see him enjoying jazz (apparently in the States) and resting with his friends before he decides to return to Germany. Apparently show your human side. OK, I'm ready for the dramatic part. The part in which he defends faith. Instead, to emphasize, we have a very badly preserved affair with a 17-year-old student. Regardless of whether it actually happened, this should not be the main part of the movie. Now ... I am still waiting for a dramatic part, or some narrative explaining what was going on in his writings ... or SOMETHING to let us know a little about the greatness of this man. drum-roll ..... waiting ..... .... waiting ..... ZIP. Nada. This is the kind of film that gives Christian Films a bad name. All they had to do was set up the structure of the film to follow, with a certain background ... even some of the readers or flashbacks for him preaching from his works ... a story about who he was and where he was. But no ... this is what we have. It does not match the hero of faith.
