I do not know who came up with the idea that orcs are circling around, killing people, fighting and destroying things for vengeance, but my god is absurd. Orcs are certainly not a cold-blooded killer whose film makes them ... his foolishness. Orcs are extremely intelligent, do not get me wrong, but I doubt very much if they know and understand a concept like revenge. So I must say that all I have learned from this film is the entertainment of how ridiculous it was. So at least I was a little amused. Personally, I recommend going to see Jaw if you want to see an Animal-Killing-Humans movie. But if you're like me and want to laugh at something so far from realism, I'd say go further. :RE
