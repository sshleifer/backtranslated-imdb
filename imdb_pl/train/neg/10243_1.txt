It's the biggest pile of nonsense I've ever seen. DO NOT RENT! The creators of this movie should be a band that has ever made another film. It starts with a storyline and then quickly disappears. I think I would rather dry paint than look at the cover. The actors were terrible, the plot quickly disappeared, filming left much to do. There is nothing good to say about this shit movie. If you rent this movie, you will waste money. I really like movies from National Lampoon, but it was a waste of time. Learn to write, learn to act, learn to produce and learn to manage. I feel that I should sue those holes that caused this movie to lose on rental costs and lost time.
