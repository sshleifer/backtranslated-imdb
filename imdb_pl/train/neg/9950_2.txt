If the original idea for casting was preserved (hunting for Rutger instead of Ice-T), this movie could work. Unfortunately, racism had to enter the picture (literally) and spoil it. Mostly the black production staff could not allow the antagonist to be black, so they exchanged the roles of Rutger and Ice-T. This was just the beginning of the spiral of this film. Ernest Dickerson's approach to "directing" only confirmed that it was another commission for affirmative work. Master shot, close up, close up. Gads, "Who's Line Is It Anyway," uses even more creative camera work. Eric's "The Most Dangerous Game" is at least an attempt to modernize the classic story, but does not give us any motivation as to why the characters do it. We never give reasons, except that "nobody will miss these people", why the leader (re-written as Rutger) does these things. Except for the sense of heart of John McGinley and the honest work of Charles Dutton, do not worry about it. One little thing, it was a real accident with drunk driving during filming, which injured F. Murray Abraham and caused the death of a drunk young driver who caused an accident.
