I chose this film on the cover, which was a bad move. It was not funny at all, and the main characters were unbearable. The girl was beautiful, but history and acting were terrible. It had absolutely nothing to do with surfing. A scary movie with a surfing theme that has nothing to do with surfing and no real surfers. Catherine Zeta Jones was beautiful, and the movie will probably be reborn because she is now the center of attention, she is married to Gordon Gekko and everything, but if you have not seen it, do not waste time. A bad movie with GREAT surf, REAL surfers and AMAZING, BEAUTIFUL pictures were IN THE HANDS OF GOD.
