The year 1999 will go down in history as a year in which a film critic brings public opinion astray. First they sent us to EYES WIDE SHUT. Then they overclocked THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, and now MAGNOLIA, which is by far the worst film of the year. What is it about? Who the hell knows. He is full of indulgence and full of evil actions. I always like to stay and watch credits, but when it ended, I could not get out of the cinema quickly enough. Most of the audience who took part in the show I was in felt almost the same. Dates were in conflict with each other, as well as with strangers. It's an ugly and hateful movie that will make you feel ugly and hateful.
