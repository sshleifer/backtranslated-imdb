I never thought of myself as a "student" when it comes to watching movies, watching them, creating opinions and so much. But Unhinged changed it all. This film is undoubtedly the most inept attempt to make a movie I've ever seen. Any kid who falls into the university thinking that he will be the next Spielberg or Tarantino, must receive this film with the textbook "How not to make a movie". Not only is there no history, but the filmmakers were not even competent enough to make a movie worth watching. It's been some time since I saw it, but the only thing I can say is to watch the overhead shots in the opening scenes. They never end! It's almost like breaking teeth, but not so much fun.
