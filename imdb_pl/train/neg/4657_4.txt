Remake (and sequels) have been the basis of cinema since the beginning of the media. However, this is a hit or miss venture. If you take what is good from the original and build on it and update key features that are too up to date, you can be successful. Attention, such films as THE THIEF OF BAGDAD (1924/1940) or KING KONG (1933/2005) were successful. Others, such as KING KONG (1976) fail, poorly. <br /> <br /> SHORT MEETING (1945) is a template for this film. It's as perfect as it would be on this topic and we rate it as IMDb ********** Ten. The story is simple, Love, innocently found by chance and tragically lost. Why did this happen with two (2) executives involved in the wrong time. They are presented in a convincing and sensitive way by TREVOR HOWARD and CECILIA JOHNSON. They are not conventionally leading Star materials, but qualitative character actors. For details, watch the movie. <br /> <br /> What went wrong? Film T.V., converted practically to the stage, with the actors of the names RICHARD BURTON and SOPHIA LOREN should at least get IMDb ****** Six. Both actors seem unselfish, they just appear to hit the clocks and receive checks. Neither are they related to their characters or to themselves. You do not believe that they are in love, or when they finally separate, each is a great loss. It should not be that way and that's why it fails. Sometimes it's better to leave everything alone.
