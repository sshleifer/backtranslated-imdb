Never before has the movie forced me to write a review, but it was only dire.i stuck in it, trying to find what was in the movie, which meant that the spy chose him as his first serious role, but honestly it was bad choice. I made a good book, but it certainly did not work as a movie. I found it incredible, there was no atmosphere and I found a lot of hideous scenes. A musical maestro he could be, but a serious snoop actor is not an actor. Dylan mcdermott and rose byrne were tolerable, but not enough to lead a weak story with poor dialogue. maybe I have completely overlooked this point, but for me it did not fit any genre, did not arouse empathy with the characters, nor did it provoke tension, in fact I found myself praying for the end and suppressing the deep desire to slap all three main characters!
