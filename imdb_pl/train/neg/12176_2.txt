The original Trancers is by no means a great movie. He had huge role-playing holes and very little internal logic. However, it was fun, better done than most low-budget B movies, and can be surprisingly witty. Unfortunately, Trancers II is not one of them. <br /> <br /> Trancers II suffers from many of the same problems with most of the flop sequels. The story is thin enough to look through, and the writing is bland. It seems that the people standing behind this film felt that it is enough to bring back the faces of the first movie friends and not bother anyone else. Even experienced B-class actors such as Tim Thomerson and Jeffery Combs were unable to pull this film out of the mud. <br /> <br /> A brief overview of the plot: Jack Deth (Thomerson) is a future policeman who was sent to 1985 to save the ancestors of his government. Trancers II takes place six years after the events of the first Trancer. Jack Deth is married to Lena (Helen Hunt), the woman he met in the first movie, and they both live with Hap Ashby, the Deth man has been sent in the past to protect him. It was discovered that Whistler's brother (the evil guy from the first movie) went back in time to create an army of Trancer, people turning into mindless killing zombies to kill Ashby. Jacek's complicating mission is that his first wife, who died long before Jack left for the past, was also sent away to stop Whistler's brother, and now Jack is working on her. <br /> <br /> I have two real problems with this movie. First of all, the method of creating trancers in this movie is radically different from the methods used in the first movie. It is annoying that in a rather poor example of Soviet revisionism they behave as if it was always a technique. <br /> <br /> Another thing that annoys me is that the love triangle between Deth, Lena and Alice Stilwell (Jack's first wife) receives very little time for the screen. I was particularly worried because it was much more interesting than the actual plot of the film. It seemed that it was something that was thrown in to fill the space in the film. The character of Alice in particular seems very indifferent to the fact that she joined her husband only to discover that she is married again, making her either very shallow or very badly written. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can think about watching this movie is watching the entire Trancers series (currently a total of six films). Otherwise, even if you're a fan of the original Trancer, stay away from this cool sequel.
