When I read the FREQUENTLY other comments, I felt that they were too luminous for this film. I discovered that he completely lost the spark found in earlier Zatoichi films and simply proves that after a long absence on the screen it is best to just allow it. I completely agreed with the analogy of Star Trek with another reviewer who compared the first Star Trek movie to the original series --- millions of excited fans waited and waited for the show to return and were forced to watch the bland and sterile approximation of the original. <br /> <br /> The story is sometimes unintelligible, terribly bloody (although the last NEW Zatoichi Beata Takeshi is much more bloody) and lacks the heart of the originals. I did not mind blood at all, but some of them can be turned off (especially scenes with a severed nose and cut off heads). In addition, time was not good for Ichi - it seems that the movie is broken and sad (much, much more than usual) - and this is something that fans of the show may not want to watch. <br /> <br /> It was a very pathetic return for Zatoichi. If you are not like me and you want to see EVERY film by Zatoichi, this one is very negligible. See one of the previous versions or ALL NEW version of 2003.
