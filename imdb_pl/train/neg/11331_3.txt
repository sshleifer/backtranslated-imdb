With all the disrespect for George Stevens' epic "misreading and misreading", I can only wonder that James Dean's "legend" could survive this trip, I am saying that the bows in the studio at the time came to the "giants" with cash. trimmer of his own "gigantism". Rock and Liz were not much better. Let's just say that the television "Dallas" was an authentic "heir", even if we contemplate "Texans," like Lay and Delay, not to mention our alleged "president" of these lively Amurric states here, we make one of the privileged misery of global dimensions. I have never read the original of Edna Ferber, but I will venture that it is the head and shoulders that outweigh what appears on the screen. And despite all those well-paid, as I imagine, "supporting" actors and celebrities, "Giant" is, at least for me, the dwarf of trifles, invalid promotional campaigns.
