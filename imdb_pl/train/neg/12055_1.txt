Do not spend money or time on this pathetic movie in the guise of cinematography. When every third word is devoted to vulgar language and has no real story, and has a cast of old actors who still give outdated performances of the past and have not evolved in their careers, it leaves a lot to say. I was expecting something better than the award-winning actor Benicio del Toro. The Puertorrican vision that others may have will be irreversibly distorted by such garbage as Maldeamores. The vulgar word at a given time in the film can be used to emphasize a given point of view, and can even be fun or sad depending on the context (see movie Elsa and Fred, for example), but it should not penetrate the story. The film is completely embarrassing and there was nothing funny or even charming about it.
