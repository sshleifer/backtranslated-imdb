Let me start with the fact that I will try not to put too many spoilers in it. I usually like Robin Williams movies, but this gem was not one of them. He was announced as a thriller of suspense. The night listener was nothing else. Simply put, there were 6 people on the opening day of the theater, and 2 of them went out, for good reason. In my opinion, the film was poorly written and directed. Acting was fine, but again there was nothing to work with. The film tells the story of a storyteller who reads a good book of a dying child. However, * put a spooky here * no one can verify the existence of children. So Williams goes to Wisconsin to try to find the author, but all he gets is a headache and excuses from the boy's guardian. That's all, that's all. You wait about an hour and a half and the film ends. He had as many emotions and thrills as a visit to a dental office. Homosexual overtones or subtexts really had nothing to do with the story, and the movie had a bit of profanity, but it seemed that he was thrown there for absolutely no reason and it did not make sense. In summary, I can not really write a decent review of this movie because there was nothing in it, it was as engaging as watching dry paint. I gave him 2 because acting for what was worth was okay and was not directed by Uwe Bolla.
