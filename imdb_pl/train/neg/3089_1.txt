This movie is so bad, it's comical. In fact, the Mystery Science Theater 3000, a television program in which three characters watch and parody bad movies, used the movie for derision. I suggest you watch it (maybe on YouTube) instead of watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Please, do not look at Hobgoblins if you are not ready to stop in the first scene. Actually, I do not see this movie, period. Please. At least not seriously. His jokes are not funny (to put it mildly), and you'll have more fun parodying or watching the parody of it, and then watching the movie. <br /> <br /> You can feel sick when you look, so save yourself. Read a book. Do the laundry. Everything is more fun than watching Hobgoblins.
