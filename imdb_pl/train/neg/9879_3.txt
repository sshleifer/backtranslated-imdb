After watching the movie I was really shocked to see such a high IMDb rating. <br /> <br /> "Fantastic Mr. Fox" is an adaptation of the classics of beloved children, presenting the story of smooth, smooth protagonist Mr. Fox (or "Foxy"), who tries one "last" robbery to steal terrible Boggins, Bunce and Bean . That's right, one short, one fat, one skinny, or whatever it goes. <br /> <br /> I do not know where to start from my criticism. <br /> <br /> Well, I'm a teenager and I've never been a fan of Roald Dahl, but I like his material very much after reading some of his books as a kid and saw Matilda and Charlie and the chocolate factory over and over again. However, this movie is struggling with the audience. Is this aimed at children? Adults? I'm still not sure! Many "jokes" bore a child, especially since Mr. Fox visits eg. Lawyer or complains about being poor. From the audience (I assume that) children are expected to sympathize with the figure who steals and kills chickens. I am an advocate of the food chain, but you can practically see how Mr. Fox bites on their neck! Are you sure it's a bit too much? And also the plot ... well, it's boring. I only stayed hoping that it would be better, but instead I was just getting more and more nervous about Mr. Fox and his son Ash for making stupid decisions. <br /> <br /> Humor, meanwhile, falls. I only laughed once or twice, although I recognized jokes in particular. I think that part of it is that the voice game is so incredibly flat and monotonous. Voice actors do not have a sense of comical timing, instead they tend to subtlety of humor that works only with some media. George Clooney aims to show Mr. Fox as charming and elegant, but his voice has no character. Meryl Streep does not show any emotion, I did not even realize the role of Bill Murray until the end credits, and Ash, 12-year-old fox, sounds like he was about 30 years old. <br /> <br /> I love animation, especially stopping movement, but the visual style has actually scare me a bit. The characters are tall, spindle-shaped and have no heat design. They move with very little fluidity and often the animation is uneven and strange. There is also a characteristic "mixed medium" because 2D components are added sporadically and to no avail. Characters look straight into the camera and talk; it was very awkward. There were one or two moments when Kylie was looking straight at the camera, she did not move and spun in front of his eyes. It really scared me. <br /> <br /> Fantastic Mr. Fox had so much potential. Many people still like it - look at the reviews. Maybe it was not for me.
