Warning! Spoilers! <br /> <br /> This is your typical Disney movie. <br /> <br /> 1. Correct exactly what you have with a foster home, which even has a division of races. <br /> <br /> 2. Invokes the intellect of viewers with straight lines. <br /> <br /> 3. The boy's slender father is almost directly taken from the story of never-ending 2. <br /> <br /> 4. In a world full of crimes, misfortunes, corruption, hunger and other matters that must be settled, only the losing team is worthy of divine intervention. Do you like to swear ?! Where the hell it came from! <br /> <br /> 6. Helping the team, the angel causes pain and humiliation of the opposing team. Very angelic! <br /> <br /> 7. The team of angels help are called ... can you guess ... ANGELS! Disney in the worst! <br /> <br /> 8. "I just got training wings". Brillent line! <br /> <br /> My conclusion: I did not like it at all.
