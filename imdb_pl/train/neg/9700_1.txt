I agree with most other guys. Loss of photons and valuable time. <br /> <br /> Almost no joke is worth what the paper was written on. The only attraction of my pov is Olli Dittrich as Pinocchio. ("Egal, ich muss eh Waldsterben") Reminds old times with RTL Samstag Nacht. It is difficult to describe performances of actors, because most of them do not even seem to have a good time during production and simply "do their own thing". The camera is fine, the plot is funny, I think you would be ashamed, even if you discussed it with lots of beers. <br /> <br /> Besides, I was yawning all the time, I was wondering how such a script could even be considered for production and wait for the end. <br /> <br /> My 9-year-old son was happy, but then he is so happy at this age :-) <br /> <br /> In any case, 1 point for almost 1 point too much ...
