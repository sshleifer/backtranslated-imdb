Suppose you have been on a desert island for the last ten years. I did not hear about Scream and left when part 1 of Halloween came into the cinema. Then this movie would be a blast and a completely new vision on the horror scene. <br /> <br /> At the moment, the rating is 2.7 on IMDb and does not deserve such a low recognition. Cutting the whole way, like "I know what you did," and who-that-that when you get to the end, I convinced me of who and why. nice movie to watch with Coke, popcorn and lack of desire to get a difficult story, deep characters. If the video rental is not one of the best titles, you can take it without risk, but do not expect a masterpiece. I saw much worse.
