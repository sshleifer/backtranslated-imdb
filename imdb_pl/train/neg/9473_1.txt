As a veteran of many, many pretentious French films, I thought I'd done the worst what industry had to offer and I could bear anything. But not this. No sense, unyielding, violent, unpleasant, meaningless ... The film has nothing to offer and is accidental hatred and aggression disguised as pretentious art. Avoid at all costs.
