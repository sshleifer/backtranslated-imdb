I can not say enough bad things about this train wreck. This is one of the few films I ever wanted to go out. At first it was a bad assumption, the first pregnant man, but then they tried to fake him. What did they falsify with all these real pregnant males? It was the worst movie I've ever seen. If he had enough votes, he would have 100 IMDB downstairs. If you could give him a zero, I would like and would still feel that I gave him too much credit.
