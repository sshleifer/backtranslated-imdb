Misty Ayers had a body to smoke, and that's all that the movie was about. Clean operating flow. I started playing with myself, counting how many times they looped the orchestral music. And of course the music is completely unrelated to the scenes. Example: accidental entrance to the room and the saying "Hello" was rewarded with chase music from the Roman epos. I'd like to know why this movie sat on the shelf for 11 years before it was released. What I learned from this film: that low-rise women's panties existed in 1954. I'm talking about Sigourney Weaver in the original panties from the Alien movie. At least 20 of the first 30 minutes are Misty, who takes off calmly and puts on his clothes (unfortunately with a bra and panties). It also contains horrifying dubbing, leading to "Watch out! Godzirra! "Effect.
