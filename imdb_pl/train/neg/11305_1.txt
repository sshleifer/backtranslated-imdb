This is a very bad western mainly because it is historically inaccurate. It looks like he was shot in the back in California, not where Jack Slade, Idaho, Colorado Territory, and Montana had lived and died. He fictates everything that is known about this mysterious "evil man", "good man". The script is terrible; there is very little direction and bad acting. Dorothy Malone is completely wasted as his wife. Mark Steven never knows how to introduce this mysterious Jack Slade. In real life, Jack Slade was a very good stage manager. The local burghers were afraid of his heavy drinking. When he is drunk, he starts to fight and cause other problems in Virginia City in Montana. To make sure he would never be able to terrorize them again, the guards lynched Jack Slade after ignoring their warning to leave the city immediately. It's a terrible movie. I can not recommend anyone to watch this movie other than to see Hollywood massaging the story, even to this day.
