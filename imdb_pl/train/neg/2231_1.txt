All I can say after watching Snitch is stopping Mr. Cahill. It's painfully clear that you do not understand what you're shooting about. If you insist on making videos about gangsters, I encourage you to do research. It's comical to watch movies with absurd gangbangers that sound even more absurd when they talk. <br /> <br /> I was laughing at the part where Mr. Cahill goes to school with just 3 students and begins to kick in the fu fashion butts. This film was difficult as unique after school. Who came up with the idea of ​​wearing hats telling where a given gangbanger comes from? I suspect that real gangbangers do not wear hats, claiming they are gangs. That would be stupid, given the new rules that extend prison time if the person is connected with gangs. <br /> <br /> Snitch'd is the worst gangbanger movie ever made.
