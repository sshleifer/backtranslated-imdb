How good is Gwyneth Paltrow! This is the right movie for her ... it's a pity she's completely out of the role. I have not read Jane Austen's book, but I can not believe it is so superficial, and the characters are nothing more than caricatures. Within 2 hours of the show, about 600 pages of the book were not so easy to reduce, but I was expecting something more than just watching old furniture and cups of tea. I breathed a sigh of relief every time I saw an actor who did not cross the boundaries of the excess (several times).
