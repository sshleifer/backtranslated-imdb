What's up in the sky? Is this an airplane? Is this Superman ?? Errr, no? This is TURTLE!?! See what happened to the Cold War! Nothing but bad news and other problems! The Americans shoot down a Russian warplane somewhere over the territory of Artic, and the subsequent explosion defrosts and literally wakes up a gigantic prehistoric turtle named Gammera. He / she is not a very friendly criminal, because he quickly destroys everything and everyone in his path. Arguing governments ultimately decide to kill an ugly bastard with a brand new and super-sophisticated ice bomb, but Gammer has another surprise in the store? A damn turtle can fly! For the first time, this is happening in an incredibly grotesque and fun sequence! Gammer is lying on his back, looking defeated, when suddenly a fire is blowing from his armpits and bounces in the air. How can you not love it? There is also a terrible subjective topic about an annoying kid who is able to telepathically communicate with the monster, but this is not interesting enough. Flying turtle, people !! Not much more can be written about this Japanese (and American re-edition) Sci-Fi effort, besides it is an obvious and completely shameless tripping of such classics as the original Godzilla and The Beast of 20,000 Fathoms. The effects and designs of monsters are extremely hokey and, unlike the above-mentioned films, it is never possible to create an apocalyptic atmosphere. Respected actors such as Brian Donlevy ("The Quatermass Experiment") and Dick O'Neill ("Wolfen") seem unaware of what film set they are on, and even the original Japanese chaos scenes are not very convincing. Gammery's personal and personalized song is rather cool, so he gets an extra point for it.
