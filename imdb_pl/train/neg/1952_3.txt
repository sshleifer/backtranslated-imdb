Scott Menville is not Casey Kasem. This is the first, most important and most disturbing thing in this attempt to re-imagine Scooby-Doo and the company. <br /> <br /> Shaggy's voice is shrill and does not sound like it ever sounded in any of the previous Scooby incarnations. They also changed the outfit and the classic way of walking from the original. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what they mean, but the Formula used in previous Scooby shows is certainly not following it. <br /> <br /> And the style of animation is very strange and distorted. I like it, but this is not a real Scooby-Doo animation. But the strange animation used for other WB shows grew on me; it can also. <br /> <br /> It is worth taking a look at - once - if you can deal with the lack of the right Shaggy voice. It's enough to speak one of the enjoyable shows correctly. Besides, I try not to be a relentless, insidious fan. Evolve or die, as the saying goes. We will see how it looks after two successive episodes - until then I will create a much more solid opinion.
