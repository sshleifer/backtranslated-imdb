Fortunately, I saw it for free and I would like it to be better than it was, but it's really the same old things that film studios seem to impose on us over the last ten years. <br /> <br /> Ben Stiller and Jennifer Anniston play a pair of opposites - yet they are attracted to each other. <br /> <br /> If this plot does not surprise you and excite you, the movie will not be either. <Br> <br /> A lot of sight and jokes. In the middle of the movie, I began to realize that Ben Stiller really is not so funny, but he tries VERY hard. And Jennifer Anniston is not really that pretty, but her hair looks great. And Hank Azaria and Phillip Seymore Hoffman had to pay a lot of money to be in such a typical ho-hum movie, I started to expect more from them. <br /> <br /> It was interesting to see it after watching American Splendor, which is really funny and original movie - and compared the two in my head and wanted the movie directors to be forced to sit through these two videos back - maybe that would put a bit of sense into it and <br /> <br /> would start to create better movies with unknowns than the formal things that are best played on airplanes.
