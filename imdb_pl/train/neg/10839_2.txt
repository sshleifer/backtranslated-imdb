This was shown on the biographical channel and was just as instructive as a comic book for children! I gave him 2 out of 10 points for attention to detail, because it mostly affected the seventies, and the three ladies who played on three original angels looked as if makeup were good. br /> It was supposed to be a biography on the biographical channel, but it was devoid of everything that is normally / usually seen in one of their biographies. No interviews with other cast members, crew members, members of the production team, etc., Their friends, families and biographers of these people. In fact, I know the same about the program as before watching this movie based on (supposedly) a biographical book. As for learning something that no one knew about the program and was not widely known, which never happened.
