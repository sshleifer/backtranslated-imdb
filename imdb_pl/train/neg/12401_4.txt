I have a clear flaw here. I did not see the first two films in this series, although I saw many of Larry Cohen's films. Fans of the series seem to think that it's a good movie. I thought it was quite boring. <br /> <br /> You never really see the face of a maniac (Robert Z'Dara), but what I saw was quite gloomy. Death scenes seem to be made in order to eat a bigger movie, not to give it everything. Maybe if I saw Cut Director NC-17, maybe I would be more impressed. <br /> <br /> The end of the car race with Z'Dar, Caitlin Dulany and Robert Davi was very intense. the best part of the movie.
