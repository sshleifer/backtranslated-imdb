Documentalist, like any filmmaker, has to convey a fascinating story. Will Pascoe completely fails in this effort by combining the unflattering fragments of Chomsky's wisdom from his visit to the McMaster University in Hamilton. The material is filmed amateurish and video. The only effort of Pascoe to combine fragments into a whole is to periodically cast an obscure title on the screen: "9-11", "Activism", "Truth". <br /> <br /> Lame. <br /> <br /> Compare this with documentary films such as "The Corporation" or "The Fog of War", which create narrative drawing material from interviews, recordings and film recordings. In the end, each of them delivers a moving and insightful message cleverly and intelligently. <br /> <br /> The only conservative favors of the film are the nonchalantly directed historical dogmas of Chomsky and the fact that the running time is only 74 minutes. <br /> <br /> One of the interesting passages was to tell Chomsky about his experiences with National Public Radio. He describes the conservative media as more adapted to different views, while the liberal dogma of the NPR-Strait broadcasts their interlocutors and dramatically reduces the allowed messages. Another starting point for skepticism for the media. <br /> <br /> This document is only for Noam Chomsky compliments.
