Great western, I hear you all say! A brilliant first effort! Well, I'm not sure what movie you've all seen, but it had to be different from the one I saw. Big westerns, or actually good movies of any kind, have characters that you can believe in, and this movie did not have any! Acting was weak, and I did not care about any of the characters, which made the whole movie useless. the story was too big for the creators and maybe they should try their hand at creating cheesy trash, as in the "FACT OR FICTION" programs on sci-fi. <br /> <br /> Please, if you're looking for a good movie, a great western, and even a nice hour and a half, look somewhere else.
