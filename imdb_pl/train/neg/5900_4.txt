Young and attractive Japanese are again on the wrong side of the curse, this time it concerns mobile phones. Different people are dying until the unhappy spirit behind it has been discovered, so basically, if you've seen more than the 2 most recent Japanese horrors, you can sketch this movie in the dark with your hands tied. <br /> <br /> The main attraction is that Takashi Miike is behind the camera. Until now, I was impressed by his low tracks, such as City of Lost Souls, but when One Missed Call was promising, I wanted his more well-known envelope from Dead or Alive or too pseudo-Cronenberg style Audition. Despite the fact that many of his films are essentially empty, at least they have such advantages, or at least something that attracts your attention, like Tadanobu Asano flaunting shiny suits pretending to be Johnny Depp. This is not in One Missed Call; there are very few credits: acting is bland and average, there is very little (nothing, honestly) in the way of fear or tension, and in places it is simply boring. <br /> <br /> However, there are times when Miike's sense of humor permeates through nondescript commercialism; first of all in the case of a television program whose purpose was to film the collapse of one of the cursed topics, and the TV programmer was more worried about his evaluations than the lives of girls. But there is nothing to suggest that Miike is behind the camera; above all his usual visual style disappeared without a trace (including his famous gore), although it is more likely that he simply did not have enthusiasm for the project and I understand why. One missed call is not offensive. It's just frustratingly average. <br /> <br /> Miike apparently loves directing. With his huge annual achievements it is obvious that he will not be 100% interested in all his projects. But even with that in mind, One Missed Call felt like he was just paying the bills.
