Well, I can put an end to the question once and for all: "What's the worst movie ever made ... ever?" It's Flight of Fury, starring Steven Seagal. Sure, there are many famous, bad movies, but he takes the cake in such a way that he treats himself so seriously. <br /> <br /> It's a Romanian movie that tells you how far Romania has to go to catch Bollywood. He also talks about how Steven Seagal became completely devoid of intellect and talent. This movie is so bad that you literally feel offended after watching it and you have to crouch in the corner of the shower and cry, knowing that nothing will make you feel clean again. <br /> <br /> It was released only on video (I can not imagine why) and I suspect that employees had to force the DVD to wear protective equipment and regular advice.
