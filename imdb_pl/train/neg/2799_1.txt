Whoever wrote the script for this movie does not deserve a job in Hollywood (he does not even live there), and these actors have to find another job. The most frightening hour and a few minutes of my life ... and I just watched to see if it would be better, unfortunately not for me. <br /> <br /> Even at the end, the loans gave me anxiety. I think that there were not many people behind the film, so they had to slowly throw loans ... very slowly. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely a great guide on "How not to make a movie". It is a pity that I can not give 0.
