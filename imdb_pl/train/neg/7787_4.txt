This is one of those films that are more interesting from an academic perspective than from an entertainment perspective. I make my grades based on how much I liked the film or what I used to play, so I give it to him 4. If I would rate it as an academic movie, I would get 10. <br /> <br /> It's shot in a very interesting way, like a pseudo-silent movie with elements of sound effect and reality. It aims to convey chaotic memory and fragmentation of the mind, and this is interesting in this respect. <br /> <br /> However, the movie has many disgusting elements that were not so much fun for me. They are simply disturbing. It also has some very interesting photos and some interesting concepts, but some of the relationships between characters (especially between mother and son) are quite disturbing. <br /> <br /> In total, this movie will be either attractive for you or it will not be. For me it was interesting from an academic perspective, but it was not a good watch and I probably will not come back to it a second time. <br /> <br /> 4/10 if you're looking for entertainment. 10/10 from a scientific point of view.
