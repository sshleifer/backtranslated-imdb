Skippy from "Family Ties" plays Eddie, a stupid "metal" gull who is chosen. When his favorite metal singer Sammi Curr dies, he hissing, tearing all the posters on the bedroom wall. But when he later gets an unpublished album that keeps the ghost of his dead idol of "metal." First, he gets involved in the idea of ​​revenge, but then he does not want to take it as far as Sammi. What is not as far as his main victims seem to only go to the hospital. This film is completely funny and has almost as much in common with real metal as "Rock Star". OK, maybe a little more than this piece of rubbish, but you understand. And as EVERYONE can uproot a guy played by Skippy from "Family Ties", I have no idea. Gene Simmons' cameo is fine, and Ozzy Osbourne is cohesive, I applaud him for it, but otherwise skip this one. <br /> <br /> My class: D <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Elise Richards gets topless, topless additive at the pool party
