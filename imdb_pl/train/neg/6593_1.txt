Even if it was a bit funny, this waxy film would still be defiantly disrespectful. Stop just before digging up the boys' bodies and recreating Bernie's Weekend? but only? producer Larry Harmon and the director of the "Ernest" movie from frickin use copyright as a pretext for nonsense of Stan and Ollie's legacy. Gailard Sartain performs a fair personification of Ollie, but Bronson Pinchot would not have reached the tenth place in the Stan lookalike competition; even if they were both in place, they would be no less disgusting. The less you were told about the surrounding disaster, the better. It makes the utopia look like a dignified swan song.
