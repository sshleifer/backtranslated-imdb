86 wasted minutes of my life. I fell asleep for the first time when I tried to watch him, and I must say that I am not the one who ever falls asleep at the cinema. <br /> <br /> I have never seen such a senseless plot in such a stilted and forced manner, and one can only assume that the actors were as stubborn as the main character's writer allegedly in the film itself. <br /> <br /> Everything in this terrible adaptation is overused. And if it is not a wooden action, almost as if you were seeing a teleprompter, then the set itself, which is overly illuminated and disturbs completely unnecessary ways, and exaggerated in an unimaginable degree, is enough to push away the whole farce. <br /> <br /> As for the alleged shock of a detective in disguise, any person who does not see it - like the rest of this absurd story - telegraphed in advance light years, should immediately check the eyesight. <br /> <br /> Bad acting and two very decent actors, combined with the hyper-spoiled trademark of Branagh, you just need to use real bullets, not empty ones. <br /> <br /> To top it all, there is a completely risky homoerotic that is getting stronger at the end of this period. I just hope that it was such a flap that people will never try to imitate this level of cinema.
