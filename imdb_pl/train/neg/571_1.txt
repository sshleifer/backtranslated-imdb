I only rent it because I loved the first movie. However, calling him John Carpenters Vampires: Los Muertos, it's just a trick to borrow it. He is actually an executive producer and apparently had nothing to do with creating this movie (Jeepers Creepers Anyone?) <br /> <br /> A tragic plot, terrible special effects and Jon Bon Jovi as the least convincing Vampire Hunter of all time. It is not even bad. <br /> <br /> What we'll end up with is a boring, non-engaging movie with a terrible script and incredibly bad and stereotypical acting. It just reeks of a low budget. <br /> <br /> Avoid bubonic plague.
