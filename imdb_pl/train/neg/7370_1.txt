I've seen a lot of Seagal movies, and while most of them are not great or even good, this steamy stack has lowered the bar for bad movies. <br /> <br /> Plot: I'm not sure. Something about the medicine that makes you crazy and strong or something. Who are good and bad guys? Hard to say. Most of the film is cut scenes passing between people in darkly lit rooms, complaining about how good the character of Seagals' Mashall is. <br /> <br /> Acting: blows. ,,,,,, What was the terrible overdubbing of the voice ?! Could they find someone who sounded less like Seagal? Maybe Cheech or Chong may be making a voice, which can be fun. <br /> <br /> This movie is boring and completely stupid. Avoid it at all costs !!!!
