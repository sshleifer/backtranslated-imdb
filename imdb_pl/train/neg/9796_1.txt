Okay, seriously I can not think of anything worse than the PR series. There are many bad things in life ... traitors, liars, etc. But seriously, Power Rangers has a GOT at the bottom of this list. Can you think of something more stupid than five teenagers (who do not even behave like normal teenagers) dancing in identical suits WITH DIFFERENT COLORS THAT YOU CAN SAY WITH THEM? Fans, have you ever encountered a real person who rushed to the mental wall and gets up almost immediately and continues to fight without injury? The Power Rangers are for five-year-old boys, and believe me, I've never liked this show, even when I was five. <br /> <br /> I think you can say that Dino Thunder is an exception. Teens actually act like teens, and Tommy Oliver actually acts like a mentor, or not, a teacher. He has teen humor, although the fight is bad, I do not hate Dino Thunder. <br /> <br /> Many people say that Power Rangers are nonsense, but I would not do it. It would be an insult to nonsense. So, the five-year-old boys, Power Rangers, are rubbish.
