It was probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I watched it with a large group of friends, and after it ended, none of us understood the conspiracy. Apart from the lack of plot, the acting was terrible, the "special effects" were not so special, and the writing was absolutely horrible. The only advantage of the movie is that it is so incredibly bad that it's quite funny. You can not help laughing about the zombies being driven while the actors spit out a shit dialogue. I would not recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good movie, but it is something that a group of friends can meet and laugh well. It is now a joke among my friends and I. 1 in 10.
