I can not believe that Guillermo del Toro and Kim Bassinger are involved in this piece of rubbish! The script is so poorly written and the director is so weak (both of the same person) that it is difficult to find more one-dimensional characters in the film. Dialogues are so bad that this so-called thriller laughed at a few fools who got into the theater. Configuration is difficult, inviting you to believe that you are going to watch a bloodcurdling thriller and suddenly it turns out that it is the stupidest movie of persecution. The character of Bassinger is so stupid that he stops shouting to God, "Where are you!" So people after her can follow and then they take a leak !!!! And then, apparently, she got into the smallest wood in the world, that is, she runs all over the place, and the killers never lose her, and it happens in the middle of the night. I wonder really if the best Hollywood writers can see that they spend millions on production.
