This film was made in Saskatchewan and Manitoba parks and again drew the attention of the world to what remained of "Wild West Canada". When Archie began writing his stories for newspapers; the day's thought was to tame the desert and convert / absorb the Nations of the First Nation. <br /> <br /> The film introduces itself and asks a question; why a well-educated, apparently talented Englishman would become an Indian? <br /> <br /> Archie, as an English boy, dreams of becoming something, but understanding the full sense is unique and priceless - no matter what it is. Sounds like the famous story of dolls, no. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, I saw how Archie became my living image of "Indian with cigars" with a very wooden character and it is not real at all - a very well done action on the part of Mr. Brosnan. He also played the wild Indian on the dance scene for the tourist. Fullness and reality were not realized until he met and married his wife, Annie. <br /> <br /> Annie pushed Archie in a direction that would lead him to the forefront of the English world scene, not as himself, but Gray Owl - a Canadian countryman from the wilderness. <br /> <br /> This is the closest Archie who becomes a noble wild prototype. <br /> <br /> The interpretation of Mr. Brosnan and his directors are well done. I watched documentaries about Gray Owl and I think it's a good movie on a big screen that I can add to my collection. <br /> <br /> Spoiler - I thought that the last scenes with Archie, which will meet with the Grand Council of Bosses, were a great great moment in the film. <br /> <br /> Very beautiful scenery of the Canadian lake and the real locations of the "Gray Owl". <br /> <br />
