Boy, what a fool was this mess. But it only lasts an hour, and I paid only PLN 1 for that, so I will live ... unlike the entire cast of this cluster from 1933, which is now pissed off. <br /> <br /> So in any case, the small village begins to appear bodies that have been drained from all their blood. Local yokas, of course, start talking about vampires and a little louder after finding each body. The sheriff or policeman or whatever he is, played by the amazing actor Melvin Douglas, tries to tell them otherwise. When he mentions that the dead have one large hole on each side of the neck, instead of two holes close to each other, the locals simply say that a giant vampire bat. The officer insists that vampires do not exist and it must be a human culprit who kills. <br /> <br /> But Melvyn does not seem too embarrassing in any way. He spends most of his time trying to get into his beloved pants, played by Faye Wray. Also in this mix is ​​the urban simpleton, played by Dwight Frye, who al ways seemed to play the same role in every movie he did. He still annoys townspeople, catching bats and drinking his own blood.Lionel Atwill plays a city doctor who apparently tries to help the policeman solve the crimes. he always stinks like an actor. In this role, Twill is as close to cardboard as he could. And Lionel Barrymore is also in the matter ... many big names are a pile of guano. <br /> <br /> Besides the terrible wrong title that this movie has, the alternative name "The Blood Sucker" is much better, this movie is also boring and plump and just stupid. <br /> <br /> For me, the high point of the film is watching Frye, nails bizarre freak out of the city, but outside this film did not offer too much. And then, when you find out what's causing the strange deaths and you see a special effect that requires this blood, I'm really disappointed. <br /> <br /> Bela Lugosi made a lot of awful photos, but at least he was funny and interesting to watch. of this movie as really a Lugosi's poor cluster WITHOUT Lugosi, and you will feel how dismal this mess was. <br /> <br /> If you can not make a good horror movie from the thirties, put Lugosi in it.
