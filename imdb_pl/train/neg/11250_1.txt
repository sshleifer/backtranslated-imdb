I like the period, I like the trial, but watching a movie that looks like I'm looking at it through a Coke bottle makes me a headache. If I were playing computer games that were so blurry and out of focus, I would update my computer. Maybe that's how the director's look looked like, but it's not like it hurts your eyes and you want to leave after 10 minutes. If I did not take someone with me on this movie, I was not there. Even though it was a series, not a movie, Band of Brothers did it. They made it look like material from World War II, with a bit of grain, but watching was still a pleasure. Movies need real people, with real sets and real locations; Use CGI when it's appropriate, not the whole movie.
