OK ... this movie could have been very good! All generations were exposed to Thunderbirds and loved it, and this movie contained some of the features that could be found in the good Thunderbirds movie. Craft and Tracey Island were realistically transferred to the big screen, while maintaining the patterns in which we fell in love. Sophia Miles was just fantastic, because Lady P and Bill Paxton, although I did not quite know that Jeff Tracey was, he was solid enough ... but then the adults were taken out of the equation and asked to believe the 8-year-olds could fly 200 tons of machines. <br /> <br /> It's not just the fact that the movie was focused around the kids that made me feel like Jonathon Frakes hit me with a wet fish and he laughed at my hard-earned money on film the fact that Alan Tracey was like that unbearable in the film and that he seemed to be able to fly machines, as well as his brothers ... who were at least 19/20 years old. Seriously, these are some damn simple machines to use if it is. <br /> <br /> It seemed that the film did not know if it wanted to be serious or farcical. He tried to pay homage while satirizing and simply fell flat on his face. 3/10 (2 for machines, 1 for Lady P)
