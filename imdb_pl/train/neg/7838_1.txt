This film was basically Velvet Goldmine, if the writers of the party of five got it and made it t.v. movie. The film lacks what Velvet Goldmine had, which was a good actor, writing and basically everything else. The movie had the worst magazine I've seen since Wild Wild West. It definitely had to be interesting. I know that vh 1 has become widely known for musical performances. which are much better than all that would work if it was a musical episode, but it was not and it felt flat on the face.
