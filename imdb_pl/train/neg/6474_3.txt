It was the first sequel that I saw (except Return of Jafar) and I honestly thought that before I looked at it, it would be close to the original. I was terribly disappointed. <br /> <br /> The plot was basically the first script with a few additional characters and the situation reversed. Ariel and Eric have a daughter, Melody, who is not happy with life on land. He wants to become a mermaid. However, Ariel kept away from her daughter because she wants to protect her - and when Melody finds out she is upset and angry. And then he decides to escape and she becomes a mermaid. So he is happy swimming, and Ariel decides to find her as a mermaid. <br /> <br /> The story does not sound bad, but the stereotypes and replays of the situation from the first film are only too obvious. And adding the fact that Melody is, in general, very annoying, and the film becomes almost unbearable. <br /> <br /> There are also many other new characters - Tip and Dash are two of them. They are not as bad as the characters themselves - just try not to think about Timon or Pumba! The songs leave much to be desired, they simply do not have the same magical energy as the songs from the original. Animation apparently did not contain the whole load in either parts, movements or figures. <br /> <br /> Another piece of advice - try to forget about Original Ariel while watching this movie. A beautiful, rebellious, interesting teenager "grew up" for a bland, boring wife and mother, and her characteristic red hair is associated. It is much more visible if you have never seen the original - you will have nothing to compare. <br /> <br /> All in all, it could have been worse - it's not as bad as some other sequels, such as Cinderella II. But he is not in the same league as the original. But when it comes to your collection, if nothing else, but if Disney goes on like this, they will lose all of their older fans.
