I can not believe how popular this program is. I consider myself an avid sci-fi fan. I read countless science-fiction novels and liked many science-fiction movies and TV shows. I really would not even consider this real science fiction. Every episode in which I participated was like a bad, diluted version of the Star Trek episode, without anything that would make it interesting or exciting. <br /> <br /> It's basically a group of people standing in ARMY pants, talking about something boring, which from time to time passes through the Stargate and goes to a planet that looks exactly the same as the Earth, with people who look and they sound like people! It seemed an extremely low budget. The heroes forget about one dimensional cut-out, and many attempts at humor fall. It reminds me when you see an advertisement with a well-known athlete, trying to be fun, but it is not. It's just sad. <br /> <br /> The movie was terrible too. You can do so much with the portal in space, but every place that ARMY people go to is BORING! It has no imagination! Actually, I thought that the series "Alien Nation" from a few years ago (based on the film Alien Nation) was much better. This program had good stories and decent characters. I was not crazy about "Alien Nation", but it was great compared to this overrated shit! <br /> <br /> Also, unlike the great new "Battlestar Galactica" series, "Stargate" copied the look and feel too close! They should at least update the special effect of "flushing the toilet" when someone passes through the Stargate.
