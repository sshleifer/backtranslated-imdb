With all my heart I do not agree with other viewers of this miserable movie. The only reason I did not rate this 1 as a terrible one was Carmen Miranda's great talent. The beginning and the end are the best parents because of her talented singing and dancing. <br /> <br /> The problem is in the rest of the picture. Alice Faye comes out quite empty. Don Ameche has a great vocal voice, but he gets so horrible with unfortunate writing material. <br /> <br /> The plot is really stiff here, and Ameche assumes two parts as a singer and dance man, and a baron not very happy married to Faye. <br /> <br /> It seems that by playing a song and a dancing man, Ameche's marriage changes again. Some stupid nonsense about the need to clean up the business and be away allow him to play in both parts. <br /> <br /> S.Z. Sakal has little to do, so his comedy presents have no chance to shine. Just like in the case of J. Carr. Naish, who seems awkward in his role. <br /> <br /> This is a film bomb from chica chica.
