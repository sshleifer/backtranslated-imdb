RATING STARS: ***** Works **** Just miss the sign *** This little piece between ** Delays * Hollows <br /> <br /> A little lost platoon and some very nasty people now have the means, to create a bomb capable of wholesale destruction - so Josh McCord (Chuck Norris) and his uppity young protégé Deke (Judson Mills, another actor from the previous movie) with the help of adopted daughter Josh, Que (Jennifer Tung) decided to stop them. <br /> <br /> This was another film that dealt with terrorism a year after the September 11 events. Filmed in 2001, Norris himself later commented on how remarkably the story line for the movie resembled what happened that day in central New York, so there would be one that would be in the mood for a movie in which Norris and his side kick some terrorist butt, if nothing else. And he's as exchangeable as anything Norris has ever been. It makes you wonder what the original did to ensure continuity first, and if it could be produced, President 3 may soon appear. <br /> <br /> If you've seen one Norris movie, you've really seen them all and there's nothing new or unexpected about what's going on with this movie, but at least you know what you're getting and how I said it could only be that what some people had to let go. **
