Have you ever watched a movie when 20 or 30 minutes have passed and you suddenly realize that you have seen it before? That's how it happened to me with 'The Young Graduates'. The video field cover, if you find a video, is very misleading. I swear that both women on the cover are not even in the movie. <br /> <br /> In any case, or I was born ten years too late to appreciate the more subtle aspects of this movie, or ... it's just meaningless junk. I am strongly leaning towards the latter, but I think that some of them have developed a connection with this film. <br /> <br /> Hmm ... plot. Story. Let's see ... there must be a plot somewhere. No, I can not find him. The point is that some senior high school students behave stupidly and do drugs and speak a language that has become obsolete decades ago. One of the students fell in love with her teacher. The teacher has a frigid wife (whom he actually calls an iceberg), so he is open to girls' progress. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of driving and awkward dialogue and lots of spastic dance. Our cat, BooBoo, was charmed by dancing high school students. With incredible intensity, she watched the dancers wobble and shake on the dance floor. It is nice to see that at least one species found something interesting in this relic. 1/10
