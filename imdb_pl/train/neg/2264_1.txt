To preface this review, I must say that I was, I think, a little curious about the movie ... However, I probably would not have seen it if my arm were not twisted slightly. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this movie shows how depraved a man can be. In my eyes the worst thing about this Springer phenomenon is not that people on the Jerry Springer Show behave the way they do (which is in itself worthy of accusation), but many people are so curious and excited to watch them and hear about their lives (yes, I suppose it covers me ... in any way it's true). If we do not glorify this type of behavior (as some might say), we can at least subtly destroy our minds and / or de-urbanize this type of behavior. <br /> <br /> But enough soap (type). Here's the skinny: the film has an R rating and although it may deserve it (I turned my eyes on some of the scenes, so I'm not sure), I feel that NC-17 (hat tip to another reviewer) may be a bit more suitable for huge sexual content (Cynic can comment that the film was just one big excuse to show sex on the big screen). The plot is very strange, combining the stories of an absolutely dysfunctional family and a group of stereotypical black nervous who will appear at various Springer exhibitions. Finally, the film leaves some rhetoric with resolution and Springer about the need to see the real world (apparently in his program). I agree with him - it is important to know how the world really is so that we can strive for positive changes. Having said that, let me tell you - quite well in the world in a new newspaper or news to see it, but do not throw away good money to support the sensational and perhaps formal titallition that Springer wants to give us.
