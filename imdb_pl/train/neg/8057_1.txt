What's wrong with this movie? Many, many things. Editing too much is trying to look good and does nothing but confuse the viewer, while providing him with a powerful headache. The story is muddy and of course extended from what began as a short story (or a movie). The plot creates only less than ten minutes of good story, and it is just desperately painful until it reaches the minimum length of the feature film. We all know what happens to things when we stretch them, right? Exactly. They are getting thinner. Ultimately, the plot is as thin as paper, which you can even miss, if you do not pay attention, which is difficult to do while watching this movie. Acting is not even impressive. Characters are poorly written and boring, uninteresting. One of the worst things that is wrong with this movie is that apparently anyone was responsible for the score / soundtrack, he had no idea what the movie is or what it should be (not to blame) Consider it too . As a result, half of the music in the movie does not fit the scenes at all. What was with all the sexual undertones between Eliza Dushku and the main character? Naturally, it was aimed at attracting young men, but it was so cheap. Did the first scene have anything to do with the rest of the movie? At every possible level? At all? Two terrifying guys had nothing to do with the movie at all, they were there just to have a few scenes of pursuit. I doubt anyone would really enjoy a movie so badly composed and such a shameless and horrible Hollywood attempt to have a bit of an interesting idea. But digression. I recommend it to teenagers with a small span of attention, who do not mind really bad horror, as long as there is some sex and gore in it (although this can only be true for the Killer Cut I have seen). 1/10
