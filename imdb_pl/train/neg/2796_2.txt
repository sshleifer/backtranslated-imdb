for the most part, On Demand delivers some horrible horror movies and offers only other horror movies that everyone has seen and already have an opinion about. It was either this or Invinicible (I like Marek Wahlberg's films) which I did not see, actually I was in a movie watching the mood, which does not happen often anymore because I've watched all the movies that I have a million times, a lot of movies, and I'm not interested in new movies, and this movie made me regret it. I'm not going to put in any spoilers, I'm just saying that only a few of the very few actors in this movie are half decent. I think the main girl, who died, who kills everyone, is very annoying but convincing; I would take her on a psychological bitch every day, so she fits her role well, although it is lame. The blood is not so great, just a few killings, and maybe I can say that "wounds" are okay, but you can not see too much and there are no props on the body part of the film to make the injuries look more convincing. At the end of the movie, I was begging my girlfriend to turn it off, and being a member of the band, the "recording" parts were not very interesting either, although what happened was really going to happen when it came to recording. I'm done, if you want to watch it, adjust.
