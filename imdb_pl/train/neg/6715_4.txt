I went to the theater to experience a pleasant 90 minutes of entertainment, if not enlightened. I did not leave either entertainment or enlightenment. This film can not decide what it wants to be and ends with little. There are a few funny lines and some incredibly pretentious references to movies (400 Blows - for this character? Get out of this!). While none of the characters is treated with great respect, over thirty gays get the worst: all predatory, greasy, sad, slob. If you're in the mood for a movie about homosexual relationships, check out Parting Glances, Longtime Companion, Trick, All Over the Guy, Red Dirt, Maurice, Philadelphia instead. You will be grateful. <br /> <br />
