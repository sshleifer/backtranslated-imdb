This movie was probably as stupid as The Naked Gun (which was supposed to be). Case in point: <br /> <br /> 1. To pretend to be drowning, Roberts secretly takes swimming lessons at YWCA. After her "death", the YWCA calls her husband to work to make condolences. WELCOME, where did his work number come from? <br /> <br /> 2. Before leaving the city, he drops the ring in the toilet. Days, and even weeks later, her hubby finds it in Jan. Does this mean that the toilet has never been red? <br /> <br /> 3. No explanation is given as to how she pays for looking after her mother in an old people's home (because she did it behind RICH's husbands). <br /> <br /> 4. At the end of this tiring movie, Roberts suspects that her husband is at home. Instead of running to life, he runs into the kitchen to see if the cans are neatly arranged.
