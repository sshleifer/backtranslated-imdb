In Hollywood in the 1930s and 1940s, I think that every studio can create a western, with the exception of Warner. A few times they try, it's always funny (except, perhaps, Dead with boots on, which is a cavalry western). it looks like a mushroom. True! Cagney and Bogart are too urban, also in the 21st century, to be credible in the Western film. The story here did not have a surprise and it did not help. Every 10 minutes I see that Bogart and Cagney are throwing their small guns and putting their hands into the machine gun to escape from the set in a black car from the 1930s.
