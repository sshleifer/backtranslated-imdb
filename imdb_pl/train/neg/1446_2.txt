The film is a very long tale of a classic novel that completely does not reflect the spirit of the original adventure. Quite frighteningly American Patrick Swayze is cast as the British hero of Allan Quatermain despite his obvious nationality. <br /> <br /> The film continues the story of "Hollywood-ise", changing both the story and the characters better to fit the accepted form. The film is predictable all the time, even for those who are not familiar with this story and is harassed by very bad acting and terribly disappointing sequences of battle. <br /> <br /> In total, a terrible addition to the already quite bad collection of films based on the legend of King Soloman's Mines and Allan Quatermain.
