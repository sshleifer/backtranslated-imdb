Recently I watched it again and there is another version, which is shorter in 1999. I have the impression that they are the same movie, but I would like to know the difference. <br /> <br /> One is Japanese, and no pikachu is everything you can come up with. So why vote twice for the same movie? <br /> <br /> Prof Ivy was rather boring. It sounded almost asleep, expressionless with the few lines she had. <br /> <br /> It was pleasant enough, but it was not much. <br /> <br /> The collector (who does not want to destroy the world after Lugia) and the usual characters who try to stop him, because the attempt to capture Lugia causes a lot of destruction. <br /> <br /> The films of the pokemon that follow are slightly better, deoxys (poke 7) is great, without. 8 almost here.
