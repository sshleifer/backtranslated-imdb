OK, first and foremost, Steve Irwin, rest in peace. You were loved by many fans. Now ... this movie was not a movie at all. It was a television program "The Crocodile Hunter" with bad acting, bad scripts and a poor director between Steve, who captured or taught us about animals. He was funny as a searcher / specialist. Millions miss him. But the whole idea of ​​the movie was a big mistake. The plot was so corrupt that it almost did not exist. Throwing was terrible. Acting was not even worth the actors at primary school level. The direction must also be wrong. If you can not get the decent performance of your actors, no matter how bad the script is, you can not be so good in the first place. I could write a better script. It is a pity that I have never seen this movie. Of course, I watched him for $ 3 ($ 1.50 for me, $ 1.50 for my son), while with friends who insisted on seeing it instead of Scooby Doo Live. My son, who is not so discriminating, liked the movie well, but he still never asked to see it again. If you want to mention Steve Irwin, buy his series on DVD. Avoid this movie like a plague. If I was Steve, I know I would not like to be remembered in this movie. Respect him: avoid this movie!
