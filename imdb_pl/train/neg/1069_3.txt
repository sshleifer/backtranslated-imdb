I saw this movie at the AFI Dallas festival. Most of the audience, including my wife, enjoyed this comedy drama, but I did not. There are Lucas Haas (Brick, Alpha Dog), Molly Parker (Kissed, The Five Senses, Hollywoodland) and Adam Scott (First Snow, Art School Confidential). The director is Matt Bissonnette, who is married to Molly Parker. All three actors do a great job in this film about three friends, the marriage of two of them and infidelity with the third. Everything takes place at the lake house and looks great. The film wants to treat your subject as a comedy and then a drama, and I thought it must be the other way around.
