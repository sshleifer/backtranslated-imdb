I went to this film with expectations, from the hype that it will be insightful and uplifting. Certainly something more than a cheap promotion for the Wilco team. <br /> <br /> Instead, we get a lot of mops and moans about the "trial", disgraceful and undoubtedly one-sided presentation of one member who was expelled by the lead vocalist / author of prima donna songs, defiant confession of a fallen friend - for 18 years - saying that "friendship ran its course" and this strenuous, intransigent story about how one label "hurt their feelings", throwing them away, just so that the band could immediately receive 50 offers from other labels (oh, tension. .. no!) They tried to make it look like it was tension, but I suspect that it was all smoke and mirrors that caused a tragedy that did not exist. It does not even take into account long episodes in which we will get many of their latest songs without a story, insight or even decent work in cinematography. Strained attempts at emotional honesty or a reasonable look at life made me unable to watch. <br /> <br /> From the movie, this band sounds like a handful of vile little kids who are spinning around to find a voice that they do not have and think they are musicians who are definitely not. And I thought that music sucks and I could not even understand the lyrics because of the slurred style of the vocalist. <br /> <br /> I gave him 2/10.
