This movie could not decide what it wants to be. There were several auxiliary threads that made you think for a time that all these elements would eventually come together ... but they did not. If you want a story about a "foreigner in frozen waste", stick to the version of THE THINGS from 1950 (Not an abomination that has been transformed into gore-o-vision 20+ years later). <br /> <br /> I could not ignore the fact that the "alien" looked almost like recycling from the WEATHER DAY. <br /> <br /> The "bare minimum" sets would be more effective if they employed actors who could actually act and achieve the intended mood. <br /> <br /> A lot of scenery chewing with a small payout.
