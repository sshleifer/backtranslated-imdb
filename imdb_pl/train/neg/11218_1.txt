This movie is not worth the movie on which it was photographed. Dialogue is flat, filled with clich√©s of overused lines and provided by amateur actors who sound like their reading of the script for the first time. Uncertain, shaky, film style is a cheap imitation of visual effects in the style of "The Ring". Characters do not even behave like a normal person. For example, a character who is looking for his twin sister in his home forces, struggles through the front door, creeps around the house, everyone is scared and crying, and even sometimes calls his sister's name to see if he is at home. What? You'd think she just buried her sister instead of looking for her. Too much retrospection for her childhood. Too many unnecessary flashbacks are a typical sign of an amateur director. It's really fun looking at the many shots of a woman driving a car down the street, uphill, in this corner, here, there, from the side, now the view from the front. It's enough. You would think that you are watching TV commercials on Solaris! Scary Movie. 0 per 100. I really regret anyone who has spent money on this movie or watching it.
