Having the chance to write, direct and play in my own film, I would probably choose something about weapons robots. Anthony Hopkins, however, decided to create the most bizarre movie he has ever seen. "Slipstream" is a movie that is so strange that even David Lynch would probably look at the person next to him and say "What's going on?". <br /> <br /> This is a movie in which in one scene a man crosses the road towards a yellow car pointing to the right, which suddenly turns into a pink car facing left. It is a movie in which two characters talk with shots of random people laughing and climbing on the walls of insects. This is a movie in which a man begins to talk about "Invasion Of The Bodysnatchers" only so that the actor of this particular film suddenly appears as himself (and then disappeared in the air). <br /> <br /> This is a movie that decides to throw the need for a coherent plot straight from the window and use fifteen different editions, while changing the color from black to white seemingly for no reason at all. <br /> <br /> I must praise Mr. Hopkins for the selection of the actors in this film (some of them portray a lot of characters). Everyone involved throws themselves into their roles, even if they probably have no idea what they are doing. My favorite here was bandit Christian Slater wearing a hat that was impressively dangerous while he babbled nonsense and sang the American national anthem. <br /> <br /> Anthony Hopkins was quoted saying that he made this movie as a joke and this is probably the best way to summarize the "Slipstream". It's a joke in the audience. You will watch it from beginning to end, trying to understand what is happening and hoping that the answer will come, only to discover that the answer never really exists. What is the meaning of this particular joke, only Anthony Hopkins will ever know. <br /> <br /> I've mentioned David Lynch before and I'm a big fan of this particular director. I'm guessing that Anthony Hopkins shares my love for "Twin Peaks", "Blue Velvet" and "Lost Highway". However, "Slipstream" is not as rewarding as any of Lynch's films, despite imitating many of his techniques (although I was surprised that no one is talking back in "Slipstream"). It is definitely too chaotic and accidental - as another reviewer pointed out, this is a film version of Alzheimer's disease. There is no doubt there is a small number of people who are able to see it and get something out of them. Unfortunately for the rest of us, "Slipstream" quickly becomes an annoying and confusing experience that was made only thanks to Hopkins' commitment. <br /> <br /> Watch at your own risk.
