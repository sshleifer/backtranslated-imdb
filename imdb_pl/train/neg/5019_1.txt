This movie was a waste of time, even rented on DVD. If super-fast camera shots are faster than this, we might as well pay twenty dollars to get to the laundry room, popcorn and watch the dryer spinning. Jet Li is much better than this one. One can only hope that in the near future he will not make any transactions to make another film with phrases, such as The One. <br /> <br /> If there is one movie to avoid, this is "The One".
