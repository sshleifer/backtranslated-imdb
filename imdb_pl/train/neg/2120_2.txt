I found myself quite melancholy, especially when I watch wonderful touching and tugging movies. But not for that (which surprised me!) And it really surprises me how many people praise the film so high. <br /> <br /> There are a few disturbing facts in the films: 1. Despite the guilt - Ben's true intention to save 7 lives to buy back his past is disturbing to me that the film seems to encourage this type of suicidal activity. Some people may see that it is a heroic action, and others think that it behaves cowardly, in the end it was a disturbing act for me. <br /> <br /> 2. The story is too dramatic, but the logic is too simplistic. Medically, a blood group match must be an organ donor. At the end of the movie, we learned that Emily had a back blood group that limited her chance of getting a donor in a short time. Nevertheless, it seemed that Ben had a rare blood group, the same as hers, which allowed him to be her donor, and conveniently, despite the rarity of Ben's blood group, he was able to give away not only the heart but also the kidney, cornea and its bone marrow, which in all cases requires not only the matching of the blood group, but also the tissue antigen. <br /> <br /> 3. Why do doctors allow Ben to give organs in spite of the jellyfish dying he killed himself? <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm analyzing the whole story, because it's just a movie. However, some of the worrying facts outlined above will help you revise your plan to watch this video. If you choose a movie in the style of soap opera, go to him. But you are looking for intelligent entertainment, miss it!
