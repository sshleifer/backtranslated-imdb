I should never have started this movie and stopped watching after 3/4. I missed a very bad ending. This movie was a disappointment because it could have been much better. It had a nice atmosphere, great cast and director, good locations. But baaaaaad plot, bad script. I noticed the southern accent of Kenneth Branagh - he was better than the script. The plot was stupid - driven by characters acting in an unreal and unlikely way. Nobody behaves like this outside of Hollywood scenarios.
