Even if 99.99% of people who saw this movie are Brazilian, I will be up to date with English because it is the language of this site. <br /> <br /> This movie is a piece of cr * p. I have seen the worst acting for a long time. Children are terrible. Especially boy. It was the first time I saw someone with a less expressive face than Arnold Schwarzenegger and one tone of voice, like a five-year-old child reading in front of the classroom. How can someone so bad be the main actor in the movie? The plot is so shallow that my daughter could do better (she is 3 years old). It is so simple that you can save them in a napkin and tell in three minutes. <br /> <br /> There are only three options for someone who likes this movie: 1) you are a teenager; 2) you were so praised by Globo's foolishness that you think that everything that has a Globo seal is amazing; 3) you have serious brain damage. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs! Shame for the Brazilian film scene.
