Yes, MTV is really a way to market Daria. What began with wise teenage anger - "commenting on everything that sucks and makes the viewer feel better in their teens' lives" has now mutated "the way you should deal with your problems" - charade. I watched Daria all the time and I liked it very much. Now, sitting here after watching the so-called "movie", I can only wonder what was the meaning of all this. Daria tells us how to lead a life in college? Excuse me? Was not it that Daria made every episode you like to do okay if it's okay with you, no matter what the rest of the sick sad world thinks about it? All this thing reminded me of the scene from "Reality Bites". The movie channel shows the document for the first time.
