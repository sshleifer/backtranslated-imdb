Let's hope it's the last nightmare. This is the personification of a bad thing. Okay, it's still a bit of fun, but only in the most mundane sense. Rachel Talalay was there for the duration of this series, she worked in the production department and even produced. I do not know what she was thinking about, but this defeat ends with a video game boy and a hospitable appearance. <br /> <br /> Tom and Roseanne Arnold! It is a pity that I have no idea what she thought when she wrote / directed this disappointing piece of garbage. She even tried to distract the audience from the fact that this movie was nothing more than a glorified movie with popcorn, not some similarity to the horror movie, with the fancy use of the 3D ending. Are these glasses not cool? And you have to SAVE them! That's the equivalent, you've just spent $ 9.00, making me rich. Here are 10 cents. You do not feel special !? I'm sorry, but for me it did not make me feel special. <br /> <br /> And Freddy had another face lift. This is probably the worst. The whole beautiful artistry that came into his "look" in earlier films was replaced by a naturally cheaper, less detailed set of dentures. It looks ... less like a burned victim, which should be, and more like a skin disease. The change of the current lead makeup into a series is on the same level as the change of the main actor. But wait! They did it and they did it. So I think it does not matter. But that meant something to me. Freddy is not terrifying anymore. He's just ... another low-rent monster like Leprechaun. <br /> <br /> It's more ... dark comedy than the horror classic that the series promises; absorbed in what you can only hope, the writers thought they were witty one-hacks and a wise repartner (unfortunately, both accounts failed to achieve this). <br /> <br /> So there is nothing more to say than to catch popcorn and prepare for laughter, because in this whole movie there was not a single frightening or tense moment. <br /> <br /> Ocenes 3,2 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
