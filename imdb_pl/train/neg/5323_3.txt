I can not believe that in 34 previous comments no one mentioned that this movie is a blatant rip off of Born Yesterday. A man was hired to bring a seemingly stupid blonde to the gangster's requirements. Hired gun and blonde fall in love and live happily ever after. The gangster stays on the ice. But born yesterday was an intelligent procedure, while it is so much fluff. Transfer Technicolor to DVD is deplorable. Natalie Kalmus will fall in the grave. Check the newsboy. Recognize him? But it's historically interesting to see the roots of Rock 'n Roll. It is also interesting to introduce Ewell to CinemaScope, a new format at the time.
