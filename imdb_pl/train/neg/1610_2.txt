What interested me so much in this film - I saw the full 4-hour version of the roadshow, it's how strangely it is dispassionate. In the case of a film with two very charismatic men - Castro and Che, engaged in a massive political struggle, it is almost completely devoid of emotional fire. The scenes between Benicio Del Toro and Demian Bichir (who is at best a second level actor with a slightly high tone of voice) have no drama or depth and basically descend to Castro, saying Che: go here, go there, do this and that, without no explanation of how the effect or use will result in this action. Odder is still an actor in the cast, who has the required power to play Castro - Joaquim de Almeida, but puts it aside in the smaller part of the second half. Without the tension and passion that you would expect to shoot these men and their followers, the film becomes a boring epic movie about hairy, bearded men running through different jungles, shouting and shooting at any particular purpose or purpose. Several reviews I have read have been praised by director Steven Soderbergh, ignoring the actors almost completely. (One of them spent more time talking about the new Soderbergh digital camera than on the story or actors, or the fact that it is entirely in Spanish with English subtitles.) It's strange, strange because a) Soderbergh was just a rented gun in the movie and b) it is only a competent job, with an unnoticed nod of JFK Oliver Stone in a black and white camera, when Che visits New York. If you can imagine Reds directed by Andrew McLaglen instead of Warren Beatty, then you can imagine the boring competence of this movie.
