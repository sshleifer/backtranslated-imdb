it became a cult movie in Chinese studies, although I did not watch it until it was broadcast in channel 4, UK. <br /> <br /> full of artistic dizziness, the plot is mediocre and unreal; The "spirit" that he wants to convey is how independent artists "rely on the commercialization of the music industry" and maintain the "purity of the artistic soul" and not "sell for dirty money". it is really dizzying and superficial; Diologies are mostly pathetic. acting is weak. sceenplay is full of artistic grudge. is a fantasy film for children and so on, <br /> <br />
