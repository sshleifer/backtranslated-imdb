I hated the movie so much that I remember it live. It is not even funny. Any film that is based on obscene jokes and racist humor does not deserve money that costs. In the first half hour Rob Schneider drinks a rag carton of milk. All I could think of was "deserving of it for making such a bad film." Do not waste time or money on this.
