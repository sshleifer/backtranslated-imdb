The story is about a genealogy researcher (Mel Harris) who is employed by his cousin Estee Lauder. Her aunt (through marriage, which we must assume) tries to track down her missing family in Europe. All they have to do is picture a young girl standing by a decorative music box. The researcher goes to Europe and searches for places like Milan, Budapest and Vienna. The scenery is real and is shot on the spot (as opposed to Murder, She wrote, where Jessica is to visit a distant place, and Lansbury never left Burbank). In any case, he meets a young man who also tries to solve his own family secret and together they collect traces and threats of bad guys. Dialogue, especially romantic dialogue, is terrible. I watched it because of the scenery, but the script was so bad that I just stayed to see if it would be worse. Did that. Acting was also turned off. I can see why Mel Harris's career never really took off in his thirties, but he is adequate (though he seems too old for her fellow star). But supporting players come straight from the community building. I also lost the count of how many times they say "Budapest". Yes, it is pronounced Bood-a-phesht. We know, okay? In the middle of the movie, I realized that it must be one of those Harlequin movies and it certainly was. Guess that says it all.
