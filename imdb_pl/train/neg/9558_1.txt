I thought it was a sequel, and it was supposed to be the original from 1983. But the sequel does not take the original story and does not destroy it. <br /> <br /> I had very little expectations of this movie, but I just wasted 95 minutes of my life. Without tension - I actually feel clairvoyant, bad acting and so full of technical mistakes, so as a computer geek I could not believe it. They tried to make a mixture of a general war movie and 24 hours. But this is not even worth the low-budget TV movie. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie, it's a complete waste of time. Instead, get the original. The subject is still valid. Do not allow too much power into the machine. And acting and the story are much more exciting and fascinating.
