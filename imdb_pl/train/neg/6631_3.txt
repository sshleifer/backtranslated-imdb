Ram Gopal Verma proved that he is a very innovative and competent director. He made remake / remake of Godfather at Sarkar and was a huge success. As with Lolita, which he created as Nishaabd. <br /> <br /> Sholay is a movie that has repeatedly repeated that it inspired him most. Unfortunately, he managed to make a disappointing and ultimately boring remake. <br /> <br /> Acting ranged from decent to very good, and Amitabh Bachchan was as dangerous as the villain of Babban. <br /> <br /> The songs were awful and forgotten. The song Mehbooba Mehbooba appeared as a second-class music video. <br /> <br /> The worst was the pace and dialogues - which were forgotten. <br /> <br /> Watching a movie in the theater, I found myself waiting for a break, then at the end. Some viewers were wise not to wait, and they were seen going out throughout the duration of the movie. Finally, one of the worst films of Ram Gopal Verma.
