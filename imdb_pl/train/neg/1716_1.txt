Although it was a TV production, there is absolutely no excuse for the lowest results of the finished product. This film "DID" has a budget and has a casting department, so if you're going to make a movie about a real life story, or actually put a "real story" in the title, do not try to capture any realism? First of all, this movie is ridiculously populated. These actors belong to the daytime television soap or to these absurd Lifetime Channel movies, not to the real gangster / criminal story. Everything about them, from their appearance to manners, simply shouting a generation of listeners from the 90s. What about the script? Two words describe it - stupid and offensive, and again it's 90 times sounding. I do not think that the real Clyde Barrow would say the words "I am here." It's like a bunch of "New Kids on the Block" fans have gathered and decided to make a really "kewl flick" about Bonnie and Clyde, you know, who would be totally happy and rockin '. Well, this sticker does not even rank on the scale of advice and rockin. Anything that may be wrong with any type of film is bad here, from casting and acting to editing and music. Every single thing is grossly wrong ... and it's annoying that the parties responsible for this terrible turkey had the courage to put a "real story" in the title. Certainly this is NOT a real story, but what's worse is not even as funny as the thoughtless popcorn of popcorn accepted on its own terms. As I stated in my headline, it is simply horrible beyond words at every possible level. Trust me or watch at your own risk.
