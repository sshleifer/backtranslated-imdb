Throughout my life I can not understand why anyone would make such a movie. The plot is tired, the acting is strained, the language is always fouled, and sometimes too often using the word "F" seemed like a lack of dialogue, so "let's throw another pair of" F "for good so I want to hear American public opinion." Gossett was particularly nasty and seemed to enjoy his part. Forget about c__p, rent "Shrek" and have a good laugh.
