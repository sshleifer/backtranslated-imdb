Jennifer Jason Leigh and Mare Winningham are a good match showing very different siblings, but only Winningham is able to bring something convincing or meaningful to his role. Leigh, who plays in the bar team and alcoholist Sadie Flood, is constantly based on the older sis Georgia, the acclaimed folk singer Joni Mitchell. Perhaps because of her dual responsibilities as a co-producer of the film, Leigh seems to be putting in a corner: she is not credible as a singer, and even if it is intended, she gives herself too much time on the screen of the microphone. Probably hoping for a tour-de-force, Leigh is stretched out, nervous and frayed; but we just do not see any talent in this form (Leigh is obviously a solid actress, but he makes decisions that push us away from her). If Sadie had even a bit of charisma or roll call, we could buy the concept that she gets (small) breaks that she does. In reality, the chance of ever getting up on stage is small. Director Ulu Grosbard performs several intense dramatic sequences, and the editing in the finals juxtaposes Sadie's performance with sold-out Georgia performance - they both sing the same song - and this is a sad niuanska ... but really, what is the point? * 1/2 of ****
