If you are one of the people who find a great TV comedy, "According to Jim," it will affect your world. And can I add that it is right to prove that good talent, good writing and a charismatic star are all you really need in any network other than ABC, which prefers to fly nonsense like the Jim Belushi show from year to year. <br /> <br /> "K-911" is a large, steaming, brown German shepherd in the size of "thank you" for all the geniuses who loved the first movie. This is what the fans of this film and lesser Belushi deserve. Jim's comic cutlets and selection in projects are never far behind his ability to sculpt the blues standard. Look for him to try to present all his various talent gaps in any project that he throws in public like a surly chimpanzee from the zoo. <br /> <br /> If you like Jim's work, this movie is your reward.
