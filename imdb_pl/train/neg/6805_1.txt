I finished watching the movie 10 minutes ago ... How I still can not believe what I was watching. <br /> <br /> This is absolutely the worst movie EVER. If I mentioned all the disadvantages in the film, this review would take many sentences (very funny defects, although they are so bad) You must be surprised by the skills of the commandos assigned to rescue the plane. they did not even know how to move. <br /> <br /> Ice-t is such a bad actor ... and the thing I do not understand is the way in which production wanted him to be a hero, but he is zero ... <br /> <br / > Of course, the main drawbacks will be landing 747, only need 3 or 4 tips from the guy in the transmission to land the plane ... amazing ... as well as dead bodies that have almost no blood ... <br /> <br /> But I definitely recommend watching this movie because it is very interesting to see how something bad can happen
