When I was a child, we were always caregivers to children, and we always rented a movie or watched a movie at the cinema. This is one of the movies we watched. It's one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen. I think it can even be a Walt Disney movie! Martian falls down, turns into a man, befriends a man and tries everything to get back home. But he is distracted by the wonders of the Earth. The only good commentary I can give is the choice of actors Christopher Lloyd from Back to the Future, Martian, Jeff Daniel's Duck and Dumer as Tim O'Hara, Elizabeth Hurley as Brace Channing and Daryl Hannah as Lizzie. But besides, it's complete nonsense. Poor!
