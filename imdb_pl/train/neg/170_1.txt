Spectators spewing everyone, including the title sequence (now THIS is fun), would make us believe that it's a movie miracle, but believe me, it's one of the most embarrassing bad movies you could see, and if you do not laugh for five minutes, I would say you lost your sense of humor. <br /> <br /> David Niven plays the doomed and daring pilot of the RAF, who somehow considers it appropriate to attack a sensitive (female) air traffic controller in an emotional conversation about love, just as he plunges in his own and fiery death. (Is not it romantic ...) Of course, it saves him a strange metaphysical chance and is washing himself on the beach, just as the same air traffic controller goes on his bike. (They jolt immediately.) <br /> <br /> Looking over bizarre homo-erotic subtexts (so you really have to refer to them as supertekst√≥w, from a naked boy sitting naked in the shade on the sand) topic from the film about the dark zone, on his little flute, the celestial courier who camps / the queen and his make-up is more stuck than the ladies "), the strangest aspects of this film are the way that weaves such evil caricatures of national and racial stereotypes into an overwhelming attempt to argue some point about universal nature and the power of love. We get it - fly boys like girls in skirts and heels, and girls like back, and apparently all you have to do is cry a little, make it noble enough for the movie to get 10 stars on IMDb .... <br /> <br /> When it comes to production quality, continuity / editing is bad enough to cause anxiety, and lighting can be even worse than it, but almost no time to notice because the script is so bad. There are Technicolor games (anything passes for the sky is black and white, if you can understand the meaning of this) and preview (so funny that my colleague from the audience who usually likes movies like this actually cheered and laughed when the motorcycle the doctor finally ended up with a fiery wreck) and frozen movement (which is the funniest because the female advantage is so weak, standing still, you know that the stage hands were laughing at the camera). <br /> <br /> The best shots are the early ones on the beach, but then everything is downhill. The stairs (moving like escalators) are not, to put it mildly, Odessa's Steps, and I really warn everyone not to feel as if they have to see this poor attempt to make a film on their account. The whole movie is bad enough that it can be fun, and that's the best thing I can say.
