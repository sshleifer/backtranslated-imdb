I just spent four dollars renting this movie! Why Alliance Atlantis promotes such a bad excuse for the film is beyond me. But even more surprising were the pretty good reviews that a couple of Canadian press critics gave this film. I'm tired of the media justifying the movie just because it's Canadian and has a low budget. It's as if they were expecting Canadian movies to be bad, so they give a good reputation whatever. <br /> <br /> Now about the movie: Acting was below average (except for the main male character, which was actually quite good). The quality of the film was poor, which can be expected from an extremely low budget. The script was absolutely terrifying. An example is the story that revolves around one of the main characters, a female drug dealer who flirts with one of her clients so she can recruit him to repair and steal bikes for his gang, whose sole purpose is to randomly destroy SUVs. Apparently, many of her gang members' bikes are destroyed in these activities (I do not know how he can not afford to buy new ones because this is supposed to be the big drug relationship from Vancouver to Toronto). <Br /> <br /> Anyway, the purpose of the story (which has not been revealed until halfway through the movie) is that the drug dealer plans to shoot buildings near Toronto to try to make homes more affordable - how he will not want to live in the area. <br /> <br /> - I have to say more. <br /> <br /> A shame at the Toronto Film Festival for accepting such a film, Telefilm for his support, and Gazeta Globe and Mail and Georgia Straight for giving such biased opinions. <br /> <br /> The film should not be treated specially because it is Canadian !!!!
