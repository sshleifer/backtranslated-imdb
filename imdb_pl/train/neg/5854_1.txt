I just watched this movie on Flix after recording with the timer. I grew up watching F Troop and I had a hard time surviving Wrangler Jane, so I was shocked, literally shocked when I found out after watching the movie that Melody Patterson's degenerate nurse was dead, which looks pretty good but also looks completely different and is unfortunately poorly photographed. I would never guess that it was in a million years. What the hell is she doing in this picture? I agree with the guys here that the film lacks what it pushes. No sex, no blood, no bullying. It is also a remake of Atomic Brain aka Monstrosity (1964 or more). Most of the actions are boring; the protagonist spends a huge amount of time running around the mad doctor's and basement's house, and in the neighborhood, or is swindled by a cop, all boring and time-consuming. If the Italians did it, half of the movie would be Slingblade / uncle Ernest / Jack Elam, a supporter caressing the unconscious naked girls. But you only get it for 20 seconds.
