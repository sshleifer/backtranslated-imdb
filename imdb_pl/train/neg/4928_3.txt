This romantic adventure must have seemed shockingly subversive in its time. A wealthy Englishwoman from a higher class is planning, plotting and manipulating all around herself for her own satisfaction. He uses his privileged position to undertake secret activities with a decidedly anti-social character. There is a clever reversal of sexual roles, because her actions prove her bolder and more daring character than most male characters. But naturally there is a tall, dark and handsome stranger who sustains interest in love, and this wicked lady is not backward when she meets the right man. every other character makes the plot unconvincing, but those who want Romance will overlook it.
