Short version: Seeds are not worthless. It is simply derivative and worse. And soulless. <br /> <br /> Long version: If you've never seen any of the films containing the vaguely defined genre of "psychological horror," this movie will probably melt your face. Maybe not, but it will give you good burning. The initial installation of real abuse of animals will be enough to open the eyes to the possibilities of brutality on the video, and (only) the memorable scene upwards later in the movie will probably be more than you can handle. Climax will play with your emotions in a way that maybe no other movie has. <br /> <br /> But if you do not have much experience with this genre. If you've seen the real thing ... like August Underground's Penance, it will be awfully hard not to fall asleep to the end of the movie like me. <br /> <br /> Other reviewers have compared this to old videos. I understand this comparison. Like video, "Seed" is more violent than mainstream horror and less subtle. But the reason why videos are known to us is not only for the above reasons - those that are still popular have something special. Let me be ambiguous, I think you will understand: those who were stuck in the area had a "soul". <br /> <br /> Take this quote from Gabriele Crisanti, director of "Burial Ground", in an interview for the new -ish DVD: "... we will never have more such films, because today technology has outgrown the imagination. And the technology is cold. So many things will disappear because such small films will no longer be produced. Today we have great, unique tricks that are very expensive but are cold. Today, horror, this type of terrorist movie costs over a million dollars. These films were not so expensive ... they are real effects, made with our hands. " <br /> <br /> It is possible that the comparison to the old horror is treated so badly. But Crisanti hit the nail on the head. Even in their most seemingly exploitative, the best of nasty videos chased the primitive "truth". And this is where Boll is not doing. It is as if he saw movies and did not understand them. Everything on the checklist is ... BS on the subject of "speaking on the subject of humanity," indecent torture scene, etc. But this is, as Crisanti says, "cold." Gore is all CGI. The whole looks like scenes stuck with other films of different genres. And the stimulation is sooooooo slow. A man, so slow. <br /> <br /> Another interesting remark: this one scene really reminded me of the video game. <br /> <br /> In any case, just BS. Weak movie.
