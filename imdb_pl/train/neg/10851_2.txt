This movie was made for fans of Dani (and Cradle of Filth). I'm not one of them. I think he is a follower of black metal (I still am not a fan of black metal). But when I carried this DVD to pay for it, I found that the less authentic it is, the more it tries to be persuasive. So I assumed that I was on a rollercoaster ride with rubber gore and splash Do it yourself with an ominous background. That's what I like. <br /> <br /> I came home and threw him in. My patience lasted 15 minutes. AMAZING operation of the camera and disgusting quality. And then it was (2002) that it looked like it was shot with the Hi8 camera. I left it on the shelf. Maybe a nice evening with beer and Bmovies would create a nice place for this ... photo. <br /> <br /> After a few months I returned to him (in the aforementioned environment) and saw half. Then I was not only upset by the mentioned aspects. My reluctance has evolved. I noticed how funny Dani (1.65 m, height 5'5 ") looked at the shoes on the platform, tearing the robber's head (Yes, ripping, his head apparently had no skull). It does not make sense, but I have not finished yet, so I was not positive. <br /> <br /> After several more attempts, I finally managed to finish this movie - a few months ago ... (Yes, it took me 5.5 years). So - Dani was actually funny because HELP and film Szatana / Manson / the super-evil-male did NOT make sense. Why? Well, I think it's just very, very bad. In fact, both are and it is almost that. <br /> <br /> We have a few short stories attached to Dani. it was about a guy who STEALS SOMEONE'S LEG, because he wants to use it as his own. Yes exactly. <br /> <br /> ROCK BOTTOM of the actor. CGI is the worst in history. and, boy, there is CGI baaaaad Stinger. This story does not make sense. And the quality is ... Let's say it is not satisfying. The only thing that can make you watch is unmanageable violence and gore. Blood and guts are quite good. Why, in fact, you see that the film was made there and then moved on. (Example - Dani "The Man" Filth takes a stuffed cat - a fake one he can - and looks at him ... and then eats what came up, why? We never know, but we know that this cat had to be about illegal substances, because his heart is almost half the size.) <br /> <br /> You might think, after my comment, that this movie is so bad that it's good, but it's just bad. Cradle of Filth fans can add 3 points. I added one for gore.
