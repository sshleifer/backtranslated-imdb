I just saw this movie premiere on MTV. I must say that it was very average (at its best). Dialogue does not explain this story very well, and I felt like there were a lot of holes in the story. In this adaptation, there is no one nice character because of poor performance. I simply state that all characters are too possessive when it comes to someone they love. Also the love of Cate and Heath seems very incest. They seem more like brothers and sisters than lovers. I do not understand why my father would accept something like that under his roof. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie because of a few actors I respected and liked to watch in previous movies, but as I said it is extremely difficult to like any of the characters. Katherine Heigl's performance was horrible, which was a complete shock. She was terrible, being Edward's ugly older sister, and Aimee Osbourne did not have enough poems to criticize her performance. Johnny Whitworth was doing well and it was great to see him in something new and though his character was a bit of a kooky, he was the only person I sympathized with. As for Erika Christensen and Mike Vogel, they were supposed to be our heroines, but they were in vain and exaggerated. <br /> <br /> I just did not like this movie or the music in it. There was a short performance by the Christian punk band MxPx, but this small look would not convince me to watch the movie again. MTV did a huge job, convincing me that it was not a movie. I imagined something completely different.
