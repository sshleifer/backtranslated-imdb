If you value the renaissance in Asian horror, do not bother Gawi. The film does not deserve attention next to A-list works such as Ring, A Tale of Two Sisters, Cure and Ju-On (and even such good material as The Eye or Inner Senses). These films are full of subtlety, unexpected images, rich characters and a decidedly non-Western approach to what is frightening. Gawi is trapped along with the remains of limbs and bodies of everything that made the American horror bad for the last twenty-five years. <br /> <br /> The movie tries to connect the Asian ghost story with a Hollywood movie, but it does not fit well. One aesthetics must suppress the other; guess which one? If you do not have your own story, tell the filmmakers that they are playing the ring for the story of evil, but the situation is hopeless. Clich√©s, crap characters, witless plotting, boring spirit, ho hum.
