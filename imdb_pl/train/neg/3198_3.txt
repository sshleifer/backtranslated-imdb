In short, the film had some weak first act with forced action and a somewhat chaotic rhythm and rhythm, in a sense a decent second act, which managed to build tension and intrigue despite the inconsistent stimulation and inferior casts, and the third act ... practically there was NO third act! <br /> <br /> As for the third act, the movie just ends abruptly. There is no solution or path from the climax of the second act, so there was not much of the third act. The bad ones will die and that's all; final credits are over. Nothing shows what happens to the protagonist and supporting heroes, and so on. The audience would probably leave the theater after the movie, asking "all this?" Real disappointment. <br /> <br /> The music was composed by David Bell, who acted enough to serve the movie most of the time, but it certainly is not unusual. It is simply functional, but it achieves this by being only general and derivative. It is also obvious that the score is VERY outdated with the use of synthesized boilers for some drums. At least it impressed me that some moments of tension heralded musical signals sounding as if they had been taken out of James Horner from "48 HRS". and "Commando", especially brass. <br /> <br /> In total, the film had potential, because the story itself is good, but the execution was poor with poor direction, weak acting and a somewhat inconsistent pace. <br /> <br /> Actually, there was no third act to correctly end the story, and this omission is serious and inexcusable because it does not allow the film to end in a satisfactory manner. It could be a scenario or possibly production had to stop filming or editing the third act to the finished film due to budget constraints (but I speculate why there is no third act). Regardless of the reason, the sudden ending really hurts the film. <br /> <br /> It's good for the view, if you're curious and you can get a VERY cheap movie, and find out why you should have 3 acts (start, middle, end) if you write scenarios and shoot movies. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, you may not want to waste time unless you get the MST3K version to at least laugh a little.
