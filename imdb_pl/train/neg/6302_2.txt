The British 'heritage film' industry has been out of control. There is nothing wrong with making classic novels, but why should all be filmed by talented people? This movie wrenches the guts from Orwell's difficult novel, turning it into a harmless, fluffy romantic comedy. "Aspidistra" may not be Orwell's best job, but no one who reads it can forget about its great image of poverty. Orwell emphasizes not only coldness and hunger, but humiliation of being poor. In the novel, London is a gloomy, gray, cold, soulless city, and Comstock prays for it to be destroyed by a bomber squadron. But this movie squeezes everything that can be disturbing in any way, and creates a cheerful nostalgic trip to the charming London of the 1930s, where everything is lit with golden rays of sunshine, and Lambeth's slums are picturesque and filled with freshly scrubbed urchins and happy prostitutes. Comstock's poems with a sharp breeze winding around garbage littered streets seem completely out of place in this world of chocolate boxes. The worst thing is that the scenario is relentless, ancient jokes and clumsy dialogue. It's so frustrating because Richard E. Grant is the perfect person to play Gordon Comstock, and the movie is full of great actors. But that's all for nothing. This movie made me so angry! The literary history of Great Britain is proud of its richness, complexity and strength. What will we do about it? We employ bland nobodies to turn them into soft, anodyne papers for people who want to feel that they "get a culture" while they drink Horlicks and fall asleep quietly.
