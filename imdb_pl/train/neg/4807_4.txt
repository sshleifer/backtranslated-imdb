"Ambushed" is not an ordinary action. It's very bad to be ordinary. One man walks towards the other with a burning machine gun. The second man shoots one round and throws the man with greater firepower, without losing anything with the hail of flood falling on him. Guess who is a good guy. Duh. That is "Ambush". It's not a good action movie, it's not a good drama, it's not a good movie, "Ambushed" fails at all levels, and the cast of B movie veterans mechanically goes through the movements almost as if they knew they were making a real loser. I do not recommend it to anyone. <br /> <br />
