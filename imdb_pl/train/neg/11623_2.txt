From all I read about the film, I was excited about the support of a Christian film. Everything about the film was very unprofessional. Especially writing! Without good writing, the film has no chance. The writer / director said in an interview that he does not want to reveal how the title relates to history. Believe me, it was not a big surprise. I waited for the development of teenagers / young adults' history, but it never happened. As a person who has undergone a divorce, I was very disappointed. This movie would not be a consolation for me when I first experienced emotional confusion that a divorce can bring to your life as a Christian!
