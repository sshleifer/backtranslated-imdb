"Black Angel" is a small crime story, and June Vincent as a woman tries to save her husband from an electric chair after he is found guilty of killing an old friend. Dan Duryea (the husband of a murdered woman) decides to help Vincent find the real culprit. Peter Lorre has one ungrateful role as a suspect. This movie noir looks and plays like a cheap programmer, never achieving anything special. It is pleasant enough, but at some point it ceases to make sense, and solving the mystery provokes one of these great reactions, "give me peace". The ending itself could completely drown the movie, but what precedes the conclusion is also not very good. Vincent is a naughty character, and Duryea has never been very good at playing good guys. I love movie noirs, but this one was a real disappointment.
