Flame, flame. It seems to be Gammer in a nutshell, a prehistoric creature who can take them away and throw them away with equal resignation. I'm not a fan of Japanese monster movies, but I've devoted myself to watching all the movies from fifty DVD movies from the science-fiction collection released by Mill Creek / Treeline Films. That's a great value for about twenty-five bucks, so for fifty cents a movie really comes down to making investments in time to see some of the stupid offers. <br /> <br /> Gammer is upset for centuries through a nuclear explosion and is not happy. Like Godzilla, he takes him to Tokyo, launching the United Nations and trying to come up with a plan to save the planet. They reach the "Z plan", the hope of the world, and do not you know that there is a scene in which a huge shed is shown, which is called the "Plan Z" building; it was a nice touch. <br /> <br /> In the mid-1960s, this country was still not quite politically correct. One of the American military scenes at Alaskan Air Defense Sector has General Arnold asking the sergeant for coffee. I do not think there were any privates around. <br /> <br /> Good old Gammer was quite a nice sight, walking on two legs and moving to throwing flames when he was challenged. That's why I was surprised by the way Plan Z managed to capture the turtle in the nose cone of a hidden space ship, bringing it to Mars to save the world. High Fives for the American and Russian teams that saved, now let's get back to the Cold War. <br /> <br /> Similarly to Godzilla, Gammera spawned at least a dozen or so films, but after seeing this nice one, I am satisfied with the interest in flying, burning turtles. Especially that this DVD package, which I mentioned earlier, has a "Monster Attack" with the guest appearance of Big G. It took me all that I managed to get through to the end of both films; it was such a relief that I was able to reach the last cage in the one that said "Gammer, Sayonara!"
