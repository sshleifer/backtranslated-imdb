As a fan of the history of the navy from World War II and someone who is not proud of the history of racial relations in this country, I could not wait for this film. What a disappointing piece of schlock. I did it about 3/4, but I should have turned it off on the subatak stage. The idea that a U-Boat would launch a torpedo in DDE, as if there was hope for it, and then was able to "escape" from the DDE during immersion, is ridiculous. And that's just a small detail. The whole film was poorly written, poorly directed and badly played. I agree with others in this forum that it could be a good movie. It is as if they decided that since all these bad propaganda films from the Second World War were made of completely white castings, they had to create one with black people. And as bad as old movies, it's actually worse. At the head of Ossie Davis and Stephen Rawa almost feel false advertising. It turns out that they had very small roles. I have to believe that these two great actors were ashamed that they were involved in this film. I'm done. Too much of my life I devoted to this nonsense movie.
