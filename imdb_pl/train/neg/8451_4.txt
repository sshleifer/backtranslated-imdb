I must admit that I liked the first half of Sleepers. It looked good, the acting was even better, the story of childhood, pain and revenge was interesting and moving. An excellent Hollywood movie. But ... Nobody has mentioned it so far (at least in the last 20 comments), when it came to court scenes, and the character of Brother Pitt followed his plan to save two friends who are rightly accused of murder, I felt cheated. This film offended my intelligence. <br /> <br /> Warning Spoilers !! <br /> <br /> Why did someone accept their false alibi, a priest's witness? If these two guys were with him, why should not they say that during the investigation? Amnesia? If you were a judge or a jury member, would you believe? Is it wise to give the motive of the killers? <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but in the end the story is very poor, and it annoys me. This movie had great potential. 4/10
