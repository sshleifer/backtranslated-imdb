Belmondo is a hard clay. He goes for a great drug dealer (played by Henry Silva, usually a great villain - see "Sharky's Machine", but here he is clearly called and therefore he lacks the usual charisma). He goes to the most wonderful places in Paris and Marseille, asks for names, beats some people, gets names, goes to darker places, asks for more names, beats more people, etc. The whole movie is a blow after a blow. It seems that the people who created it had no other ambition than to create the French equivalent of "Dirty Harry." Belmondo, who was 50 years old, performs some good acrobatics at the beginning; in addition, Le Marginal is a brutal, episodic, banal, shallow and forgotten movie of a policeman. (* 1/2)
