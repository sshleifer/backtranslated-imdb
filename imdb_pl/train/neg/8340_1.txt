One of the worst movies I've ever seen. I was so bored that I turned him off half to see the news. When I turned it on again, I fell asleep. The film begins with a dream, continues the dream and ends with a dream. Then there are a few dreams. Come on, what interests me? The film must have a reason to be interesting. The moment when you felt that the movie is just a dream happens when a sensible filmmaker turns off. Has anyone ever insisted on telling you your dreams and what does it mean to them? This is it! <br /> <br /> Absolutely terrible.
