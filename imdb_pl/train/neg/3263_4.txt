This is the second British film that adapts Sommerset Maugham's story to the film. Everything but one story from the "Quartet" does not go well in the contemplative era; and the actors' speech is definitely "cut off", as can only be the delivery of British actors before 1950. In anycase, "Trio" seems to be more strict and cinematic than the first adaptation of the film. <br /> <br /> One of the problems that these two films can not overcome is that their source material was written 25-30 years before the movies. Therefore, in the 1950s (pre-war), Maughm's popular "little morality" seemed quite peculiar, if not absurd.
