This movie seemed better than it ended. The cinematography is good, the acting seemed solid, the dialogue was not too stiff ... but then about twenty minutes takes this long scene with the Doctor you know is a patient in the asylum pretending to be a Doctor - from there he goes to the south. <br /> <br /> Besides, the demon is about the stupidest-looking hellish things from the days that look like Godzilla in Curse of the Demon. There are also some weird devil worshipers who wear masks that look like exploding teens from the beginning of Logan's Run. <br /> <br /> In the end, the photos could not save this movie. Despite the fairly solid performances of the actors, the story simply does not go anywhere. I think that "Hellbored" would be a better title.
