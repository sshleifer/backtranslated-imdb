I just watched the movie for the first time. I wanted to watch it, how I like Drew Barrymore and wanted to see one of her early films. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of a girl (played by a young and beautiful Drew Barrymore) who moves from New York to Los Angeles to overcome a recent worried loss. Shortly after moving to the guy who falls in love with it, it becomes obvious that he has a bad twin = doppelganger who haunts her. <br /> <br /> The film is quite poor and bad. Both dialogues and acting make the film worth watching. All in all, it's just something for Drew Barrymore fans.
