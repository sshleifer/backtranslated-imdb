I am a guy who usually keeps his opinions, but I just came back from this movie and felt that I have to express my opinions. Let me start with the fact that I am a huge fan of horror. But what makes a horror movie? I certainly would like to see at least a bit of a good script and character development. I know that they often lack horror films, but "Prom Night" looked like they did not even make any efforts in this department. Then we all love tension. It is on the edge of your seat uncertain unexpected surprises. Yes, Prom Night did not have anything! Of course we like a terrifying killer. Prom Night has it? No, he has a nice boy with a lovely lily knife. And when all else fails ... at least the horror has its guilty pleasure to make it pleasantly like gore gore and nude scenes from time to time! Yes, well, when you have a horror movie marked PG-13 like Prom Night, they also leave it. So, when all these elements are missing, I ask ... does it still matter as a horror movie? No. I would call it more comedy. People in my theater laughed at it when I saw "Semi-Pro", which was supposed to be a comedy in fact (which also sucked, but that's another story!). I think I will have to give up the new horror movie. All good horror movies from the last good days have been turned into rubbish, so movie studios can make money. The people I came to see did not even know it was a remake! What pissed me off! I wonder what will happen when there are no more movies to make? Where will the horror go ???
