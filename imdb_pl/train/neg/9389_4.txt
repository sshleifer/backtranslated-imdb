According to IMDb, as well as to any other website that has a review; this "thing" has no director. Well, it would certainly explain a lot! Only a handful of people who have gathered together to shoot perverted porn sequences and throw an ultra-thin story about the worship of the devil and the victims of women in the walls of an isolated sanatorium. "Hardgore" is the best example of the completely crazy stupidity of the 70s, because it is really created with minimal production value and script inspiration. Horror stories about satanic cults were extremely popular in the early 70s and pornography, so why not combine the two? Here is a simplified story about a young girl with a nymphomaniac who is involved in mental asylum and from the first night she gets involved in a network of drugs, psychedelic orgies, rape, torture and dildo action. Really, a lot of dildo shares. A friendly lesbian nurse tries to warn her, but she has a slit throat even the same night. Aspects of horror are really underdeveloped, going from the ridiculously unpredictable masks of Satan to virulent attacks of spoiled penises. Shooting and acting are almost unbearable, but what can you expect from a film that contains footage of vibrators shooting sperm and talking amputated male reproductive organs? The leading lady Justin Lynn is a pretty girl with a thrilling body, but most of her stars (male and female) are hideous and over-slimming spheres.
