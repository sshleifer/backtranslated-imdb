Even in a bad movie there is usually some redemption function, something that could be said to be so awful, but there was such a performance, or this part of the script, or this special effect, it was just awful. Acting was ridiculous, the script was terrible, complemented by many inexplicable breakfasts at Tiffany's, and even the special effects were at best cheesy. It was a very bad movie that even Drew Barrymore wished to remove from history. Observe if you want to: a) suffer from your own pain. b) See how bad a movie can be. This is one movie in which I can use the banal "ninety minutes of my life, which I will never come back to" with some justification!
