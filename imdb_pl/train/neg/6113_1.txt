I was shouting because watching this movie was my first film experience at the age of 13 months. I remember that it was incredibly bloody and it made me angry. A few years ago, I watched him again on television. Big mistake - acting is wooden, the story does not exist, and the film lacks merit, unless the 23-year-old T & A is what gives you a chance ...
