It could have been based on historical events and we know that the creators of this TV documentary drama took the liberty to make it more dramatic - I can live with it - but it was just badly done! I was amazed in the case of a growing crisis in the air, as everyone seemed calm, certainly someone would panic, and what a smooth flight, without the apparent discomfort of the passenger - come on! I'm not sure about the rules, now some air security seems to be nonsense OTT, but why take off shoes before emergency landing, common sense tells me that this is not a good idea! Shots of this massive plane descending on this distant runway were unconvincing and false. In fact, it would be an amazing view of the earth nearby, in this movie it was disproportionate and looked like a model that probably was. There were escape slides on the front and middle emergency doors, but no one seemed to come out in front, although the decline was much smaller. The captain returned to the plane after landing - why? this has never been explained. We know that the emergency landing was due to lack of fuel, but there must have been some fuel spilling out at the bottom of the tanks, and the risk of explosion had to be a real threat, but the evacuation seemed almost trouble-free and everyone stood at the foot of the slide, instead of going so far as possible as I probably would have done. There were too many inconsistencies, mistakes and falsified activities in this. I would rather see a drama show in real time and a realistic movement of the presented plane. He had the potential to be quite exciting, but undoubtedly because of budget constraints failed, and made someone feel that the plane losing all the engines is not really a big deal, and you'll safely slide down a bit of a bumpy landing, but not the real danger ! - The reality is of course a bit different!
