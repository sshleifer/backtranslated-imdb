"Child problem" is one of the most stupid movies in history. This is not the worst (though some people will not agree with me), but it is also not the best. It's about a devilish 7-year-old boy who is destroying the comic devastation of childless couples (John Ritter, Amy Yasbeck), who foolishly adopts him. This movie is too stupid and unbelievable because I do not buy for one second that a child can behave as unkindly as a child in this movie. He is asinine and ridiculous, although all the time I was laughing a few times (I really do not know why). But I can not recommend this movie. I know I'm too kind to her. If there is something positive about the "Child Problem", it's better than the sequel, which was just awful. <br /> <br /> ** (out of four)
