This movie is just boring. <br /> <br /> Trying to copy some of the effects borrowed to a creative director like Jeunet in "Am√©lie Poulain", but that's too much. Dialogues are very bad, some of the worst I have ever heard, Guillaume Canet is not convincing (I almost never found him very convincing), his father plays very badly in the film, the story is stupid, the ending is .... stupid. <br /> <br /> I think I did not like the movie so much because "le pacte des loups" from Christophe Gans (and I watch / see about 80-100 films a year)), but at least this movie had some action and many good actors. <br /> <br /> I have never commented here (only rated), and when I saw the scores and comments, I thought I had to write something wrong. <br /> <br /> I do not think we will have any problems with selling the DVD we were offered: not a bad movie in our (large) collection !!! <br /> <br /> I am open (I watch SF, westerns, dramas, comedies, silence, horror movies, fantasy films ...), but this movie was so boring that I felt I had lost an hour and a half.
