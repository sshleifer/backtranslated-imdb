I watched the episode. Yes, I've sat down all this unhappy experience and I have to say that this comedy brand is one of the worst you'll ever get. Imagine Peter Griffin, the fame of Family Guy. Now imagine Peter Griffin as a woman (though slim and without glasses), except that now he lacks something that made him hilarious. Peter Griffin is an idiot, but he does not know that he is an idiot. Sarah has no real character, she has no acting ability to pull her character away. Maybe it's trivial, joking jokes that make her comedy even lower than her character, she can do it herself. Maybe it's a lack of reliable films. Her insensitive bigotry personality can speak to insensitive, bigoted people as opposed to mass appeal, which is the insensitive, bigotry figure of Stephen Colbert. Like Bill O'Reilly, Sara creates an annoying, distasteful character. She lacks something that is necessary for satire, let alone the whole world of comedy. What Sarah Silverman is missing is noticeable. And when you do not believe in it and do not identify with it, it's not funny anymore.
