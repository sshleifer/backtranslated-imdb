I start writing this review during a break in watching a movie. I tried to do it for the first time, but I have trouble going through it without occasional interruptions. This is not because it is intense, but because it is bad. <br /> <br /> It is almost painfully boring and unbelievable, especially when the supernatural, solid dying brother Ryan (Colm Feore) is on the screen tragic and strange, indulgent-lucid. It would be a much better movie if they just left this character behind the story. <br /> <br /> Adds only a melodious, silly, very irritating melodrama. Maybe someone decided that if they could not get Ryan to believe, they would simply make him unbearable. The problem is: Who cares if a spoiled, grumbling, nasty jerk dies? Not me. <br /> <br /> The only thing this character has for him is that he dies and apologizes, but that's not enough. Dying does not make anyone special. WE EVER die, sooner or later. No one has the right to expect sympathy, behaving like a moron. <br /> <br /> The other two characters and actors who play them (David Cubitt as Theo and Chandra West as Sarah) are very interesting, and their story, without interrupting the pangs of Ryan, would make a much better movie. But it's not over yet and it's time to play PLAY again. Maybe something big is happening before the end .... <br /> <br /> No. Excuse me. This hired turkey is coming back tonight!
