I do not like The Pallbearer, it's not that bad but in those days it's very slow. As the film becomes more interesting, but it is not brilliant. I really like David Schwimmer and I think he's good here. I'm not a big fan of Gwyneth Paltrow, but sometimes it does not bother her and it's fine. Pallbearer is not a recommended movie, but if you like to drive, you can enjoy it.
