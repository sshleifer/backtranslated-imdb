This version is probably available at your local dollar store on DVD. The print is not great, just like the sound, but if you have $ 1.00 and 90 or more minutes, you'll get the value of money (which does not say much). Anna Neagle is extremely boring like Nanette. Regardless of her charms, they are not visible in this movie. The film features many great actors (Helen Broderick, Zasu Pitts, Even Arden), but the material is extremely poor. Nevertheless, it is interesting how such great performers use weak writing. Music numbers (there are only two) are quite awful. Of course, the studio did not feel compelled to earn the rich musicality of the original "No, no, Nanette". For how much it is worth it, you can buy a DVD for $ 1.00. It's worth saying that you saw it.
