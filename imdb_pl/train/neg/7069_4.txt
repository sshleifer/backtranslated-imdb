When the film was released, it was the biggest hit and soon became Blockbuster. But honestly, the movie is a funny watch with a story that glorifies the loser. The movie has the Tag line - "Preeti Madhura, Tyaga Amara", which means that Love's Sweet, but Sacrifice is Immortal. In the film, the movie hero (Ganesh) devotes his love to the leading lady (Pooja Gandhi), even though they both loved each other! Its justification is the meaning of the markup line. This film has influenced so many young broken hearts that it was recognized that the attitude of "Loser-like Sacrificial" is very well thought out, and thus became a cult film in which they could transfer their lives. The actress Ganesh in the film is Amateurish, Crass and Childishly stupid. The song looks really funny (Onde Ondu Sari ...), when it has to look stylish and cool. His appearance also does not help in the main role. His hairstyle is poorly made in most parts of the film. POOJA GANDHI CANT ACT. Her costumes are scary in the film and very inconsistent. <br /> <br /> A good part of the movie are great photos and brilliant music by Mano Murthy, which are actually the true graces of this film. Also Jayant Kaikini's lyrics are very well written. Director Yograj Bhat must be praised by presenting the songs in a tasteful manner. <br /> <br /> Anyway, except for songs, the movie is very ordinary !!!!!!
