The film is complete nonsense. We have two good actors who are poorly manned and are the head of the actor Salman Khan to attract the audience. History is nonsense. Figures badly sketched. Non-existent story. You do not need to edit. Ajay Devgan as a rock star ... is a dream. The film stretches to the point of decadence. The whole farce about Arjuna bringing Manna to London, let him be gropeing his girlfriend and let him not play on Wembley (Vimbley in the dubbing process) is absurd. Salman Khan's work at the highest level or pretending is too painful to watch. I remember seeing some good movies from this producer Vipula Shah, but this is not one of them. It seems that all the good directors fall victim to the Box Office mania created by Mumbai Media Morons. This is another shitty movie in the style of "Wanted" with an idiot actor like Salman Khan who has no place in Good Hindi Cinema. It is good for Indian cinema, as well as Titanic for winter business. On the positive side - I like Asin's character dancing Bharatnatyam when he changes into Western-style dance when the teacher is not looking.
