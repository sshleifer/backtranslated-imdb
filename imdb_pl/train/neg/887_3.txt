After the success of "Paris, Je T'Aime", a group of directors decided to gather and create a similar film in the style of an anthology based in New York. Unlike the original movie, the stories in this movie sometimes seem to come and go too quickly - until you think they're beginning to talk, in too many cases it ends. And they often start and stop, and then start again - with stories intertwined together. As a result, there is no title indicating that the story is complete and has a less formal structure. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, while "Paris, Je T'Aime" was hit or missed (mainly a hit), most of the "New York, I Love You" was missing. The stories were more sexual in nature, but also much less sweet - and often rather horrible. It was an unusually boring and uninteresting movie with just a few unique stories - and perhaps the often depressing music made it seem more. Now I understand that it was a good quality music, but her grim tone really made me feel like I had my wrists cut! Among the better was the story of a young man who took the girl in a wheelchair to the ball, the couple talked about scams outside the restaurant (although it was also in the first movie) and the old woman. It's all so sad because I liked the first movie so much - and I really WANT to love this movie. I respected what they tried, but I just did not like it. <br /> <br /> By the way, and this is NOT a real complaint, but I was amazed how many people smoked in the film. In the case of the latest film, it was extraordinary in our more anti-smoking culture. <br /> <br /> Also, if you get a DVD, there are two segments included as additions that were not included in the movie. One is made up of Kevin Bacon (wearing a nice fedora) eating a hot dog .... and absolutely NIC more for almost ten minutes. The second presents a teenager who releases a video in the world - including a very unhappy couple.
