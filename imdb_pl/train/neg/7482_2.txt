This movie is NOT funny - such a waste of big stars that seem so absorbed in their own star that they forget. John Cleese is just a hotel manager who likes to dress up - almost powerless laughter falls from the chair when he dances to Donna Summer's "Bad Girls", wearing high heels, a mink coat and a delicate hat. The rest: FORGET!
