When I saw it in the shop, I thought it looked really good and original. Like Wolfs Creek, he meets a Texas massacre and I mean it cost only three pounds (about $ 6). Honestly, I do not think it's worth it. <br /> <br /> It looked as if directors - "butchers brothers" could not decide if they wanted to do something like artistic horror, or a slasher of terror. It ended up in a sadistic, sadistic hour and fifteen minutes, when all the characters were one-dimensional, and you did not care about what happened to them, but trying to make the audience take care of the characters to whom they added a useless monologue and the beginning of the movie, which, to be honest, was not needed. <br /> <br /> The only good part was the middle / end - I will not ruin it for you. But that was the only "good" part. <br /> <br /> Generally a pointless watch. I felt like in a two-hour movie, but in reality it's only 75 minutes. If you want art cinema - do not worry. If you want a slasher movie - do not worry - the movie moves so slowly that nothing happens.
