One of the worst romantic comedies (no, the worst movies) I've ever seen. The boy (who works as a phone psychologist!) Must pretend to be gay to move into the apartment with the woman of his dreams. Hilarity is not created. Boredom, light gaying and terrible dialogue. If you read Brad Melzer and you like his poor dialogue, you'll love this movie. <br /> <br /> Be smart. Avoid this. if you see him, destroy the copy.
