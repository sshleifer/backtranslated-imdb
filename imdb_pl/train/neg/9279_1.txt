As with many other franchise pop-culture series, this line simply did not know when to end. Instead of leaving things as they were perfectly finished, they continued to generate this; the first edition of this series is very poor. <br /> <br /> This movie should never happen. There was not a fourth movie in this line and it definitely shows. The assumption is idiotic, and the portraits were the same. <br /> <br /> After the wonderful experience of The Omen, it was a huge disappointment that smelled of 70's cheese and terrible acting. It was like the horror of Amityville in these aspects, and it left a terrible, heavy stench for a long time after its end. <br /> <br /> Ocenia 1,4 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fienda :.
