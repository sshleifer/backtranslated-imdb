Kubrick meets King. I remember that it sounded so promising in the spring of 1980. Then a movie appeared, and Kubrick's cultists argued with the king's cultists from that time on. <br /> <br /> The King's bodybuilders claim that Stanley Kubrick took the big story of horror and ruined it. Kubrick's cultists do not care about the king's history. They talk about Steadicams, tracking photos, camera angles. This movie, they say: it should be considered alone. It just so happens that both camps are correct. Unfortunately. <br /> <br /> If anyone thinks this is an adaptation of King's novel, "The Shining" is in fact a failure, a missed opportunity, a series of unsuccessful narrative gambits. <br /> <br /> I blamed Kubrick's screenwriter. Author of Diane Johnson (author of the book Le Marriage, L'Affaire, Le Divorce, etc.). He has a reputation as a novelist about social manners. Maybe she was chosen because of her subtle understanding of marital relationships or family dynamics. But the small working-class Sidewinder in Colorado does not exist on any map in the Frankophilic Universe. <br /> <br /> Kubrick the Anglophile probably found her sympathetic. He is of course a real author. His script for the film "Shining" - with its unusual psychology, rationalism, supernaturalism and alleged reincarnation - just can not stand the logical analysis. <br /> <br /> I am willing to consider Kubrick's "Shining" on his own terms. I am even inclined to take it for something other than a conventional horror movie. But it also fails as a naturalistic study of isolation, alienation and madness. Either way, the movie almost falls apart. <br /> <br /> Are the horrors of the Overlook Hotel real? Or do they exist only in the mind - first as the prophetic nightmares that little Danny Torrance suffered, and then as hallucinations of the father? It is noted that whenever Jack Torrance sees a conversation with a "ghost", in reality he looks in the mirror. You can see that the frozen hotel topiary-hedge labyrinth seems to symbolize Jacek's dwarfed psyche. Very deep things. <br /> <br /> But if the Overlook ghosts are purely a manifestation of Jacek Torrance's growing madness, who exactly allows the imprisoned Jack to get out of the kitchen cabinet, so that he can continue his crazy, crude ax? <br /> <br /> And can EVERY explain, with a straight face, this black and white photo of Nicholson (helpfully labeled "1921") as a party in a tuxedo - his, who jumps from the left field and the wall of a hotel-room the ball during the last seconds of the movie? Should we seriously conclude that Jacek Torrance's Bad Craziness is derived from a certain kind of past life experience? (And if you swallow it, if the reincarnated people are to be exact physical replicas of their past?) <br /> <br /> Maybe Kubrick did not care about his story. Maybe I just wanted to create a mood of horror. Whatever the case, the film tries to secure its narrative bets - to have them both ways, rational and supernatural. As a result, history is a mess. This movie has not improved with age and certainly does not improve with repeated reviews. <br /> <br /> I do not deny that a few moments of fear, claustrophobia and general horror are scattered throughout this long time, a long film. But those who spew Windami about the Blood, seen many times in Danny's visions, are absurd and ridiculous. And the infamous lines of Jack Torrance ("Wendy, I'm home!" And "Heeeeeere's JOHNNY!") Simply pierce the dramatic tension of the film and disperse its narrative energy. (I know: I was sitting in the theater and I heard the audience laugh comically: "Phew, I'm glad we do not have to take it seriously!") Finally, Kubrick is completely at sea - or completely cynical - during the scenes in which Wendy she wanders around an empty hotel while her husband tries to let go of her son. A foyer full of mummified guests, all sitting there dead in their hats? Yikes, now I'm really scared. <br /> <br /> Given the brilliance of Jack Nicholson over the years, one can only assume that he gave only a kind of rolling eyeballs, moving the eyebrows, the scenery that the director wanted. Shelley Duvall performance as a female version of Don Knotts in "The Ghost and Mr. Chicken, "it's best to remain silent in silence. <br /> <br /> This movie just does not work - not as an adaptation, not on its own terms. He probably deserves 3 out of 10, but I give him 1 because he was so right in this forum.
