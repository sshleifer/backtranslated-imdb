The film had some nice aspects. Maybe too much for my taste. It seemed that the screenwriter / director desperately tried to force us to feel the internal conflict of ALL of his characters. Not once, several times ... but all the time. <br /> <br /> This is a television job, not a cinema. <br /> <br /> The location of the railway station was well chosen and I liked the performance of Sascha Horler as a pregnant friend. <br /> <br /> I felt like Justine Clarke's performance was pale. Her reactions to things were forced, as if the director tried to vocalize the themes of the film through expressions of the heroine. I can not believe that the director can make the wonderful Daniel Farinacci an incredible presence. <br /> <br /> I do not understand how the choice of pop music flooded whole sequences. It is a lazy device, especially when pop music comes from a place where there is no place for a movie and / or when the song lyrics are embarrassingly ardent. <br /> <br /> Having said that, the film is characterized by airy, which evokes Australian heat and local attitude with originality. It creates an atmosphere of warmth and sunshine. Especially through the use of great animation sequences that save the film from total mediocrity, giving it passion and hand-made charm. <br /> <br /> I am curious why dialogue is so overworked. "Who knows if there is any god? Like some guy sitting in the sky, telling us what to do, "or whatever the line was. <br /> <br /> Perhaps one of the most troublesome moments was a friend coming home from a cricket with a bouquet of flowers to declare his wife "I quit smoking." <br /> <br /> Anti-smoking advertisement? TAC advertisement with a tasteful animation? I had to leave the cinema after 50 minutes - it was too much.
