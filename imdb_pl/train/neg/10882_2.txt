This movie is one of the worst horrors I've ever seen. From the first scene I knew it would be a disaster. It starts with a seemingly evil girl killing a group of nuns in a mission. As it turns out, people in him were possessed by random zombies. Well, a few years later, some college friends are taking an oath. Horrible acting goes from the pledge to the head. Things like a jockey shouting at him to do things in a completely non-chalonte manner, with the promise of reacting and abusing the whole "willing to be a popular role" What really took this cake is the final battle. Absolutely frightening special effects with pistols. Noise flashing guns, for example, and vice versa. it is accompanied by zombies-stop-animations (why move in a time-lapse movement is a secret), cheap music and about 40 pistols that appear out of nowhere. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is crappy. Like many others, you can rent for 50 cents at the nearest movie rental agency.
