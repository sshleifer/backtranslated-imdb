This film is about a Japanese who is obsessed with calligraphy on the skin. <br /> <br /> The plot is absolutely strange. I do not see any "sensual" or "erotic" tones. The plot turns the ancient art form into fetishist pornography. In addition, scenes recorded in Hong Kong certainly portray bad parts of Hong Kong, such as an airport in the middle of the city, poor living conditions and noise pollution. Throughout the movie I still think that The Pillow Book offends the Japanese culture and environment of Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> "The Pillow Book" is a perverse but boring movie. Seriously stay away from him.
