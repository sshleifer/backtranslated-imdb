Yes, to make the movie fans understand the meaning of this movie, I decided to write another review. Last time I missed a few things ... <br /> <br /> First the script. Second, acting. Thirdly, Jesus Christ, what they were thinking, doing a piece of rubbish and then expecting us to enjoy it when there are no redeeming features from beginning to end, except when Joseph Fiennes is finally amazed at the very unexpected the highlight !!! br /> <br /> I can not believe I wasted my money when I could give it away to a homeless person or dealer or SOMETHING! <br /> <br /> Do you get a photo?
