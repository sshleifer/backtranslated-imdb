OK, I found this movie in my father, an old stack of movies and it looked pretty good from the cover, but the movie really sucked !! OK, the first story with the swimmer was quite good, but it took her some time to get in, and the boy was completely delayed! It was not even scary! His dream sounds like a bedtime story. Then the girls with the news were completely delayed. I'm sure someone will call a news guy and ask him to come with you. But she ended up fine where she stabbed him, and she was in the hospital and saw him on t.v, and he told her all that junk. Next was this nice, funny story about a guy who brought dead people ... It's so stupid that I will not say more about it. The last one was the best. It was not so scary, but the idea of ​​this story was pretty cool ... yeah, the girl is possessed and she kills all her classmates or something like that. Then, when everyone is done telling their dreams, the losers get on the bus (DO HELL AHAHAHAH) and see all the people from their dreams on the bus (Ha). End.
