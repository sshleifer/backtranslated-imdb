Who me? No, I'm not kidding. It really says in the case of video. <br /> <br /> plot; short version: A pretty woman stands around smiling. This for some reason makes all people kill. <br /> <br /> "Find Ariel ... Where is Ariel ... I can not find Ariel ..." She is right behind you, you idiot .... <br /> <br /> Most of what you can say about this terrifying little Space Opera has already been said, it looks like. <br /> <br /> A pack of old-fashioned actors playing mainly convicts after the first selection of actors is very fast. Then they are pushed in the same way. Each scene is broadcast almost fifteen minutes earlier. Perhaps it was a drawing of straws to see which actors had the most time on the screen and more payroll control. Obcy wirus / hologram / VR witownica / malfunction seems physically powerless and does nothing. Why can not he just stay in the computer instead of doing the "teleporting vampire" routine? (Actually, it would be more interesting if she was a vampire or did more than just look at people, what she's doing, it's enough for all men to kill. Go to figure ...) <br /> <br /> That's really there is no cosmic movement. There are many more photos of the old western route, the Easy Rider trail from 1950, the night noir scene of the Film noir club, and even jogging on the beach in a fantastic land, none of which has any depth or even meaning. The nightclub scene is of course black and white. He collaborated with "Czarnoksiężnikiem z Oz". It does not work so well here. It's probably a good thing, because the few pictures they make showing the space are depressingly stupid. You'll probably cry at these moments, especially when you see a spinning "space ship" that looks three inches long. <br /> <br /> Nothing is noticeable for any character, not because they are convicted or do not have personality, but because they are in serious need of acting lessons, with the exception of Billy Dee Williams who really looks depressed and with a loss, probably being in this job ... <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that you watch with your friends, will cause very "loud" silence, especially when the gull lunges on the comics one-liners (including a poem about French kissing in a meteor ...? I heard that's true? Maybe not ...) <br /> <br /> The original girls from virtual reality are "killed", which means nothing because they are not even real at first. Well, other "characters" are not, but it does not matter. Haha. <br /> <br /> What's funny is that the scene that grabs the video tape is something that looks like a cosmic skull-horror (green filter added to give it more ... .hh ... green look ), which is actually an android after he was killed, and ultimately has nothing to do with anything else. <br /> <br /> Another strange thing that I noticed. Whenever there is an explosion (at least on my cheap DVD copy), everything becomes very pixelated. I do not mean SMALL pixelated, I mean HUGE blocks about 1/16 the size of the screen. Wow.
