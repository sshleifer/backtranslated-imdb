Although I was hoping for this movie, especially since I like Jason Segel's acting (Freaks & Geeks, Undeclared) so much, I have to say that it was one of the worst movies I saw in the latest memory (Loser and Dr T a Women are also on this listy. <br /> <br /> Yes, there were some laughs of loud moments, although the film could have been much better.The assumption was not artists cheaters who betray their way through the university and meet their match when someone discovers their proposal The problem is that the characters were so unlikely that I did not care about any of them.The blackmailer (played by the talented Jason Schwartzman) was such a psychopath that watching him was not so funny - he was not mad in a particularly funny or charming way he was just a crazy loser who was actually pretty dangerous and not cool to watch. The editing of the film was difficult to trace - keep up it wafted between fantasy and reality, and often it was not clear which one. Only two or three gang frauds have really been shown, you just had to believe they were really cheaters - showing that their plans would be better. The so-called love story was absurd and unbelievable, in fact it was stupid and poorly written and directed all the time. I could talk about the shortcomings of the movie, but you have an idea. Not worth renting for $ 4 or gas needed to rent to and from the film store for rent!
