After watching KHAKEE, I felt that I could watch another good movie, but unfortunately the movie is a joke and really tries to present Aryeman Afterall his father Keshu is the producer. <br /> <br /> RKS talked so much about the film during the promotion, saying that film has meat as opposed to films released at that time, I wonder what films he said. <br /> <br /> The film is a typical Masal movie with lots of comedies, romances, action mixed up <br /> <br /> The ease with which children kidnap families is one of the funniest parts in history. Imagine that children kidnap Dawood's family <br /> <br /> The end is a complete confusion of confusion with a sudden change of character <br /> <br /> RKS gives his weakest film to this day, with the exception of some of Bachchan's scenes, the film is boring <br /> <br /> Muzyka jest nudna <br /> <br /> Amitabh tries to give his role the role of everything he does well, though not too good, although he makes his face too tight when he pulls the trigger and makes a strange look by smoking a cigar H dubbing is not properly matched sometimes. <br /> <br /> Akshay is there for a few minutes and just repeats his act and hams. <br /> <br /> Aryeman seems expressionless, tries too hard, but exaggerates some scenes <br /> <br /> Bhumika emerges best from the party <br /> <br /> The rest is fine
