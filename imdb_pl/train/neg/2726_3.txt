Given his pedigree, it should be a much nicer movie than it really is. Even with an amazing collection of eccentrics in the cast - which fan would not look forward to the movie linking Lemmon, Lanchester, Kovacs and Gingold? - the whole event is blunted, gloomily shot and more often than thoughtless. <br /> <br /> Kim Novak's gifts were not essentially comical because she continued to confirm in Kiss Me Stupid. James Stewart was a great comedian, as shown in the films from The Philadelphia Story by Harvey. I think it comes out of this mess better than anyone else. Maybe except for the cat.
