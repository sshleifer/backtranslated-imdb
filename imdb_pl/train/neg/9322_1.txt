Do not be fooled by the cover of this movie. And if you're looking for a cheap horror movie that you can laugh at: that's not it. I will usually be stupid if it's funny, but this stupid was so stupid that he almost (or probably did) make me stupid. <br /> <br /> The quality of the movie is better than manual, but not too much and it's quite possible that the music was created by pressing the Samba 2 key on the Casio keyboard. These problems should never be a detective from watching a horror movie, but adding this awesome (crying) cast, and you have a real humderer. <br /> <br /> The story is about a guy who invites his friends to his family cabin in Texas for the weekend. He also extends an invitation to his mistress in his office. Along the way, they meet a woman in danger, who is then invited by other girls. <br /> <br /> The stay in the cabin includes sex and nudity, and soon all the panties are in the bundle, when one girl disappears and strange items appear in the house. <br /> <br /> From there you (audience) and morons, um, actors, you try to find out what's going on and soon they do not trust each other. In general, I think I made it sound better than it is. The main struggle with this film is that the characters are very poorly developed, the plot invented, the acting evil and motivations have no idea. Once again it could be forgiven, it was the least fun, but unfortunately it is not. <br /> <br /> A spinning ending is just a phrase that nobody would guess it, because if you really came back, it would not make sense anyway. Do not let this review stop you from seeing this movie. (Woah, my nose only grew eight inches.)
