Oh yes, Sakura Killers is a silly, horrible ninja movie, do not make a mistake. But it is also extremely pleasant. This is mainly due to the amazing presence of one Chuck Connors, who is considered the main character of the film, but really only shines in a few scenes. I suppose he should be Obi Wan Kenobi's type ("Hard ninja-buster", as the copy says), but his "wisdom" is ridiculous. "Move without thinking" ??? My friend says that this is a sign of mental disability, not the highest concentration. <br /> <br /> But in fact his two advisers, Sonny and Dennis, have such a terrible dialogue that "Brooklyn", as we call the colonel, tends to shine in comparison. Pay special attention to Dennis's logic of the "genetic splicing" in which Sakura is involved. If you know anything about cloning, you'll die of laughter. And yes, this is the main storyline. <br /> <br /> A really funny movie, Sakura Killers is a hard-to-find gem. I will not spoil the end of the "tricks", except that it is the perfect setting for Sakura Killers 2. It's a pity that Chuck Connors died. :-( Because it has the most delicate ways to blow a ninja.
