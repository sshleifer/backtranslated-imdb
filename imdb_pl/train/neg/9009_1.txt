What a horrible movie! For some reason, scientific laboratories and outlets always have a cast of dirty, dirty, malicious misanthropes living inside. Those people who probably work together on complex scientific projects can not agree on how to survive death at the hands of the CGI dragon. Spoilers: Extravagant scientist, whose main skill is "leering" and "sinister look," cloned the Dragon. While the lab was supposed to work on such things, other scientists are shocked because they apparently were far behind in their experiments and were caught on trousers. The rest of the story is like a THING or a TENIAN INDIAN, where staff are hunted and killed when they try to formulate a way to escape and / or defeat the "Dragon". The CGI Dragon's essence is dark gray, which seems to be the popular color for most low-cost CGI special effects. Almost does not look better than a cartoon, and dark gray shades make it difficult to see interesting details in the Dragon's body. It looks like a gray drop. Acting is less than terrible. These scientists behave like a group of children who can not agree on anything, and this makes it easier for Dragon to kill them in various attempts to escape, hide, etc. this movie. It seems that it falls to the level of its cast. This movie is really, very horrible. Acting is bad. History is stupid. CGI is very cheap and amateur. There is nothing worthy of praise in this film, it is not even a good time killer to have a look at housework and others.
