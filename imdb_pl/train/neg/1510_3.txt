Reasons to watch this fallen ... err ... tribute to a great movie called Se7en: - It's turned on while surfing the channel and there is nothing else. - Someone is paying you for watching. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and put DVD into Se7en, rent it, download it on iTunes or put in your Netflix memory and skip Flock completely. The Flock is the same story with a few changes. What's more, editing simply sucks Se7en and actually ends up several times. The worst of them is probably a flight over desert helicopter shots, with the sounds of people talking on the radio, except that police helicopters do not fly over them. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: I call it a glaring downfall. If you want to be nice, you can call it a tribute movie, keep going, but look at Se7en anyway.
