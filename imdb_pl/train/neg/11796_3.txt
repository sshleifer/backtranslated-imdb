Is nothing else on TV? Are you really bored? Well, then look at Phat Beach. However, do not rent it and definitely do not buy it. That would be a big mistake. <br /> <br /> I watched it on TV and found out that I was laughing at certain points. I did not laugh for long and did not laugh too much. There were, however, subtle jokes and comments from which I laughed. If you're looking for an extremely fun movie "hood", watch Friday. If you're looking for a strong emotional movie (something that the movie tries in ... kind of), look at something like the dreams of the hoop or Lyric Jason. If you're looking for a good black "booty", watch Dominique Simone's porn video, because the nudity in this movie almost does not exist. If, however, you have nothing better to do, and this is on the cable, go and see. You will be slightly amused. <br /> <br /> *** 3 out of 10 ***
