If half of the material in this movie looks strangely familiar, it means you are watching too much of this bloody Italian cult! As you can see, the famous demigod Lucio Fulci not only produced this film, but also allowed himself to re-use the most sadistic sequences of killing in his own (and easier to follow) "Cat in the brain". The opening scene, in which the prostitute is brutally cut off by an ax, appears in a later movie Fulci, and also makes another handful of murders and moments of ignominy. Andrei Bianchi's "Masssacre" fails miserably because giallo's search for a sadistic killer among the film crew who makes a horror film is fascinating and tense, but it is still a good pastime if you're cheap trash. Inconsistent script introduces a whole host of disgusting characters who are potential geeks, but none of the red herrings from which it derives is not reliable and you can point the murderer almost immediately. Whatever remains to be enjoyed is the truly misogynistic effects of the make-up and the playfully awesome performances of the band. Whenever there is no bloodshed on the screen, like between the first and second murders, the "Massacre" is slow and almost unbearable due to its stupid dialogues and totally uninteresting photography. Fortunately, in the second half there are women who make fun of the fences, and the males are repeatedly stabbed with rusty spikes. Music is nonsense, and the use of filming sites is very unimaginable. I advise you to skip this puppy and go straight to the previously mentioned "Cat in the Brain". This includes ALL the wonderful moments of "Massacre" and then a few.
