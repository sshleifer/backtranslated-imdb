I just watched the movie last night and had to warn anyone who is considering watching this movie. In a word - no. I really feel that this is something that a scenario student would write in the phase of Quentin Tarantino / Eddie Murphy, i.e. Every other word was a curse. I do not have a problem with a profound curse, like in "Good Will Hunting", provided that it will help you better dive into the heroes. In this case, it was just an empty joke with an attempt to draw an occasional * sigh * or laughter from the audience. The three main characters are their own, unique stereotype, jerk from the street on the wall, moron from the cafe and "I'm not-gay-only-in-touch with my-feminine side" a bit less-a-jerk. Just do not worry about any of them! They are all shallow, impossible to overcome losers that you WANT to see. For those who dare, this movie has a few funny moments, at the very beginning and at the very end. Scena z toalÄ… / dibratora is funny in the sick style "Uh, yeah". I really recommend this movie only to my worst enemies.
