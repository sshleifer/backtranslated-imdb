This film reminds me of the film A Mary-Kate and Ashley - only worse. I think only the rich sisters, although Alysons more actress, in this movie Amanda Michalka was okay at times, but Alysons behaved smelly. I think that after the school musical they had to come up with something better, and that certainly was not. The plot was not so great and I think they should have got two other people to play in Taylor and Courtney. I'm not a big fan of Alyson Michalka and this movie did not like me. I think they should definitely get into singing and watch this movie if you have nothing better to do (which unfortunately I did not do)
