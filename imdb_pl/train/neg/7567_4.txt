History: Young-goon is a girl whose family has a history of mental illness. She ended up in a psychiatric hospital after she started believing that she was actually a cyborg. In the institution he meets Park Il-sun, a young man who makes a connection with her. <br /> <br /> If you're reading this, you probably already know how talented Chan-wook Park is. But "I'm A Cyborg ..." is a big departure from friends and (unfortunately) stronger territories. I am a big fan of every movie or story that tries to do something different. God knows that we all have enough nonsense in our local cinemas. The main point of the movie, which I must say, is that it does not say anything about mental illness or create the characters you care about. <br /> <br /> This story must have been one of the strangest things I've seen for years ... but strange is not enough. The film has no heart ... only surrealism and confusion. Confusion seems to be the main theme of the film. The characters try to understand their own problems, but the Chan-wook Park itself turns out to be the most confused.
