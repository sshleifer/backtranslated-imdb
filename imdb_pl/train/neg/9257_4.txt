If you're looking for something new, you've chosen the wrong movie. Who can think that a movie that is a virtual replay of its predecessors may be good. Maybe a producer and maybe a director, but let's hope they were not serious when they created THE THING. The whole movie is like making a DVD with the biggest hits from the first 3 movies, but changing the actors. BHHAAAAD.
