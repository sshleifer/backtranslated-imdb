The case is the best part of the movie, but it is not worth the purchase price itself. I was expecting the movie "Based on True Story" only to find a shot in a home movie about poorly filmed clips connected to pathetic scenes of actors and non-slaughter. The video scenes had numerous scrolling situations that were probably used to extend the function rather than to the effects. I started this review before I was even halfway through the movie and waited for it to end, in case it had a better ending, but low and that was even worse. If I could mark it lower, it would be minus ten. Learn from my error and save money and time thanks to this.
