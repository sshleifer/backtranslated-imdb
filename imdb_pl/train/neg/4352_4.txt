If you've seen friends, the letter will be very familiar. Especially the last 3 or 4 seasons of Friends often share the same comedy settings. <br /> <br /> The performance concerns a group of people whose relationship consists in sharing the same class when they were still young (about 10 years I think). Now they are about twenty years old and meet again at the class meeting. The series begins here. <br /> <br /> A typical episode applies to many stories at once. They are usually not connected in any way. Each plot line is divided into multiple sections, which are then displayed in a mixed order. <br /> <br /> Sketches is a place where my problems concern this series. As in the later seasons of the Friends, it is often a rather silly setting with difficult to believe situations. One of the main characters does something really stupid, which is hard to believe. The situation is then exaggerated, as if it was not stupid enough. If you like such humor, you may like this series. For me it is a great off. <br /> <br /> The reason why I started watching Friends is the first few seasons. There are interesting and particularly credible feature lines in which there is an affair that makes the characters' roots. The class has nothing of this. Characters are simply too forced, and stereotypes are too far. Therefore, you can not refer to them and like them. <br /> <br /> At least with friends, it took several seasons before they ran out of steam and all the features of the characters were wiped out. But in class it seems that he ran out of steam before it even started.
