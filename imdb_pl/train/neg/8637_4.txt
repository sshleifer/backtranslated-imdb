A more mysterious film with unjustified elements of horror; average in general. <br /> <br /> It starts with a woman who has a nightmare in which her sex partner gets up from the bed, walks into the room of a crying child and kills him. She stood up. Then this man dies in the hospital, spitting with blood. His distant daughter arrives and manages to contact her through her dreams (I think), and he wants her to know who killed him before his body is completely disintegrated in the grave. <br /> <br /> There is not much secret about who did it, or even how; most viewers will understand this long before disclosure. I'm not sure if the way he was killed would really work. <br /> <br /> In any case, the elements of horror are going through: a bloody autopsy, the returning dream of a man killing a boy, a nightmare in which a plate of eggs turns into eyes that are then cut, and several shots of a decaying man in both nightmares as in his grave. <br /> <br /> I was a little surprised to see the dedication finally written by Fulci to Clive Barker! Interesting.
