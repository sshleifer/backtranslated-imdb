Walerian Borowczyks La Bete (1975) was of course accepted in various ways: some were terrified, others were shocked, others applauded their courage. But I am completely untouched, bored and can not stop asking myself why displaying inconsistent, incoherent images that revolve around the main theme are considered an intellectual journey. <br /> <br /> What exactly was this movie about? Increasing sexuality in a woman? I've seen great movies about it, but it's not one of them. How can one try to show growing sexuality in a girl, not trying to at least characterize her as a person not only as a narrative device for dreaming (naked) about beasts. Where there is no form, there is no character investigation. A woman persecuted by the beast was not a teenager, a girl having sex with a black butler (is he also referred to as a beast?) Has a very adult attitude to sexuality, so where is the consequence? Is this a movie about religion? If so, we would need a little more thematic material than a priest without function, character and charisma, but with a strong desire for two young boys. <br /> <br /> Is it about bestiality? The metaphorical feeling of the film prohibits a realistic investigation of bestiality, especially since a realistic exam requires realistic characters. So there is no real bestiality here. Some mythical beast and two priests talking about the sin of bestiality. Enough for an essay on this subject? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> Is it about sex? Is it about anything? I do not know. I only know that showing the fired weapon is not a war film. Dealing with the topic must mean more than showing your own associations with the topic. <br /> <br /> So look at the controversy. Do not be afraid of bestiality, nudity, ejaculation, masturbation and other things. I'm not. Look at how you look at another story and you can discover that it is poorly done, badly edited, badly made, badly written (okay, some pictures are pretty nice, and the main character is a really pretty girl) brain masturbation of a director who He thinks that beating the bush in a hypnotic, slow way will make history smart. It is not so. It makes it boring.
