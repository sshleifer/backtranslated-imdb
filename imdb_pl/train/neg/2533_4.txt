I agree with the majority, if not with all previous comments from Tom (bighouseaz@yahoo.com). The Zatoichi series is a wonderful study of characters combined with a great fight with sword and excitement. <br /> <br /> I saw Zatoichi 1-13,15,16; I believe that 14 were not released in Zone 1 (USA). Zatoichi the Outlaw was disappointing. The plot was complicated and seemed like a mix of many earlier Zatoichi themes. At one point I was wondering if I had seen the remake of the previous Zatoichi movie. <br /> <br /> This film was disappointing because it began to depend on the effects (turning over the head, cut off limbs, blood) and less about the nobility of Zatoichi. All previous films have been successful on the basis of the plot and the action, and they have won wonderful observations without having to resort to effects. <br /> <br /> I only hope that the other Zatoichi films do NOT follow the same trend. This is Zatoichi's first film from his studio. I highly recommend all previous Zatoichi films - and I recommend them.
