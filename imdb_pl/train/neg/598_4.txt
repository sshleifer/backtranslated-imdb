Be warned: this movie, though a pretty bad plot, was one of the most gruesome movies I've seen ... EVER. Just remember that before you sit on the couch to enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> It officially starts with the event. Just your average party, but there's a guy there. It's nice at Kate ... if you know what I'm saying. Remember his face; it will help later. <br /> <br /> So in any case, Kate went to find George Clooney (did not I say that the plot was bad?), so she takes the lamp. It's a London subway in the middle of the night, but she's so stupid. So the timetable says the next, and finally the train will come in 7 minutes. Now, Kate, the stupid party girl she is, decides that she can take a nap in the free 7 minutes. Usually he misses the train and is closed in the London subway. Alone. Well, almost ... <br /> <br /> So the movie just lasts. Blood, guts, limbs, even some parts of the body that I will not mention, are cut and panted, and finally amputated from the body. <br /> <br /> In short, it's a typical horror movie; a pretty but fat lady in women who are suffering and sick, a strange psycho. Or, as in the case, Creep. <br /> <br /> I would say that if you are in Saw, Hostel or Texas Massacre Chainsaw, but for the rest of us, Scream with meet the horror thank you very much.
