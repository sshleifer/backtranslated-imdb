The "subculture" of BDSM in Los Angeles serves as the background for this low budget and miserably constructed mess, which is simply vanity for her highest-earning player, Celia Xavier, who also produces and creates scripts, doubling as twin sisters Vanessa and Celia. Soon, the question will arise as to whether some rather immoderate pyrotechnics, lighting and assembly can ever reach a point of connection with a weak and often inconsistent narrative that will not be taken seriously by a sensual viewer. Celia is employed as a highly motivated court curator in Los Angeles, while her sinister twin became an iconic figure in her fetishising world mainly due to erotic performances on CD-ROMs, but when the disaster falls "Master Vanessa," virtuous Celia, determined to dig a malicious attacker of his sister, he starts a new job as a "sex slave" in a private castle club, where the specialty of the house is the "dungeon party". Two FBI field agents (whose deployment in the Vanessa case is allegedly required due to her involvement in BDSM websites), in addition to the homicide detective in Los Angeles, investigate the crime while trying to ensure the security of Celia, whose enthusiastic performances in her new calling is carefully considered by clients as creating conditions for her personal danger. The disadvantages of logic and continuity are abundant, such as the assassination assigned to the South-South Operations Bureau L.A.P.D., a metropolitan region that is far from the script of the film. The direction is out of focus and is not supported by incorrect post-production editing and sound reproduction. The aforementioned gymnastics ends with batty editing near the film, which precedes the recording, but is tangentially related to the script. There is one solid turn out of the slag: Stan Abe as a zealous FBI agent.
