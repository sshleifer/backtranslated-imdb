* Can anyone tell me WHERE is COMED ?? !! <br /> <br /> * (Charlie Sheen) is a very weak comedian, (Thomas Haden Church) looks so weak (along with him!), and the whole thing is so fat! <br /> <br /> * They tried to create a live comic, which turned out to be a super bloody comic nightmare and was not even funny? Like a bathroom plan scene; it was so good with your cinematic imagination, but there is nothing more besides PAIN! <br /> <br /> * Donald Sutherland ?? His relationship with his daughter ??! <br /> <br /> * This is actually the type of work they have done to do this and make some money on it, but it has become such a crime when THIS money would be robbed by ourselves, who were deceived by so low artistic work and entertainment, he had absolutely no entertainment EVERYTHING! <br /> <br /> * Well, it would be uglier if it was a big production and Brando in his golden years with a real star. <br /> <br /> * Sheen's family here. Just be aware of that! <br /> <br /> * Anyone who loved this movie or -Boda, do not love it! Then you have to go directly to therapy before you become more dangerous and hurt anyone else! <br /> <br /> * (Brando) is undoubtedly a genius, but the movie is not! And he was not going to be here after reading this for sure !! But the main problem is that no one else has worked in this thing, trying or wanting to be a little intelligent and even good !!! (I'm sorry I'm crying now! Torturing the movie is unbelievable!). <br /> <br /> * There is a scene where (Brando) hits (Mira Sorvino) her shoes! It was so realistic! Maybe he saw himself in it, so he punished himself for being in such shit! <br /> <br /> * For a billionth time: this could have been better (or less so!). The script, until the train jump, was nice and I imagined that they would run away to hunt someone else (Smokey and the Bandit), but with (Brando) as the sheriff. In fact, each of these chimeras was much merciful than what I was watching! <br /> <br /> * Why did not this masterpiece receive any Razzie award ?! Do you want to make me believe that there was a lower movie than THIS? I do not think so ! This is a situation in which Razzi's manager must win for his negligence! <br /> <br /> * Martin Sheen is also here as a guest star, maybe for the support of his son who has fallen, but ironically the father was just as a failure as his son! why is that ?! Well ! Because I hate Martin Sheen, maybe more than I hate comics, they were not as good as his ambitions! <br /> <br /> * This is not a comedy movie, it's NOT ... It's a horror movie! And I just hate horror movies, especially those that were propagated as comical! <br /> <br /> * Call it right? Hmmm! Well, this monster Marlon Brando (Island Dr. Moreau - 1996) would be close to Casablanca !! <br /> <br /> PS: If you still want to know who they are or are exactly the bad ones, ugly and very ugly in this movie .. Just pray for the last prayers and watch it .. God help me!
