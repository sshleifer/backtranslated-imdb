You do not have to wait long to explain why Code Name: Diamond Head did not reach the network schedules. The TV remote's film does not go through loans before it becomes obvious how bad it will be. Maybe I missed something, because the conspiracy did not make much sense. Based on what I got out of the confused mess, a terrorist or thief or something called "Tree" (Ian McShane) goes to Hawaii to steal something from a secret weapon. The stupidest secret agent in the world, Johnny Paul (Roy Thinnes), is to stop him. It could have been more, but trust me? it does not really matter. <br /> <br /> Action movies should have action. Hard moments should have tension. Dramatic moments should have a drama. This is not in the Code: Diamond Head. I saw how others used the word "turgid" to describe what was being done for the television? and is better than any description of the word that I can come up with. None of the characters is the least exciting or worth the attention. And Roy Thinnes copes with the worst possible leads. His charisma is somewhat north of the snail. Ian McShane is undoubtedly the best thing the film can fit, but unfortunately for everyone else involved, it does not seem that he will come back as an ordinary cast member. If McShane was cast in the show, maybe you had something. <br /> <br /> I quickly discover that these awful TV movies from the 70s Gawd make big episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000. And it's double if Quinn Martin was involved. Very funny things from Mike and the Bots. So although I can give the film only 3/10, I rate episode # 608 on 4/5 on the MST3K scale.
