This movie was so bad that I could not sit without him. There was no story or point. I was very bored and could not remember one joke or a funny line worthy of description. Politicians without technical jargon about charisma could not be less entertaining. <br /> <br /> So how did this happen? Is there no quality control in the film? Watching girls in a bikini was the only distraction during this terrible experience. <br /> <br /> It is hard to imagine that Adam Sandler, who became popular and appeared in great comedies, was able to survive after such exposure. In this movie he was not funny, so he proves that writing is so important in an effective comedy.
