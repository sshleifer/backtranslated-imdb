It seems that there is an overwhelming response in this film, but no one has any insight into the criticism of his methodology, which is extremely flawed. It simply continues to propagate journalistic style analysis, which is based on the fact that it reveals the lack of knowledge and prejudices to the viewers to trigger an emotional decision and an outbreak of a negative diatribe. <br /> <br /> Journalism 101: tell the viewer some fact only to predispose them to draw conclusions that are predictable. for example, the idea of ​​civil war, chaos, plunder, etc. was allegedly an unexpected reaction to the collapse of government infrastructure after Hussein's collapse: were not all of them symptomatic of a hopeless culture? doctrinal conflicts as symptoms of the very veins of Islam, not the failure of police forces to stop and secure? or would the US just declare Marshall's law? I'm sure the newspapers here would explode with accusations of a police state and fascist forces. <br /> <br /> apart from the analytical idiocy of the film, it takes several shunts and leaves the rest claiming that "the interrogation was refused ... yet the questions they would ask are undoubtedly the answer to the hundreds of inquisitions that these people have already received. As a vice president, would you like to give an interview to the first writer / producer who has certainly already been strengthened to turn your words. they could not record Condi tapes to actually show their opinion and answer some of the logistics questions, maybe they never watched her. <br /> <br /> it is far from a neutral look at the situation on earth there. this is another tendentious, asynchronous approach of journalists - basically this mindless herd. <br /> <br /> anyone who wants to comment on the war should at least base their ideas on things a little more credible than the NBC report and CNN comment. these interpretations strike the same vitriol, which simply creates the further two-party character of those who want to think, and those who want the media to say what to think.
