In short, a group of half-naked men hitting and hitting each other. this is it! We see it for about 5 minutes. It's filmed in black and white, and tons of half-naked men are running around, hitting the melody of frightening music. It looks interesting, but there is no plot and really - the violence inherent to this was worrying. Homo eroticism also plays out, but mixing it with violence was not a good idea. Some people who like avant-garde material may like it, but I found it inconceivable, boring, stupid and (occasionally) disturbing. Really - what's all this about? I saw it as part of a gay shorts festival, and the audience sat there in dazed silence. I really want to be able to go below 1.
