Skip Mission: Galactica and watch original episodes of Living Legend instead. The network took parts 1 and 2 Living Legend and created one story with a horrible episode of Fire In Space. Although Galactica suffered from network-controlled writing and lack of time to prepare for proper production, Living Legend is the best of the 1978 television series. Fire in space is one of the worst episodes. As a historical note, take a look at Galactica, the original Star Trek, and then a series of Trek revivals, and you'll see the difference in quality between the science-fiction network and the science-fiction consortium.
