As a big fan or series of Cracker, I am waiting 7 years for the next addition. This episode I'm afraid just does not fit the legend. <br /> <br /> Fitz returns to Manchester after 7 years for his daughter's wedding and is involved in the investigation of the murder. his tour in Northern Ireland, he continues to kill. <br /> <br /> What I did not like about this episode is an extremely convenient way in which everything is arranged and how fitz leads to the murderer. It is very thick for the strained. <br /> <br /> However, there are good scenes in flash movies from Northern Ireland, which are filmed.
