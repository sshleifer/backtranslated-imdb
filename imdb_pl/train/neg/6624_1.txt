This movie was absolutely ... hmm, I can not find the word oh, wait ... crap! I mean, when it started, it was like this, it looks good, and then it was so boring. I almost fell asleep and it had nothing to do with the fact that I caught up late, because it was a complete dirt. Ram Gopal Varma tried everything in his power, but the cast would never match the cast of the original Sholay, which he meant by doing a remake. What did he want to do? Be like Sanjay Leeli Bhansani and win all the prizes next year, just like in the case of Black? Ajay and the other guy were good, especially the other guy who played in paradise, because of all of them he was the one he was looking at. What was Amitabh doing? He destroys his own dignity, making all these stupid movies. First Nishabd, then Cheeni Kum, then Jhoom Barabar Jhoom, and now I mean, he has to collect some money and leave as far away from Bollywood before losing all his respect and telling you that his half has already passed. It's all really good for other actors like Shah Rukh Khan who now has a really good name because of Amitabh's recent fall. I never liked him because he thinks he is God, and I just knew that Abhishek would be in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to save Â£ 17.75 and spend on something good, watch Heyy Babyy, because it's the funniest movie in history and number one on the charts!
