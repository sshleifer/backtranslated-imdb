I saw this movie literally immediately after finishing the book, or maybe it was a neutral idea or very stupid. I think it's the other one. First of all, it was inaccurate in many small but important details. One of the first things I noticed was that in Winston's everyday life in his work, his conversations, eating in the cafeteria, etc. He feels at ease, looking unhappy and looking evocatively at people without a lot of fear. One of the most important parts of the book was that even in small classes it was virtually impossible to safely show at least a bit of your real emotions on your face AT ANY TIME. This is also seen in the scenes on the streets of the proletariat. In the book, Winston knew that this is a huge risk of wandering around and he is skeptical and terrified at every trip. Being in a movie, he does it so often and without fear that you are losing the important feeling of heavy surveillance and risking it right after the bat. <br /> <br /> Other minor inaccuracies included Winston hiding his diary in the wall, such a small change, but the question arises what's going on? It was also the most annoying thing a director can do with a book, namely changing a character. <br /> <br /> The large inaccuracies were, however, much more disturbing. First of all, one of the important elements of this book is that the Big Brother is a government based on intelligent but strict philosophy. In the film, they skip this and go straight away to think that the government is guided by Hitler with technology. Which is true, in a sense, when it's directed with its facism, but if that's all you get out of Big Brother, you've really missed the meaning of this book. The frightening thing about Big Brother is that in a way, it's philosophy behind it. When O'Brien goes to the Winstons mind in the Ministry of Love, he's listening to everything Winston says against Big Brother. The fact that he listens and develops in his philosophy is in fact the most frightening and intriguing. Finally (a careful SPOILER ahead of us), when Winston says he loves Big Brother, it's scary that you're not sure if it was the kind of beating and torture that caused it, or the real power behind philosophy. I do not say in any way that Big Brother's philosophy has something I like about it, but its intelligence and depth make this book extremely disturbing. <br /> <br /> Also, how could anyone feel any connection between Julia and Winston in the movie? It was awful, no relationship. <br /> <br /> And where was O'Brien before he gave Winston his address? One of the things that brought the book with them was Winston's thoughts on O'Brien, BEFORE he contacted him. In the movie, they just jump to the gun. <br /> <br /> But all this sums up why this movie was a terrible adaptation: because you can not DO NOT jump over the gun and change the character in less than two hours. How could anyone think that this video was watched if it had less than two hours? The video requires at least 3 hours to be able to capture some important moods and connections. Anything less is simply pointless. <br /> <br /> If you liked the book, and I mean TRULY, you loved that you would not approve this movie and chances are you already knew you would not do it. Because the book is impossible to make, and this movie proves how impossible it is to cram something decent into a small roll of film. <br /> <br /> Two stars out of ten
