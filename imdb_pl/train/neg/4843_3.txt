I've also heard read reviews and comments about how this movie may earn an Oscar for Best Picture, so I went to see it today. What a great disappointment! 1) If you read other reviews, you will learn from the members of the US Army who served in Iraq how unlikely the events of this movie are. They reflected my own thoughts; while I was playing a movie - a complete civilian - I was thinking "say WHAT? there is no way it can happen. "2) There is very little in the story when it comes to reality. A new guy appears to kill the bomb to replace the one who died (death that is not clearly explained). A new guy gets adrenaline from his job. His attitude threatens others. THIS IS IT! 3) This film is nowhere as strained as it was claimed. If you want some tension, try one of Bourne's films. If you want to see a war movie that is emotionally strong, try to rent Go Tell The Spartans, which talks about the Vietnam War, and Burt Lancaster stars (who told me PERSONIST in an unexpected supermarket meeting that it was a movie that he was extremely proud of and one who considered one of his best works, and who was still nervous, was largely ignored in the wake of the terrified Apocalypse Now), or the old black and white classic Sink The Bismark from World War II, which especially for the English movie is incredibly painful. DO NOT WAIT YOUR TIME ON AN PROHIBITED CABINET.
