Horror / Sci-Fi is interesting because it's funny. F / X quite well ... for what you see. Filmed for TV thrillers, which is not as bad as the worst of them. Jeffrey Coombs plays a brilliant but vicious scientist who manipulates stem cell research and manipulates human DNA using a hammer shark. Frightening results give birth to the hell of a killing machine. A group of scientists led by William Forsythe and Hunter Tylo is invited to the remote island to test a brilliant new experiment. Of course, after laughter and stuttering in awe ... Creation of Coombs, by the way, his own son connected with a hammer, is released to hunt for one of his father's friends. Revenge is not always satisfying. Also in the cast: Elsie Muller, G.R. Johnson, Arthur Roberts and Velizar Binev.
