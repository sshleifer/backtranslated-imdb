Burt Reynolds came to a point in his career, where he seemed to just go through movements. He appeared, played with his friends on the film and took a large payout home. It did not seem to matter to him that the product he represented was pure shit. <br /> <br /> No film personified it more than "Stroker Ace", which makes "Cannonball Run" look like classic and "Cannonball Run II" look like a watch. With the exception of a few racing scenes, there is nothing worth seeing. Even the beautiful Loni Anderson does it as bad as a stupid blonde, which is embarrassing. <br /> <br /> If you think about Burt with Jim Nabor and dressing up like a chicken sounds funny, this is your movie. Otherwise, choose almost any other movie comedy and it will not be worse.
