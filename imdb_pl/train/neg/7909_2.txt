Unbelievable! <br /> <br /> this movie is 7 out of 0 0. It must be one of the worst movies I've seen in years. not only was the game incredibly bad, but the plot (if you can call it that) was just as bad. Everyone knows what will happen in the first 5 minutes. Which is not a bad thing if you can captivate the audience while leading up to that point. However, it is not. There is no action, no tension, no spark even between two leading actors. It is unfortunately a waste of my time, and certainly a waste of my money. <br /> <br /> and 2 only for the attempt
