Do not watch this movie if you value your mind. At the end of our joint watching, my friends and I estimated that each of us lost 5% of our brains during the course. The only person involved in its creation, which was not clinically crazy, was the scenery designer. <br /> <br /> Most movies leave a bad taste in their mouths. Now I realize that instead of a sense of disgust, this movie has caused a deep hatred in me. I really hate this movie. <br /> <br /> Some people may say that this movie should not be taken seriously. If only he did not take himself seriously. But it is so. The plot is a heated version of the Blade Runner universe combined with cheap rubber suits, so common in bad dinosaur movies. Dialogue is not only childish and meaningless, but often literally painful. Whoopee Goldberg does not even try, but George Newbern as Theodore Rex's voice is like nails on the soul. And whether it is Juliet Landua, who again has a British accent, or Richard Roundtree (aka Shaft) as an angry commissioner, will fall into a growing sense of disbelief and disappointment. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie only to anyone who wants to see the depth of stupidity that humanity can fall into.
