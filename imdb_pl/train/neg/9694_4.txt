Otto Preminger directs this light as a story from feathers. Bohemian Jean Seberg and her equally artistic widower, father David Niven, vacation in the south of France, with the madman Mylène Demongeot. Everything is fine until a friend of the Deborah Kerr family appears. Nivens, a degenerate womanizer, thinks Kerr's conquest is too difficult to resist. It's good for Seberg until Niven loves her and leaves her (as he did with all women in the past ... including Demongeot). When it seems that he becomes the second banana in Niven's life, Seberg takes revenge on Kera. Preminger tells the story in retrospection from Seberg's perspective and cleverly combines black and white with more colorful scenes. Georges Périnal's photos are stunning. The film contains a part of the weakest direction of Preminger, although it rarely allows close-ups, which makes it difficult to see what actors really feel. Arthur Laurents wrote the script and is full of acidic dialogues and funny scenes (mainly involving Demongeot with the brain). Seberg admits quite well, but Niven is the least attractive ... and does not show any chemistry with either Seberg or Kerr. Preminger really does badly with this casting. It's a role that seems to be tailor-made for someone closer to Charles Boyer. With Geoffrey Horne as a would-be competitor of Seberg and Martita Hunt as his mother. Juliette Gréco, playing herself, sings the title song at the Paris nightclub. Great titles are regular Preminger Saul Bass.
