* WARNING * Possible spoilery below <br /> <br /> The movie is more boring than anything else. It seems that there are attempts to build up tension through poorly lit shots of empty rooms and empty lawns, but nothing works. <br /> <br /> MST3K did a pretty good job, but the movie itself is usually boring. <br /> <br /> Fun moments: <br /> <br /> When a false skull pops up from the pile of ashes, the wife becomes hysterical and woozy when the husband (who tries to lead the wife crazy) says in a deadly voice, "There's no skulls, no skulls. "<br /> <br /> When real ghost skulls have a husband caught in a flood, as if trapped between the first and the second base.
