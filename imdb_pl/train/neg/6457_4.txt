I think I've seen worse movies, but that can be because I'm tired of the standards of these evil horrors. The thing about the deadly monster is really very bad, basically it's a guy in some green body color. It's a lot worse when it comes to film B, but do not think it was awesome for a moment, hell, no. In fact, he had a conspiracy with content, but he was still quite stupid. Basically, it's just a bad low-budget horror. But at least it's not as bad as titanic that the movie sucks, it just sucks. In this movie the blood looks really false. This is one complaint I have about the whole horror of a new millennium, low quality gore, it looks stupid. A good macabre death scene with really fake blood is so stupid. At least there was a nice scene in the shower
