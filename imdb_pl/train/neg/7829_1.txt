The beginning of the 1990s brought many "bizarre" and "off-beat" independent films, with a semi-spiritual desert crime film as a special subgenre. Others are "Wild at Heart", "From Dusk Til Dawn" and to some extent "Natural Born Killers". Good films such as these have brought trash, such as Highway 666, Destiny Turns on the Radio, and the inappropriately surreal anti-masterpiece Under The Hula Moon. This is a comedy that strives for a certain emotional tone, achieves it, but it still teases. While the pursuit of the spiritual world of the desert and Chris Penn's cast are good ideas, the film is not dirty enough or hard enough to be a good crime movie, and is not focused enough on laughter to really be a comedy. I will not blow the end, but let's say it's bad. The film is basically a bad side effect of the tumor of the genre. These are the remnants of indie-mania.
