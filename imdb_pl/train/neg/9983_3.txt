This movie is a huge Yawn, which proves that Americans have no idea about farce. Even when it was written for them! The original film "Hodet Over Vannet" is a witty comedy of errors, which I would rate on 8/10. It's not just about linguistic translation, but some absurd chains of events are completely skipped, stealing a film from his original wise farce nature and turning it into a shoddy farce "oops there and my pants".
