It was a great idea and the scenery was beautiful, but it ends there. It seemed that the neuter Set It Off meets the West. The story hardly made sense. There were so many characters and there was not enough time to develop your personality. There were too many unnecessary things that did not relate to the plot, and did not help in further history. There were also long, empty moments in which the story could be examined, but it was used for silence or unnecessary conversations. The script should have more sense and directing. I had a huge question mark on my head watching this movie. But in my opinion the casting was great. If you only watch sweets, this is a movie for you.
