It's just horrible, really terrible garbage. Yes, we have beautiful naked women dancing and having sex. But although it may work in the mechanism of a porn movie? maybe even a hit as a porn movie? it tries to mask itself as a "movie" with real things to say, with real emotions and struggle. This is not. It's an excuse to get naked girls and have fun. I'm sure that all these women (and men) in this particular movie could do well in the porn industry from the '70s. . . but not in real film business. <br /> <br /> Acting was cruel, so bad, I mean really terrible. Writing was even worse. Can not I blame all of those actors? they had nothing to work with. A very wide structure or plot of the film could be made and made well with good writers and competent actors. A very broad structure or conspiracy concerns a psychotic man who spends time shooting people from a distance as a sniper. These shootings were motivated by men who did not respect their women. If there was more writing - better writing, much better writing - and less free sexual photos, we could have something to work with. <br /> <br /> This movie should be filmed, filmed and sold all the time hardcore porn; would earn more money. It is practically a hardcore porn movie and remains the only non-porn video I've seen that shows a male penis.
