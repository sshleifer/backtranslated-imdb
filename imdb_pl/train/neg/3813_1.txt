What a crime ... <br /> <br /> You forgot to brush your teeth ... let's do a 30 minute show about it and ask some kids to make a noise, then let them teach them all, because that's what they have to do . <br /> <br /> But do not forget that Uncle Joey must make strange noises and cook faces, then Uncle Jesse must show up with his black leather jacket and jeans and look nice for a few minutes while everyone is discussing this how a mother would do anything if she was around ... <br /> <br /> Yes, full of bizarre little adventures with a lot of nothing and a whole long history that could be built around her. <br /> <br /> Full House will not only bore you with tears, but will make you get older twenty times faster than normal.
