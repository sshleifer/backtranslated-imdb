(Maybe very light spoilers.) <br /> <br /> Usually a fan of Diane Keaton, I tried to watch it tonight. I had to turn him off before the second hour because I found myself completely without sympathy for my daughter or mother. Both of them turned out to be absorbed in each other with little respect for others, and the daughter added rudely, dismissively and recklessly. When my daughter died, the only thing I thought was: "At least we will not have to watch her anymore." Keaton did a good job putting himself in a state of bewilderment and despair, but then it was too far away. I just did not like it, so I stopped watching. If you want me to take care of the hero, you have to make me start taking care of heroes much earlier - if it's an hour and I do not care, it's too late. <br /> <br /> Supporting cast was honest and well played - I felt * to them! * - and the best gay friend was great, but even in combination, it was not enough to move the movie for me.
