This movie is another average action movie, but it could have been much better. When the guns come out, they really need help with choreography. Someone like Andy McNabb - who made this genius action sequence in Heat when he goes off the street with robberies - would change boring sequences of actions into something special. Because the rest of the movie was fine - predictable but possible to watch - better than you would expect from this type of movie. Then came the last show-down scene we were waiting for, but it was like watching something from the band A in the 80's. They shoot wildly, they hit nothing and run around the house, trying to kill - the same old one.
