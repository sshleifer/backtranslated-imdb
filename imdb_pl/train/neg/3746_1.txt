However hard it is for me to believe, with these horrible representations of reality that have occurred over the past few years, this must take the first place as the worst. I'm still wondering if this was just a trick done by the SCTV gang. If Andy Kaufmann was still alive, I would be sure he was behind it. Can a rock band lean lower than INXS to do such a disgraceful thing? The assumption is simple and moronic. Interrogate the karaoke group rejecting the role of the new vocalist INXS to replace Michael Hutchence (who committed suicide in 1997). Eight years and no hits later, the band commits a final act of sadness, surrendering to a group of talented people who are to be the new vocalist of the band, which is 20 years old. So they're trying all these nasty singers (I thought American Idol has a share in doozies), who make awful interpretations of almost every classic (and predictable) rock song you can imagine. And then they associate with INXS team members who seriously discuss the merits of each of these candidates. You can see better (and more original) rock performers in almost every nightclub in any city in the world. <br /> <br /> It has all the typical, non-creative elements of every other reality show. Lame participants of reality, lame interviews, poor host / emcee, lame "rating" performances and lame start of one participant at the end of each program. Are these shows more predictable? This is clearly a team's promotional achievement; the last breath of hope to revive the lost fame before finally being buried in oblivion. Michael Hutchence, if he lived in shreds of dignity, he must fall over in the grave. INXS has never been a great band, but I had no idea they were so pathetic. If INXS in general represents what rock and roll has become, this concert would be the ultimate proof that rock and roll is dead forever.
