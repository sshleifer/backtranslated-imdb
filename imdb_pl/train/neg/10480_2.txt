It has a great name, but you do not get more than your money, in fact the first 30-40 minutes of the movie can be fun, but then the story goes from one side to the other with no special reason and you just can not understand what's going on happens until the action ends. <br /> <br /> And yet the producers (Roberto Angel Salcedo) call him an actor, but I do not think that the way he does it was called anything but overrated !! A small child who plays as his son has absolutely no sense of the game and I believe that it is only a favor he did or something because he had no idea what he was doing. <br /> <br /> For some reason during the casting they thought they were throwing comedians who could do it, but they did not do it !! and sometimes the taste of cheap humor is so bad, I do not buy it. <br /> <br /> But I hope it's as bad as it gets. In order for people to accept these DVDs for good taste, they will have to offer them something to eat, which may work. <br /> <br /> Maka
