While acting and directing could be considered a merit - the plot is a very bad movie from Vietnam with the name of the country just changed. <br /> <br /> At least for the film to remain credible, try and have the appearance of accuracy in the equipment, weapons and tactics. It is not important to make a gross misrepresentation of the army's behavior as a norm. <br /> <br /> In addition to limited use as a silly propaganda about the South African Defense Forces, it serves a small purpose - definitely no entertainment value. > <br /> Aspiring filmmakers - that's not to do a war movie. Do a few tests and feel the pride of your product.
