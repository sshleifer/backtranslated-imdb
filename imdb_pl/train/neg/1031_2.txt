This movie is one long chiche after another. First of all, although they had their share, there is an unjustified drug scene in which John sniffs the weeds like an idiot. Wigs and accents are terrible. They sound worse than the old Beatles cartoons. John is a nasty, jealous, homosexual man in the closet, a slave to Yoko, whom he portrays as the discredited book of Albert Goldman. In regular conversations, they still release the titles of the songs "there were always only two of us"! John would not be so bad for his fans either. As his death showed us, he was too kind, if at all. The only funny scene is that the stupid Beatles fan only recognizes John and asks him to sing Paul's Yesterday. The offended John says something like, "Sure, and when I'm humming, why do not you go down on your knees, put on your wife's wig and lick my bond." It made me laugh for many days. Really this movie is funny in how seriously it tries to leave ridiculously. John and Paul also did not sit all day, because they were funny, happy guys who even disintegrate at The Beatles where they were introduced more personally. Forget about it.
