Zodiac Killer. 1 in 10. The worst acting in history. There's really no worst acting. David Hess (Last house on the left? No. The one from the seventies, Rent it really well) is the worst of the group (quite stiff competition, but it is incredibly ugly). find a participant in a home movie with such an uncomfortable presence of the camera. The film is actually screeching up to a stunning, painful stop when it's on the screen. <br /> <br /> Not that the film really had any salutary qualities for Mr. Hess to break down. Filmed with a home-made film camera, the look resembles a quite old set with a microphone attached. There is also no post-production.

It would embarrass Troma. The story tells about the Zodiac Killer (Last seen in Dirty Harry ?? UH Huh. What can you expect from a movie that does not know that DSM IV is a book that is not a psychiatric disorder and where the relationship of an older killer resembles that of congress and closed congressman? This hairstyle and production values ​​from the eighties meet Nambla subplots. Write me down.
