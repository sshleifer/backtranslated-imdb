Wow ... what can I say ... First of all, IMDb says it's the end of the 1960s ... which means that Carlito would be very close to going to prison, he went out on 75 and said he was in it for 5 years. They used a group of actors and a story that did not make sense. They only bring back one actor, Guzman, and he plays a completely different guy. Why did it end with him and this puerto rico? Wheres Gale? He said he'd been in love with her before. Wheres Kleinfeld? He said he knew him forever ... You'd think he'd be in it. What if it made sense, where are Rocco and the black guy at first? It was just stupid ... It's insulting Pacino and the first movie.
