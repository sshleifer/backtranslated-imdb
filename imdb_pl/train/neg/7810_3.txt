Against All Hope is a very poorly made, sometimes painfully film. This is the first movie by Michael Madsen, who shows that he is not good at it. Some people may find this story ridiculous; the alcoholic realizes that his life and family are falling apart, which is why he calls the preacher the ultimate means of help. After telling the preacher of his story, he receives Jesus Christ into his heart. <br /> <br /> Actually, I found many religious scenes, like when Cecil Moe (Madsen) goes to church but leaves him, quite realistically. I also liked how Cecil knows that his life is falling apart and trying to get help, but he realizes that only God can help him. In the end, he realizes with the help of God that he can go through life without drinking. <br /> <br /> This movie is not well made. Acting is wrong, the script can use some work and it looks worse than my home movies, but it has good news. Now, just because you become a Christian does not mean that you will be able to automatically stop addiction or heal your broken family, and Cecil knows it and works hard to stay on the right track. In general, if you are a Christian, you will appreciate how this movie introduces Christianity, and if not, you can be called to learn more about faith.
