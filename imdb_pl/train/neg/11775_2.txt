Watching "Kroko" I would like to leave the cinema for the first time in my life. I do not recommend watching this movie: flat main characters - absolutely no development, for example, Kroko's metaphorical German child with problems remains a pure metaphor without the possibility of positive involvement despite several chances for it. Uninspired actors, not a growing plot. It seems to me that the film tried to conduct an environmental study, but it failed: the camera seemed rather shaky than motivated. The pictures were low - contrasting, gray and dark - I'm sure they are deliberately, but the components do not add up to the convincing impression of the social environment. However, the story had a certain potential, it could be a good story.
