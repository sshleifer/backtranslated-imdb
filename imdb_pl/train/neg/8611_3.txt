When Rodney Dangerfield is on the wave, he's funny. In My 5 Wives is not on the field. The time of one-liners movies is off, but that's the best thing in the movie. The five women who play on wives do not sum up into one whole. The plot is very poor. Even the assumption is quite weak; There are a few jokes about having many wives, but the situation has little to do with anything else in the movie. Most of the film could be played in the same way, even if Rodney's character had only one wife, so the premise seems to be more of an old man's fantasy than a key part of the comedy. Another fantasy of an old man: we should accept the fact that Rodney's character is a sports skier. <br /> <br /> Jerry Stiller seems to be calling in his role just to do a favor to the buddy, and the rest of the actors' names just need to be desperate for work. <br /> <br /> A strange nod towards political correctness in a later film does nothing for the film. For those who like their politically correct films, non-PC humor is still in the first place, and the seeming apologies for it still do not make sense. For those who hate watching a film that follows political correctness, PC add-ons are simply annoying. There are several racist jokes, and the scenes from the bedroom would have made shocking television 40 years ago, but that's it. Maybe men are topless (they are joking). <br /> <br /> The DVD features interviews in which cast members seem to find depth and meaning in this film and in their roles. I wondered if they were serious or joking. They seem to be serious, but I kept thinking, "They must be kidding!" There is also a strange objection suggesting that if the movie really does not call Mormons or the Latter-day Saint Church, it's not about them in any way. It does not matter that the film contains a polygamous religion in Utah and refers to Brigham Young. <br /> <br /> In short, My 5 Wives was a disappointment. I was hoping for Rodney, but the best thing I can say about the movie is that Rodney looked pretty good for a guy who pressed 80 times during that time.
