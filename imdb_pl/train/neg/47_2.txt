When a man who does not suffer from Alzheimer's disease can not remember how many films he made, he is probably the most prolific director in the world. This man is Jesus Franco, the king of the so-called eurotrash. His film from 1980, Devil Hunter, is so hasty, opaque, stupid, lazy and exploiting in the truest sense of the word (at the beginning the title of the movie is misleading, like any other Franco movie I've seen). That makes it sound pretty horrible, and it's ... And yet Franco has some unique sensitivity, a generous way to be balding outrageous, with nudity and madness and violence, and even with his stupid, cheap editing that tries to overwrite an extreme rush from which all of his films were made. The combination of all of these elements means that you drive on his films, even if you're mostly waiting for them to finish, because they are very tedious. <br /> <br /> Devil Hunter is almost unintelligible for the first half hour. The kidnapping of a white woman who appears to be a model or movie star is interrupted by several native actions in South America. There are a lot of naked twisting, dancing and endless multiple close ups on an ugly pole totem. You have to get used to the repetitive close-ups and the technique of going back to the same picture about three times in a row, because these are the main methods of Franco expanding the movie to the length of the film. <br /> <br /> A monster that looks like a totem pole is actually frightening. He has raw eyes of bugs, and his presence is always signaled on the sound path by cacophonical moans, apparently recorded in the echo chamber. At the beginning of the song she chews a native woman tied to a tree and it's hard to know what's really going on here, but I think she ate her stomach (or her genitals, sweet Jesus!). <br /> <br /> In any case, the adventure begins correctly when a guy and his bizarre Vietnamese vet are sent to the island to retrieve the white girl from the kidnappers. Flakey guy has an accent which, as it was called, is half-Brooklyn-American, half English-Liverpool and everyone is delayed. The whole dialogue and dubbing are funny and ridiculous, creating another layer of the movie that may in some way interest you. <br /> <br /> It's not really happening since then, and it's happening quite slowly, stuffed with strange anger like rape. The nebular action is developed (haha!) About 360 degrees of nudity from the natives and two female leaders, and even from the monster itself. The fact that he walks with the exposed penis, makes the stock for him become an unappetizing perspective for the hero tough, but it must be done at some point and it is nice to see that the director will show someone's genitals in the camera. <br /> <br /> The best thing about Devil Hunter is filming the location. Franco can be extremely cheap in design and fictional aspects, but he does not joke about the sets. You get real islands, jungles, helicopters and mountains, all on the panoramic screen. This is a really cool experience in these bad CGI sets and nauseam sleepers. <br /> <br /> Finally, the issues of recommendations in which this film is discussed seem to be debatable. If you're trying to see all the Nasties videos, you'll have to watch it at some point and you'll be as restless as me. If you like Franco, you'll watch it anyway. If you do not fall into any of the above categories, chances are you will never see this movie. His copies are not just nearby, and I can hardly recommend looking for it. It's Franco. Lazy, crazy Franco.
