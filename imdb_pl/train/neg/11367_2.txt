Greg Davis and Bryan Daly adopt some crazy statements from terrorists, add a commentary of a group of reckless reactionaries, ascribe the most extreme positions of the most fundamentalist Muslims in the world to all who call themselves Muslim, and portray it as the theology of Islam. Perhaps their next film will include interviews with Fred Phelps and the congregation of the Westboro Baptist Church, commentary by some militant atheists, and the name "What the world needs to know about Christianity." production value and lack of care for the most basic standards of journalism. Do not waste time and money, just turn on AM radio and listen to Rush Limbaugh for a few days for free, and get the same message with the same level of intellectual analysis.
