Horrible .. So frightening !! Full of nakedness (from fat to thin), Maslin Beach takes place on a nudist beach in SA <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time two years ago - it's safe to say that it was a strange topic of discussion at school the next day . This movie was horrible! This is not a romantic comedy - only a showcase of nakedness! This film reached the lowest level when one of the figures of the new age stared at the girl's legs. <br /> <br /> Girl: You will not find God there! Guy: No, but I think I found the sky. <br /> <br /> Avoid this unless you want to hear amateur actors discuss topics such as farting, adultery and the process of genital mutuality. AVOID!
