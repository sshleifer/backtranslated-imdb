A group of models is looking for a flat to live in and is shown by a local real estate agent. However, it is not known to the models and the agent that the "hell threshold" is in the apartment, and when it is crossed, the demon "Dethman" is called to kill all those who are on his way. The story was told by Sam Bishop, a journalist accused of murder. <br /> <br /> Although I am a master of low budgets, microbudges and independent films, I can not boast of this movie. The creators are proud of their 24-hour photo schedule, and at least one actor boasts on his DVD with his acting prowess, but I can not wrap his head around it. Why film in 24 hours if an additional one or two editing hours would bring a difference? And why are you proud of the action, which is bad, nonsense and results in bad delivery of several lines? <br /> <br /> Most of the film models are shown in the part of the apartment next to the real estate agent. The dialogue is clearly advertised because no screenwriter can come up with such empty diction. The agent also knows nothing about the apartment ... focuses on the aspects of the house, which nobody cared for, wrongly explains the source of heat (did not see the heater?) And says that the problem of vermin will be solved when they call the "terminator". Please write a script - some deviations are fine, but it was a mess. <br /> <br /> And why do girls move on models? Their career did not make sense in the story, and it seems to be a forced situation. At some point, the actress breaks the character and says something to the effect of "guy, will be (upset)", which sounded more natural than any other line, though not in place due to another bad dialog box. /> <br /> The demon did not make sense. I appreciate the attempt to explain how the "threshold of hell" jumps to random places on Earth (including fireplaces in apartments), but why not explain where the demon comes from? Its origin includes a man whose love kills another man. How does it make you a demon? (Besides, why did we need these Victorian flashbacks without a dialog box and a look at the field? It was exaggerated.) <br /> <br /> The dramatic break between the lines was awful. Sam Bishop's character was by far the worst, and the interviewer was not far behind. Does every question require a pause, a funny face and an answer ... followed by a pause, a funny face and an answer? I was so frustrated. For me, the only thing was to drag the time ... but I would rather have thirty minutes of good delivery than an hour of terrible delivery (and then I would lose more time, knocking over the same loans twice). /> <br /> Who was the character of Sam Bishop? Apparently he "saw" all this and was accused of killing girls, but he was not in that part of the story with the girls at all. How did he see them? And if not, how did he know that Dethman had killed them? And if he did not see Dethman, how does he know that Dethman is the spirit of the Apostles? I was so lost ... was there even an outline of the story when it was written? <br /> <br /> The only part that made me happy in this movie was the scene with one of the models in the bathroom. Not that it was really important or something, but it was the only break from the boredom I was given. I wonder what director Felix Diaz thought. His music is very good (see the DVD behind the scenes of his improvised game), but I'm wondering about his filmmaking skills. Although, by far, the best part of the DVD was the trailer of his "Superhero Excelsior" (the trailer itself was better than the whole waste of time). <br /> <br /> I'm sorry that I have to be so strict. I would like to think that this movie was a test of what can be done in 24 hours, or maybe just an experiment for fun, and the idea was never to create a high quality movie. But if "Superhero Excelsior" is some indication, Diaz can make the quality ... so why he decided to avoid it? Perhaps the world will never know.
