I tried to sit through this bomb not so long ago. What a disaster. Acting was terrible. There were some absolutely pathetic action scenes that fell flat as a lead balloon. supposedly a modern modification of the original "Lifeboat" by Hitchcock. I think Hictcock will spin the wheels in his grave just thinking about it. From what I could suffer, there is nothing convincing about this movie.it can boast of a few big names, but do not put any effort into your characters. But, you know, to be honest, it was no one's fault. I'm really sure that the script exploded during the first explosion. LOL.it, it's possible that this item will end up improving over time. But for me I am not willing to spend at least three days to find out. So if you do not have at least a three-day weekend on the horizon, avoid this stinky / 1/10
