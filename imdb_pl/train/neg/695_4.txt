I have heard so much about this film that it was a great movie and one of those early films from the 80s that had to be seen by the most ardent fans of most films. Well, I hired him and I have to say that although my attention was as far as the uncertainty concerned most of the smaller films, such as April Fools Day, Friday 13th and Prom Night, this movie might have been right there with the above-mentioned only there was a lack of real enthusiasm and potential from the heroes, as well as continuous history. The characters I thought were unfortunate that I was in this film were a weirdo with curly hair that crawled around the dormitory and, of course, led to his real climatic role while fighting the murderer. Another would be a dirty, sloppy-looking guy with a denim jacket, he could play more roles in this movie, which could make the movie more interesting, instead the guy played this guy as another loser, making an unfamiliar connection while sleeping with his girlfriend, and then drops his part and cut him off to the end, which was a waste, I was finally disappointed. Regarding the real identity of the killer, when the identity was revealed, who he was, I just laughed, but everything was obvious and really made a real moron, and the annoying figure for his true intentions was revealed. This video should be at least one watch for all fans, but do not spend hard earned money on rare collector collections that are difficult to access.
