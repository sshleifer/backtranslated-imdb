This film is nothing more than a religious treatise promoting classical Hinduism and New Age Occultism disguised as Western images to be swallowed by those who do not know fundamental religious comparisons. Basic tenants of Hinduism contain elements of reincarnation. (Some characters appear both at the present time and in the seventeenth century), of course resurrected. God is an impersonal force. The life of animals and the life of plants are the same. (This is pantheism). Redfield tried to combine Eastern mysticism with Western Christianity. His attempt to syncretism can deceive or mislead those who are not seekers of the truth, but this film is a weak excuse for any ultimate reality. As she used to say in old Berkeley Barb for $ 10.00, she'll show you how to start your own religion. As one of the famous prophets said, "Use the power of Luke."
