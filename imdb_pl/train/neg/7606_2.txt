Beverly garland was born at the wrong time. She was an actress ahead of her time, bringing power and grace even to such poor films as in Corman's films in which she performed. In Gunslinger, she is the wife of the city sheriff. He is released, so he takes over his job to pursue his killers. It is definitely better than the material it works with. The film is gray, stiff and mostly boring. There is some (unintended) humor, where there are traces of tires everywhere, people running behind one building, suddenly appearing in front of others (I heard about false fronts, but it is ridiculous!), And a really stupid plot line of a newly widowed sheriff in love with a rented guy, to kill her. Even if she did not love her husband, it was only a week or two since he died! In the end, he ends up shooting the guy to death. There is no happiness with men, this one. <br /> <br /> The villain is another woman, the owner of the salons. She plans to buy the land in case the railway line goes through it and makes it rich. Her plan of action, if it is not, is pretty bad - she will just steal as much from the city as she can and jump. Hell, it's only she and her hired gun at the end against the whole city. Are you telling me that these people are not armed? See what happened in the real cities of the Old West, when the bank robbers came to rob the bank, and then they were demolished by a barrage of bullets by the armed and dangerous inhabitants of the city. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of pointless conversation and driving, interspersed with a few lame shootings. The ending is as bleak as ever in the Corman movie, although thank God he lacks moral proselytism at the end which was in "Conquered the World." The sheriff passes his badge to Sam Bass and goes to the sunset, although the movie was so gray that you never saw the sun.
