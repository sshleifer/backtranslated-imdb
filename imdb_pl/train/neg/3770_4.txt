The intention of director Warren Beatty to turn the famous comedian Chester Gould into a live cartoon (with Beatty in the lead role as a square-jaw detective) had a sweet charm of innocent nostalgia - quite unusual and intriguing from Warren Beatty. Unfortunately, the picture is a required ham, fun for a moment, but finally tiring. Dick Tracy is trying to bring the Big Boy Caprice gangster, assisted by a loving Tess Trueheart, but stumbled by the evil Breathless Mahoney. For about half an hour Oscar-winning art direction and stage design are great to absorb, but when the plot creaks as predicted (without a real sting in writing), everything begins to solidify. Al Pacino received an unexpected Oscar nomination as a bad boy Caprice, and Madonna (who is most often used as a decorative prop) sings Stephen Sondheim "Sooner or Later (I Always Get My Man)" who coped with the award for the best original song. A lot of heart, thanks to Beatty - who was devoted to his vision - but the picture is too cold and calculated. He lacks heat. * 1/2 of ****
