This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen in the cinema !! I could not wait for it to end. What's worse, it receives a 12A certificate, so you can not see anyone who gets shot, only bodies falling to the ground, even killing Babban was cut !!! Too many scenes have been cut to attract younger viewers because I think the developers knew it would be catastrophic! Acting Amitabhs was great, but "Basanti" and the second idiot who plays Devgans can not even act. Devgan was wasted !! <br /> <br /> I would not watch it again and advise everyone who read it to do the same.
