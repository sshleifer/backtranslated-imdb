This movie is probably the worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life! The story is ridiculous, and all the crap of "Little Man" is so stupid. The whole movie is unrealistic and stupid. Let's face it, it's just a "black comedy". It's just a senseless horrible song that should never have reached theaters. Jokes are not funny, and acting is frightening. Please, I am begging you to save your money, than you saw this worthless piece of nonsense. For an hour and a half I had to endure sitting by the Little Man, wanting my eyes to bleed. I am disgusted that something like that may even be conceived! Who is writing this shit? The actors have NO talent, what ever, how do these people get to Hollywood? They earn from this trash!
