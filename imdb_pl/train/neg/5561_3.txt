I saw this movie titled "Tied Up". Generally, I liked Dolph movies, so I tried it. It was not worth it. I have read some previous comments about the tempting viewer. Do not be fooled. It's a bad movie at best. The operation does not exist. The story, what is not enough, is very predictable. The film in the places seems to be cut together. This one just stinks the place. Not even worth the price of a cheaper nightclub. As a little Dolph fan, I was waiting for him in action. At the end of the movie you will still be waiting. It's best to avoid this movie and spend time watching almost everything.
