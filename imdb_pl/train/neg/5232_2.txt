Becky Harris plays a female client who is unfortunate to be in the shop at the wrong time, and of course the only purpose of this movie is to provide a reason to use pilots! Miss Harris seems to be over fifty or older when she appears on stage for the first time. When the redhead bandit ends with her, it turns out that she is not the AARP queen. If these are not some of the best resources that have ever been displayed on celluloid, I want someone to give me. Absolutely breathtaking, in my opinion, I literally wiped my copy of VHS, registering its charms. I would like to know if this movie is available on DVD. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie really is not worth the memory. I was hoping to see something quite convincing and intelligent, but I was disappointed in both cases. God bless Becky Harris!
