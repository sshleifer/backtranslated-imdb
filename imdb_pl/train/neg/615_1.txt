I must say that I usually like horror movies that I have never seen ... but this one was just pathetic for my bloody taste. I got used to the bloody, humorous types ... but this particular movie was bad. The operation was terrible (however, this trivial (non-word game) single-coat was sweet). And the continuation of this, Scarecrow Slayer was even worse! Yes, probably when it first came out, there was enormous admiration and people liked it. But when movies like The Ring and The Exorcist of Emily Rose appear, movies like these make films like Scarecrow seem childish. If you want the movie to just pass the time, choose this one! The special effects are shoddy as hell. But seeing that it was a low-budget movie, I see how it will happen. It will remind a little of the movie "Children from corn". Independent movies are spinning most of the time. So if you want to see a scarecrow killing people with corncobs, or in the sequel, 2 scarecrows that appear on it, these movies would be for you.
