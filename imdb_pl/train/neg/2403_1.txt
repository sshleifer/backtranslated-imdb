Whack!!! I got this movie because Elizabeth Hartman was in it. I was disappointed when I learned that at the end she was in two short scenes. Besides, I kept pushing the fast forward button all the time. Some teenager goes with his father on a trip to Romania and is bitten by a wolf and turns into a werewolf if it is full. He kills his father and friends. About 30 years ago, but does not age and enrolls in high school. There he meets a shy teacher whom he eats, and then he has children with her. He sucked this movie and I do not recommend it to anyone. Instead, read War and Peace. Only Mrs. Hartman did a great job. Check out the very young Bob Saget in this one !!
