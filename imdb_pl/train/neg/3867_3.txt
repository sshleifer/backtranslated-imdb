Oh, so familiar comedic story about the nice guy Paul (Jason Lee), who after a night out at a bachelor party wakes up in bed with Becky (Julia Stiles), an attractive blonde who he met the night before. After he lied to his fiancée Karen (Selma Blair), he is forced to say more and more lies to hide his songs. <br /> <br /> I am sure that most of us have witnessed such a story at least once before ... on film or on television. The film is formal and VERY predictable, with the ending that can happen a mile away. <br /> <br /> At least the cast provides some interest and keeps them in view. Lee is at the forefront, and Stiles is great fun in the light comedy role, different from the very serious roles that usually plays. Becky is a free spirit who seems to change jobs as often as other people change clothes. <br /> <br /> But you know, it's not exactly written. At least one question remains unanswered: on WHAT, exactly, is Ray (Lochlyn Munro), a brutal ex-boyfriend Becky, examined by IA? <br /> <br /> And I did not like the figure of Buck (David Koechner), Paweł's stepfather; he's a super-obnoxious moron who got so nervous that I begged someone to hit him. <br /> <br /> Add another debit: an unjustified, non-accredited episode of comedian / actor Larry Miller, once again playing grouch (in this case, it's a bit justified - his character is ultraconservative minister). <br /> <br /> He is not good at all, but as usual for me, I give him three out of ten based on the efforts of the cast itself.
