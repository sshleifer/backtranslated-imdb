When I work in a video store, I watch a few movies, and sometimes I try to watch some of the not so big movies. Proud turned out to be one of them. The initial idea of ​​telling the story of a black ship with a crew during World War II had some advantages. However, in less than 10 minutes watching the movie, it turns out that the main point of the film was the story of racial tension during World War II. The basic story concerns the ship, crew and their feats during the war. This main point is stuck inside you to the point of redundancy throughout the movie. I praise the people who served in the USS Mason for their triumph in the face of adversity and the hardships they endured. A film about the achievements that these people have made for themselves, the Navy and their country, and not a film that focuses on racism during World War II should be filmed.
