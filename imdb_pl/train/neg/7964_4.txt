"Creepshow 2" is not much more than a pale imitation of the original, designed for a small purpose other than earning on the name of the previous movie. It even strengthens the defects of the predecessor, which was often predictable and heavy. Still, the first time, there were enough emotions to make up for this periodic break, which resulted in an uneven, but generally quite amusing effort. Continuation has several valuable moments, so the transparency of the story is even more evident. He delivers it once in a while, but he stays there most of the time. <br /> <br /> As in the original, all stories revolve around the common theme of revenge and only desserts. A wooden Indian comes to life, vengeance on the killers of its owner. Teens are devoured by a water monster. The hitchhiker returns from the dead to pursue the careless driver. None of these premises is in itself evil, but they are completely lacking in inspiration. There are several surprises and no worries. This is a textbook example of making movies without motivation. It does not help that this cheap movie appearance suffers from a flat style of directing, although to be honest, there was nothing to work with. In the end, the second story comes out best, but not too much. <br /> <br /> Most performances are fine at best. George Kennedy, as the unfortunate owner of a general store, performs appropriate, if not particularly inspiring work. On the other hand, Dorothy Lamour is quite good as a motorized driver, evoking compassion for her difficult situation, despite predictable, unnecessary material. However, most of the characters are quite thin. <br /> <br /> One would think that "Creepshow 2" would be better. George Romero, who directed the original, returned to writing the script based on many stories by Stephen King. The creator of makeup effects Tom Savini performs a good, bloody job. So why is the film disappointed? I think Romero did not really want to make a second movie, but he was forced to do it for financial reasons. It was a decade of horrors, clones, uprisings and so on, so it was certainly inevitable. I can imagine a guy writing a script in a hurry, raising his payment and running away. I think that he had to do what was necessary to finance his own projects; we can not blame him. <br /> <br /> Mark: * 1/2 (z ****) <br /> <br /> Published by New World Pictures
