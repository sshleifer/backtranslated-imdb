It just does not make sense to try to glorify any part of the movie. <br /> <br /> It was simple. At the very beginning you can think that you are in a visually amazing cinematographic art ... and soon after you hit a big bag (hemp) FAIL! The fight is barely war, acting is balancing on the edge of couples, and music is not worth describing. There are only enough stories to create an excuse for this movie. The decisions made by the characters and the way they deal with situations are weak and nothing bothered me. I think the only reason this movie was made was to fulfill the role of the site's fans using Yumiko Shaku.
