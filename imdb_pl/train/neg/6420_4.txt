OK, I admit that it started very nice and good, but then it just fell down, I can not believe Sarah Michelle Gellar could even finish reading the script after about 5 minutes of the movie, the only reason I really sat all the time film, did I want to see the phrase in ned, and to my surprise, well, people I can not even tell you if there was one, because the end just leaves you confused, and then the role of credit, I was like hell? it did not deserve the course of the theater, I'm sorry, but that did not mean it was awful, the only thing I gave him was 4, that he had some lively parts ... that's all! You can watch it, I do not tell you not to do it, hey, you might like it or even love it! but if you hate it, do not say I did not warn you!
