Fragmentary film about a few people in Austria during a heat wave. This type of film was made more often, and above all better. Stories have nothing to do with each other, except for the pathetic finale: "people are cruel." An ugly body, unpleasant people and a movie that lasts too long without doing anything specific ... Little ... Boring? Indeed. Even the great Franzisca Weiss can not save it! 3/10
