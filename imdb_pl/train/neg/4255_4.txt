the film opens with a beautiful lady in a frayed white dress running through a stereotypical city in Eastern Europe. we know that she is following her because she is still looking at her. and soon we see that she is being hunted by a mysterious man in a black trench coat. then we realize that the man is actually a vampire hunter and he follows her. but look, is her reflection in the store window ??? this is not her identical twin vampire! but unfortunately they both get it. <br /> <br /> after this brilliant and incredibly funny ejection to old hammer films from the 60s and 70s (in the subtitles twins are listed as twins of evil, which of course is the name of the last part of the carnine trilogy), the plot almost dies . <br /> <br /> What is the small story about dracula (which comfortably changes its appearance every time it is reborn, so the producer does not do it I need to bring the same dracula to the morgue, medical students realizing that he is undead and thinking ... wow, what an opportunity, I can just ignore all the movies that say drinking vampire blood turns you into a vampire and use the blood of a vampire to find a cure for our friend's ailment, of course it's a mistake and everyone gets wampirem. <br /> <br /> A new concept, but very badly reflected, the film constantly creates great situations and does not want to do anything with them. <br /> <br /> For example, medical students try to bring back to life drac by putting it in a bathtub filled with blood in a secluded, country downed court. The house itself is scary enough to become the center of the movie, but are we staying there? No, because they decide to take a vampire and the abandoned pool, sigh, this movie has a real problem with "homagas", as I mentioned earlier, the opening scene is straight from the hammer, and this home scene would be perfect for a movie resembling a hammer, but the movie quickly changes gears and changes in medical horror. <br /> <br /> Another problem is that they introduce so many characters that it is almost impossible to regret any of them. They are all medical students and their "friend" from a professor in a wheelchair, all medical students: arrogant, boring, hungry, money and stupid. when they reached the medical school at all, they amaze me unless the medical school had to meet the limits related to the muscles / big breasts. and then there is a vampire hunter who remains mysterious in the movie. Hey, I can respect it, but it would be nice if they did not set it up as if the movie was about him. then you have random priests, cops and scientific types. so many people are put in, then quickly forgotten, until they need that person to either save the day, or jump out of the cheap fear that is quickly becoming tedious. <br /> <br /> Essentially, this is a lazy movie. no real fears, just a few predictable horrors. Such a system is so complicated that it is fun. for example in a full blood bath. it is so obvious that drac will jump out of dark blood. and yet we have to wait too long to go to the inevitable fear of jumping. after that, he kills one of the stupid and bigger breasts of medical students. we all know that he will become one of the undead. but what are the others doing? bury her in a shallow grave near the house. sigh, so you know who will jump on you when the cops show up at home .......... <br /> <br /> Oh well. <br /> <br /> Maybe someone will get a clue that it is impossible to make a horrible vampire movie and just go to the atmosphere, and then we'll end up with a whole movie that's as good as the opening scene. <br /> <br />
