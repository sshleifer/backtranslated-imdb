I was so disappointed with this movie. I do not know much about the real story, so I wanted to see how the film plays and educate myself in a small piece of history. With such a powerful real story and great actors it seemed like a combination. Well, somewhere the script failed them. It was so scattered - was this movie about his childhood? his love life? his own disability? his speaking ability? his passion for the disabled? I'm sure there is a way to incorporate all these things into a good story, but this movie was not that. I remained cold, watching characters who could not be met because of their disability, but because of their personality. Other minor notes: 1. Heavy soundtrack. It's the seventies - WE ALREADY GET ALREADY! 2. If he is such a phenomenal public speaker, why have we not been treated here and there more than a fragment - and even then mainly in assembly?
