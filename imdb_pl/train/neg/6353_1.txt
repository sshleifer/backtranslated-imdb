For the comedy writer, Woody Allen really lets the paying viewer come down from this humble attempt to develop the character. There are some funny moments, but no more than one could listen to their drying tennis balls. <br /> <br /> Will Ferrell is wasting his time in this movie, which does not show his usually fun delivery. Amanda Peet was doing well, but again she had no place to move into another movie. The film is so heavy and boring that it can not be worn, but if it was taken, it was done by Radha Mitchell. <br /> <br /> If you like movies that last and last in one scene and really do not achieve anything, but show that their writer can sometimes write a few poems of dialogues, you'll love this movie.
