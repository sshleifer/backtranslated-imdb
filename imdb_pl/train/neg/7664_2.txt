Spojlery in front of you, but does it really matter? Have you ever read a review of a video made only of questions? Is it possible? Why has ancient civilization buried artifacts around the world? Why has this question never been given? Why was the indexing of the initial text inconsistent? Why did the nun (certainly seemed nice!) Give away 20 orphan madman? Was there always a gold mine in downtown Vancouver? Why does one of the gold mine shafts go out into the orphanage yard? Why is the figure of Tara Reid suddenly appearing in the apartment of Christian Slater for sex? (Or maybe I just answered my question?) Why did not even the non-archeologist bang of course open a valuable, solid gold box with a hammer? Why would modern computers still display the green contours of objects from the pre-Tron era, supplemented with small "hemorrhages"? Do all digital movie timers need digital displays? Why is nothing in this movie meaningless?
