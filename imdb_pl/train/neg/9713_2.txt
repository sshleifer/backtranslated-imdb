For the first time, I watched the Cold Case after working for about a year on Danish television. At the time of his appearance on television, he nearly drowned in 4 or 5 other US crime programs broadcast more or less at the same time. <br /> <br /> I saw it and I was bored with death. Sub-standard actors who had just faces and morals were behind. The whole assumption that so much money was given to a team of researchers to solve murders from 10-20-30 years or even 60 years ago seems unlikely. <br /> <br /> Time is also a factor because they only have 50 -60 min to tell a story, which means they get a break just in time to resolve the matter and ensure justice for the surviving family members if they are still alive. In conjunction with the "personal" problems and relationships of researchers who must be on the list, the show is completely colorless. <br /> <br /> I give him a 2-star rating because of the music I finish which is really the only reason to watch ... what you will not do, of course, because it's too slow to watch this shit.
