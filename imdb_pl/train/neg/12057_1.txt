Charles Bronson continued the collapse of the 1980s, which could have been his worst film of the decade, if not ever. He plays a detective in it, who makes every effort to track down a pimp who kidnapped an Asian girl and now sells it to the highest bidder. It's a heinous attempt of action and probably the most depressing movie ever made. Many people consider Death Wish sequels to be Bronson's worst movies. The Death Wish sequences were not great films, but in most cases they were competently made and could be watched. Kinjite, however, is a completely boring thriller, which is interrupted by crazy racism and child molestation. It is really a film that can be repeated, and all this is exacerbated by the fact that he is trying to preach the mentality of "Law and Justice", which is too exaggerated to really say something. Indeed, the film begins with Bronson's interruption of underage sex, and then anal rapist pedophile using a vibrator. I watched the Chicago theater as if it was just gasping because of the awkwardness of the scene, just to catch the breath of the pimp's awkwardness in the film. There is no point in using it, and the movie was not written enough to rise above the level of exploitation and provide something that would work. Bronson seems more to the point, but it is clearly too repulsive to save. I want to point out that I think Charles Bronson is the coolest actor in history, but this effort is ultimately his worst. The action sequences are also weak. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * out of 4- (Terrible)
