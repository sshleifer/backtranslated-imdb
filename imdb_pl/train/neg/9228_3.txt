CQ is incredibly slow and I'm a fan of David Mamet. The film is about a young filmmaker who creates a very effective film about Barbarelli. After that the movie started to lose me. Deep and deep? Not quite. The film "Dragonfly" created in CQ has a problem with the lack of completion. This is very similar to CQ, which also lacks the ending (in my opinion). <br /> <br /> I was lucky that I caught this movie at the SxSW film festival. I expected quite high expectations after watching Y Tu Mama Tambien and some other great movies. I could not wait for the performance of Jason Schwartzman. But it was not an easy movie. If you do not play sci-fi from the 60s or in free movies that do not have space, skip it. <br /> <br /> CQ is like a student movie. If you want Donnie Darko to take out an indie-style sci-fi movie recently, you will not sleep.
