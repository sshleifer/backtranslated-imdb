This grainy movie has a cult and one of the features that you had to see. It may be hard to believe, but in the southwest Arkansas, in the village, there is a rural community that knows that the legend is real. This story is told in a documentary style, told by Vern Stierman and filmed in real places where he talks with the people involved. The legend changes with the story, but at the end of the 1960s and throughout most of the 1970s, the area around Fouke was visited by a creature similar to Bigfoot that paced Boggy Creek. Long-haired with three fingers and a height of over 7 feet, this hairy creature occasionally injured and threatened "bejeebers" from the majority of the community. Personally, I crossed the small Boggy Creek bridge in 1974 and so the hair on the back of my neck increased. Of course, it was about 1 in the morning in the rain. Before I reached Shreveport, I was laughing.
