Some comment that this is Elvis' worst film ever made. Well, they're only partly fine. For me, THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE IN EVERY PERIOD! I have never seen anything so primitive, offensive and wicked in my life as human nature as this film. A real embarrassment for the film industry, it's not even that bad, its good. There is not as much dingy entertainment here as in other bad Elvis movies like Clambake. This one is so rotten to sit through his painful. Clean trash. Native Americans should sue here for their bad stereotype and stereotypical treatment. In truth, perhaps ALL Human Beings should sue to the crime and harm that this film makes to the genre as all 0 Stars, seriously. Degree: F
