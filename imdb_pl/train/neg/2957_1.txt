What a mess!! Why was this movie made? This and other films from his "caliber" should be teaching tools, like not making a movie. Children may like it, but anyone who turns 10 may or may not. To make matters worse, such great talent as Whoopi Goldberg and Armin Mueller Stahl has been completely wasted in a film unworthy of any kind of announcement.
