This movie, apparently a thriller, had about five sub-themes that developed at the same time to culminate at the end, but ended up more as yawning. <br /> <br /> Writing was trivial, the pace was slow and chaotic and the characters were boring. George Clooney looks like he has to get into the gym, Matt Damon pinned him down, and others seemed to read his words from the teleprompter. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this movie was that it was carefully made or politically correct, so I did not say anything about big business, oil and the Middle East. I've seen documentaries that provide more excitement. Watch only when there is absolutely nothing else to do.
