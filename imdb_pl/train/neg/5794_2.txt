all the Germans stand out in the open and mimic a machine gun. Good guys never die, unless for dramatic purposes. "Plot" has so many holes that it's funny. (Where did the German soldiers go when they tipped the fuel tank towards the train? Erik Estrada? Please!) And the whole idea, kidnapping the train? How silly! The Germans know where you are going, it's not like you can leave the track and drive away! What a loss. I prefer to hit the head with a ball hammer 10 times and then sit down again. I mean, seriously, FELT how it was done in the 1960s, but it was made in 88 !! 1988 !! Band A is more credible than this horrible pretext for the movie. Watch it only when you need good laughter. This film is for Tele Sevalas what Green Beret was to John Wayne.
