I saw mommy ... well, she was not exactly Santa's kiss; she has a hand on her thigh and thinks about bad thoughts. <br /> <br /> It was enough to emotionally hurt a young boy who wanted to believe. He grew up to be a bitter man who was upset by the quality of the toys he produced and the lack of a festive spirit. <br /> <br /> Expecting a real slass, I was very disappointed that fewer than a handful of people are dying, and there was no nakedness at all. What a bummer. <br /> <br /> I wanted to like this movie, but it was too slow and really did not have a good script. I did not expect great acting, but I definitely wanted some action. It simply was not.
