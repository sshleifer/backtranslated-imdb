It was a charming movie to the end. The end was just one more wretched effort to wipe people out and empower women at their expense. The girl refused to listen to reason and logic and used her passive / aggressive nature to control and impose her will on the guy who eventually gave his power and control over the relationship with her. It was no coincidence that she sat behind the wheel in the car when they left at the end after he had to beg and beg her to take him away. This film is a victory for all women who think they should lead all men and control their relationships with them. For this reason, it was a vile movie.
