Although it is not a "great movie", there is something fascinating and unforgettable about it. Like another movie commentator, I saw it in my childhood. Thirty-three years have passed since 1952, but I have never forgotten history or its absurdly uncomfortable title. See if you have the opportunity. You will feel like a voyeur in the life of a small town that has been evolving for decades. More than any other film, it brings a human face to the historical drama of "progress" at the beginning of the 20th century. It's addictive enough for the young viewer and memorable enough for the older. In addition, it's easy to like the heroes and watch their passage of time.
