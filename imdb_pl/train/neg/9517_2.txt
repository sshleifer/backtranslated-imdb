Vincente Minelli films are usually worth your time; Meet me at St. Louis, The Bad and the Beautiful. I was expecting this movie with great interest. But what a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Some Came Running is a scene of the go-nowhere scene of fatality. Sinatra is a sad sack that has come back from the war to find a disappointing family relationship, a disappointing conviction that hangs on it, living in a disappointing excavation, when it convinces him to end a disappointing writing project. The film has a dramatic ending in which a disappointing villain catches up with Sinatra and MacClane and something disappointing happens. The sequence should be filled with tension, but Minelli is not Hitchcock; he is so distracted by beautiful colors, he does not notice that the scene is a whistling clich√©, and the characters are so poorly drawn and poorly developed that we do not pay much attention to being shot. (especially MacClane) But this is the only true cinematography in the project. Otherwise, we look at the hardened figures standing around bars and lounges that get into their nerves for two hours. Hell is different people, apparently. <br /> <br /> Nothing happens in this movie. The dilemma of soldiers returning to resettlement and indifference after the Second World War is cleverly treated in the "Best years of our lives". And one of the two Inge products, "Splendor in the Grass" and "Picnic", includes the desperation of imprisonment in a dead end of the city, with much greater takeover.
