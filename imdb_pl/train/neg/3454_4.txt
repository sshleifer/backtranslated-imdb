Cut tries to be like most of the post-Screams who have tried to be a parody of a horror genre that has tried to be clever, referring to other well-known horrors. Now I'm not packing "Scream" because I think "Scream" is a very good horror movie that combines horror and comedy. Cutting is unsuccessful at most levels. It has its moments, but in general, it just does not work, even as a "bad yes" good movie, just below average. <br /> <br /> The first five minutes are OK and set the story pretty well, except the fact that Kylie Minogue can not really work, and ironically pulls out your tongue, go to the figure. Go a little further and a group of film students want to end their movie, which is clearly cursed. And, as you've probably predicted, one by one the cast and the crew are slowly being chosen by the masked madman. <br /> <br /> An unfair plot, poor acting and predictable ending are just some of the elements that follow. There are many references in the film, everything from "Shout" to "Texas Chainsaw Massacre." This is also not smart, because it seems that the director wanted to feel smart and good, mentioning other famous movies from the horrors of ala Scream. There is a minimum of gore and no nakedness for a slass player, which is a huge negative when it comes to a slass who does not have much to do. I really should support this movie because I am an Australian and we are not so good when it comes to horror (although we have our jewels), but Cut definitely does not belong to them. <br /> <br /> However, it made me watch for about 90 minutes, so it's at least good. I do not recommend this to anyone except hardcore slasher fans who can appreciate what this film tries to strive for, but if you're looking for a good movie, stay away. <br /> <br /> 2/5
