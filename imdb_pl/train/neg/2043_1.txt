Horrible, terrible, horrible. <br /> <br /> At the beginning there is a condescending note and some nasty autopsy photos are not a good movie. Once again, I am amazed at the determination and skills that some people have in making a film, and yet they are not proud that they realize that what they have done is a complete pile of nonsense. <br /> <br /> I sat and tried to come up with a redemption function to at least balance my criticism, but the only thing I could think of was that the Pink opening song was pretty good ... I wonder if she saw it ? <br /> <br /> Watch it at your own risk, boredom can kill you.
