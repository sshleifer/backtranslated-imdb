This film is not only a very bad movie, with terrible actors - or supposed actors - bored direction and unattractive history, but also accurately copies the scene from the excellent "giallio" "Torso" directed by Sergio Martino in 1973 (two years earlier), one of the best-known psycho-thrillers of Italian cinema and the cult movie around the world. In "La Sanguinusa conduce la danza", the director repeats the bed scene between a black girl and a white girl, watching a book from the bedroom window. Of course, the scene in the Rizzo movie is ridiculous and worse than the softness and charm in the movie Martino. To put another black girl, another white girl and another voyeurist, it's just the most appropriate way to prove that the Rizzo movie has no ideas, originality, taste and nothing. I think that such things are an insult to the viewer.
