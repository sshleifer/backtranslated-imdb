I think the real task is to sit in this movie. The soundtrack was not the best, and some of the accents made it difficult to understand what had been said. There was not much to move the plot and often the action simply stopped and the talks that seemed alien to the film were prolonged. These conversations changed between family groups, and the observer was there to try to connect what was the common thread that bound them. It's rare that I rate a movie so low and I do it in this case, because the whole experience of watching left me thinking "so what" and "why I wasted my time watching this".
