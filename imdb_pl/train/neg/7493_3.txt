I could not believe my eyes when I saw Nuremberg on Dutch TV yesterday. It starts very slowly, the background of the Nuremberg trials becomes clear step by step, the Germans have a funny English accent, but suddenly, in the last few minutes of the first part of the series, the audience sees the most shocking, scary material I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It is important for people to see such material (although I absolutely disagree with people who claim that there is no minimum age at which children can be exposed to this type of material), but in this movie it was totally funny. This was only to improve the impact of a regular television series. It was supposed to impress the audience, which is very cheap and incredibly easy. Instead of trying to move us through well-made scenes, inspiring dialogue or interesting points of view, the audience is tortured with terrible images of prisoners of the camp from skin and bones. He does not show respect for the victims of the Holocaust. <br /> <br /> I am very angry.
