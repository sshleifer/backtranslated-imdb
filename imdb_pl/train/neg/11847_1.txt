I'm terrified of how bad the movie is. As a pastiche of Hollywood artists from the beginning of the twentieth century sets a new level - even after The Moderns or (sapie) Cradle Will Rock and never thought that I will see a movie worse than 2. They admitted that there is a slightly different environment Dot. Nevertheless, the intentions and results were disturbingly similar. <br /> <br /> First, is the scary casting: Eddie Izzard as CHAPLIN? Excuse me? Peter, are you guilty of this guy? Jennifer Tilly as Loulla Parsons ?? Kirsten Dunst as Marion Davies ??? Saints of smoke, these people do not even try to capture the look or the sound of the period they purport to represent. <br /> <br /> Well, the Last Picture Show was a decent movie, but this is a disaster and the rest of Bogdonovitch's photographs were not much better. Guessing that he is fighting Welles & Hitch and Ford has long since ended. Still, it is well-suited for hosting TCM.
