I saw this DVD in my friends' house and I thought it was a Turkish action movie with a few stars not too big in Hollywood. Interested enough I decided to give it a chance later. Believe me, it was hard to endure the experience. Then, after finally seeing a roll with subtitles, I thought, "We Turks are really drawn into making Hollywood movies. I checked a few names and no, they were not Turkish names and no, it was not a Turkish movie; on the contrary, he was literally shot dead in America by an American director and crew! It made me think again! - How the hell can you convince names such as Micheal Madsen, Edward Furlong or even Arnold Vosloo to take part in such a project? Probably with money. It made me think further. How can you collect enough money to offer them and allegedly an international cast? Then all my meditation paid off and I came to find the answer. We rented the cheapest equipment and crew that can be found. And if you still have difficulty adjusting your budget, then: by writing and directing the movie you are trying to produce - or vice versa, I do not have any information about it. So it's not a bad movie, because everybody wants to introduce him so much ... It makes you think - in my case I even meditate - and there are many movies that do not even affect it. at least makes you think; It makes you wonder .. It leaves you in disbelief ... and then makes you wonder again ...
