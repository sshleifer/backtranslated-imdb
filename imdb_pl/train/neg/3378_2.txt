Before the film was released, I saw Chorus Line on stage 4 times, and I was looking forward to the long-story production of the film. My wife and I were in the hours before the opening of the cash desk on the day the movie was released. It was not just a disappointment, it was a kick in the stomach. <br /> <br /> First of all, the story has been "moved outside", so to speak, including scenes that do not fit into the theater. These boundaries form a large part of the meaning and influence of the story. <br /> <br /> Total second and third (assign your own order): removed one of the original songs with a very dynamic dance number; added a song that was NOT in the stage production. Say what? I'm confused! <br /> <br /> The only reason why I gave this film 2 stars instead of 1 is my admiration for the talent and hard work of the performers. I've seen Chorus Line on the stage six times now and I would not mind seeing him six times before I die. It's great written, with great music and amazingly real stories. If you want to see a musical that includes a great audition "Cattle Call", I recommend All That Jazz. If you want to see the history of the line A Chorus, see it on stage.
