George Brent is a reporter sent for an interview with an heiress. Apparently he's the heiress of a fortune on his face. He talks to her on his yacht. They fall into each other in swimsuits. <br /> <br /> It turns out (quite early) that he is not an heiress. It is part of an advertising campaign for cold cream. <br /> <br /> The film follows the ups and downs of their romance. <br /> <br /> The support cast does little to support it. Davis and Brent carry the picture. Although it is quite predictable, it is also quite entertaining. It's far from her best. But, especially considering her vagueness in her work, this is not one of her worst.
