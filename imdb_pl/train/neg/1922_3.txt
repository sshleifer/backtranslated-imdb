About the child: why did not my brother assume that he would be hungry for a bottle or some food or change of diaper? After many hours, he should shout without interruption. It's definitely stupid to take your child from a safe place when he did not have to. <br /> <br /> And why was the road wonderfully clean when someone wanted to go somewhere? Did not any uprooted trees fall on the roads and block them? <br /> <br /> I can not imagine the cops in blockades following the young person who will break her down, especially when they say it's dangerous to go there. <br /> <br /> Having in mind the above, it was nice to have a movie that the children could watch safely, for a change.
