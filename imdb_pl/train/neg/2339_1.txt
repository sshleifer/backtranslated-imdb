This spinning movie is more like a combination of music clips on MTV than a real movie. There is no real story, and as the film goes on, ask yourself, "What will happen?"; but nothing happens. The story around Eric Cloeck, a frustrated writer, is the only good thing. Other people seem to have nothing to do with each other: why then combine them in the film? With music, you can make watching the worst movie. When I open the tap and there is water with Bach's music, most people want to look at it, but it's not a movie. The director should learn how to write a movie screenplay for 100 minutes or more before starting to direct a film.
