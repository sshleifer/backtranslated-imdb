Not a good movie, but according to the information is quite accurate in the presentation of torture techniques. The aim of the film was to show the brutality of NK prison camps and this was done effectively enough, with surprising honesty for now. Whatever technical flaws there are (and there are plenty of them) watching this, you'll see a forgotten corner of forgotten war and some nasty things - again, nasty because it's north of the DMZ, not the Guantanamo Bay. <Br> <br /> I do not think any of the Korean veterans moved their torture when he applied for the office, and if you watch movies like this and Pork Chop Hill compared to films from Vietnam. I do not know if the people of 54 were imprisoned in the concepts of World War II (boys often have a tendency to break security), or war, or what, but it is interesting to see it from the same system that 16 years later making movies like "Go Tell The Spartans".
