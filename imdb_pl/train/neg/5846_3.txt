Yes, it's one of THESE movies, so scary, so bland, so uninspired that you will not be able to stop laughing. I watched comedies, good comedies and I laughed less than my wife and I laughed at the movie. Other comments give a good enough idea. Characters are so unpleasant that you cheer on rats, the effects are so poorly made that you wonder whose primary school ran artistic classes, acting ... for acting ... conversation about tired dialogue and embarrassing breaks. br /> But a rat, yes, a big rat. Why did not we see the rat until the end rather surprised me. Often the "big" is not shown to the end, because the budget is limited, and good effects are chewing so much money. I suppose, however, that in this case the big rat was hidden to the end, because the filmmakers were ashamed that the best they had was a man running around dressed as a groundhog with the dentistry of the third world. <br /> <br /> The most sublime part of the whole movie is the elevator scene. After finding out that rats can not stand the loud noise (migraines due to bad behavior?), The main dude triggers a fire alarm to send rats into a rage. If you ever wanted to see a pair of walt-rat rats, while blood spurts from their heads like a geyser, this movie is for you. Really, you have to rent it and see for yourself. <br /> <br /> But not over 99 Â¢, OK?
