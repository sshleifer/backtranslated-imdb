I will give this movie two stars because it is full of beautiful photography. Otherwise it abounds mainly in stereotypes and stereotypes: mountain people are either stupid white trash of fanatically religious or ragged racists, or wise white Indians. Indians are magical people who move without sound, they can disappear in the blink of an eye, talk to animals and read in mind at long distances. And so on, etc. <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie, I was wondering what the sense of the film is (except showing me nice pictures of mountains, log cabins, forests, animal assortment, free impetuous mountain dwellers and crazy people in the church <br /> <br /> The story touched on a whole range of issues, but it did not explore any of them, it was neither a story of growing up depressed nor about being an orphan or fighting for identity. He tried to be all these things and something more, which made him superficial and unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> Although the film was about Little Tree education, we know almost nothing about it, he got a brief summary of his people's story (brave and stoic) and show distillery; forces in chopping wood (where he failed) and running whiskey (literally), I learned to read (and maybe write) with the help of grandma and her dictionary - and that was it. Apparently he did not learn much during the s to stay at the boarding school because it was locked up in the attic. <br /> <br /> However, grandma, grandfather and character Graham Greene made sure that in the end Little Tree became a very spiritual person whose main goal as an adult - then I paraphrase here, "riding with Navajos" and "catching for several wars "- it was" catch up "grandma, grandfather and the character of Graham Greene in heaven (instead of, say, dating girls, get married, have children or other such nonsense). <br /> <br /> Finally, I have to say that I found my grandfather's commercial offensive. Why all the things had to be still whiskey? To counteract the stereotype of the "drunk Indian"?
