Come, some previous reviewers almost wrote a novel commenting on this episode. It's just a TV show from the 1960s! This episode of Star Trek is noteworthy for the most serious child (Yeoman Barrow's) that has ever been used in Star Trek and the fact that it was filmed in a real outdoor location. In contrast to the TNG and Voyager series, which were completely limited to sound scenes. <br /> <br /> This use of the outdoor location (and babe) gives the right depth and almost cinematic quality to the quite ordinary episode of that day. and a very familiar program. <br /> <br /> With the exception of a few notable exceptions, such as "A city on the edge of eternity", "Allotment of land" and "Tomorrow is yesterday" The old Star Trek series must be seriously moth - he gnashed and threw boring misery out of himself . Half a dozen good episodes from 79 are quite weak batting average. <br /> <br /> This is typical of the boring things that Gene Roddenberry produced then, unlike the popular belief that some people worshiped the land on which he walked he actually made a lot of rubbish! He does not deserve to talk about him in one breath, like Irwin Allen, for example. <br /> <br /> Just look at the Enterprise bridge set from a modern point of view. On the floor they used shaky plywood, table chairs with plastic backs and cardboard cardboard above the instrument boards. There are clearly folds on paper! Every expense saved or what!
