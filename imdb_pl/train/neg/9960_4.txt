MÃ“J BROTHER TOM <br /> <br /> Image format: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: Dolby Digital <br /> <br /> After an episode of sexual abuse at the hands of a trusted neighbor, young Jessica ( Jenna Harrison) establishes a relationship with a strange boy (Ben Whishaw) whom he meets in the forest. Unfortunately, Whishaw has his secrets, no less troublesome and much more dangerous ... <br /> <br /> A dramatic drama, triggered by brave performances by Harrison and Whishaw, in which two related spirits immerse in the mutual love of nature after traumatic experiences in the "real world." Unfortunately, their friendship falls apart when harsh reality begins to enter, leading to the inevitable tragedy. The film, directed by Dom Rotheroe and photographed in a digital video format, looks jagged in places (too many uncomfortable close-ups and sloppy camera moves) and takes some time to find your feet, but the dramatic gain is quiet satisfying.
