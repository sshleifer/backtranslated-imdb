For the second time I watched The Incredible Melting Man and it was even more boring than when I first saw it. I do not understand why he became such a "cult classic" when it is so boring boring. The opening scene looks promising when a fat nurse drops a canister of blood and runs into her dear life. After all that's really happening, the melting man roams through the woods and homes, having memories of life as an astronaut. The makeup is quite good, and its melting, sticky face looks quite realistically. There is a nice scene in which he throws the man's head in the river and rises until he reaches the waterfall, where he falls on the rocks and opens. However, there is not much to soak, most of the scenes are shot in the dark and you can not really see what's going on. There is not much gore, at least on the Vipco DVD you are watching. <br /> <br /> No, Incredible Melting Man is not so great. I will give him signs for the cheese factor, but that's all. If you want a real classic sci-fi / horror movie, watch The Deadly Spawn instead!
