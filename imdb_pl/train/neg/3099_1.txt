This film is not only bad, not only banal, but also repulsive. Something in Daphne, about a frightening girl, about the whole damn thing (and I use it literally), the movie emanates a grotesque that could offend a brothel lover. This film makes my skin crawl, I regret that I have reproductive organs and makes me feel unclean. <br /> <br /> One of the things that bothers me the most about this movie is that they have used such a good idea. A creature that has fantasies with disastrous consequences, and not the stereotypical Worst Nightmare and exaggerated Twisted Wish, is really a fascinating idea of ​​the movie. <br /> <br /> Thought: the reason why the hobgoblins must be killed before the day is attracted by their bright lights. During the day, bright lights do not appear well, so they can go anywhere. <br /> <br /> Count Hobgoblinów: Four hobgoblinów leaves the film studio, and yet at least nine deathly plush toys are killed during the film. <br /> <br /> Discussion Question: If you had a cold, demanding, underestimated girl, would you enter the battle with gardening tools with a military piece? Explain.
