Animal Farm (1954) is a very good reading about the dangers of totalitarianism. How good ideals can be changed and distorted by those who are ignorant or who rule with an iron fist and empty head. Unfortunately, this movie does not present any of them. What we've shown is a propaganda piece with lots of waving and pointing fingers. Animation and direction were good, taking into account the budget and period, but the essence of George Orwell's novel is very missing. <br /> <br /> If you are one of those who want to see how not to adapt a novel or are just interested in adapting this brilliant novel, so just in case. I just found one that is a bit mediocre. Only one sentence of a man. <br /> <br /> Remake is a notch below, but not much.
