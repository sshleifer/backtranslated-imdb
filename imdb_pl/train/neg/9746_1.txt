I remember this movie, an exhibition in Barcelona (Spain) in 1970, for a week. Although this may seem unbelievable, and I can not explain it, this film was staged in a theater devoted to ... films about art and high quality (i.e., Bergman, Resnais, Malle, Bu√±uel and ... The Projected Man). Few people have seen it (thankfully people without a doubt) and there are no references to this very boring SF movie can be found in Peter Nichols Science Fiction Encyclopidie, nor about the author of the original novel. Very indicative. I remember this, after all these years, without history, many special effects that actually seem funny, and no more. It seems that in some countries the working time is 90 mm. and in the next 77 minutes. Well, it means just a little more pain.
