Wow. The only positive reviewers are Carpenter's apologists. I know many of them. Guys who watch John Carpenter squat on celluloid and track the film, announcing him a masterpiece of horror. This "movie" is a complete shit. It looks and sounds like porn (good ladies, the soundtrack is awful ...) and has porn acting below the norm, which is shocking, because normally Ron Perlman is really a very good actor. Honestly, I have no idea what Carpenter thought about when he did it. Most likely, "Beans, beans, beans ..." until someone fed it and turned it on a blanket for the whole day ... Do not say anything about the debate about abortion, when they could have a very interesting topic central religious anti-abortion fanatics feel that this devilish child? Not one person from this episode or what you should leave unscathed. It's just awful. How terribly plan 9 from Outerspace. For example, good God, could anyone turn it off before I was terribly crowded. Try to watch it and The Thing the same day, and your mind implies.
