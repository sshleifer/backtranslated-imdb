Seriously, I do not even know where to start. It's as if someone gave a $ 1 billion budget to an autistic Tertiary and said, "Make me a film about secret services." The editing is ridiculous, the photos were at best accidental, each syllable of dialogue was completely delayed, and the director ... was there even a director? Everything was so pointless and lame and aimless ... and accidental .... and bad. <br /> <br /> Here is a SPOILER for you; this movie is the stupidest thing you'll ever see. <br /> <br /> However, if you like this piece, you'll like it; Deterrance, Dark Blue and partial frontal lobotomy.
