Hi, I'm a friend of werewolf movies, and when I saw the title of Darkwolf hitting the shelves, I was like "hmm, a simple and nice name for it at least." Althou ... I wonder why I did not hear about it before. "<br /> <br /> First of all, the movie starts with tits, lots of tits, tits are basically the whole movie budget, who cares about the werewolf effect, just pay the actresses enough to get topless shots! <br /> <br / > So, about the mysterious figure from the dark wolf (small spoilers in front of us, but who cares ...) Is your average everyday cyclist. Even not very strong look, but as the old wise woman in the film says, "is much more powerful and dangerous than ever before. "Describing her as a tattooed guy-motorcyclist, quite original .I looked up twice when they first used the effect of" red glowing eyes. "I mean, my God, that the effect of "let the plants on the red dots in the eyes of the computer" has been used since the seventies. It looks ugly here! And do not start with a 3D-CGI werewolf. As said earlier, how bad and old video game. <br /> <br /> And finally, if I like werewolf movies, as I said. They always build their own legend about werewolves. Darkwolf also builds a world of werewolves, some stupid legends about hybrid werewolves and an ancient bloodline. BUT. Almost immediately after creating engagement rules, "a dark wolf kills everyone who has been touched by a girl", she begins to cut randomly. Which just does not make sense, why even bother telling us about the rules of killing, when they will not even play through them ... Aplus shots from the wolf's point of view are made with sony handycam or something, filming mainly floors and walls. Just add snarling noises and you have a great werewolf effect. Gore is partly OK. But when the wolf cuts everything with an open hand, just putting a hand on the victims, it just can not help me ... <br /> <br /> Really, WHO gives money, create these piles of junk horrollitles straight into the video, they are not even funny - such bad movies, just sad.
