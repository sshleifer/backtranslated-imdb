The American Humanitarian Association, which is the source of the famous waiver "No animals have been harmed ..." (registered trademark of AHA), began to monitor the use of animals in film production over 60 years ago, the blindfolded horse was forced to jump to death from the top cliff in order to take a picture in the movie Jesse James (1939). Needless to say, that terrible act kills for me the whole entertainment aspect of this film. I suppose you can say that at least the horse did not die in vain, because it was the beginning of the audience aroused by the soulless and frightening pain caused by animals for the glory of making movies, but I can not resist the feeling that if a poor animal had a choice, it certainly would not be the way he would choose!
