The road to the ace! You just did a bloodcurdling, grossly intriguing story of the necrophilic cannibal into a soft, gentle drama. Of course, a movie called Dahmer would be one of two types: Horror, or a documentary? It was not. It was not close to any specific facts (in fact, it barely had any substance). It was not really morbid or scary, or even trying to be very disturbing (as if you had to try !!) What the hell was this writer / director thinking? Here is one of the most REAL examples of serial murderers in history. We shot badly, gay rapes and long, frightening flashbacks in the lonely time at his parents' house were bad. I think Jacobson actually tried to present (or come up with) the "soft side" of J. Dahmer.
