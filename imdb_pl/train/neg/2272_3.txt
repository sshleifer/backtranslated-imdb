I'm not a regular Springer spectator, but I watch his performances in flashes and I think the show is a guilty pleasure and a good way to kill time. So naturally I'm going to watch this movie expecting to see "Jerry Springer Uncensored". First of all, Jerry appears in about twenty minutes of the movie's duration. The second hour and twenty minutes is devoted to building this pseudo-farce about junk, jealousy, incest and deception. Jaime Pressley (who looks as hot as HELLLL) is a weirdo who sleeps with his stepfather (a very unusual, burning chains, drunk Michael Dudikoff, who finally leaves his heroine). Mom finds out about the affair, gets into a fight, wants to take him to the show "Jerry" (yes, there is no Springer). And then we have a parallel story with an African-American couple. They take him to the show "Jerry." Characters collide. Bla, bla, freakin 'blah! Trash was rarely BORRRINGG !!!! I wondered why hell Springer has millions of fans, but none of them has checked his movie. Well, now it's totally obvious !! No matter if you love him or hate him, you will hate this movie! How can I explain this? It's a total mess in the movie (if you call it that). It is so badly edited, with scenes that just do not combine, and after some time the story almost disappears and is simply on the map! Imagine a predictable soap opera that has evolved into a comic farce. He rarely laughs. <br /> <br /> My only positive note is the scene with a hot girl. It's as risky as possible. Do not get me wrong, this scene is quite risky, but if you look at the overall video comparing it with material about the Springer program - this catastrophic farce seems to be extremely cleansed. <br /> <br /> My result: 3 (out of 10)
