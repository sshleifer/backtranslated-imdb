W. Somerset Maugham's of Human Bondage is to be a classical English language. If so, many had to be missing in the film version here. The attractiveness of Phillip (Leslie Howard) for Mildred (Bette Davis) is so inexplicable that the scenario would seem to be a post-breakup that tells the story from a human point of view. As a family lawyer, I have heard many such accounts; the man presents himself as noble and always correct, and the woman is a hellish man who had no purpose other than to exploit man. <br /> <br /> Indeed, unless someone wants to laugh at the social assumptions of a filmmaker, it's an uncomfortable movie to watch. Phillip even gives himself to Mildred when he brings a child with indefinite fatherhood, but the real highlight is that Phillip allows Mildred - an angry and now dubious mental health - to run freely on his flat, with predictable results. Bette Davis was attractive for about five years of her life, but this period did not take place here. In fact, at the end of the movie, she looks like the heroine of Baby Jane, which she will play thirty years later. <br /> <br /> I pay attention to the fact that Howard's character is always impeccably dressed and well-groomed. He tells me Phillip wants middle class respect. Someone could not take off with a woman with the right Cockney course. Phillip is a student by most of the film; such a person would be more credible if he was younger and had disheveled looks that testify to the low income and low self-esteem that often accompany the student's status - English Raskolnikov, as it will be. And balance it, letting Mildred have a bit of charm.
