Dakota (1988) was another early vehicle of Lou Diamond Phillips. This movie is similar to the later Harley movie. There are a few differences, but both are the same. I do not know which one was first. I think that it will remain one of the secrets of life. But they are both worried "children" who are trying to turn there. Instead of bicycles, this applies to horses. It's basically the same movie and both are cheesy as hell. If you are serious L.D.P. Fan, so I recommend that you watch them both. You get extreme attacks and attitudes from L.D.P. if you play, go to the game. <br /> <br /> Not recommended, except for L.D.P. Fans !!!
