This program seemed to be good. Kyra Sedgwick is a good actress and I like police series, but somewhere in production this program went badly. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, writers should have more suspects than one, you know who did EVERY TIME !!!!! It makes it boring. The main character is incredibly irritating and is not credible in any way. I know they wanted her to be tough, but I mean, stupid and evil. Crimes are uninteresting and bland, and just lame. As mentioned above, I hate this ... <br /> <br /> In total, it was a huge disappointment and very bad ...
