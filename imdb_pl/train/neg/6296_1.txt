This movie looked interesting; I read the book a few years ago and informed me that this function follows the plot of the story quite strongly. <br /> <br /> I started to watch it and almost from the beginning did not live up to expectations. Actually, I did not bother to watch all this ... total nonsense - bad performances, bad acting and immediately disliked characters - that was the meaning of this film. she left a bad taste in my mouth and made me stay below for the rest of my weekend. <br /> <br /> Do not worry about this function.
