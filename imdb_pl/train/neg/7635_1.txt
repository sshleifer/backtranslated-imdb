I completely agree with Variety's review that the film is never so funny, vivid or insightful with regard to the creative process, because its premise seems to justify. It's dirty and lighting is really problematic. If the film is to be driven by a character, poor lighting does not improve performance, and sometimes it is difficult to see the facial expressions of the actors. Many people outside of South Africa will have difficulty following English spoken in the film, and some local humor will be lost in the process. I watched the film last year at the Cape Town World Cinema festival. Comments and reactions to the film ranged from unobservable and untidy to welcome departure from films about our painful past. Unfortunately Bunny Chow will not be remembered as one of the bright lights of the South African New Wave, but some of the extraordinary films about our apartheid history will indeed be ranked among the best in our 110-year history of the film. No wonder the film disappeared from the cinemas in Cape Town just two weeks after the premiere and most of the cinemas in Durban and Gauteng. It has clearly limited interest among South African consumers.
