The concept of the legal gray zone in Love Crimes contributes to about 10% of the film's attractiveness; the remaining 90% can be attributed to blatant anger. The statement that Sean Young's performance as a so-called district prosecutor is wooden is a gross contempt. With her wretched suits and unnecessary hair gel, Young does a decent job, convincing the audience of her pious hatred for men. Why would she still ask her only friend to pose as a prostitute so she could arrest the cops who try to catch them? This hatred is also the only reason why he ruthlessly chases a perverted photographer who gives women a consensual thrill and the driving force behind this bad film. Watching Young goes from cold to full naked, which does not arouse interest, but a tantrum that he throws next to the fire at the lake. Watching her rant and delight over her hatred for herself and her sexual frustration makes Love Crimes worth the rental fee, but it's all down to and from here. Despite her desire to bring Patrick Bergin's character to justice, her police skills completely escape her tension from her own tired lust and passion. Patrick Bergin does quite a decent job as a slimy sociopath; if it worked in Sleeping With the Enemy, it can work for sure. But I can not help but wonder if the noticeable lack of energy brings conflicts to his film with his slimness. I'm guessing that yes, and the effect is a "thriller" with chills that are completely bad and at the same time comedic.
