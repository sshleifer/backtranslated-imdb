Here is one of those movies spoiled by the emphasis of the studio on a happy ending. Conflicts that have lasted for years are resolved within a few minutes. It would be much more interesting to inject a tone of ambiguity. The talented Barbara Stanwyck is disbanded by a sudden metamorphosis from an independent and firm woman to a consistent woman of the kind she has put down her whole life. Brent, as usual, is far from the head, and then there is the funny situation of Gig Young playing a character named Gig Young. Someone mentions "Gig Young" and then appears, but Gig Young, actor! It is worth to see though far below what could have been.
