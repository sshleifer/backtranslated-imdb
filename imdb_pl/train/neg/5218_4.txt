All elements for the bad night in the movies are in place: a dialogue full of techno-babble biology, chintzy sets, balsa-wood games, the horrifying Casio result from the late 1980s and a general look that suggests anything on the Sci-Fi Channel programming schedule, around 1993. Although "Metamorphosis" begins with promising, the film develops into unremarkable idiocy and MST3K-style cheese, when Clark Kent wants to be "Doctor" by Peter Houseman (Gene LeBrock) is forced to reveal information on his secret projects. But when he tests his indefinite experiment on himself, he transforms into a vaguely defined creature (which bears something more than the similarity to "Dr. Freudstein" from "House at the Cemetery"). The FX work is quite good for such obvious low-budget production (although I suspect most of them are in the shadow for some reason), but overall, "Metamorphosis" leaves a bad retro aftertaste in your innards, in spite of his hopes to sway us otherwise. I can not disagree with the final remark of one character: "(That was) Nightmare ... from the past!"
