Rajinikanth is born again after gaining magical power that he can use seven times. <br /> <br /> There are a few problems with this movie, which are obvious to ordinary people: Rajinikanth, 50, is still at home with her parents; the girl's neighbor's father thinks he is an irresistible "boy" ("vaseekaramaana paiyan"); Rajinikanth abruptly interrupts the movie with his sermons, the worst thing is that women from ancient times have been practicing homework - and yet we have to believe that he is not a theist; although he was well read, he wastes six of his seven powers on a stupid kite; I can go on, but you get a picture. <br /> <br /> There are gods, there are gods and there is Rajinikanth. The catalog has difficulty fitting Rajinikanth into one of these categories. Initially, Rajinikanth is simply Rajinikanth doing what the Tamil heroes do - they oppose the villains and, despite being the eldest, get the recognition of the prettiest girl in the film. Rajinikanth does it well, and some styles of Rajinikantha trademarks are really nice - "baba count" is a novelty. What makes this movie unbearable is that these first few minutes are just an introduction to the worst book ever written. Even this preface is interrupted by a comedy that is forced and obvious. <br /> <br /> The director does not explain the hero's purpose; we see that the hero is facing many obstacles (as usual, politicians), but we can not really eradicate the hero, because we do not know what the hero's ultimate goal is. Finally, when everyone wants him to be a leader, the hero gives another of his sermons and goes away to become a hermit. The director does not offer a solution to the problem on the climax stage. <br /> <br /> A. R. Rehman's result is really interesting. Either he shows patches of brilliance or he did not bother himself to get fully involved in the movie - who can blame him. There is one scene in which Rajinikanth enters the van of one of the crooks, then throws a knife and starts counting. Music is very suitable for this moment and acts as a catalyst that adds tension. The songs are average, no one would have bothered with the songs from this movie after a few years. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, 1 is the lowest rank that can be assigned in IMDb. This movie has all the elements that justify its proper place in the IMDb ranking.
