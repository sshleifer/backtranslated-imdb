HORRENDOUS! Avoid like a plague. I would rate it in the top ten of the worst movies in history. Special effects, acting, mood, sound, etc. They seem to be performed by students of daily care ... wait, I've seen programs better than this. It opens like a soft porn show with an indistinct naked woman who makes a scene with a shower and then breaks down. Good naked scenes, but that's all. Sound and light problems persisted throughout the movie. Sometimes I swore that I can hear the roar of the camera engines. YIKES! I would like to see another movie about this story, but made by different people. This party of actors and crew needs more acting and filming lessons. He voted 1 in 10.
