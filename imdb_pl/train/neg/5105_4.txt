There are probably those that Nicole Eggert remembers of her little girls in such television programs as T.J. Hooker, Charles in Charge and Who's the Boss? You perverts, you! Maybe you remember her from Baywatch when she grew up and had breast implants. Regardless, you will for sure forget about her in this alleged comedy about strangers eating people. <br /> <br /> There are so many things that do not make sense and are never explained. How did she recognize a stranger? Why was the alien hot on paprika and cinnamon? Why did not the alien eat her? You get the picture. <br /> <br /> Before the alien eats his boyfriend and accepts his identity, you will see her in the body of Alex Meneses. This Mexican / Ukrainian beauty is the only reason to watch this basket. Stay on the stage in the shower and on the boy and continue your activity.
