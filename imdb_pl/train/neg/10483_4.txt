I saw this movie in flight American Airlines west. It was so bad that it really seemed that the flight was longer. The plot had potential (who would not love the movie about a woman who accidentally kills every Elvis creator she meets?), But she broke down a million times by very bad writing. At the end is an embarrassingly evil scene in which Elvis's gang of counterfeiters is on the roof of the casino, sending the sky, thinking that he will come back, then a group of stars moves together to form a constellation of "Elvis", which immediately shoots a thunderstruck with the players, sending them smashing on the roof. Bad ... REALLY bad. What is the theme of the whole movie? I would avoid it at all costs.
