Only PPV did it. I do not want to waste too much time because most of the posters present it better than ever, but I wanted to say a few things. <br /> <br /> I did not know which was more fun: Redgrave chased a tiny moth and stumbled over his nurse; A close disappointment that her "precious" boy (whom she and the master decided to be a drunk loser) was turned into a road killer; that the dull tone of Ann schmoozed with Peggy Lee; or the terrible CGI of Crypt Keeper Annie staring at her younger self! <br /> <br /> I never bought Danes as a younger Redgrave. I did not buy Richardson and Collette as sisters. If the daughter of Meryl Streep wants to become an actress, better let her mother give her some lessons! I had no idea why any girl (or Buddy) would make fools over vapid stud du jour Harris! Ann's daughters are as timid and thoughtless as she is, Luc is a delayed slacker on crack, and I did not let me rot! The evening gives Chick Flicks a bad name!
