Disney's Golden Age of Era died in the late 90s. This Quack Pack program should not even be considered duck DuckTales, because the show had nothing to do with DuckTales. It's about teenage Huey, Dewey and Louie, who trouble their uncle Donald and talk in hip-hop slang and are fully dressed as opposed to DuckTales. I prefer small adventures of nephews from DuckTales. There are people in Duckburg, and ducks are the only animals living in Duckburg. There are no references to Scrooge McDuck. The stories are repetitive, the story is boring, but the animation is good. If you want a lot of slapstick humor, I recommend it to you. If you want to have a better Disney show, watch "Darkwing Duck" or "DuckTales".
