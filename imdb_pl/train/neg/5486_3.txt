First of all, this movie starts with a really stupid note: a 10-year-old girl, playing in a moving vehicle, decides it would be fun to cover her mother's eyes with his hands, and then causes a terrible accident that kills my mother .... duh .. ... I'm sorry, there is no positive 10-year-old who is stupid. The rest of the movie does not look better. After the death of her mother by apparently the stupidest 10-year-old on the planet, my father moves his family to Genova in Italy, where he is to teach at a local university, but here he is a clinker: he does not speak a word in Italian! Then the little girl has "visions" of mummy (which she killed) and often the next night's horror, which always end when her father holds her and pampers her. Then we are forced to observe how this family is constantly lost, then finds and then squeezes, then cries and gets lost, then finds (and then of course more cuddled and crying) to such an extent that I actually wanted some catastrophe just wipe out all those boring, ignorant people from the planet. Do not get me wrong because I love India, but indie stupid people (and I mean really stupid) is just ridiculous and pointless. It's really a pity that this movie was based on such insipid characters plunged in such delayed scenarios, because the place was interesting.
