This movie serves as a warning to anyone who thinks he can both write and direct his own film. Challenge yourself, you can not. Because in this way there is no one to tell you when you break into the big holes in your story, you have meaningless transitions, banal, unforgettable dialogues and you manage to turn a pretty cool Korean legend into a steaming pile of celluloid wheelbarrow. > I wanted to like this movie as a cheap popcorn movie, I really did; I like a lot of bad movies. But when I was forced to ask myself what the hell was going on and WHY, Dear Lord, WHY? more than a few times, I really can not take it anymore. <br /> <br /> Besides, I would like someone to explain how LA became Mordor in the last scene.
