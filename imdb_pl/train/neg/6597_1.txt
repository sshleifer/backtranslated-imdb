This is much worse than those horrible fairy tales from the 1960s. They were terrible, but at least they were the usual tricks of rebirth Stan and Ollie. The new viewers have rediscovered the comic genius of the couple, and the caricatures were repulsive debris, aimed at earning on the interests of children. This was to be expected. But how can you even try to rationalize this work ... I can not even think of a word. I'm sure the creators hoped that it would somehow inspire another revival of Laura and Hardy, but you can not inspire interest in the past with a shallow and tasteless caricature of what made the original so appealing. Impressionists (I hesitate to call them actors) are doing the Vegas act and that's where it belongs. The plot is even more capricious than those used in the old days, trying to get two drum ideas for the storyline. If this movie was someone's first exposure to REAL Laurel and Hardy, I'm sure that the viewer would reject the reputation of the original duo as a senile tap. The only movie I hate worse than this is I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE. And you know, those filmmakers basically did the same with Stan and Ollie.
