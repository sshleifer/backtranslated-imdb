It's a good movie for children who love dogs. Earlier, it works a bit slowly, but ends when the De Vil brawl appears. The basic theme is the same as the first movie. The bright side of the adult film is a talking bird who thinks he is a dog. The bird speaks like a man (Eric Idle from Monty Python) and barks like a dog. It's a comedy that the film needed more. See it in the morning, so you do not have to pay the full price or wait for the appearance of Disney.
