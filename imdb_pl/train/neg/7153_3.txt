In this movie there is a scene of about 42-minute sign, which is one of the worst I've seen for some time. When F. Scott Fitzgerald (Gregory Peck) and Sheilah Graham (Deborah Kerr) are lying on the beach, suddenly things become tense, and Sheilah begins to cry - at this moment tells the lover about his dirty past. This "dramatic scene" becomes so terribly exaggerated and histrionic. Nobody experiences such moments - no one. Whatever part of the movie is real, I can not say, but this particular moment was ridiculously bad and as false as Rolex for $ 8 - and leads me to assume that some other reviewers were right - the movie is sooo. However, I am not an expert on the lives of these two people, and the internet probably did not explain it either. <br /> <br /> Who were F. Scott Fitzgerald and Sheilah Graham and what was their relationship? However, what I know about Fitzgerald seems different than what I saw in the film. Was he a kind and decent person whom we saw in the film at first? Well, considering he was married at the same time as he continued playing with Graham and drank like a fish, I assume he was not. Was he so unbearable and gruff as we see later in the film? Maybe, but if he was so bad And Mrs. Graham stayed with him, it made her a complete mannequin - not someone you'd like to see in the movie. And if not, then the film badly serves his memory. Anyway, it caused a painful and not very pleasant experience while watching. <br /> <br /> The sum of this movie seems to be a tale of two not very nice or healthy people. In a dark and gracious way, some may find it very funny, but most will certainly consider it to be a train wreck with no surprises! Unpleasant, but with shining production values ​​(especially music that was beautiful, but exaggerated) raises the question "why they decided to do it in the first place?". The main thing - it's a pretty bad movie all around and probably is not worth your time - even if, like me, you're a big fan of Gregory Peck.
