OK, a slasher movie. very, very stupid slass movie. <br /> <br /> We have your stereotypical teenagers at home. We have an FBI agent who saw Dirty Harry too much. "So what's the secret ... punks?" We have about 4 different small shots from the camera and scenes that make no sense at all. "Hey man, I fix the sprinklers" ((this guy was my favorite part of the movie)) Suddenly there is a preacher bound on the couch watching home movies, he dies. follow the killer in the middle of nowhere, without the cops. she is suddenly in the church, wearing a wedding dress. I swear it's the stupidest movie I've ever seen.
