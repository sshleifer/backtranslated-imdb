Revolutions always create opportunities for dramatic films, because in reality most of the revolutions are dramatic events in themselves. Unfortunately, what is missing in this film compensates for excess boredom. It does not care about who wins, loses, dies or lives - just finish it as soon as possible. This is largely due to the superficial use of background technology. Scenes from Paris and the French village have the quality of cardboard. They can be better done on the bare stage and left in this way. You can not expect the amazing effects of "The House of the Flying Daggers" or "The Golden Compass", but in the end it is a digitally mastered production from 2002. Characters seem to enter the stage due to entering the stage, so that the number of times the hero goes in and out of the room is lost. In my opinion, this film transforms the French Revolution of the 1990s into a paper-mache revolution in the world of colle paper.
