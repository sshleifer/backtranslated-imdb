You must give some points for the pure courage to write a musical around a history lesson, but what about some decent music? <br /> <br /> Was the drawing acting of Howard DeSilva aimed at arousing the interest of otherwise tired children? <br /> <br /> Will the contemporary (for now) style of acting by William Daniels refer to the demographics of the 60s / 70s. <br /> <br /> Do we need all "jokes" about NY and NJ? (I hear a blue-Italian audience on Broadway waking up on call.) <br /> <br /> Excuse me, I think the whole song is outdated, boring and works too strongly on the screen
