Shiri Appleby is the sweetest little incarnation of evil transformed into a good girl, kicking the demon Buffy, Elle. But I'm ahead of you, you see that Lilith was the first woman God created as a companion of Adam. But she got the whole bad feminist, so God banished her from Eden. The secret order known as The Fath intercepts it, but it does not kill, so now with amnesia (which is not so well explained) Lilith (now Elle) can be said Buffy-clone who has to fight a mad scientist who got a blood injection Lilith. <br /> <br /> If the previous paragraph sounded horrible, it is because it is. The film is also boring, general, and for a movie with a plot steeped in theology does not seem to know about it. This poor movie in the CGIed cellar was the obviously unsuccessful pilot of the series. All I can say about the fact that it has not been received is Amen. <br /> <br /> My degree: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Commentary by writer / director Bill Platt and co-writer Chris Regina; and picture gallery; video effects samples: before and after (it also has a "also available" choice, which THINK would lead you to some trailers, but not on the DVD covers for other movies, which is a stupid idea) <br /> <br /> DVD-ROMs : Final scenario for recording and scenes deleted scenes saved in PDF format
