The first episode set the bar high, I thought. He appeared with William Hurt as an assailant who has a contract to kill a young man. We get very little information about his character or who pays him for killing, in fact the episode is known for his lack of dialogue. Returning to his modernist penthouse, he receives a pack with toy soldiers, which gives him a smile, but dismisses him and goes to work. But he is hell for the night, the soldiers are alive and have to wage war, jeopardize, shoot machine guns and bazookas, and even fly helicopters! The special effects are good for the TV program and become quite tense because it bypasses the flat, trying to survive, sometimes getting an advantage, and sometimes not. I will not ruin the end, but suffice it to say that it was a clever little phrase. This gave me hope for the rest of the series, but I was disappointed, the remaining episodes were rubbish and I lost interest in the fourth. Stephen King's adaptations are always mixed and are no exception
