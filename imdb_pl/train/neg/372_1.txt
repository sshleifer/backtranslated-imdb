I saw this movie a long time ago and I do not want to see it again. <br /> <br /> This movie tells about Preston Watersie, a hard luck that always seems to be overlooked by his family, who always seems to be poor in cash. All this changes when the bank robber crosses Preston's bike and gives him a check in the form of compensation. Preston uses a check to pay 1 million dollars from the bank (ironically, the money belongs to the robber who gave him the check). Preston then buys a property and says he works as an assistant to a mysterious and wealthy mentor, Mr. Macintosh (named after his computer). Then he just goes crazy with the money. <br /> <br /> It sounds like a great idea on paper. However, the screen is one of the most empty movies I've ever seen. First of all, it's too unbelievable. I know that some parts of the movie were supposed to be amazing, but I draw a line with a twelve-year-old boy going out with a thirty-year-old woman and a person responsible for a small fortune. It was also a shallow movie with poor acting, a predictable storyline and characters that are less than memorable. The characters were either bad, irritating or underdeveloped. But "Juice" was a funny character. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a good movie to watch with your family, skip this one.
