Joe Don Baker. He was great at "Walking Tall" and had a good share in "Goldeneye", but here in "Final Justice" all hope has passed ... The dark side has won. <br /> <br /> As with most people, my main experience with this was on MST3K and what experience it was! Mike and robots dig their claws deep into Baker's generous body and fry them completely. It's obvious that they were just starting with "Mitchell" on their anti-Joe Don kick, and here lies their continuation on the subject. <br /> <br /> It makes it a fun experience: there are plenty of riffs to choose from. My favorites - "John Rhys-Davies for sale", "This" Meatloaf: Texas Ranger "," none of them is spongy "," Why she was wearing a dress from prom to bed ", and my favorite -" "Son. .. "What? What was he son: the son of the TEACHER'S MAN? <br /> <br /> Same "Final Justice" is, as Joe Don says in the film, "big fat". But here it has some entertainment value. You have the chance to catch this version of "Final Justice". <br /> <br /> Two stars for "Final Justice". Ten at ONLY the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> Oh, and try not to visit Malta when Joe Don is in town.
