I saw this movie late at night on the cable and I could not believe how bad it was. I usually like bad movies, but this one was so repulsive that it was not even funny. Some of the most important events of this film are absurd music that constantly plays throughout the film, hideous special effects (when someone is shot with a laser gun, change color to neon green and quickly fall apart) and disgusting acting. Acting is what I feel, steals the show. I did not recognize any of the actors in the film and I hope that I will never see any of them again. In general, I recommend renting this movie (if you can find it, I can not imagine a video store with this trash) just so that you can learn to appreciate high quality movies after seeing this trash.
