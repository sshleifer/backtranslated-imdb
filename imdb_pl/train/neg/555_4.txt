The film is quite confusing and ridiculous. The story is awful ... but on the other hand acting is quite good, with a few good shouts and screams. This time, Sharon's stone is OK ... not half as good as the original mind. Murders are not as bloody as the first, which is a shame. This is not an unpredictable mess that everyone says. Sex is quite graphic, while others are clear that it is false (they are fully dressed). The scenario is weak most of the time, but the most important are scenes with jokes and arguments between Dr.Glass and Washburn. The story revolves around several times, but the ending is awful. The tension is always constant with a huge portion of "Oh my God!". The pursuit sequences are perfectly focused, and the shots and camera angles are impressive and bring a bit of class to another felt film. Sharon's stone is also a bit old. The pieces in which we see her breasts were delighted at first. This time they are too horrible to describe them. Movies that are rather average, but worth it. Mainly because the film deserves a good buzzing ... the opening sequence is the main attraction. Do not be critical, but if you liked the first - leave it. Do not ruin the run. You will be glad that you left this stone unscaled.
