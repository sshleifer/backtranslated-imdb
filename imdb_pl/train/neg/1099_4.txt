I was shocked by the ridiculously unbelievable plot of Tigerland. It was the liberal's fantasy what the army should look like. The dialogue was difficult to swallow along with the stupid things that the hero Colin Farrell was allowed to escape from his senior officers. <br /> <br /> I thought: "Hey, there is a reason why the training camp is difficult. he should equip soldiers in battle and transform into one cohesive unit. There is no room for presumptuous attitudes and people who do not follow orders. "I supported Bozz to kick him in the ass because he was dangerous to him. I would not like to fight alongside someone like him during the war because he was more interested in the feelings of people than doing what was necessary to protect his individual. <br /> <br /> - <br /> <br />
