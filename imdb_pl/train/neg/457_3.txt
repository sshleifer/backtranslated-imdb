Sure, I like short stories, but I did not like it. Of course, children would love it very much. But on the other hand, I am no longer a child (although I still consider myself young). <br /> <br /> I will tell you nothing about this story, for the simple reason that there is no history. How is it possible that this cartoon dragon has been nominated for an Oscar ?! Well ... I think that's because people in the thirties were happier with little than now. In the present, in which we live, everything must happen quickly. Now look at the films, and you will come to the same conclusion: we live in a society that does not allow people to be slow. It's really a shame. I would like to live in the thirties because it seems so peaceful. But every time has its ups and downs, I think ... <br /> <br /> In conclusion: if you like music (and frogs), you have to see this cartoon. Otherwise, do not pour out time.
