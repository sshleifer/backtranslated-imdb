The title should be a walker. The guy spends 90% of the movie. He does not know what he wants or who he is. Go through life, stealing people's identity for free. He does not receive any benefits, he has no money, nothing pretends to be another person. <br /> <br /> No body could understand why he was pretending to be someone else. in this movie it was clear that he loves his father and is a good son. But the rest was nonsense. <br /> <br /> Maybe a director, a looser one who would like to be someone else. But what he really should do is get a real job because after his film I do not think he has a chance to become a film producer.
