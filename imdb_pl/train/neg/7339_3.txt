Maya is a woman with no interests. He simply dreams about his life and wonders why he does not feel fulfilled. This may be an interesting topic. It would require a good story, nice scenery and good dialogues. There is none of them. This movie is completely boring. There are only lengths and no culmination points. The only highlight is Shahrukh Khan. But even though I'm his big fan, I could not stand this movie. Even he can not get out of this movie. The movie is not as bad as "King Uncle", and if you're an Art-house fan or you prefer, you might like it. It is not funny, it is not interesting, it does not catch. My recommendation: do not watch this.
