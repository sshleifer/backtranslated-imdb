We have a movie here about how chasing money and revenge can spoil your soul ... or something like that. Guy Ritchie, a director known for making a gangster genre, bites off more than he can bite with it. <br /> <br /> He used modern noir movie to deal with the topic of a man who becomes free swallows his pride, is kind to his enemy and distributes all his money. When Jason Statham's character is no longer afraid of Ray Liotta, he apparently drives Liotta crazy to tear his head off in the last scene. Why? Basically, you can not set up a mafiosi, such as the figure of Liotta, who probably reached his position in life, showing the kind of ruthless behavior visible throughout the movie, only when he led him to suicide with only a merciful smile on the face of Statham. <br /> <br /> Before anyone starts saying that I miss ... I'm not. I understand? Give up searching for wealth and you will find true happiness and inner peace. Be kind to your enemy, and this will fool him into self-destruction. It seems that this is the heart of the film and in itself is not a bad premise for the story, though not really original. The problem is that Ritchie simply does not have the ability to make movies. Even when Guy Ritchie is aware of this, he seems bored with history and begins to put in red herrings: A scene in which Statham is knocked over by a car - Why? Shooting some scenes as Marvel's comics ... again, why? <br /> <br /> There are so many loose threads and unanswered questions at the end of the movie. try to guess them or just accept that there is no answer, and each viewer will interpret things in his own way. Each other? I was so bored with the pompous tone of the movie that I just did not care. Honestly, the ending could not come too soon, so I did not have to sit down to this pretentious psychobabble. <br /> <br /> Loss of two hours of my life.
