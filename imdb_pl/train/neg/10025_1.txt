If it's a 2008 product. Coming from one of the largest production houses of the Indian film industry (Yash Raj), I'm afraid that we will achieve the right standards very far. <br /> <br /> If you can go wrong to this length with such an enormous cast star Anil, Akshay, Saif and Kareena, then making the movie is even harder to study by everyone involved in this movie. The film lacks almost all departments except for cinematography and Akshay Kumar. It has a few good dialogues to render, but this alone can not make you feel happy with huge expectations. <br /> <br /> The first scene of a car going down to the river from above has very cheap graphics, such as the one from an animated film. This was a clear indicator of the director's vision. Any actor who is otherwise an asset of the movie is simply wasted. Anil Kapoor's trick about trying good English falls most often. And Saif will certainly hit himself thinking why he signed the film. <br /> <br /> In short, THE LARGEST WASTE RESOURCE AFTER "JHOOM BARABAR JHOOM". I would say that even "Aaja Nachle" was a better movie than this one. <br /> <br /> You can not understand how and why this kind of script was written and approved. The most undesirable sequence was the retrospective of Akshay's love story. After the defective script, the weakest point of the film is his music. Vishal Shekhar only gave some melodies that filled every song. The songs start very well and suddenly the melodies fall drastically. Only one song "Falak Tak Chal" is somehow good from everyone. An opportunity wasted by Vishal Shekhar. <br /> <br /> As for the creators' continuity intelligence, just try it out: Akshay and Saif are on their way in the hilly terrain of a foreign location (probably Ladakh). In the next scene, they're looking for Kareena in Haridwar, and then back in the hills with Kareena in their damn car. I still think who wrote it. <br /> <br /> If you manage to sit up to the last minute, the culmination is too long with stupid and unnecessary acrobatics. You can see all the heroes going through the storms of bullets without hurting them, as if they were GOD. Do we still see the film from 2008 With all technical heights achieved? So there are no more words about this pitiful and inferior movie, but a sincere wish for older actors from their fans. <br /> <br /> Dear Anil Kapoor and Akshay Kumar, If possible, ask them to preview their videos after their first copy is absent. As artists with such an increase, you have certain responsibilities towards your fans and viewers. People are still clapping for you when you step onto the screen in the first scenes. I think this kind of film should not see the light of day, because it makes it difficult for all the people involved in the movie, actors and production house to be reputable.
