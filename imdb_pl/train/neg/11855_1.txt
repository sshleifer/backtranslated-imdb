This is one of those movies that appear on the cable at two in the afternoon to play in bored housewives while ironing. Acting is the second rate. Poor Mathew Modine seems to sleep through the whole movie. And God help Gin Gershon. Her accent is too high. It does not sound like a real Englishwoman. Sounds forced and false, just like her acting. She should stick to what she does best, a lesbian concert artist who plays in a rock and roll band and has a drug problem. Other characters are not better. They are two-dimensional. empty, boring and stupid. How should we care for these people? At one point Christy Scott Cashman dies in Central Park. Really? It is not difficult to get around Central Park. Just follow any path. Not only did not I care about ANY characters, I hated them. The only reason I stayed in this movie wreck was Fisher Stevens. Even his genius humor could not save this dying Fish. Each scene is a typical romantic comedy and nothing will surprise us. The script was horrible, as well as acting. If you catch this fish, throw it away!
