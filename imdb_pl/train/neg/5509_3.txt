When I was a kid in the '50s and' 60s, everything about Disney was by definition great. What happened? They are able to get all the actors and actresses they want, as best they can. But somehow Disney manages to screw up despite their abundant resources. <br /> <br /> Disney can afford the best writers, best producers and directors, but still ... spoil everything! This movie is crappy. The sad thing is that I suspect that Disney does not even know when the film is good or bad. <br /> <br /> Only thanks to the talent of the actors I can even give him 3 10.
