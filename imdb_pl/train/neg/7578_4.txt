"Superchick" (1973), suggesting no less than the movie version of the television hit from the 1970s, "Love, American Style", decorated with flashes of nakedness, is a light piece of fluff that somehow manages to entertain. And the main character here, Tara B. The truth is really a superchchem. Stewardess (not a flight attendant), who is so handsome that even the autopilot of her plane approaches her (!) And with a handsome boy in every port, this winged swing gal really puts a lay in a layover. What about her germ surgery in New York, her playboy with gangster problems in Miami and her creatively challenging rock star in LA, Tara is certainly busy. And when he does not suck these guys out of all his male energies, as the viewer learns, he can take karate lessons, clubbing at miles, repel murderers and rapists, participate in groove parties and stop the attempt to kidnap her. As I mentioned, happy fun and definitely good for the night when you feel a bit dead and just want to go out before the lamp. The future astrologer Joyce Jillson brings some empty charm to her role of Tara, and the movie looks pretty handsome to please. Disappointing fave of the 70s, Uschi Digard and Mary Gavin (aka Candy Samples), they are wasted here in very small roles, but they still can do what they do best - show their breasts! Although the picture is never too loud and does not have many thoughts in its metaphorical head, it manages to consistently play and I suppose it is something. Strange that the end credits should pay attention to Mrs. Jillson's double body; I do not think I have ever seen YES!
