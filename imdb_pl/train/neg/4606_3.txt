This movie was an attempt to enter places that most do not and should not go wrong. It was a similar attempt in the bizarre main issue we received at The Cell, though not as thorough and well-represented. The plot is built simply with an initial sense of campus. Then, when the film takes the alleged "dramatic" order, the plot breaks down into a few legs on which he had to stand. <br /> <br /> Basically it's about a child (Chris McKenna) who needs money. He plays the role of an assassin, killing an urban accountant. Then he does not get paid for his work, but instead he gets tortured for several days because he invented a "genius" idea to try to use the backup file he had as a leverage. This idiotic move trying to force them to pay him for being terribly and endlessly used. He starts going crazy (some very disturbing scenes). Then, thinking that he paid for his sins and could start again, he visits the wife (Kari Wuhrer) of the man he killed and gains her feelings. Soon after he discovers who he is, he strikes a tragedy, and revenge takes place in the air when the boy follows his captors (Daniel Baldwin, George Wendt, Vernon Wells) for their previous "kindness". <br /> <br /> I have to ask, what is Kari Wuhrer's and horroru / gore's films about? <br /> <br /> It seems that everything she has recently released is in this genre. I admit, I liked her in the "Eight legendary freaks" and she was fine in "Anaconda". But despite its obvious sweetness and charm (wow, it's hot!), It can work much better and choose better roles. Or maybe I'm wrong and it's just a misconception. For all who are there, you can see her "fully monty" in this movie, although it is rather bizarre and short-lived. I almost felt like she did a bit of soft-porn after watching this movie (something Kari's career is not foreign to). The simulation of sex is that you have to wonder what really happens during filming. <br /> <br /> In any case, I will say that there is some good game. Just do not expect too much from him from Daniel Balwin, whose career seems eternally meant to replace his brother Alex. The film features some of the great old characters, George Wendt (Norm from Cheers) and Vernon Wells (Commando, Weird Science). Above all, Chris McKenna does the best job playing the main character, Sean Crawley. His small acting experience, and at the same time his credible nature as na√Øve youth, introduce certain content to the film. <br /> <br /> I would not do it this way. If you're bored and you're tired of the same old episodes of The Hitchhiker, then maybe I'll advise you to look at it. <br /> <br /> And Kari, start working in better movies!
