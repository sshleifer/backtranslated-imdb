This is a big step after a surprisingly pleasant original. This continuation is not as fun as the first part, and instead spends too much time creating a story. Tim Thomerson is still the best thing in this series, but his wise description is subdued in this post. All performances are right, but this time the script fails. The action is just routine, and the plot is just a bit interesting, so I need a lot of stupid laughs to be able to have fun during the movie "Trancers". Unfortunately, the laughter is scarce and that's why this movie is at best possible to watch.
