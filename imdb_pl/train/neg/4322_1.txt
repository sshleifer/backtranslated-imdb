Read on and notice - you can save 88 minutes of your life (whether it's all!). <br /> <br /> Inexorable gloomy, this movie aims to create (I'm guessing) a modern town American Christmas tale in the style of Capra. If it fails .... completely and absolutely fails. I tried to come up with one good thing and I can not. Let me mention some of the most important events ... <br /> <br /> People do not die, they can spend eternity as immigrant workers in the Santa Claus factory. Angels are actually former cowboys who sit on trees. Saint Nicholas can bring people back from the dead (if you send him a nice letter). <br /> <br /> And the plot ... I will not spoil you, but in the movies there must be some light to contrast with the darkness, but there is none. Even photography is bleak - the snow shows up at the end of the cold, everywhere it looks cold, humid and unhappy. <br /> <br /> As you can guess, the movie has a happy (schmaltzy) ending. What a relief!
