"Transylvania 6-5000" is an insignificant but sometimes funny and charming parody of horror movies from the mid-1980s with some very famous names in the cast and a handful of real laughter scenarios. Two of the journalists of the gossip tabloid newspaper are sent, against their will, to Transylvania to tell the story of the alleged return of the frantic scientist Frankenstein. In the film, you can find some lovely details and details, such as a small hard-boiled egg-cutter and laboratory test tubes that are used to apply cream and sugar to the breakfast table. A healthy film is not as successful as it could and should be, with jokes and parody situations that are too long. The production of Roger Corman "Transylvania Twist", which appeared four years later, is much more fun and recommended. The film is especially a parody of classic Universal milestones from the early 1930s, so you'd better make sure you've seen them if you want to capture all the small gags and references. There is a fairly original phrase indicating that Frankenstein's character behaves like a crazy mad scientist when he enters his laboratory. It also turned out that he is actually more of a messiah than his father Damien, who only cares about the state of exiled monsters. Michael Richards, a freaking guy who plays Kramer in Seinfeld, appears as a psychotic butler who appears and disappears at the most inopportune moments. I'm sure the character of John Turturro in "Mr. Deeds' was inspired by Richards's role here.
