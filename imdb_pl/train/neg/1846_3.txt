Well, I like to be honest with all the recipients I bought because of Kira's sexual scenes, but unfortunately I have not seen them too much. All sex scenes were short and accidental, along with all the strange and simple music in the background, like all other B films - it just does not look like two people having sex. At the end there is a small conspiracy - Kira's new lover is a killer. Whoa !!! how shocking !!! Why do not we nominate this film for an Oscar? I can not imagine how bad the movie would look like if it was rated by R (Mine is imported from the UK, it was rated at 18). Proposal? Put it down and go away, so you will not end up with a moron like me. <br /> <br /> Result: 2/10
