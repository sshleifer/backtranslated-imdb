The title says it all. "Tail Gunner Joe" was a tag given to a senator who was based on the ignorance of public opinion about aircraft from World War II. The moving rearward-facing guns consisted of a latch that would prevent the rear shooter from firing at the tail of the aircraft, preventing the gun from firing when he pointed to the tail. When the senator practiced on the ground one day, he managed to shoot down the plane's tail. He could not do it if the gun was properly set. The head of the headquarters responsible for this publicly admitted to the camera that he was responsible - he made a mistake, not a senator. The fact that the film did not report this fact shows how unilateral it is. This movie was designed to do one thing, destroy the reputation of a complex person. <br /> <br /> A much better program was a special PBS program. He was a hardworking, intelligent, ambitious politician who overcame extraordinary vices to achieve extraordinary heights. He made several mistakes, some serious mistakes, but shooting from the plane was not one of them. <br /> <br /> The popularity of this movie is due to the fact that the public likes simple stories, one-sided stories, so that they do not have to think.
