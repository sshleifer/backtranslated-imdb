Of course, "Flatley" is no longer the perfect name for a dancer, but I think Michael really pushes an irony envelope with this new title: "Feet of Flames" <br /> <br /> You really can not resist the Desenex Foot Spray command for going away Retired (and clearly ill) Flatley. <br /> <br /> I can add that just like this cheering crowd in London (for the review below), I'm also an enthusiast that it's his last live performance. <br /> <br /> "Suggesting that this may be his last live performance, Flatley is applauded by an enthusiastic crowd in London." ~ Perry Seibert, All Movie Guide
