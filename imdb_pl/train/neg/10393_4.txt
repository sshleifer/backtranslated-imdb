Okay, you have: <br /> <br /> Penelope Keith as Miss Herringbone-Tweed, B.B.E. (Backbone of England.) She died in the first scene - it's true, people; this concert has no backbone! <br /> <br /> Peter O'Toole as Colonel Ol 'Cricket from the First War, and now an outstanding Lord of the Manor. <br /> <br /> Joanna Lumley as an ungrateful lady of the Court, 20 years younger than a colonel and 20 years from her own first-rate, but still charming (British spelling, not mine) enough to have a boy on the side. All right, they have the full knowledge and consent of Colonel Cricket (the guy even comes "for Christmas!") Still, he's thoughtful enough to tell the colonel that he told her boyfriend of his age (what a gal!) <br /> <br /> David McCallum as the boy-toy mentioned, as just as senselessly charming as his squeeze. Pilcher could not think of any cover for him, so she gave him a quiet job in Circus. <br /> <br /> and finally: <br /> <br /> Susan Hampshire as Miss Polonia Teacups, venerable director of the venerable girls' dormitory, serving tea in her office with a bit of deep, moving advice for life in the outside world just before graduation. Her best advice: "Once I was at Nancherrow (the local Stately Home of England). I thought it was very beautiful, but somehow it is not part of the real world. " Well, we can not say that they did not warn us. <br /> <br /> Ah, Susan - time has been, your character would run the whole concert. They do not write them anymore. Our loss, not yours. <br /> <br /> So - with cast and scenery like this one, you have a remake of "Brideshead Revisited", right? <br /> <br /> Wrong! They took these one-dimensional support roles because they paid so well. After all, acting is one of the oldest temporary tasks (you call it another!) <br /> <br /> The first warning sign: a lot of backlight. They move, shooting outside - "hey, it's just sunlight!" <br /> <br /> Second warning sign: The leading lady is crying a lot. When she does not cry, her eyes are damp. This is the law of Romance novels: "The Leading Lady" is "dewy". <br /> <br /> From now on Leader will be known as LL <br /> <br /> Third warning sign: LL actually has stars in her eyes when she is in love. Even so, I will give Emily Mortimer only the reward that she must act in the spotlight in her eyes (I wonder. Did they use contacts?) And finally the fourth warning sign: no screen, the female character is "Mrs. "It is either" Miss "or" Lady. " <br /> <br /> When everything was said and done, I still could not say who was chasing anyone and why. I could not even tell you what was said and done. <br /> <br /> In conclusion: everyone lives through the Second World War without anything that happens to them. <br /> <br /> OK, at the end LL states that she lost her parents in Japanese prisoner-of-war camps, and my sister comes home in catatonia. In the meantime (there is always "in the meantime") some young boy LL fell in love with himself (when, I do not know) he returns home from some difficult place during the war and is found on the street by Lady of the Manor (there must be a little street, if SHE finds him there.) Both war victims are escorted to regain their strength at Nancherrow (EVER must be "kicked out") WHAT are these romances!) <br /> <br /> A great drama.
