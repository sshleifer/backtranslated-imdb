Doc Savage: A bronze man is a terrible movie. Poorly written, exaggerated and just stupid. That said ... it is a really nice movie at a certain level. This movie begs you to watch in a group with a lot of cheap beer. This is one of those films like "Santa Claus conquers Martians" or "Yor, the Hunter from the Future" ... so bad it's almost okay. If you have the right group of people, this movie is great to watch. These are camps. That's funny. It has a Sousa theme. If you're looking for a good movie, look somewhere else. 3/10. <br /> <br /> BTW, I heard rumors that some studio is investigating the remake ...
