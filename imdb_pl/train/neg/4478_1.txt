I did not expect too much of this movie - a fun little entertainment. Wichrowe Wzgórza can be transformed into a credible, modern history - nice and soapy, melodramatic and intriguing. But this movie decided to throw away the talents of people involved in a simple version, so diluted from the source material that it was amazing that they had the courage to even call it Wichrowymi Wzgórzami. This ignores the fact that it is a story about people who are essentially unlike themselves, usually unpleasant and often cruel towards themselves. He changes the very nature of certain characters - for example, Isabelle in the novel did not have bone in her body - deprived her of blind idealism and turned her into an intriguing whore. Heathcliff is a terrible person who mentally tortures most people on his way, but in this version Catherine ends by leaving his daughter under his protection. Dialogue is trivial and one wonders how the actors managed to deliver it with straight faces. In place of depth or real emotions, we know that they mean something when they shout at someone's face. I read the criticism of the early 1990s version of "Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights," in which Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche performed, saying that she had turned an intensely dark, gothic story into a clumsy corset. Some correct comments, but the MTV version goes a step further, using the basic structure of the story to deliver slimming tramps on the beach, drawing to really bad music.
