He was not only annoyingly listening, but he was not kidding. I swear that some cool Asian guy telling your mommy jokes would be more fun than Leary's shit. (Well, maybe it can be fun for a few minutes, but at least I'll be able to laugh at least once!) Leary said he stopped taking drugs during one of his "jokes" ... apparently he was still on something high; he was just some fluttering persecution, mainly drugs. One of his jokes was: "I would not use crack, especially with the same name as between my ass" - Oh man, how did he come up with it ?! I swear that the only guy who needs to shut up is Denis Leary. Thank God I did not have to watch him live. This guy is totally sucking. <br /> <br /> If you easily play with curses and "jokes" in which you can come up with something for yourself, then waste your time on this trash.
