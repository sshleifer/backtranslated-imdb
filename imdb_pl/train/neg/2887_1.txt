I just watched the movie today and not only that it is terrible and horrible, but it looks like the director has joined several friends to make a film about a sick man. I also think that this movie has the appearance of a pornographic film with a clear, sharp, filmed view. <br /> <br /> Thank God I work in a video store and I did not have to pay for it because this movie is nonsense x infinity .. DO NOT BUY OR RENT THIS FILM !!!!! You would have a better time watching Dude Where's My Car than this piece of nonsense! And that also does not say much about this film. <br /> <br /> Acting is poor, and the movie is simply unobservable. I watched this movie and wanted to kill myself during and after the film. <br /> <br /> I came home and vomited after seeing this piece of dirty film, then I took a shower and burnt my clothes. <br /> <br /> If I had any doubts, I would take a film outside and burn it, because no one should be subject to it ... maybe Al Queda members ... especially those we have guardians, and also rapists who they are in prison on imprisonment without parole.
