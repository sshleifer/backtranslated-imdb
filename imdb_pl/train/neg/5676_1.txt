This video shows a clip of animal mutilation that has been chopped by a machete and torn from the skin. I know these horrible things are happening in the world, but I watch movies based on the fact that what I'm watching does not happen on the screen. These clips with live animals are not supposed to be in movies, they have to show people who belong to certain organizations to help terrible things that people do to other genres. <br /> <br /> It should be banned and destroyed. I also contacted Netflix and other resources to collaborate on making this movie available on the market! <br /> <br /> This movie should be removed from society. The person who created this movie needs psychological help.
