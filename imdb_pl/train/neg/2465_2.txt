It would be average Hollywood viewing if it had a good editing. It is based on a typical American thriller - "who will outsmart everyone". Acting is below average, but with the shining appearance of a detective who is the best actor in the film and is mostly responsible if the tension in the film increases. The film was completely suppressed by empty video and sound clips, and most of them look like raw footage. In conclusion, if you do not mind watching a movie that looks like a student film project, it's a movie to watch. I think it would be enough to say in this movie, anything else could really screw up the voltage that is probably low enough.
