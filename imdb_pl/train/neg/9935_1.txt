Completely defeats me, why Godard is treated so seriously - and One Plus One is a perfect example of his ineptitude both as a filmmaker and as an "intellectual" polemist. It is hard to admit that Godard really believed in all this Marxist and Maoist chant. Anyone who has half the brain can work out the bankruptcy of these "isms" and how many people have destroyed and continued to destroy even when Godard made videos of them. As a filmmaker, ask yourself: do you bore readers who read the arduous political diatribes of their recipients, and then, when you can not think of anything else to do, put on another reading for the first voice, which in any case lost its listeners after the first 100 words? Brilliant, Jean-Luc! As for Godard insisting on making a film with Rolling Stones: of course he did; truth? It was the only guarantee of seeing such thoughtless trash at first glance: the genius of Stones outshining the gifted and mumbling political idiot relaxed by the camera. The scene of the bookstore was not worth even the worst theater in the margins and was an insult to the intelligence of even the young children who were used to it - which could be easily seen. Withdrawing, letting friendly critics claim that all this senseless nonsense was a satire in the mainstream of film production, is nothing but a safe way out to offer those who clearly see the poverty of intellect and arrogant disdain for its recipients. It's ironic that Godard's one-time friend Truffaut, from Nuit Americain, created the best movie about filming in history, and Godard did the worst of Le Mepris! By the way, Godard did not choose the song "Stones" Sympathy With the Devil. It so happened that it was the song they were working on when the film began to shoot at Barnes Olympic Studios.
