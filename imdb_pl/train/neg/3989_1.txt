Who in their right mind plays a lyrical song while presenting an emotional scene between two people? When Flipper confronts his wronged wife in the locker room, the song sung with lyric content is as loud as dialogue, so no one can hear it, weakening the emotional impact of the scene. The scenes from Annabella beaten by her fists, the lamp, and then the belt were so cartoonish that it was absurd. The whole movie is a cartoon, raging prejudices against whites are literally amazing. The discussion of black women after the flipper's wife learns that he has betrayed her with a white woman - as if it were a discussion of the Oxford discussion team, she is ridiculous. Raging racism can be bearable, but the soundtrack and sound mixing during this "movie" is too much. It was a poorly made film. There is no understanding of the basic craft of film making, soundtrack, editing and the desperate attempt of great actors trying to keep the film on the surface. In fact, I felt sorry for Anthony Quinn, wondering why he took on the role in this movie - his appearance is painful. This is the first movie I've seen this director and it will be my last.
