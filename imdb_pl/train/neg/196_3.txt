This film is flawed on many fronts. Like many of the earlier, he presents the Alamo mythology more than history. Production is poor, overall it feels like a social care project for many actors who would otherwise have to work on Hollywood Square. For me, it was the biggest drawback - I know the ages and general features of the true heroes of the Alamo and the geriatric team of television actors chosen to represent them, never allowing anything to come from credibility. <br /> <br /> As a native Texan, I grew up in mythology. Later I found out more about history. I can accept decent production from every perspective (though I prefer more historical accuracy), but it never gave me the chance to enjoy it. Even the versions of John Wayne or Fess Parker had more life than this clumsy mess, and at the same time were a little less accurate. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing - avoid this.
