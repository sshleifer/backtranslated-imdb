The movie was "OK." Not bad, not good, just OK. If there was anything else in the theater, it would be definitely overlooked. Unfortunately, Fast and Furious 2 also stink, but I'd rather see it than FF2. :) If you have a fetish for a harrison ford or another young punk, it will be a "sweet" movie for you. Personally, I would be waiting for HBO or Blockbuster.
