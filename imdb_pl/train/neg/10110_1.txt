This movie was by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life. I'm not even kidding. It was badly done and the actors could not act. It was a waste of my time and money. It looked like a movie that my friends and I could connect together. The case in which the film appeared is definitely a disguise. Nothing in the movie looks like a zombie on the front. It looks like the director or make-up artist simply put under the eyes of a black liner and called them zombies. Subtitles at the beginning of the movie take up almost 20 minutes of the movie. Which watching the subtitles was the best part of the movie. It was a really awful movie and I could not believe how much it was put together. Scenes jumped from one thing to another, and sometimes it was like "what's going on?" The sound was horrible, and the action shots looked like a pair of teenagers joking about creating a fake battle scene. <br /> <br /> IF YOU are considering renting or buying this video, I'd advise you to at least watch the trailer because it shows how awful it really is. It is a pity I would not see him before I rent him.
