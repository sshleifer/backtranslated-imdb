This film was made in a very bad taste. The script was really bad. I am very sorry about the late Gregory Peck, who took the title role in the adaptation of B's ​​film one of the greatest generals in history. The film was politically incorrect and even insensitive to others who fought against the Japanese in World War II. There was a scene in which I almost vomited, showed Macarthur in a bunker on the island of Corregidor, talking to soldiers like an experienced politician, when one wounded, one-legged Filipino soldier meets. The soldier bleeds and dies, manages to sit up straight at the sight of the general and says "no papa, no mother, no uncle alone", and Macarthur gives his little talk that the Americans will "never abandon" the Philippines. The scene ends when the soldier is animated by the words of Macarthur and gives him a clever greeting. I mean, if there was a more condescending scene depicting the United States as the great white savior of the world, please tell me because this one takes the cake. It turned out that the Filipinos are in danger of being unfit for honor and must rely on the great Americans solely for the purpose of redemption. It blatantly and deliberately overshadowed the contributions of members of the USAFFE (United States Armed Forces of the Far East), these are Filipino volunteers who were included in the US army during World War II who died side by side with the Americans fighting against the Japanese who went side by side with Americans during the death march in Bataan and defended the island of Corregidor, starting a guerilla after Macarthur went to Australia with the famous speech "I'll be back". My late grandfather, WWII veteran and USFFE soldier was one of many who fought with the Japanese with honor and love for their homeland. I think this film will not honor them, nor the thousands of others Macarthur relied on, preparing an interview for his famous return to land at Leyte Bay.
