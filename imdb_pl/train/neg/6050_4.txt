I just can not believe the number of people who compare it with the first movie. That made me leave this comment! It is simply an obvious attempt to earn the success of the first film. Dialogue is frightening and nothing is as authentic or compelling as the original movie. <br /> <br /> The story is ridiculous, the portrait of the French police is funny and Doyle's character a mile from the first movie. br /> <br /> How many drug bosses do you think that you will go to the docks personally to see the parcel? The ease with which Doyle finds his man is simply pathetic. Like all the French police, she just drank coffee until Doyle came out of America and did the REAL police work. What a joke. Try to go to a foreign city and discover the largest hiding places in the area using the travel map and tourist brochures. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> A really horrible sequel, everyone who thinks otherwise is crazy.
