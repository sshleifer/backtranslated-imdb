I love Dracula, but this movie was a complete disappointment! I remember Lee from other Dracula films when I was younger and thought he was great, but this movie was really bad. I do not know if my youth has deceived me in the belief that Lee is the ultimate Dracula, with style, appearance, attraction and evil under it. Or maybe this movie disappointed me. <br /> <br /> But can you imagine Dracula with a snobbish English accent and body language to come to terms with it? Do you like when the story contains unrealistic heroes and is boring and free of any tension ..? This is a movie for you! <br /> <br /> Otherwise - do not look! I gave him only 2, because somehow I managed to stay awake during the whole movie. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but if you liked this movie, you had to be sleep deprived and be alone at home in a dark room with a lot of unnoticed space behind you. Maybe alone in your parents' house or in a strange home. Because even the characters in this movie did not seem scared, and I think that sums up the whole thing! <br /> <br /> And maybe you like this movie because of its place in the history of Dracula's cinema, perhaps fascinated by how Dracula's History has evolved from Nosferatu to what it is today. Because the movie is not so appealing, it does not attract you to the evocative secret that makes the vampire myth so fascinating. <br /> <br /> And, in addition, it has so much of this cheesy 70's. The landscape looks like a cheap theater. And I'm not saying that I reject everything that was done in the 70's. Because I can love the old movie as well as the new one.
