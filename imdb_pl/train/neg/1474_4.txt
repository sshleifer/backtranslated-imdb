** SPOILERS ** A little mockery for a television movie is the sexy and medieval gold digger Isabelle Collins, Susan Tucci, making a number on every man he has contact in the movie. First they win with hearts, then with wallets, and then, when they do not use them anymore, they are thrown into the waste bin like used Kleenex tissue. <br /> <br /> Isabelle's first victim is different than her abusive in stopping Isabelle from invading his bank account, her husband Stewart, John O'Hurley. She's in the movie later, when Isabelle is very friendly with a former plumber, and now with the yacht salesman Richard Davis, Philip Casnoff, that she, without really telling him, has Richard's love contract for the life of an unsuspecting husband. The capture of this former convict, in fact, as soon as he is released from prison, Daggett, Nicholas Campbell, to do a job at Stewart Richard soon learns that he did not get exactly what he paid, $ 15,000 in cash, too. /> <br /> A bit too greedy Daggett not only blew out Stewart's brain, but took a solid gold watch that Stewart also offered him to javelin his life. The watch was easily followed by Daggett, who tried to set him up at a local jewelry store where he was quickly arrested. With Doggett spilling over whoever hired him to hit Stewart, it does not take long before the long arm of the right arrests Stewart, employing Doggett, the husband of the killer Isabelle, to be a plumber and a yacht dealer, Richard Davis! Davis' arrest by the police takes place when he and Isabelle marry in the local church! <br /> <br /> Isabelle manipulates everyone, only men, who fall on her feet in their favor, getting them to do her dirty work. Always playing the role of a naive housewife, widow or lover, or even Isabelle's client, it seems that he lives in a charming life always one step ahead of the law and the police. No matter what she does, Isabelle covers her so nicely enough that it's almost impossible to pin her on anything, in the case of others, to the many crimes she commits in the other party in the movie. <br /> <br /> After moving, figuratively and literally, her first husband Steven, her second husband, for less than ten seconds, Richard and finally her, or Richard, advocate Gavin Kendrick, Kamara De Los Rey, Isabelle knows it's only a matter of time before the police understand her. Thanks to D.A, both Richard and Kendrick turned the evidence against her Isabelle, knowing that everything is coming fast, making the last move. By doing everything right, by transferring all of her cash abroad, Isabelle and her 10-year-old daughter Ruby, Lauren Collins, are shooting at the passport office to get a permit, passports and get out of the country. <br /> <br /> It's when the curse and clever Isabelle commits her first and probably last and fatal mistake in the movie. Isabelle was informed by the passport official, Don Carrier, she would have to wait 48 hours and Ruby's passport to clear herself! Enough time for the police to find her and arrest her! A bizarre ending that is contrary to almost everything and any ethics that is in the film noir or crime movie. A termination that will not only break your mind, but also your concept of what is good and bad in the world!
