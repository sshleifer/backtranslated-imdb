The film starts with scrolling text that lasts almost five minutes. It gives a basic summary of what is happening. This could easily be done with acting, but instead you get the text scroll effect. Soon after you get bombed with figures you learn a little about, remember that you'll find out EVERYTHING about them. The story begins to break up and then goes through the whole movie. The story not only changes, but you can even ask yourself if you are watching the same movie. I've never played a video game, but I know people who have. From my understanding of whether you played this game or not, this movie is no better. Save money, unless you like to sleep in theaters.
