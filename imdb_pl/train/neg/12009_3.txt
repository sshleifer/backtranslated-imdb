I had a movie about it. And I think it was my fourth attempt that I was able to watch the whole movie without sleeping. It is slow, and the idea of ​​the Mid Atlantic platform, which could have been revolutionary at the time, is now simply a great big yawn. Aside from Conrad Veidt, the rest of the cast is quite forgotten, and it's only in action at the end that things get really interesting. When the water began to spill, she woke me up once. <br /> <br /> But give me the due amount. No one could hold a cigarette like Conrad Veidt. He does not push it between index and middle fingers, like smaller mortals. He holds it in his fingers, showing us old pearl browns. In this movie there are several scenes in which smoke rises to the sky on a dark background and looks very artistic. But he does not say much about this film, if everything that impresses you is tobacco smoke.
