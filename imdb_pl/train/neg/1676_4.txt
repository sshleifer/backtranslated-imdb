Val Kilmer, solid performance. Dylan McDermott, solid workmanship. Josh Lucas, solid performance. Three very engaging actors giving decent performances. The problem is who cares about the conspiracy? John Holmes. He is infamous because of his benefits, a drug addict and a guy who, despite being infected with AIDS, continued to create adult movies, simply does not make an intriguing figure. <br /> <br /> History surrounds events leading to and the aftermath of the brutal mass murder that took place at the end of the 1980s at Los Angelos, with which Holmes was tied up, arrested and accused of murder, and who eventually was acquitted. As in the case of OJ, the guilt factor, regardless of the result, fluctuated quite high in the "He did it" zone. <br /> <br /> No one can sympathize with this movie, just as everyone is a selfish criminal. There is nothing interesting here.
