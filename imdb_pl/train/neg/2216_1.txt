I'm a lover of B movies, give me a genetically mutated bat and I'm in heaven. These films are good for you to stop thinking about everything that is happening in your world. Even the stupid B movie usually makes me laugh and I still think it's a good thing. Then there was Hammerhead, who was so terrible that I had to register with IMDb so that I could warn others. At first there was the science of creating a shark-man whose film barely touched. To make the viewers interested, they made sure that every few minutes there is blood. During one attack, the camera moved away from the attack, but you saw what was obviously a bucket of blood thrown across the stage to inform you that the attack was bloody and the person probably was dead (what great special effects). Coming back to science, I thought it was very interesting that the examined women were kept naked, and the research equipment required them to be monitored by breast tissue. Anyway, this movie had a bad story, a horrible story, and I'm sorry to say it's bad. Even William Forsythe, Hunter Tylo and Jeffrey Combs could not save this smelly one.
