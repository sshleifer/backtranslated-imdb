I absolutely hate this program, what kind of people are sitting and watching this junk? OK, my father and mother love it, but I make sure that I'm out of the room before it appears. It's so depressing and gloomy, but the worst part is that I can not stand all detective programs like this, because the detectives are so wooden and heartless. What happened to the detective programs with a real secret? I mean, who wants to know what happened to the fictional characters we know nothing about, that he died more than 20 years ago ?? I would like bbc to put up more comedy on bbc1, because now, when vicar dibley has finished, there is more room for such nonsense.
