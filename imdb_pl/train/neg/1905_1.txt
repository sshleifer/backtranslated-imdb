I am one of the biggest fans of silent comedians and probably have browsed more Buster Keaton movies for IMDb than any other person. Every movie that he made from the beginning of his career to the early thirties, with two exceptions, I reviewed, so you can say that I am a big fan. For this reason, I found this episode painful and difficult to see. I loved the films of this man and I kept thinking "Buster, how could you ?!". Well, now that I think about it, I think I can see why Buster Keaton played in this horrible episode of TWILIGHT ZONE. He lost a lot of his fortune after a messy divorce in the early thirties and his film career as a leading man has long since passed. Now, in the 1960s, Keaton needed money and loved reviving popularity, so he turned to anyone who wanted to pay - he appeared in movies on the beach and messing up the episode of the big series. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem in this episode is that it's just terribly written, and Buster deserved a lot better. The play is meant to be fun, but it is not, and instead of paying homage to silent movies it is simply painful to watch - especially with Keaton putting on this stupid helmet for time travel, as well as with all badly made slapsticks. Do yourself a favor, SKIP THIS ONE - it's a pale imitation of size, which was once a career of Keaton !!!
