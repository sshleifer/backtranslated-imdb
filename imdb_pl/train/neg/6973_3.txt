I never even knew that the movie existed until I found his old copy of VHS, hidden deep in my dusty horror cabinet. The title on the box says "Insect", and the illustrations on the back explain that this is another, unimportant and badly produced horror of the 80s. Of course, they can be fun if they do not expect a smart scenario, and until you get annoyed by the huge amount of cheesy makeup effects. Almost every important aspect that makes horror worth watching is below the standard in the "Blue Monkey"! The story is absurd and highly unoriginal, the performances are painful to observe, and the total lack of tension. Following the popular trend of big-bug movies, "Blue Monkey" deals with a new, unknown species of insect that destroys the doctors and patients of a distant hospital. The creators could not be more inventive when it comes to the actual origin of this gigantic oversized critter! We only know that it does not come from outer space and at first crawled out of a tropical plant. Besides, there is absolutely no explanation where this new type of insect comes from! As I said, do not put your hope in an intelligent scenario. The first half of the movie is fun enough, with a bit of nice blood and the introduction of some mad characters (80-year-old blind and alcoholic lady!), But the other half (when the whole hospital is quarantined) is terribly boring. The end is coming that the "Blue Monkey" is beginning to exaggerate the older (and better) movies. Approaching the climax, they were clearly out of the budget, because the lighting is getting very weak, and the guy in the monster suit is no longer well masked. "Blue Monkey" is worth watching if you are really bored or if you really want to see the horror of the 80s that has ever been made. Cinema B fans can recognize John Vernon ("Killer Klowns from Outer Space", "Curtains") in the small and meaningless role of Roger, who runs the clinic.
