Mary Pickford becomes the leader of the Scottish clan after her father's death, and then she has an affair. As another commentator Snow Leopard said, the movie is rather episodic at first. Some of them are fun, such as Pickford whipping his clans into the church, while some are just there. In summary, the story is weak, especially the one from the reworked imaginary plot line and its culmination. The transfer is so dark that it is difficult to appreciate the scenery, but even considering this, it does not seem to be the best work of director Maurice Tourneur. Pickford and Tourneur once again collaborated in the slightly more accessible "The Poor Little Rich Girl", giving Pickford a childish character.
