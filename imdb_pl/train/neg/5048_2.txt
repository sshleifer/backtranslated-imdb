I tried. I really did it. I thought maybe, if I gave Joao Pedro Rodrigues another chance, I could enjoy his movie. I know that after seeing FANTASMY, I felt sick and almost disgusted with the core, but some reviews were pretty good and favorable, so I wanted to say, "What the hell. At least you did not pay $ 10 on the Quad. Give him a chance. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it is better to go to the dentist and ask for a root canal without prior anesthesia to relieve the horror of such a great pain. I often wonder if it would be better to come back to my childhood and ask my former pursuers to really accept me. On other occasions, I often think that the world is really flat and that if I swim far enough, I will not only go away, but I will fall, and that some bad thing Lovecraft will kill me with my 9000 tentacles and squeeze life - and a few fries from 1995. while still in my esophagus - from me. <br /> <br /> Is there any reason for Odete? I would say that it is not ... just maybe her Creator thought that writing a story focused on her madness (the one that makes Alex Forrest look like a strawberry cake) looks not only scary, but also sick to the bones. Above all, he decides to leave his current boyfriend (screaming hysterically) because he wants a child and he thinks he is too young. Then breaks the homosexual's funeral and - take it - to get close to him, pretends to be pregnant, getting involved in the life of the mother and lover who died in the worst way. Oh, of course, he screams like a banshee and throws himself not one, but three times good on his grave. And this is a funny undertaking that gradually becomes "Pedro", which sums up some weak, like bad-explanation of tea, that love knows no sex. Or something. <br /> <br /> I would say it is as nutty as a can of cashew nut, unsalted. But then the director. And me, for a chance. At least men look good. Besides ... not much else to see here.
