... then they will have the right place to put this shit. I am sorry, and not "secret", as it was claimed, is a religious mumbo-jumbo. I waited for the "unimaginable evil" that was promised to me, but the "evil" in this movement would be unimaginable only for a five-year-old with learning difficulties. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that they actually managed to find a few bigger actors who wanted to take part in this embarrassment. Unfortunately, my opinion about them has changed forever and I will probably avoid everything they do in the future. I am also a bit upset that I now have the name of the writer and the director's name, which I have to remember, because I now avoid everything that likes plague. <br /> <br /> It is really unfortunate that all religious fanatics who publish here and say that this movie is 10 out of 10 etc. will first publish their reviews. This can lead to more and more people being deceived, just like me, to believe that this film is something other than religious preaching. <br /> <br /> Well, he's already in the video store to get the money back for fake ads. It is a pity that they can not give me 105 minutes, which I wasted watching this thinking that it was actually a Hollywood horror / supernatural movie.
