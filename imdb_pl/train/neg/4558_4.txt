Honestly, I was disappointed with the "expiration date". Super clever title and interesting assumption, but I do not think it will work. What was it about? The desire of the main character to reconnect with the roots of the roots? Or, more likely, it was his need to overcome the fear of death. But he was not set up as someone who lived his life in fear - it looks like his life was going well, but since the end of the doomsday is coming, he should start worrying. I did not buy it. In the meantime, the supporting heroes in the film did not seem to have any needs that would merge into a superior story. Everyone just did their thing, running parallel to the main character. What's more, what was treated as a "curse" looked more like a coincidence. Who cursed the family? Why? If? Finally, why did not he just plan to stay in his apartment all day long on his birthday? This is my criticism, but I loved Seattle photos, the photos were beautiful, the acting was good at times when it was not outstanding.
