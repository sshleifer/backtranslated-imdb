Extremely ambitious sci-fi by Kerry Conran, for whom this is clearly the work of love. Unfortunately, this is not so good. Everything starts well enough - with an epic yet restrained score, a combination of Lucas and Hitchcock style and Spielberg's brilliant cinematography. The film also refers to many sci-fi novels, series and films as diverse as: The Day The Earth, Stood Still, Superman, Metropolis, Planet of the Apes, The Iron Giant, Star Wars and The Spy Who Loved Me. The film is not as good as any of them for several reasons: the main goal is that it is such a love job, so interested in throwing everything on the screen and creating a bold new world, Conran actually forgets to make a movie. Tension, atmosphere and magic are not available here, even if there are no air battles, dinosaurs and races against time. Even the noir elements fall flat. However, this is a wide way of looking at things - these elements fail mainly because nothing is real and it is so obvious that the fake - green screen looks just like a video game in the middle of time and it is obvious that the actors were pasted later. Actors also do not have much to do - Jude Law is wooden, Gwyneth Paltrow is annoying and stupid, Angelina Jolie is wasted - and all because of a horrible scenario - a kind that must explain almost everything. It's a decent experience, and some may feel nostalgia, but ultimately it is a pointless step into the world yesterday. A nice ending.
