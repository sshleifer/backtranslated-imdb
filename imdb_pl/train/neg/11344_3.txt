Cinderella 2 and Jungle Book 2 have not moved me very much, but it's probably worse than both titles. First of all, I did not like the animation, very Saturday morning cartoon, only worse in some scenes. I liked some characters, namely Thunderbolt and Patch, but other characters like Cruella were mediocre. Cruella was truly villainous in the original, but she lost her quality in the sequel. What she said was nothing she could write about, and her animation was a bit ugly. Also her companion Lars was a joke to be honest with you, and Roger apparently quit smoking overnight. Voice talents were very good, especially for Barry Bostwick as Thunderbolt, with the exception of Jodi Benson. There were a few good moments, but the whole plot seemed bloated and I was suggesting extending the TV episode. In summary, the extremely disappointing continuation of the most memorable Disney movies from the 60s along with the Jungle Book. I'm sorry, I can only give you 3/10, it was not my cup of tea.
