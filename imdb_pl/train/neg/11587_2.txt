This is like the sixth movie. The film is really bad. He does not offer anything in the death department. One-liners are bad and should not be in the NOES film. Freddy goes out as a happy child throughout the movie. Lisa Wilcox is still the only thing that makes it worth doing. The characters are extremely poorly developed. All in all better than the sixth, but still one of the worst movies in the series. My rating 2/10
