The Priyadarshan / Paresh Rawal combination was previously gold with such artists as HERA PHERI and HUNGAMA, so I went to the movie (in the Indian multiplex) with big hopes, especially after the Slick promotions. Unfortunately, just like HULCHUL before, this film was a huge disappointment. <br /> <br /> Like other commentators, the creation of a movie that was already obsolete simply stretches without any development or additional layers. After a while, you just want the movie to end so that you can go home (if I watched it at home, it would be much easier to reduce my losses). Akshay Kumar's performance is mediocre at best, and John Abraham should not try to make a comedy again. The overall aspects of the comedy were pretty good. I only remember giggling like the whole movie twice. Definitely no belly laughter, which absorbed me in HERA PHERE, and even to a lesser extent in AWARA PAAGAL DEEWANA. Paresh Rawal had some of his expected classic moments, but overall, because his role and character did not have much room for development, he did not have much impact on the film. <br /> <br /> Neha Dhupia, who appears only in the movie, was happy when she looked at the screen. And some songs are fun. Especially the opening and closing pieces of the ADA and KISS ME BABY respectively. Otherwise, it's better to just pass this video.
