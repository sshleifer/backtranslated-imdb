I did not know it was a quiet movie with a narrative. I do not care about silent movies - bizarre humor, flickering lighting and film, etc. I'm sure it assigns the low score I attributed to him. It was more or less in chapter 8 before I became interested in this story and I had popcorn that I could throw on the screen. Maybe this is talking to the sci-fi crowd? Only the zombie and brain transplant scenes were missing. I went with two other people on a Friday evening and there were a total of 6 people in the whole theater. Isabella Rosselinni told about this film - the only nice aspect of the movie. Nobody commented how much they liked it, nor appreciated the unusual approach to telling this story. I can not recommend this movie.
