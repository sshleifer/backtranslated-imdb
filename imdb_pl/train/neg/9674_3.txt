This movie reminds me of really bad sci-fi movies from the 1950s and 1960s. It's not scary or interesting, but it's boring, tacky and stupid. Special effects are funny, all actors are funny and the ending is just awful. waste money, rent or buy something better. I give 3.5 out of 10 (I think this turkey was funny because of its stupidity).
