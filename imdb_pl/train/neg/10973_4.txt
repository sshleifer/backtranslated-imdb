If you loved "Pulp Fiction" and like hand-held cameras, you should love this movie. I liked this bizarre story (although I think that Pulp Fiction was the most discounted movie since The English Patient) and discovered that the characters are unrealistic but interesting. It is not "On the Waterfront" or "Citizen Kane" and is saddled with European pretentiousness. But the worst part is the hand-held camera. It is so distracting and annoying that I was desperately waiting for the end of the movie. I do not know why the new directors think that this method of filming is so great. If you are susceptible to motion sickness, stay away, the camera in your hand will make you feel sick in about 10 minutes.
