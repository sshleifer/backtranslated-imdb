I absolutely love the "Toxic Avenger" series, but this poor offer of Trom made no sense and kept yelling at me. <br /> <br /> The leaky nuclear power plant (and the growing weeds next door) makes the young people from Tromaville High go nuts, which makes them join the gang, have sex, explode and whatever. There is also some monster breeding in high school ... my God, this movie is a mess. <br /> <br /> The actors stopped and they should. (Intentional) abuse has started to get on my nerves for about 5 minutes ... <br /> <br /> Disappointing. 2/10.
