One of the most disgusting movies I've ever seen. I wanted to vomit after watching. I saw this film in the American History class, and the goal was to incite a farmer in the West towards the end of the 19th century. We saw pigs shot and then killed, human birth, branding. Oh, finally a live calf was born and I would say that birth itself was not so bad, but the many fluids that came out led most people to my bathroom class. The story itself was fine. The assumption of this story is the widow and her daughter, who move west to become the guardian of this cowboy. They live in difficult conditions and this is an interesting, quite accurate picture of life in the West at the end of the 19th century. But if you have a choice, do not watch this movie.
