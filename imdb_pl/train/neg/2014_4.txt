I remember how I loved this program when I was a child. I thought the helicopter was the coolest thing I saw. It was a super technologically advanced time. It can fend off the enemy's fire, do all sorts of acrobatics in the air and destroy almost everything. Now I come back and watch it today, and I'm surprised how bad this program is. The cast members are not very convincing, there are many bad moments, and the battle scenes are extremely fake. Almost every end has the same rubbish with the helicopter, obviously reusing the low-quality grain material. Many reports come from the Vietnam War. <br /> <br /> Airwolf has basically the same theme as Knight Rider, except that the vehicle to fight crime is a helicopter instead of a car. After watching a few episodes, I was completely bored. However, I love thematic music.
