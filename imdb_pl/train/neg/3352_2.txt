I do not even know where to start. "It's about family." This must be the worst line of dialogue I've ever heard in the movie "horror", although it can not be a horror movie, even if I try !!! Ugh !!! And I know Owen Wilson is a better actor. He must stop playing a token that dies in every action movie (Anaconda, Armageddon). In the end, the man co-founded "Bottle Rocket" and "Rushmore". He has some talent. In addition, Lily Taylor should stick to indie movies. There is no place here. Finally, Catherine Zeta-Jones should become a porn star. There is no place for it in legal operation. I'm serious. One of the worst movies I've ever seen, EVER.
