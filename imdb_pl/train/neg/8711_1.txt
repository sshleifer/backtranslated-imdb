OK ..... This is the third of a series of carnosaurs. Let us play with dinosaur puppets! At the beginning of the movie you can not see the reason Dino, when the body counts, you can only see Dino's sight, quite clever, to hide the evil dolls! and maybe within 16 minutes in the movie, a team of special forces with Scott Valentine as Rance's leader, the team enters the warehouse, then begins to look for part of the body and dead body after Dino's madness, after a while a big box of the band's defeat arrives you can hear the scream of a velociraptor, quite scary !!! and then the black girl goes forward, and now one charmer has been found! The predator's hand appears and crosses her face, but if you stop when the predator's hand appears, you can see that it's just a guy with a puppet !? WTF! The story is simple. 1. Some terrorist attacks on a truck cause that they wash some weapons there. 2. Where he is dead, ten tons of the raptor and one t-Rex giant appear! How was t-Rex fit? 3. Rance and some suckers will kill dinosaurs! Unfortunately, some stupid blond girl told him to catch one of them alive = (4. Saints Jesusi raptors have wheels on their exploits!) 5. Dino's is now on a boat in the Pacific 6: Strange, I did not know that t-Rex had strange thing on the neck hes? 7. THE END The movie is good if you want to laugh 5/10
