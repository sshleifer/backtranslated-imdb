This film begins with promise, with the early scene in which Frank Morgan advises against the marriage of Gary Cooper and his daughter Anita Louise. Frank Morgan, playing a stalwart gold prospector, complains loudly about Cooper's perceived penance at the hands of his family - including his daughter Anita Louise. I'm a fan of all three actors. Frank Morgan is (in my opinion) the Hollywood treasure, Cooper a legend, and Louise a very charming, versatile and underrated act rarely seen in the main role. I do not mind Teresa Wright, and although I'm not endowed with a great range, she usually provides warming performances. <br /> <br /> From a promising opening, the story moves down to the very end. I found nothing funny in burning the house of would-be Cooper's in-laws. A butler in such a fastidious, non-smoking home would never leave carelessly, allowing Cooper to continue smoking, or would surely provide him with some means to get rid of his unfortunate cigarette. What's more, no one with common sense would be allowed to keep a lit cigarette without asking for ways to get rid of it. And finally, no one in his right mind crushes a cigarette in a handkerchief and puts it in his pocket! The whole sequence made Cooper seem stupid and clumsy. It's a bad idea - badly conceived and filmed in a way that makes you laugh, not laugh. <br /> <br /> Cooper's forced medical examination is also invented. No one is allowed to undergo a full medical examination without informing him / her about the purpose or consent! That Cooper did it is too detached from reality to make it fun - it's absurd! The theft of children from hospitals is a serious legal crime, and it also has nothing to laugh at. Finally, the scenes of Cooper's too-picky, neurotic attention to the child's feeding and weight could hit the nerves of several people who had experienced fear of their own newborns. But for me it just seems boring and slow. In these scenes, the garment and props departments went to the top, and paradoxically the scriptwriter went to sleep. <br /> <br /> The lines are not in the script to generate humor. They just miss all the cylinders. Laughter comes not for a mile per minute, but rather for a light year's one minute. The only moment in which the movie has any energy or humor is the situation in which Frank Morgan is in the camera. <br /> <br /> The scene, which is completely wasted, appears when both Cooper's love interests and their fathers are locked in one hotel room together. Somewhere in this mine is probably a rich line of humor, but nothing has been extracted. <br /> <br /> In the end, one of the two very nice girls will be hurt. As you might expect, it is the character of Anita Louise, who is abandoned on the night of the wedding! Although it is not a camera, it is her fate and is not particularly funny - even as a loose end. In this movie, she did not do anything that would make me unpleasant (unlike Gail Patrick, say, in My Favorite Wife). Therefore, I was expecting (maybe "hope" is a better word in the context of the movie!), So that Anita Louise could also enjoy a happy ending. The fact that such a nice character is essentially erased at the end of the movie really undermines the "happy ending" effect for Cooper and Wright. <br /> <br /> I've been waiting for something that happened, a witty dialogue so characteristic of films from the era ... And never released. Good performance by Frank Morgan in a slightly different role is completely wasted.
