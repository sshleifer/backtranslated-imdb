(When will I ever learn?) An eccentric NPR reviewer made me think that this turkey is another Kane citizen. Please, let me give up my spleen ... <br /> <br /> I admit: the surroundings, probably New York, have never been so ugly and unattractive. I am reminded that the 1970s were a poor decade of men's fashion and cars. And all smoking! If the plan was to lower the price of the heroes, it worked. <br /> <br /> In order for the movie to work (at least in my simple estimation), there must be at least ONE nice character. Only Ned Beaty was approaching and I could not wait to finish Nicky. If Mikey hit a stray shot, maybe he caused the indifference to be touched the most. <br /> <br /> I do not remember when I hated the movie so much. I suppose I'm a rube who does not copy films from "art". Well.
