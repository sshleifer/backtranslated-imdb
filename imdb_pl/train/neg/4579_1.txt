"What the Bleep Do We Know!?" Was one of the worst times I've spent in movies. It was less a movie and more after school, but nothing special at the same time. The attempt of the narrative in which they based their ideas was absolutely pathetic, which almost everyone will say. Marlee Matlin in underwear just should not happen. I will not dwell on it. What I will reveal is criticism that many can not formulate. This film, although boring, also suffered a huge drawback in reasoning. It was terribly contradictory, because it required manipulation, becoming the creator of your life, manifestation of abundance, shapeless propaganda. Connectivity is explained as a large part of our existence. However, the film encourages us to control our surroundings with the help of our minds. It completely neglects that there are other people with minds that can control us, which seems more likely. Or at least the structures in which we exist limit us. In this way, the film was improperly solipsistic. Solipsism and interconnectedness are not mixed up unless you are an Almighty God. If so, you will be impressed (?!?) All the shapely things that this movie will reveal that you can do. If not, you'll be very disappointed, moron or maybe both. In addition, the title is so ridiculous that I can not warn people not to watch the movie because I feel delayed by naming him by name. Shame to everyone involved.
