Ever since Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon appeared, a lot has been said about the revival of the film industry in Hong Kong. Do not believe it. People creating films in HK give a new meaning to the word crass. Running Out of Time 2 is a great example. This is called Ekin Cheng, but most of the movie just smiles idiotically and throws a coin. He turns the coin over and over again. Why? Who knows? Sean Lau plays a policeman who is chasing a nice boy. But once again: who knows why? In a female role is a pretty actress who runs a company and has to pay a ransom or something like that, but it looks like she prefers to be in a spa or shopping center rather than in front of the camera. Nothing makes sense. There is no action. There is no sex. There is no comedy. Here's the name: Ekin Cheng. And you know what? Who cares?
