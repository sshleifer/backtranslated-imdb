I really wanted to like this movie, but it was simply impossible. Acting was very bad, the story was annoying and the pace was SLOW, sooo slowwwwww. I sat in the theater all the time and wanted the movie to end. Twenty minuets for movies and I pray for the ending. Sure, some visual elements were pretty, but come on guys, I mean really! And for a movie about a guy tuning magic instruments, there really was not much music. The music was annoying and boring. Sometimes there were also loud, penetrating sounds that were also annoying. Mainly this movie managed to bore me and at the same time crawl. <br /> <br /> I'm glad it's over. I have to go to "Tideland" and rinse this bad taste from my mouth.
