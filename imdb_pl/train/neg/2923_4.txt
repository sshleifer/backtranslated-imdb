The plot was quite interesting, with the background of the Russian revolution. I also enjoyed watching Budapest because the film was partially filmed. Unfortunately, there was no chemistry between the two main heroes, so it was difficult to believe in the story of love between them. The love scenes were forced and mechanical. Jordan kirckland was really stiff, almost freezing. Rob Stewart was quite charming and boyish, so she looked more like his older sister than his girlfriend. The ending, when we finally found out who was actually following them, was quite weak and did not make sense. I think that this film would be much better if the relationship between the two actors was a bit more credible.
