How is it possible that no journalist or critic reminded us of the similarity to the other Flemish film "Congo Express (1986)"? There are also characters in Congo Express who have no connection with each other: Jean, (de Congolees), a worker, two taxi drivers, a street singer, Roger, Guy, Lucienne and Gilbert. Of course Tom Bartender is a star, and Luc Gubbels is not. This should not be a reason to forgive the script's defects (if there is a script). In any case, the wind blows. Wit (the only one!) At the ice party in the fridge comes this amazing Flemish film "De Witte (1934)", in which De Witte puts too much salt into the potatoes. Accidents happen in the movie, but there is no explanation. Tom Bartender provides us with a film that is more like an experiment watched on television than a movie for theaters. Another missed opportunity for Flemish cinema.
