Seriously, the fact that this series is so popular just wakes the mind. This performance is not funny, it is not wise, it is not original, it is just a steaming pile of shit bulls. Let me start with the character. The heroes are one-dimensional morons with loud, exaggerated voices that sound like nails on the board. The voice could be better. Then there is the animation. MY God, it hurts my eyes just to look at it. Everything is too flat, too pointed, too bright and too covered with candy. Then there is humor or its lack. It's completely idiotic! They just take class B jokes, which are not even so funny, and then they repeat them to death. They also throw in a senseless nightmare which disgusts me. And finally, at least, music. It's just annoying. It sounds as if it was composed on a child's computer and does not generate any emotions. I would like the result to be lower than 1, really. This performance must be canceled. This is a program that I try to avoid like a plague. Whenever I hear a theme song, I turn off the TV immediately. If you have never watched this program, do not do it. Watch high-quality programs like The Simpsons or Futurama.
