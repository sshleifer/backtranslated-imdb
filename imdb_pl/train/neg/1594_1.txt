Wow. This movie bored my pants when I saw it. Colorless, aimless and immobile. <br /> <br /> Apparently, Ash and coworkers. can travel in time using "The Spirit of the Forest" (a lot of "Princess Mononoke"?) There they meet dorky named Sam and the "storyline" begins. <br /> <br /> So Tom (Ash) and Huck (Sam) grow out of nature, become hippies and try to free Celebi ("Spirit") from some weirdo-hunter. I do not even know what else was going on. Everything went in blur. Ash's friends were not in it at all, and all the battle scenes were boring. <br /> <br /> After saving the day, Ash and his infamous friends have to return to their time watching Sam flow away from Celebia (this scene was just terrifying. OO;) After returning to his time, Ash finds out that his new friend is actually a grandfather of a rival. And I think that's all. Pretty delayed, right? If you love your children, you will not expose them to it. (1 of 10.)
