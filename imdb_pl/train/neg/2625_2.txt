This film is terribly played, written, directed and produced. But it's so abundant that it's actually half-observable. This is SEMI that you can watch. <br /> <br /> The plot (whatever it is) is practically pointless. Barney Drum is the only real comic relief in a movie that gets tired after about 30 seconds. <br /> <br /> Many Canadian supporting actors can be found in TV commercials. None of them has come to anything that I know. And of course, even less talented brother Sly Stallone ..... = <br /> <br /> Trivia: It was filmed almost entirely in the small village of Claremont, Ont. (about 20 miles N.east of Toronto) I recognized many local landmarks / intersections / buildings. I think the "Drive-in" scene was filmed on the ruined "Oshawa Drive-in" just before its demolition.
