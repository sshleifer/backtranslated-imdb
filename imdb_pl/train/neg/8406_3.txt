Memorable line from a short performance. After watching the episode in which this line was introduced, my football team inside the brotherhood began using the line to break our clusters in the attack. Instead of Ready / Break, our quarter said that the FOOTBALL and the rest of the team replied: COMPLETE! A nice way to break the cluster, where our opponents scratched their heads, because not many of them watched the show. Using this line has added a unique element to our season, which I will never forget. We had the best season during my studies this year, and this to a small extent thanks to the fun we had from this line. The show was rather smelly, but lives in the memories of football team Pi Kappa Phi from 1977 in West Virginia Tech.
