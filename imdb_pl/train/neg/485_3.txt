When I saw the preview, I thought: it will be a great movie. And it could actually be like that. The actress playing the main character was very credible, and the beauty of the film is undeniable. Dialogues, however, cast a dark shadow on the whole picture. The level of language was too familiar and too contemporary for the action taking place in 1610 and took away most of the film's magic. I must, however, congratulate the translator, because the English subtitles were more sophisticated and appropriate than the original French tips, and probably explain the good rating of the movie received on the imbd!
