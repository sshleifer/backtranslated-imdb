Whoa. In the Twin Cities we have a station that shows "Big Bad Movie" from Monday to Friday. The block of tonight is a movie from Carrie Fisher called "She's Back" about a really annoying woman who gets murdered when the bandits break into her house. Bea (Beatrice) returns to visit her husband. He wants him to seek revenge on her assassins, hence "she came back". And he will not let him rest until he does. It annoys him endlessly ... and viewers! This movie is really one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Hey, but I like bad movies (my favorite movie is Xanadu). Throughout the movie, I really shook my head, wondering who thought it was a good idea for a movie. Bea is so annoying. The plot is stupid; the action is bad; history ... well, you have my drift. In any case, if you want to see a really bad movie - a really bad movie, check out this movie. You will not be dissapointed. Heh.
