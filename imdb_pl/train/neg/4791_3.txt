* spoliers * do not read further, if you have not seen this movie <br /> <br /> Lifting after depressing "Phantasm II" is over; The Tall Man kidnaps Mike, while Reggie and Tim's new kid spend most of the rest of the movie trying to get him back, and they do not end up as slaves in Tall Man's The Red Planet. This one becomes really stupid: the thieves' caravan in a bright pink caravan was just for comical relief, and the black karate stick (she does not remember her name) was so annoying that I could not wait to see if Tall Man had killed her character. This one seems to look like it is a character of Tim who comes late and is ultimately a hero, but ... it does not really work. At the end of this story, Liz gets beheaded by deadly dwarfs, Mike gets a silver ball implanted in his skull, spheres make Reggie and the dwarves get Tim, and there is no one who can stop the High Man. The bad guy wins - now how is it with the surprise at the end? <br /> <br /> The film was made in 1993 and it was not released until 1995, and the ending was final at the time and although it is disappointing and anti-climatic, it was also an appropriate and appropriate ending to this strange little series. But the fourth changes this ending and adds nothing new, but more bad jokes, and even worse and more nonsensical ending ... <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of ****
