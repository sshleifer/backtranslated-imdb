The plot was fine. Akshay Kumar was always good and that was the only good thing in the movie. Kareena Kapoor looked bad. There was a hue and tears above her zero size, but she did not look any better. I do not know why the hell Anil Kapoor took such a bad role. There was not much to do in the film for him. The fact that it is a Yashraj movie does not mean that the actor should accept the role, however bad he is. He said Ali Khan was fine. I think it is time for Indian directors and producers to start thinking about Indian clients as smart. What are we? fools !!!! What they think will show 2 men taking a SWAT branch to get stressed and we will believe them. Is the Indian police so stupid that they are trying to catch some criminals ... they are taking away a whole unit of 100+ policemen and no one was near the palace. The action was nonsense and I have never seen such bad actions. Akshay Kumar was between 30-40 policemen who shot at him ... and shot at them. None of the policeman's bullets touched him, but he killed all the policemen. Nonsense. CRAP. <br /> <br /> I think the combat director who thought about this scene should retire. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend NOT SEE THIS FILM.
