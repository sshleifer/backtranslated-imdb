Looking through other comments, I'm amazed that there are no warnings for potential viewers about what they have to expect by renting this trash. First of all, I hired this thing with the understanding that it was a competent dropping Indiana Jones. What I got was one of the most offensive movies I remember trying to sit down, the more shocking the relatively high production values. <br /> <br /> I do not think it's a spoiler, but if it is, be warned ... <br /> <br /> If your idea of ​​entertainment is that Bimbo is raped from behind by The frightening Tribal Chief, and she stares at the dead eyes of her significant other's head all the means, borrow this movie. If not, I advise you to look for entertainment elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Think about it, this scene so succinctly sums up the movie that I have nothing more to say about it.
