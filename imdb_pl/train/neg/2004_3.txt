I have read a book for a long time and I do not remember the story exactly, but I remember that I liked it. Because I'm sick on the couch, it seemed like a good idea and hey !! It's a movie for a lifetime. <br /> <br /> The film is filled with actors and B actresses. <br /> <br /> The female cast comes from Desperate Housewives. I have never seen this show, but there are plenty of commercials for this show and I get the gist of it. Is there nothing original anymore? Sure, but not for life. <br /> <br /> All men are fairly effeminate, look and behave, but the girls must have husbands, I suppose. <br /> <br /> In one scene a woman has problems with a man, for her life and what does she do? I'm copying it into the kernel. What else? Women love it, but let me tell you something ... It's not as easy as it always looks. <br /> <br /> It was not that bad. I got chills once or twice, so I have to grant credit to someone.
