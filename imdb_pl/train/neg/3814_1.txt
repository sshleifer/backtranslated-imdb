I see little girls enjoying this show, but calling this family show is ridiculous. I'm amazed how I remember it after all these years. It is an extremely unkind and stupid show about a widowed father of three who lives with his deceased wife's brother and his stupid school friend, and others over time. All plot lines usually have a very silly lesson. In the middle of each episode, someone is angry at someone else, and each episode they create ends with a light, unhappy joke. As for the actors, I did not like them either. Bob Saget was painfully uncomfortable like a father with her mother's duties. Dave Coulier is the only 30-year-old joke that makes cartoon voices and acts like a child, and he's awful. John Stamos was the most bearable hero, but he was so stereotypical that it was difficult to watch him. The oldest girl, DJ, in the series was really a bad actress and showed no emotions. Middle girl Stephanie was too banal as an annoying little sister. The youngest girl Michelle showed what bad actresses were the Olsen twins. You can always tell when they turn them off. The plot lines for too many story lines were so unrealistically stupid that they deserve to be angry. It is a "family" program that has tried to replace any good substance with acumen and love, and although they are needed to present about the family, they exaggerated too much with it. It will be remembered as my least favorite sit-com from the 80's and 90's. <br /> <br /> My rating: Terrible show. TVG 30 minutes.
