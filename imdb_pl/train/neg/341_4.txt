Oh, old man. If you want to give your inner Crow Robot a real workout, this is the movie that you will fall into the VCR. The potential of cutscenes in this film is simply infinite. <br /> <br /> (Small spoilers ahead of us Hey, do you really care if the film is "broken"?) Losing is a problem girl. Psychology has developed its name when a child develops sexual love with a parent of the opposite sex. But this girl seems to have one for the same sex, and I do not think there is a word for it. Maybe because her mother Dan is played by Rosanna Arquette, whose sweet, exaggerated sexuality and luscious character make me forgive her many bad movies or unpleasant characters. Here, Dana not only has no idea about her daughter's behavior; he seems to fight for the gold medal in the Olympic Indulgent Mother competition. <br /> <br /> It's possible that Dana skips the murderous streak of Traci because, to tell you the truth, Tracis seems to have criminal intelligence skills. Just because the scenario dictates that she manages to count every type of body. <br /> <br /> An especially funny note in this film is the character of Carmen, a Mexican maid described by Dan as a long-time like one of the family, although he is dressed in what the director said: "I just fell off a truck with a tomato from Guadalajara. " Carmen is so smart about Tracia that she can also carry the "Hey, I'm the next victim!" Indeed, Tracia confronts Carmen when Carmen comes back from the Mass and throws her in one of those slightly curved machine wrenches that car makers pose a spare joke. Rather, I suspect, than in real life, that these things are just as useless as the murder weapon, just like for a tire change. <br /> <br /> In another order Arquette wears a thin dress in the vineyard, under a cloudy sky, talking to the owner. Cut it in another thin dress under the sunny sky, talking to the owner's brother. Then, get through the first dress, in the first place, under a cloudy sky - but this should be later. You get a picture. We're talking about really bad directing. <br /> <br /> As for the skin, do not expect too much, although Traci has a nice pair of bikinis. <br /> <br /> For those who are looking for trash, 8. For anyone else, 1/2.
