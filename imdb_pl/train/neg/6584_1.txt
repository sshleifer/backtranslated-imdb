Being the only film that I could see at this year's Nordische Filmtage in LÃ¼beck, this year's festival will be remembered for me as low in history. <br /> <br /> This movie, which was announced as an erotic thriller, is nothing but sick shit! I apologize for the language, but there are no decent words for it. <br /> <br /> First of all, the actors are not the best. But even better actors would not save the movie. E.g. plot: after the first 15 minutes it was quite clear that John was ill, the neighbors were not real and that he killed his first girlfriend. The so-called "sex scene" was nothing but an abomination (hitting each other until blood flows for me, has nothing to do with sexuality), but unfortunately these were not the only disgusting images that could be shown. Everything else was copied by other directors, like Lynch, but of course without their genius. <br /> <br /> So to sum up the whole movie and save other viewers time and money: the guy loses the girl, the girl returns home, the guy kills the girl, then rages, the guy imagines hot but crazy neighbors, the guy has a very disgusting sex with one of them (or so he thinks), finally realizes that he is crazy, and his girlfriend and her new lover are still in his apartment all the time .. bad story, bad actors, photos that cause you to vomit ... <br /> <br /> 1 of 10 (1 point for knowing that you understand Norwegian well if you learn Swedish - at least one benefit from the evening - and you can not choose 0 points here).
