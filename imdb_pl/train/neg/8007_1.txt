Really, I did not expect this type of film outside of America. As everyone can take on the subject of sexual abuse of children and turn it into a "thriller" is simply sick. Auteuil (whom I've admired before) walking around like some rescuer Rambo was ignorant and offensive to all children sexually abused around the world. <br /> <br /> What is double depressing, the groundbreaking film "Happiness" appeared in the year BEFORE this film. Menges and his cohorts should be ashamed. It is worth reading some of the comments of more intelligent viewers. They were able to see the cheesy and funny service of this topic. Those of you who think that it is a great cinema, show disgusting ignorance and you have to watch "Happiness" to open your minds to the real horrors of pedophilia. <br /> <br /> Do you think that your child is more likely to be kidnapped and sold to sexual slavery or be molested by a neighbor, teacher, friend or even a relative? Hmm ... Interesting. If they intend to make a movie about international slavery of children of any kind, they owe it to everyone to make it realistic and emotionally engaging instead of pushing the buttons. 1/10
