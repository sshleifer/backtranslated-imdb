"The Omen 4: The Awakening" is a TV continuation of the original movie "The Omen". Instead of Satan, who has the body of a little boy, he has the body of a little girl adopted by wealthy parents who are persecuted in school and who will eventually take revenge on those who misbehave. The movie seems to struggle with any factor of horror, and many of the events that happen are simply stupid, not particularly scary, and it's hard to believe that this little girl is Satan, even with all the events that surround her. I just did not consider the film very tight and frightening, especially compared to the original.
