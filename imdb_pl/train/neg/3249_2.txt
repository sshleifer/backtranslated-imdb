Jim Carrey is one of the funniest and most talented comedians in the movie today. With his hyperactive spontaneity and rubber face, he can simply go crazy and we love him for it. Has the ability to create average comedies (ala Ace Ventura) and transform them into decent comedy performances. Or, in the case of "Liar Liar", make them one of the most fun contemporary comedies. Carrey also proved that he can deal with dramas. He was excellent both in "Man on the Moon" and in "The Truman Show." The guy is amazing. <br /> <br /> Then comes "Bruce Almighty," the ideal vehicle for Carrey and the assumption that should work; Carrey, complaining about God and how his life stinks, is possible thanks to God's powers. However, the script is a clean garbage recycling. Now, no matter how bad the script is, Carrey's improvisation sometimes makes the unpleasant scene funny. The problem is that Carrey has few opportunities to release, because most of the comedy is based on stupid special effects, only some of which are fun. Carrey rarely improvises because she has to go through special effects. The authors apparently thought that all of these special effects and superpower sequences are fun, because the rest of the movie is just a filler, thanks to which Carrey has nothing else to do except a weird character who is absolutely devoid of humor. It seems to be more like a 5-year longing for our attention, wanting the viewer to find what he's doing when it's really annoying. <br /> <br /> I always liked Jennifer Aniston in "Friends" and she was great in last year's "The Good Girl". She also has the gift of a comedy, but since she is so linear, she just gets a part of a bitter girl. It turns out that she is nagging, grouchy and there is no chemistry between the two stars. <br /> <br /> "Bruce Almighty" should be a comedy that works. But he does not even have the courage to deal with the subject he makes fun of; religion. A few small chuckles (his Internet is Yehweh), but instead he turned into a comedy superpower comedy. Not to mention that his tone changes from unwise to heavy and sometimes even black comedy. The film fails on almost every level. It does not mean that he is completely devoid of laughter, but he is close. Any film where you feel the need to include the pissing dog scene to make you laugh has problems. But hey, if you're laughing at funny jokes, try it. <br /> <br />
