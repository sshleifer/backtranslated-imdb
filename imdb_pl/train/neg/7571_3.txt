A woman (Miriam Hopkins as Virginia) chases Man (Joel McCrea as Kenneth) for her father (Charles Winninger as B.J.). The woman wants to get Man to invest some of the dead mother's money into her father's business venture; but my father is known for losing money for clever schemes. Hardly anyone knows, but the real villains pose as the best friends of a man to steal his fortune ... <br /> <br /> Production seems to be immersive, but history does not get involved. Players do not play well drunk. Known as Broderick Crawford's first appearance - as the gopher "Hunk"; in addition to dealing with matters, Mr. Crawford is nailed to the floor by Mr. McCrea. <br /> <br /> *** Woman Chases Man (4/28/37) John G. Blystone ~ Miriam Hopkins, Joel McCrea, Charles Winninger, Broderick Crawford
