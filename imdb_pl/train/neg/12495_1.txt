OK, I love bad horror. I especially like horror enough to laugh. Demonicus, or House of the Dead - these were bad enough to laugh. Severed was not there. <br /> <br /> It was worse. <br /> <br /> (spoilers - who cares?) <br /> <br /> My friend and I sat through the whole movie and I have many comments, both in the style of "it sucks" and in reality real criticism. <br /> <br /> Plot (sort of) - there's a guy in this city (probably Seattle, see comment below) who runs and cuts off his head. He's been doing it for over a year (I'm not going back to the exact numbers - thank you VERY), maybe two or three years. One head for a week. And the police IS NOW, calling a "specialist" (which ONCE refers to as a medium, but it never appears again). <br /> <br /> Schya is right! The feds take over THREE combined murders? After nearly 100th similar killing, we would be terrified during martial law !!!!! <br /> <br /> In any case, this "specialist" consults with a voodoo chick, which the police ignores all the time, and two of them comes to the conclusion that it is Baron Samedi, a voodoo ghost who cuts off his head to get enough power to become a body (and then probably take over the world - or just go to Disneyland). <br /> <br /> Um. <br /> <br /> Setting - where does it happen? Well, if you are not from Seattle, you may not be aware that the bar / rave (occupied by about ten film employees and members of their families) is a poster for a local radio station and that in a highly entertaining, "Pulp Fiction" esqe dialog ( like IF) between two cops (yes, those who cut off their heads for 15 minutes), discuss the "new stadium", which could still be a problem when the film was made. <br /> <br /> Being from Seattle, I'm sorry on behalf of the film and I'm embarrassed. <br /> <br /> OK, here it's getting really critical - being a horror writer (not published, do not look for my name in IMDb), I conduct research. A lot of research. And unlike the writers of this film, I know that Baron Samedi - while Voudon Loa (ghost) who guards cemeteries and is traditionally associated (by various Christian oppressors) with "Satan" - is actually a trick "Loki" God. <br /> <br /> In other words, do not cut off the heads. <br /> <br /> Besides, a large part of the Voudoun religion is that Baron Samedi can have a body whenever he wants. Their religious ceremonies are centered around having various members of the congregation by loa. <br /> <br /> Not to mention that if you already have someone, why create a NEW body? <br /> <br />, if Baron Samedi GOT a body, he would not go around cutting his head, he would get good rum and cigar and par-TAY !!! <br /> <br /> In conclusion, the only thing they did is that it is surprising that in completely unnecessary reading of Tarot cards (used only to show that the voodoo chick is "horrible") they have not screwed up the interpretation of the cards like the majority movies. I did the research again. (Everyone remembers the old night advertisement read by the telephone tarots - "Lovers - you will soon fall in love with madness ..." and all these nonsense?) <br /> <br /> If you have done so through my comments, congratulations. And I'm sorry again. I will be more sorry if you feel the need to watch the movie because of me, so please do not.
