To sum up this movie: Without a real story, the movie consists of 80 minutes of mad characters who drink or joke. Music is just awful, humor is not funny, and all female characters are weird idiots or total maniacs. It seems to me that the film was written by a 14-year-old boy who thinks that drinking is cool, women are designed to please men, and everyone against this view is geeks. In addition, the film has nothing to do with original American Pie movies, except for a few names and Mr. Levenstein, who has a smaller character in this form. The only good thing about this movie are pretty girls. Do not watch this video and do not be fooled by rating 5.4, because it is clearly overrated and does not deserve anything above 2.
