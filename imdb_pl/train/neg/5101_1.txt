The only thing that came to my mind after seeing this nonsense was that I would never get the time I was watching back. If you want to see how Stacey Keach and Michael Dorn try to earn what it must have been then, the down payment in the holiday home will stay on track. Wooden acting, weak special effects, the only comedy attraction was that our alien hero was in a feminine form and it was over, as soon as she made the obligatory sex scene with film recordings in 30 minutes. The ability to do what could have been a decent movie disappears at the moment Nicole Eggbert turns the stranger in the bar within 30 seconds, while the police, the army, and Joe's audience do not play with the coffee drinker and use the cup holder and carry four jumpers at the same time. Of course, it must come from another planet. Just where I would like to be when this movie was on.
