Recently I came across Nine Dead and read the current reviews thinking that I can deal with the average movie. However, this movie was slightly below average, but you can watch it. The script was poorly written, and the acting was medium at the level of film B with a pair that stood out as quite good. The plot borders on plot Saw, teach people what they did wrong in the situation and try to make life more appreciative, but in fact the comparison ends. Nine dead try to have a heart and a goal for simple ideas that are not new. The main drawback I found in the Nine Dead was a flashback to the viewer's face 3 minutes earlier in the movie and it was a completely unnecessary and totally inadequate ending that people would not see them coming in a bad way. With the exception of any spoilers, I've seen worse bad movies, and they have not even finished it badly. A decent move, bad acting and ending ...
