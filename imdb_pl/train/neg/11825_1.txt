This film is the blatant cruelty of one of the best novels of all time, Silas Marner by George Eliot. <br /> <br /> The details of the film shown on IMDb confirm the original author, but I did not see it at the beginning of the movie, only credit at the end saying "suggested by the book Silas Marner". He suggested? It was just a complete break of all the important elements of the story: <br /> <br /> A wronged and sad old man, a craftsman, poor and lonely, has all his money stolen. One night a child comes to his door when her mother dies on the snow outside. The man takes her and raises her until one day a local squire (or a rich politician) demands adoption of a child. He was the father of a child during an illegal romance years ago. Then there is the battle over who should have legal protection over the child. <br /> <br /> In this and in every other aspect of the film, the story is exactly the same. Only in one can I find the difference. Silas Marner had epilepsy - but perhaps this would undermine Martin Martin's acting abilities. Besides, he has dyed hair in some mixture of carrot juice (probably to look younger, but actually makes him look more like a clown, which he is)! There are also some pointless jokes that this unusual comedian can not resist introducing into a story that does not participate in it and only diminishes the depth of history. Like when the child is crying in court, declaring that he can only be happy with the man who sired her all these years. The film is conveyed in the film by a girl who uses a nasal congestion agent on the back of her nose to weep her! <br /> <br /> I am surprised that the legality and integrity of the film industry allow us to make such a film. If I were the trustee of George Eliot, I would insist on redress. If I was Steve Martin, I would send profits to this estate or to the poor. At least it should be titled Silas Marner - adapted by S Martin. Or better still remove from the archive! <br /> <br /> If you're interested in this story - and I hope you are - dismiss it completely and watch Silas Marner. Or read a book! The BBC has made a perfect adaptation in the 1980s.
