When a comedy movie can boast a great soundtrack on the back cover, you know you're not a top-class movie. I rented this movie with friends who expect giggles, but in general, most of our laughs made fun of the movie. We could not choose a worse movie. <br /> <br /> The movie could have been fine with a few changes. First of all, the comedy was painful. Physical gags were poorly made and placed. The fat kid in the movie made us want to kill him, bless him for trying the stage and the scene, but he was like a puppy begging for love. If it was pulled out of the movie, everything could be bearable. There were some funny jokes, I believe one of them when a group of boys stole one of the parent's porn videos and turns out to be gay porn. However, to best sum up the comedy, I will simply tell you about the gags for a fat kid. She wears a shirt stained with virgin and says she does not know when something is happening. <br /> <br /> Finally, the editor of the film was able to save the film by removing the fat kid, cutting out 20 minutes of school scenes and ending that lasts for more than thirty seconds of random quarrels. <br /> <br /> OH, BTW, there are two good elements that the film has. Kadeem Hardison plays his role wonderfully and performs his jokes so that nobody will miss them or underestimate them. The second redeeming element of the film is the beautiful Mrs. Ali Landry. Her character is ignored by most of the film, which is a shame. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time, even by renting this one. I did not like it and I was part of the target group (18 men).
