Why is the film about Cleopatra, the last phaoroh extracting the worst of the films? Regardless of the attractiveness of a woman for the greatest Roman of them all, Julius Caesar and his successor, Mark Anthony, never seem to appear on the screen other than the antics of high-school seniors in high school. Despite the sumptuous sets and costumes, this movie is just as bad as all Italian "sandals and gowns" from the 1950s. I must admit that this spectacular spectacle belongs to the big screen, that's why "Gladiator" went well, but "Gladiator" did not have all the sex with romantic novels. <br /> <br /> Miss Varela has as little acting talent as Elizabeth Taylor, but Timothy Dalton has a talent for saving. It is a pity that some did not wash on others.
