"The Return of Chandu" is remarkable, if you can say so, for casting Bela Lugosi as a hero, not a villain. Why does he even get a girlfriend. <br /> <br /> History as such includes the Cult of Black Magic Ubasti, who is trying to capture the last Egyptian princess Nadji (lovable Maria Alba) and use her as a victim as a means of reviving their ancient leader who looks like Nadji. Lugosi as Chandu, who has magical powers, tries to thwart the villains. <br /> <br /> Director Ray Taylor does everything in his power, with limited resources and rich footage. King Kong fans (1933) recognize the gigantic door that was used to stop the Congo in several scenes. Acting is mostly terrible. An actor who plays for example a high priest (I believe Lucien Prival) uses this inspirational pronunciation of a trainer that was so common in early gadgets. The less you said about the others, the better. <br /> <br /> It's a mystery why Lugosi accepted parts in independent fast races at this stage of his career, because at the time he was still a banking star at Universal. Maybe because in this case he had to play the hero and get a girl who knows. As his career began to decline in the late 1930s, this type of tariff became the norm for Lugosi, not an exception. <br /> <br />
