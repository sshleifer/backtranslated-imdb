I am surprised that everyone involved in the production of this series would indeed admit responsibility. The script is so indecent that it has to be written by someone who has not passed the entrance examination to the Canadian Union of Comic Writers (and that says something!). Take out the binoculars if you like, but nothing like a joke. Ronnie Corbett had to be broke to be humiliated by this trash. The rest of the cast is so devoid of any acting or comedic ability that I'm surprised that it lasted after the first episode - proofreading, after the auditions. I can only say to all those who have amused that they must be easily torn apart. And it is obvious that the production costs had to be 100 per episode. And in case someone thinks that I'm commenting as a foreigner who does not know English humor, I must add that I am really an Englishman.
