Baldwin really bent over to make such films. Scenario, music, everything in this film is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Sound effects do not really sound, stick out too far (tech gadgets, etc.) If you try to make a movie about such things, at least try to put up with it and drop additional sounds and sounds because these gadgets really they do not seem so loud. Natural sounds such as steps and such do not exist, which gives them an atmosphere reminiscent of emptiness. <br /> <br /> The director seems to be okay for such a low budget (I hope it was a low-budget production), although at times it seems quite amateurish. <br /> <br /> Most of the characters seem empty and false, they just did not throw the film very well. I imagine that a better idea would be to let Baldwin speak a little Spanish than to let Spanish actors speak English, when we all know that it is a language that is more alive and alive, which is why actors' performance can suffer very much if uneven language is used. I mean, can anyone finally realize how stupid it sounds to make international actors speak English with a bad accent? This should be a long-buried corpse in film production. The production team ever heard about subtitles? This film again presents the European police as lazy and corrupt, societies as vulnerable and helpless. I mean, if the plot is repeated again: "Interpol can not do Jack, so let's call one American to overthrow this international syndicate" or whatever. <br /> <br /> Sony Pictures follows the same path as Columbia before it is simply producing movies for hell. I would imagine that they also have a certain respect for themselves. Do buyers have to buy every dirty title just because Sony releases something good several times a year ?! Maybe they should use the same team that created Di Que Si - Say I Do. It is spoken in Spanish, and Paz Vega and Santi Millan do a decent job, keeping the film on the surface. It looks and sounds much better! Come on Sony, wake up, make less, sell more.
