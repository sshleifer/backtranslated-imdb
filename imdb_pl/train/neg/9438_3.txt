Have you ever watched a movie that lost its plot? Well, it did not really have a beginning. <br /> <br /> Where to start? Painful boring scenes of our heroine sitting at home, in fact without any sense of danger or even a bad feeling, created even during visible continuous storms (strangely never heard at home - wonderful double glazing)? The house, which is apparently just a few kilometers from the city, is a few hours away (?) Or a third girl who serves no purpose, except for providing a surprisingly quick bloody murder, just as boredom becomes unbearable? Or maybe even the beginning, which suggests a wave of more than 20 killings throughout the area, although it seems that the killer never ventures far from home? Or a bizarre ritual of salt and pepper, which mostly sums up the inherent direction of the film. <br /> <br /> Add the main actress who can not act, but at least she's ready to do something completely unimportant nude shower scenes and this movie is really nasty, but not the way you hope. <br /> <br /> The following passage is simply forbidden in the United Kingdom in the 1980s (mainly because of the final surprising chronic murder) offering only the value of curiosity - and one classic murder "daft" (do not worry - telegram at least ten minutes earlier). <br /> <br /> After a walk in the forest, our victim comes to a rather steep upward slope, which of course they are fighting for. Halfway down the road they see a figure on top dressed in black and waving a large scythe. What are they doing? Take off and run like the rest of us? No, of course not - they fight to the top and stand comfortably, nicely and simply in front of the murder weapon. <br /> <br /> It's really just a movie, they say.
