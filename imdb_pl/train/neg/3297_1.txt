Why show that millions of us have watched and loved as children and made fun of it? They ask why Hollywood does not make money. Because they pour out rubbish and pay actors a lot of money for being garbage, and they ask us to pay $ 10 to see their garbage. The television program was what he was, good people in bad situations, when good IL boys go out. It was not Gone with the wind, but it was fun. This movie is rubbish! Hollywood can not come up with anything original, so they take something that is good and ruin it for some money. I just hope that this movie will make 10x less than it costs. The only thing that makes you happy with this shit is the guys who ran General Lee. The audience is a victim. <br /> <br /> Do not look, watch the replays of the TV program. They still last 20 years later.
