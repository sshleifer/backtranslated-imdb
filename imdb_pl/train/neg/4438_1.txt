I borrowed this movie from the library, I think it can be delightful. How wrong I am! <br /> <br /> It's such a bad movie that I have to write something about it. Mira Sorvino is SO BAD in the film, watching this scene is very painful. She is a pretty girl, but in this film she is not at all seductive, but I will have to witness her awkward attempt to seduce almost all the other main characters. This is so absurd. <br /> <br /> And the dialogue of the film is so pretentious and lacks a humorous fact that makes it acceptable. <br /> <br /> A complete failure.
