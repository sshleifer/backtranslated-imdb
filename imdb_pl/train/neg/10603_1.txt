I tried to watch this movie twice and each time I still could not get to the final credits. The first time I was able to sit through the first battle sequence, and then I lost interest. The second time I managed to force myself to digest hours worth of shoddy action, lame SFX and a very bad direction. Pales compared to the original. <br /> <br /> Has anyone ever heard of the old ET Atari 2600 fiasco? For those who have not let me fill you. It's 1982 ... ET is one of the greatest box office hits of all time ... Atari decides to release a movie game on the 2600 console in the home system console. To shorten the long and painful plot, the game went on for a long time and resulted in thousands of thousands of Atari 2600 ET games that were thrown to landfills, because they could not even give them away, let alone sell. /> What does Universal Soldier: The Return have to do with this story? Look at rating 3.2 and see for yourself. <br /> <br /> An awful movie ... IMDb forced me to award him 1 in 10, because their rating systems are not as low as 0 in negatives.
