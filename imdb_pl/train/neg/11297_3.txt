Jenny Neumann (from the movie "Sexuality" MISTRESS OF THE APES, American slasher HELL NIGHT and others) is Helen Selleck, an American actress who plays the main role in Australian stage production. She is a virgin because as a little girl she saw her mother having sex, and then accidentally caused a car accident that killed her. Meanwhile, the killer in the black glove is circling the theater, cutting people with pieces of glass. <br /> <br /> *** MAIN SPOILER *** <br /> <br /> Helen is the assassin (she speaks with her dead mother's voice, rinsing blood from her hands after the murders and sees him killing child molestation with broken bottle like a little girl!), but it has the disinterested hard work of POV camera and hides the identity of the murderer to the very end, as if it was going to be some big surprise. <br /> <br /> The whole cast seems to be obsessed with talking, being or trying to get sex, and in one case even blackmailing your way to getting a folded one. There is some nudity and blood, but there is no sense of continuity, photography is muddied, and editing (by Colin Eggleston, who also wrote and produced the script) is terrible. The theater scene for the slasher movie is preceded by Soavi's film of the same title and OPERA Argento (both are better than this) by five years, and Neumann is quite hot.
