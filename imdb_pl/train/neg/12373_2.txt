The scenario is so funny ... it in turn makes the actors' lines sound stiff and unrealistic and you can not believe it. The phrases are repeated - "my sweet little daughter, divine" and small variations of this line that come to mind ... and it's just a careless window with a soap opera. <br /> <br /> What's worse, the music is so bad! In addition, the main blues theme is terribly peculiar and completely wrong. And it seems to be abused mainly because the instrumentation, texture and layout of the subject never change, even when the emotional context of the scene does it. <br /> <br /> Then, as soon as it appears, it protrudes like a sore thumb as the main transition from one stage to another. <br /> <br /> The music is dingy and it's as if the writer was writing soap or sitcom music - a Canadian sitcom with a low budget from the 80's - and that makes you feel like we've always been on the verge of quitting on advertising. <br /> <br /> It is so wrong that there is a lot of abuse and it's really a stretch that so many of these characters employ only ONE type of NY accent - a thick Bronx accent. I do not know if this is a matter of limited ability of actors to know * one * accent * NY, or whether it is a matter of the director's ability to notice such a glaring anomaly. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's an amateur scenario with lead lines that makes the whole "movie" ... a blow. When any basis is unstable and unstable, it is impossible to build it without flaws that manifest themselves in an exponentially more damaging and unflattering way.
