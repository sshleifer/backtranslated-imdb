A friend told me about John Fante last summer after we talked about Charles Bukowski. I did not know that Fante was a favorite writer of Bukowski - an author with a similar advantage and humor, except for one generation earlier. "Ask the Dust" is the first Fante book I read and remains one of my favorite novels. The novel was a brilliant magazine about a sad, scared young writer posing for himself and the outside world as a too confident, masterly talented author who had no idea how to write about real experiences he did not have. In the novel, the hero is a virgin, having no idea how to get women's favors, which he desperately wants to write in magazines. The story of his bizarre relationship with Camilla, how he sets up his first sexual experience with an "injured" devotee and how he finally stays with nothing, but the story of his failed attempts at love is biting and true, without touching Hollywood ending. The adaptation of the film remains faithful to the book for some time, but it meanders in a cinematic trap of love persevering through racism, illness and death. The heart of this story is that Bandini is a jerk, and Camilla is crazy, and their love has never been and never would have been real, no matter how much each of them would like to be in each other. This movie took away the true meaning of the story and replaced it with Schlock. I can not believe that the man who wrote Chinatown could read this book and make a film about what had happened so badly.
