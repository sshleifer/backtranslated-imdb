I was expecting a lot from this movie. Kinda like Lee as Naustradamous like caracter, but instead everything I got was a waste of time and a boring movie. I can not even explain this movie. He had a wooden acting, horrible scenario from Bible fragments such as hurricanes, tidal waves and earthquakes. But it was at the end! I had to wait the rest and hope that something significant would happen, but it did not happen. This film tells the story of a couple trying to discover changes in the world, such as places in China, where the earthquake occurred, and ends in a monastery run by eight nuns and a priest. The monastery becomes the key to disasters. The whole movie is boring and boring. One of the worst.
