With one of my favorite actors, James Spader, I expected that this film would at least be tolerated. There was no. After the first half hour, I watched the rest with the remote control in hand, so fast forwarding was ready. So trivial, so standard, you know what will happen in every scene. You can even predict word for word. It's one of those movies that makes one scratch his head and say, "How was the movie made?" To say something positive, I'll add that there are some fun special effects. But in general, if you've seen 5 Sci / Fi movies or are over 9 years old, do yourself a favor and skip this one.
