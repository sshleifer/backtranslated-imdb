I am not from America and I know what "wife exchange" is. When a program with this name appeared, I was delighted to see cool, sexy moments from the program. But I got real stupidity. I have been misjudged by its title name, it does not contain adult content, there are no nudity, even vulgar dialogues (the cast channel cast the Hallmark channel and I think they have edited / muted such content to organize it). > A demonstration that gives an image of the current American / Western family state, overweight plump peoples, polluted teenagers and their family sucking. In each episode two wives / two mothers were chosen (more correctly) to live at home and change each other's family routine with a new own rule. Sometimes it turns out that it is good or bad. At the end of each mother, they are brought with their husband and try to learn what they have done to every family in the last days. This is the sucking part of the program in which everyone fights for their rights. I was drawn in to see all these things, and not see some nice things for adults. I mean who creates this program, more than the one that gave the name "Wife Swap"; better to call him "mother." In total, spoils all the wonderful things that mean a real exchange of a wife! <br /> <br /> Wife Swap = medium sucking reality show.
