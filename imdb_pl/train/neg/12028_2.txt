I agree with everyone who has said anything that will convince you not to waste even short moments of watching this extremely amateur film. Very poor acting values, handwritten productions, completely pedestrian direction and script so inept and flawless that it should never have been written, let alone production. Even the Hollywood "professionals" apparently go to work only for payment, although no one should have paid for this bad job. Careers should rather COMPLY this irrelevant drift. <br /> <br /> OTH, there is something fascinating about watching something so slim. And Chad Lowe is horribly and consistently angry.
