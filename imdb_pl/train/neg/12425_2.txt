I do not know what you breathe in, but please stop. This movie was a complete trash. <br /> <br /> Macaulay Culkin as Kevin McCallister was sympathetic, charming, sweet, loving and extremely funny to watch. He had this innocence, but at the same time he was strong. <br /> <br /> This new kid, Alex? Annoying as hell! Just a glaring joke when trying to match the charm and grace of Culkin, disappointing about it. <br /> <br /> Villains, complete nonsense. Harry and Marv, they were such a fun band on the screen. They were comedic, they were humorous and it just made you really want to root out Culkin even more, what a good villain should do. These guys Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, absolutely PERFECT for these roles. On the other hand, in 3, we have 4 new idiots who just quarrel and try to exploit the charisma and charm of the first villain duo. Not claiming that they were terrible, but they were not memorable or even so funny. More about this site. <br /> <br /> Then we have real movies. Part 1 and 2, classics. Unforgettable. Perfect for watching Christmas and brings a wonderful Christmas feeling and brings out so much emotion. It makes you fall in love with history and take care of heroes. Simply, unforgettable and close masterpieces. Part 3? A masterpiece of nonsense. I said enough. <br /> <br /> Everything and I do not know why people like it. I think people really do not know what a good movie is. It's a shit sequel with unrealistic traps and a stupid new hero who I regret that robbers will not be able to beat shit at least. <br /> <br /> Run away, run away from this trash. And do not even start with part 4!
