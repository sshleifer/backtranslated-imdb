I have a nice collection of movies, and this has been added to it. Exactly the number 274. <br /> <br /> The title made me start from the beginning. University of Splatter. I thought it would be a great horror movie. Have I ever been wrong. Do not get me wrong, this is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it could have been a lot better. I love all movies, but this one was laugh than horror. <br /> <br /> Poor sound quality, poor performance and poor shot settings are just some of the areas that may have been improved. 3 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The movie is perfect for a good laugh. If you're looking for one of these movies to laugh at it, then this is one!
