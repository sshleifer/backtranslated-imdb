I did not expect much from this television movie. You have to set the bar lower than in the case of limbo for each TBS movie with Antonio Sabato Jr. Despite this, he managed to disappoint, even without being a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Each scene was as if someone in the scenario cut and pasted scenes from a dozen or so films and TV shows about big business plots, he leaned in and said, "My work is over." It's all trivial, all predictable, and even worse, the actors are forced to look like they take it seriously (even when the plot is ridiculous). <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor. Watch "X Files" if you feel like paranoia. They're better at it. Also, let everyone know that sitting by "Critical Error" is just that.
