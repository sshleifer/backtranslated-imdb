Amateurism best describes the film adaptation of the best-selling philosophical novel "Celestine Prophecy", which is the result of the spiritual awakening of a non-working teacher in a mysterious village in Peru. Actors of home-made video quality present so-called figures spewing the over-staged exposure and the metaphysical hokum, while the film is driven by the extremely heavy direction of Armand Mastroianni. Despite the apparent attempts to face interesting fans of stronger tariffs in vain of ABC "Lost" or "Da Vinci Code" by Dan Brown, filmmakers are not able to cope with this task. This film reminds us of ill-conceived spiritual propaganda of mass consumption, and the results are so horrible that few can go through this mess to see the real point.
