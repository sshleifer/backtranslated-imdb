It's so bad with this dark, wet fart of the movie that it's hard to know where to start. <br /> <br /> First of all, it is an extremely terrifying horrible movie, even according to Amercian standards. Dialogue is stereotypical, characters are two-dimensional, writing is noisy, and what a small story is neither cohesive nor remotely interesting. <br /> <br /> We meet the following stereotypes in the following order: A balding faced guy (probably divorced, but who knows? This movie does not tell us) with a brave heart, a Young Hero (who does nothing heroically), A brave little child (with a deadly streak wide by a mile) and Black Bad-Ass Bitch (with a larger salvo than the brain). These guys are taking on a constant fight against Tall Scary Reaper Man and his evil Evox. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the movie is full of bad little metal balls that revolve around menacing people. With a chance, they perform an improvised brain surgery in those who have no mental focus to look at when they come to them. Booh! Actually, one of them is haunted by a good ghost (but on the other hand, it may be a sneaky specter) who seems to want to help our Brave Heroes recover their young kidnapped friend. <br /> <br /> There is no character background or even an introduction to any character. It starts with some summary of the end of the previous movie, but that does not explain too much. If you've seen the first two movies, fine. Otherwise, you do not know who these people are, how they are related, why they do not go to school or work, or why you should worry about living or dying. Therefore, no. The only point of interest are all splashing effects. And there are not enough to wake you up. <br /> <br /> Potential interest / amusement is three punk raiders, just as stupid as bad, which threaten our heroes. But they do not have much time on the screen. They are almost removed immediately. Then they are buried (why anyone should spend some time, he is behind me) and then appear again as Bad Evil Slayer. Only to be demoted again, literally in a minute. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie consists mainly of Caspar the Friendly Spirit appearing and disappearing, driving in search of places and Balding loser trying to get som Bad Black Bitch Booty, using pickup lines that would embarrass the mentally handicapped teenager. There is no bone there; even unreasonable sex could not save the movie, so it's good that it's never there. <br /> <br /> The head of baddie, called Tall Man, can not scare anyone older than 3 years; howling "Booooy!" every five minutes is not enough. Why, thanks to its amazing telekinetic powers and the incredible strength of the upper body, it does not just crush our heroes, just as mistakes are not explained. Instead, he delegates work to his inept, delayed little minions who will never be able to kill anyone until they are shot to hell. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers who like masterpieces like "Friday 13th part XXXXVIII: Jason goes to college" find some entertainment. The rest of us who have developed pubic hair will be bored with our skulls.
