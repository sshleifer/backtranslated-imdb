This movie has recently appeared on local television in South Africa and I thought that I would like to warn even those who like watching bad movies in class B (what I do) that it is not even fun. The plot concerns a couple visiting a house in the country. Some strangers appear and ... The problem is that most of the movie, of course shot in the early seventies, consists of extreme wide shots of people walking in real time and terribly slowly, from point A to B. This makes The movie is extremely boring, and the expected payment of blood and blood never happens. I'm really curious - how many people really watched it from the beginning to the end?
