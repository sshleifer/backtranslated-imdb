I can not believe how unkilled this movie is. It's like watching a police academy, except for people who have no idea what they're talking about and ... Wait, there's a stupid robot to be a helper. I understand the suspension of disbelief, but it is simply total stupidity. Not only is there no story for this movie. It's like watching someone who pretends to be a doctor, throwing non-medical words, as if they were head of staff in a large medical facility. Plus, people wear clothes that do not fit into the space program. I feel like watching a movie "b" from valley girls in space.
