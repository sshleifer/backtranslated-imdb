Direction must be a problem here. I recently heard John Cleese talking about Fawlty Towers sketches. He was to attack his car with a unit. The first branch was too weak and not funny. The other branch was too stiff to be funny. The third one was so weak that it was funny. This attention to detail is lacking in "Corky Romano". No matter how ugly an obscene piece was, it was not repaired and was not left on the floor in the cutting room. The only value I can find in this movie is the study of a very flawed movie that somehow escaped to the distribution without repair. <br /> <br /> I've scanned dozens of other reviews here. The number of reviews praising this absolute loss of time strengthens my suspicions that some people receive payment for promoting titles. I can not understand how anyone over the age of 9 years could rate this title for more than 4, MAX. I mean, give it a break, 5 is the average. I can not imagine anyone, even those who make money from it, judging it the same as average. <br /> <br /> This makes my list of the 10 worst movies of all time. And, Hey, I like the Three Devousers and I can even tolerate Ed Wood!
