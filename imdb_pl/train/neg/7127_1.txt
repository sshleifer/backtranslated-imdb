This movie was at least bad !!! Lots of great cars are disgraced because they were presented in this movie LAME. It starts with the race with L.A. to Las Vegas to be completed in 1HR 45min ... in Ferrari F430. I did it in 1HR 50min in the tiny 4cylinder 140HP 1993 Honda Accord. Seriously ... this movie does not do justice to these cars. Of course, these writers are simply and probably drive under speed limits with their hands 10 and 2 at night. I remember seeing how Eddie Griffin smashed Ferrari Enzo worth $ 1.5 million, driving 30-40MPH >>> youtube.com/watch?v=cNVrMZX2kms <br /> <br /> And ... director ANDY CHENG is THE LARGER SALE !!! It brings shame to your own breed. I wonder how many people settled in orally when he broke into Hollywood. He took part in a film that depicts Asian Americans in such a negative and FALSE way. Asian women >> cheap money clearing hookers. Asian men >> losing compulsive gamblers and bandits who are beating all the time. What the hell is the fear of Asians? Why do you always have to present them in such a negative connotation? I have enough of the way in which Hollywood ALWAYS presents Asians with a negative and false pretext.
