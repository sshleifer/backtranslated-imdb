You know that the movie will not go well when John Carradine tells (a.k.a. reads the script and a summary of the story) on the procession of his character, just 5 minutes to the movie. Narration is the last will and testament of his character. He states that his estate will be divided among his four children and servants. Children will divide evenly into 136 million dollars, but if one of them dies, that part will be divided among the others. If all the children die, it will be divided among the servants. To qualify, they must live in a family estate for a week. It sounds like a typical reality show. <br /> <br /> There are very few sub-issues as to the nature of the deans. They are a powerful and very dysfunctional family, but the real problem starts with the drowning of this dog. From the initial voice of John Carradine, you expect this movie to lead to a Machiavellian game of cats and mice with an unexpected ending. <br /> <br /> This journey is painfully slow and aimless. We go through the minutes watching people sitting, playing billiards, throwing darts, misusing the shot "through a bowl of fish", dramatic conversations between silk neckties in men, constant quarrels, improper circus music, bizarre memories reminiscent of faux-German expressionism, aesthetics of the fourth-grade horror and lots of dramatic acquisitions. All this inevitably leads to an expected and ungrateful ending. You will be happy that you will still be alive, but the pain may be too great to endure alone. Share with children, share. <br /> <br /> - rehabilitation department
