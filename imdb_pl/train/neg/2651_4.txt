The first 30 minutes of filming was uncertain and difficult to determine what is happening (unless you read the book - which I did not have). <br /> <br /> If you can stick to the first half, the other half is sweet - predictable, yes, but sweet, no less. <br /> <br /> The way it was filmed, you'd think it was made in the early 80s, not 2005. <br /> <br /> No special moments, bland, but it moved without boredom. <br /> <br /> I would like to know why Keaton chose this role, its part would be better manned by the player more on the level of other actors to maintain balance.
