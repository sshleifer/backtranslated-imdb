Do not you hate it when you order a steak, but the restaurant gives you chicken? <br /> <br /> That's how I felt watching this so-called "Battlestar Galactica". You can argue about its quality, but the fact remains that it is NOT what fans ordered. <br /> <br /> Imagine you sat in the proverbial restaurant that I mentioned. You've been waiting for years to bring back the famous New York Strip steak you loved. When the meal comes, you'll notice the name "New York Strip" on the chicken stew. You complain, but the waiter only says "but with cheeken, ees really GOOD ZIR"! Do you really care if the chicken is good? You wanted a New York Strip - STEAK! Then the waiter explains: "You zir, the chef wanted to do, like you, zomezing NEW. We felt that cheeken would be more popular, that we gave him the name of our previous delicious deesh. " You ask if you'll ever find the original New York Strip menu in the future menu, but you'll find out that because the restaurant has a dish called the New York Strip, you'll never see the original New York Strip again. <br /> <br /> This is the case when creating something NEW and hitting the namesake "Battlestar Galactica". <br /> <br /> * This mini series is an affront to all fans of the original show! * <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the production team entrusted this new version with obvious contempt for the original. The team responsible for resurrecting BG should LOVE the original series - trying to improve what fans loved without trying to shamelessly sell this new series using the name Battlestar Galactica. <br /> <br /> If you wanted a SciFi channel to give us NEW and then DO IT! Give it a new name! Do not use a name that we remember with pleasure, trying to lure viewers. This effectively deprives us of the chance to see any appearance of the original in the future. <br /> <br /> For 25 years we have been waiting for what we knew as BG, because we liked something from the original! We did not just want NAME and the remnants of the basic concept. We love the original series! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, probably the BEST original elements are those that have been omitted. Of course, the original BG was imperfect and could benefit from the update. This mini series was not any improvement, but special effects (which were good, but are not unusual in today's standards). <br /> <br /> Many viewers will discuss the quality of this. NEW show, but we will not forgive SciFi and Ron Moore for destroying our dream. <br /> <br /> Having said that ... I will present some comments on the advantages of this new mini (not compared to the original): <br /> <br /> The battle sequences were the best part. The effort was obviously put in making the effects more "real" in appearance and less "wow - look at this effect". I would not say that these sequences were unique in today's standards, but they were compatible with the original films created for the cable. What was the deal with this "pseudo-live-cam"? Some views have tried to falsify the effect of a "real" camera with delayed tracking and sudden magnifications. However, it has been overused because there was no visible SOURCE of these cameras. The infinitely more intelligent series, Babylon 5, is the only case in which I have seen such "live cameras" that were effectively used when we thought we were witnesses of Security Cams. <br /> <br /> Script, you ask? The script seemed to be written by a teenager, for other teenagers. The characters felt cardboard and stereotypical. Indeed, the whole story was combined with other well-known stereotypes. The only good features of the whole story were the few elements that have been preserved from the original series. It was obviously "muffled" for the digestion of the average television audience. <br /> <br /> Human interaction was pathetic. Instead of a drama based on a subtle look, expression and timing, every moment of human tension was exaggerated to such an extent that it became so obvious that it lost all ability to move any sophisticated viewer. This was obvious in every interaction between Adam and his son. The director had to make sure that the most dense and insensitive viewer would not miss him, even if he did not pay attention to it. I'm sorry, but real people do not behave like those who are constantly behaving. <br /> <br /> I would not consider this a bad show if he was alone. Nothing big; He will never be worshiped by real SciFi fans or craftsmen, but he will be watched by the masses. However, I could live without him. I just watched him to see how he really captured the spirit of the original. <br /> <br /> The way in which this mini-series will always be remembered is a symbol of how the quality of story telling has been rejected to appeal to a larger number. As even SciFi Channel "stupid" its productions to satisfy the needs of the masses, in contrast to the real niche market, Science Fiction fans. This will be the time when we asked for a steak, and they insisted on giving us chicken, despite our complaints. <br /> <br /> I will leave you with one thought - <br /> <br /> NOT "MOORE". <br /> <br />
