I only watched DVD 1. The right program can have 10 minutes of good information; otherwise it is snotty to put aside religious people. It is as if director Brian Flemming has only recently discovered both atheism and sarcasm, and thanks to these tools he can easily overcome his opposition. <br /> <br /> In addition, Flemming travels extensively in his personal matters and takes control of the film. He never returns to the topic. <br /> <br /> Religious people are willing to discount skeptics when their objections to religion are clearly rooted in abusive upbringing. The arguments of such persecuted victims seem irrational and therefore unconvincing. <br /> <br /> Anti-religious people will want more data. We do not need to say that religious people are crazy, just as American Jews do not have to be informed about how annoying Christmas music is in mid-December. <br /> <br /> In the best scene of the Fleming Superintendent, a Christian school from childhood thoroughly confronts the director with his motivations. It seems to be the most honest part of the movie and it was too short. <br /> <br /> If Fleming were a bit more conscious, he would have a good story about his own (past and present) relationship with Christianity and the institutions abusing him that indoctrinated him in his youth. <br /> <br /> And perhaps he could borrow his material "Christ never walked the earth" to a more serious documentary. I do not study Saul / Paul's writings to find out how it is tight, but quick browsing of Wikipedia suggests that most of these arguments are discredited. <br /> <br /> Bonus interviews are pretty good, but they do not reinforce Fleming's thesis. Sam Harris is a good spokesman for the anti-religious POV and does not shed light on these other non-Christian religions. Harris also has good (and easy on Google) interviews at Salon.com, Amazon.com and Samharris.org.
