now do not get me wrong, I like Christmas movies. I love this wonderful life and I really like the carol version with George c. Scott and alistair simulation. but this particular movie is awful. I think the song "I love life", the spirit of Christmas songs, is particularly painful. Albert Finney is singing pretty well in Anna. I do not know what's wrong with this movie, but it sounds like someone tried to sing through a bite of dead gerbils. The only thing that saved this movie for us was to turn off the sound and watch the dance numbers in the company of the festive cd from the southern park.
