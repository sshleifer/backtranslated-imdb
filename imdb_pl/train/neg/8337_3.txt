Millie is juice. He marries a rich guy named Maitland and has a child. Then he grabs him cheating and divorces him ... but he lets him stop the child who claims he loves. Then, in the early thirties, she would have been entitled to a generous spouse and support, but she let the guy surprisingly easy ... without support ... what a juice! Later, when he has a boyfriend, and life seems pretty good, he turns out to be a cheat! Wow, does she have problems choosing men? <br /> <br /> Millie is changing as a result of these bad relationships. Now she is a wild girl - she's doing everything she can to break away from her hard luck. Suddenly, many years pass. Millie's daughter, who left early in the film, is now 17, and strange fashion has not changed a bit. Millie's old friend (yes, he's another bad man!). Now he pretends to be a friend of his daughter, but he's wearing lewd projects. Millie promises him that if he touches the girl, he will kill him. Guess what will happen next! <br /> <br /> In general, the movie is a tangled and often bizarre mess - a bit like "Madam X", but much less focused. Millie's motivations and actions seem so meaningless. And it seems that the film has a bit of everything in it - as long as it justifies the view that all people are pigs. Unusual, but not very good.
