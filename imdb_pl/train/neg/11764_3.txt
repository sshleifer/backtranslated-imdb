I must say that I really could not wait to see this movie and find a new life in it that would separate it from the most boring and too crafted Mexican films. I have no idea why, but I trusted Sexo, Pudor y Lagrimas, to be the one who brought freshness and certainty to our non-existent industry. Maybe because the soundtrack (which I listened to before watching the movie) sounded different than the others, maybe because she dared to include new faces (in addition to Demian Bichir, who is always a favorite of Mexican film directors) and apparently in his script with modern social behavior, maybe because the photo I saw in the trailers was bright and realistic, not theatrical. The film turned out to be greatly welcomed by the crowd and a big disappointment. What Serrano deals with is a very old-fashioned "battle of the sexes", as in "all people are the same" and "why all women ...;" blah, blah, blah. There is nothing new about it, not even that, it uses so many common foundations and stereotypes that it finally makes fun of itself, leaving no valuable reflection about the condition of the woman / man. Full of ordinary tramps in the audience, like safe gags about the stereotypes I mentioned earlier (these always work, always) and screaming performances (this is a well-preserved movie in its context) ... and I mean literally by shouting. First, the more attractive characters of Monika Dionne and Demian Bichir turn out to be more pathetic according to Serrano. I completely disagree with Serrano, they should not have been treated this way just to serve as puppets, to make his lesson over ... he made sure that we received his message and completely destroyed their roles, which were the only solid foundation on which this story could stand. In any case, it is sometimes a very funny movie and you'll probably see it well (if you agree to manipulate it).
