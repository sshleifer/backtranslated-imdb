The longer this movie lasted - and it seemed to be painstakingly lasting - the more I became nervous, how honestly, what a waste of time sitting through this total nonsense. How the hell do people make movies like that, and even receive money for such garbage? Do not be fooled by the relatively high ratings of IMDb, because this proves that you can fool some people all the time. In this picture, the main players are obsessed with weapons, so it's not difficult to figure out how this movie will eventually develop. America will never understand that the rest of the world considers it strange how the US society has such an obscene and fatal "culture of arms". <br /> <br /> In any case: <br /> <br /> The main actor presents a loser who escapes into the fantasy world of being a cowboy in an uncontrolled urban development. He encounters a family with two spoiled kids, a teenager and a boy; under the care of a single father raising a child who is barely able to cope. The cowboy is seduced by a teenage girl or vice versa, and the sensitive boy is seemingly insane of the loser. <br /> <br /> The cowboy spends all time in a state of unreality and depression. A total loser who prefers to go to the beach and then work for a living, then commits to breaking into his family because he is too lazy to earn money legally. <br /> <br /> Ask yourself: <br /> <br /> Who wants to see a sad loser in a fantasy world that has a death wish, or actually see a poor family who is not really much better than white basket ?! <br /> <br /> This video is pointless drivel. <br /> <br /> It saves only on getting the lowest possible rating by some listening music: <br /> <br /> 2/10.
