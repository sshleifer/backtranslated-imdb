A really scary movie. At first, I did not know that it was Kiwi's effort - but very soon I began to realize that all characters speak faintly hidden accents of kiwis under false Americans. Why did he have to be set up in America anyway? - it could be arranged in NZ, and then the actors could use their normal voices. Surely someone in the production team heard horrible attempts to speak with American accents? Bad bad movie. I am surprised that it lasted so long - how did you get out of the can? It seemed to be a very flimsy attempt, a Segal / Willis type action man. TOTAL MONEY WASTE! If there was any taxpayer's money in this piece of rubbish, I would run a revolution so that all the money would be returned to the Treasury. I keep staggering (I understand? Kalambur, rocking!) In the absolute rubbish I just saw. Why am I still watching? I am a movie fanatic and I can not help myself!
