I started watching this movie with high expectations. However, after an hour I gave up this movie because it instilled many unanswered questions. It has already begun in the opening sequence and has only deteriorated. <br /> <br /> Why would they bury the Dutchman under a statue? Why is an Italian comedian present? Why did the farmers' wife save the Dutchman? Why, after saving, he did not escape to life, instead of starting to make love to the farmer's wife? Why did the farmers' wife not save the Dutchman when the farmer was not around? Why are these supposedly illiterate farmers understand Italian? Why did an Italian comedian know about the gold of the Dutch? Why did he hide it in the cesspool of the property of the evil farmers? These and many other questions appeared, and none of them seemed to respond in a satisfactory manner. So I think that I completely miss the point of this film and I do not connect with this story in any way ....
