Whattt was with the sound? It sounded like everything was dubbed. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, wrong. Plot = bad. Accents = bad (even Dougray, and we live in Scotland), Acting = bad, Harp = bad, Sex scenes - bad / noteworthy. <br /> <br /> But we still watched it in disbelief. How can such a good appeal of actors be so bad? Will they ever get a decent job? <br /> <br /> Bad, bad, bad. By the way, we gave him 3, because at least we were encouraged to see him to the end because of his bizarre plot, etc. <br /> <br /> And to an older reviewer - I totally agree, it was like a romantic farce from the 40s XX century. How was it created in 2004? <br /> <br /> OK, OK, it was a bit OK. They had a nice house in Bristol. Dougray had a nice boat. Jennifer looked nice in a small outfit. But where does this sister have all men?
