you have a strong stomach. Holden was 55 years old, but he looked nearly 70 years old and lived only 8 years. At one point Holden said: "I am more than two times older than you." Okay, try triple grandfather! The theme "old enough to be your father" in which they were filming did not work. Granted seniors sometimes end up with legal teenagers. More power for them, but that does not mean I want to watch it. This is not a question of judgment, but of the digestive tract. I like my food where it belongs. Lenz is great to watch, and cars, clothes, furniture, etc. From the 70s make it worth it, if it is late at night, and you want to watch something that calms down. It would be nice to see Lenza's blond friend, the one who tugged her guitar, get more scenes. Pleasantly cosmic ... Who was this chick? I'll try to find out.
