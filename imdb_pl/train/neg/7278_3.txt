This barely watched movie was a bit of a hard trial. None of the segments is good, but at least the first one was a bit funny and the middle one was somewhat imaginative. The last one was just brutal, and after watching two weak comedy pants, the third one was really painful to watch. Even at the low standards of the National Lampoon movie, this one seemed particularly boring and exhilarating.
