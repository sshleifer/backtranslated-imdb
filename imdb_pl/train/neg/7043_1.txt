I was ready to laugh at the movie like an experiment with the Mystery Science Theater, but it was just boring. It seems that the producers had many friends enthusiasts of motorcycles, and from there casually decided to make a movie. <br /> <br /> Often you can not watch it. Plenty of pictures of cyclists riding a dirt road, with the same music played repeatedly. Unfortunately, Renee Harmon is barely in the movie. Harmon would probably revive everything. Perhaps she had other commitments on the day she was filmed. <br /> <br /> Of course, cyclists terrorize the small town. Fights, murders, cowardly cop, stupid mechanics, etc. One of the bikers always wears a football helmet, which is a weak attempt to distinguish it from other outlaws. <br /> <br /> The script has nothing to offer. One scene depicts a cyclist attacking a woman screaming at the woman's face "You are the same! You are the same! " We return to the stage a minute later and again declare: "You are the same!". Can the writer not come up with something more creative to say? <br /> <br /> At the end, good guys killed bad guys. We also learn that the wedding between middle-aged mechanic Joe and young Susie has been canceled. Susie goes to college and suddenly we find out that Joe's wedding is still active (but with another bride). End.
