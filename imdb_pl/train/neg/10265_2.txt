Kirstie Alley, looks a bit slimmer, but only a little bit, is in this mess with a man who is looking like MacGuyver, blond hair and so on. The premise of the film is an older woman (50 !!!), who can not get a script because of age discrimination, so he sends a younger nephew to pose as a writer. This is not an original idea and not very good movie with bad acting, ridiculous dialogue and a funny story. There is another conspiracy about the writer with depression or admiration for the character of Kirstie, and that is why it is a mystery. The actor who introduces Brother Kirstie is so wooden and inept that watching their scenes was torture. What can you say about this film. Avoid this.
