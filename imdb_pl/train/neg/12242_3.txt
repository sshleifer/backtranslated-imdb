I was expecting a bad movie and a bad movie. But in my worst imagination, I could not imagine how bad the movie was. I do not even want to explain what Blood Surf is. It's not about surfing the blood, but about a big crocodile $$. They complain about a fake shark in SzczÄ™ki, but Spielberg was smart and did not show the shark until the end. Here the crocodile is shown many times and it's the worst crocodile I've ever seen, and they're not trying to hide it. If you want to see a good fake crocodile watch Lake Placid. <br /> <br /> The director had the opportunity to make a decent movie about surfing / shark, but he had to make a bad movie with the monster b. He had a chance to create the original film for surfing, but he wanted to create a movie about monsters. So you understand how bad this movie is, does it have any good parts? Not really, it has some nakedness and a sex scene that comes from a playboy movie. Acting is not half bad either, and Kate Fischer looks good. It is a pity he does not take it off her head. The main actors are not bad either. They had a certain potential. The location was beautiful and the movie started well with some nice surf scenes. The guilty is the unskilled writer and director. Dialog is one of the worst I've ever seen, and the script is really badly written, and the director has no talent for what ever and is not too fancy. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this. Even if you want to watch the beautiful Kate Fischer. It is not worth it. Watch Mermaids to watch naked Kate, and watch Lake Placid if you want a good crocodile action. <br /> <br /> 3/10, because I'm in a good mood, and Maureen Larrazabal looks good naked, and Kate looks good (but is a bad actress), and Dex Miller, Joel West and Matt Borlenghi did a good job with a piece sh # t that they had to work with.
