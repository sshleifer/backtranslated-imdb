I am a GREAT fan of the genre of horror movies! I love all kinds of horrory / slasher / gore flicks. Some of my favorites are really "good" bad movies from horror. But these movies CAN NOT guarantee that they will be watched !! I'm not going to spend a lot of time talking about everything that's wrong with him. <br /> <br /> The script is terrible. Acting is terrible. FX is not even worth discussing. "Set" is an absolute joke !! The sad thing is that I think there may be some real potential in several actors, but this vehicle did not give them anything to do !!! <br /> <br /> Just say that I saw it as "for free" and I feel robbed !! Watching WASTE time would be better if you used dental floss.
