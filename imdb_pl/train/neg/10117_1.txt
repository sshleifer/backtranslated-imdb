Wow. Tonight I went to the video shop because I was in the mood for a bad B Horror movie and I found this gem. I looked at the cover and thought it was just a movie about my mood. I brought it home and put it on. <br /> <br /> This movie was not a B Horror film that I meant. It was MUCH worse. I wanted a bad movie, but what I got did not know that such nonsense exists among people. This movie seemed to be a five-year-old written and directed, and that's nice about it. <br /> <br /> I am an aspiring director and this movie has made me so mad that someone really pays this guy direct movies. He must work in a garbage dump, pushing nonsense where it belongs. <br /> <br /> If you think about renting or buying. I will tell you the same as I would say to someone preparing to commit suicide. "DO NOT DO, IT'S WORTH IT!" I really do not have anything nice to say about this movie. Do not do this!
