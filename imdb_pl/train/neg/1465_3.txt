First of all, I would like to add that I am a historian myself, so what I am looking for in a film based on historical events is the fact that it is in fact based on historical facts. But here it is not. Of course, the movie is fun, but the fact that it is not completely fact-based is more than annoying. Hitler was not anti-Semitic in his youth, he even worked for Jews before the First World War. However, it was during the First World War and then he formulated his views on the subject of Jews. His upbringing in this film is also inaccurate, Hitler as a child was not disturbed by the little brat. He had more or less normal upbringing. Nothing is mentioned about his lost brothers and other important elements that add to the mystery that Hitler is. <br /> <br /> Robert Carlyle is a great actor, but he does not really match Hitler's role. Hitler was not as impossible and unstable as portrayed here. In his youth he was a charismatic man who "manipulated" people thanks to his charms. His unstable behavior and outbursts of rage began at the turning point of the war. <br /> <br /> I would like to see a movie about Hitler's life based on historical facts, not accusations. I really hate when people point, for example, to Hitler and others, and tell false stories only to paint their picture as pure evil. It's much better to tell a story EXACTLY because everyone could find out what it was like! Those who are behind this film should do some research before they do it. Because it seems that they did not even know what really happened. Hitler was not even shot in the revolutionary march on Munch, his arm was taken out of the nest. <br /> <br /> It gives you more to see a good documentary than to see it.
