If this movie was about a fictional character, the film could become the same and be evaluated objectively. Unfortunately for the viewer the film is based on "facts" which are very unfairly treated in relation to Ruben Carter. Many minor facts have been ignored (Carter was NOT number one at the time of the murders, there is no evidence that he saved his friend from molesting children in his youth), but some of the larger facts, apparently robbed of Joey Giardello's decision for "racist" judges, it is unforgivable for those of us who saw the fight on the tape and totally disregard Giardello. Why Hollywood feels the need to make a hero from someone who at best was in trouble and trouble far more than any normal person (he was repeatedly arrested for beating women) is strange to me. Ruben Carter never, by reviewing his actions in the 1960s and even now, never talked to his son, a person that people can look at. Everyone knows that Jewison can run, and Washington can work, but why did they choose this story because their vehicle is beyond me. Does Hollywood need a black hero so badly that he has to bend the truth in all his photos to make them credible? (Here's the suggestion: What about Denzel playing the movie about himself? Now that's inspiring.) Based on all the inaccuracies in the movie, I would suggest handing it over.
