when discussing the movie "Snakes on the plane" we should have noted earlier that snakes are very important for the plot. <br /> <br /> we have very bad cgi snakes that neither look nor move like real snakes. snakes are frightening because they appear slimy, crawl, slip. these snakes do nothing. they move along, like in a video game. they are cartoon snakes. I would like to say that even someone who had a serious phobia against real snakes would not find those terrible <br /> <br /> why in that case would you like to include extreme close-ups of these cgi failures? why not rely on uncertainty. all ethics "less is more". and even better, why not just make them look good? and then he can still use them sparingly <br /> <br /> look at what john carpenters is. here we have real mucus and blood of amazing proportions. It's been 20 years and we got this pile of smelly sfx crap "snakes on the plane". When will these people wake up and smell the coffee? special effects are receding! <br /> <br /> you can definitely say ... but the movie is a joke, do you understand? I'm sure I have this idea, but do it right! in addition to the above, this video has a crappy dialogue. and music and sound effects are not scary or memorable in any way. <br /> <br /> I could deal with any other actor taking part in this movie, except for Jackson. what was he doing there? a man who 10 years ago appeared in pulp novels. is this career development? Do you offer people value for money? No. I'd like to know what Tarantino thought when he was halfway through this stinking movie <br /> <br /> the current generation seems to have very low expectations. and it seems Hollywood offers them what they want. After leaving the cinema, I saw a lot of ads for really terrifying, future releases, including ... DOA: dead or alive, (other) animal film cgi called "pastries" and another comedy called "click". besides, I saw some horrible trailers, including one for (another) shit British horror / comedy. I really have not seen the film industry in such a mess for a long time <br /> <br /> I was expecting to see this movie for sale in the bargain DVD section for Â£ 1 for 6 months. and if you're expecting to see a black comedy with tons of great-looking snakes, and some bad dialogue with Samuel L.'s lips, forget about it.
