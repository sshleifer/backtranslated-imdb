The original "les visiteurs" were original, fun, interesting, balanced and almost perfect. LV2 must be a candidate for the "Worst first sequel of a really good movie". In LV2, everyone is still screaming when the gag does not work first, it is repeated 5 times with some vague hope that it will eventually become funny. LV2 is a terrible parody of LV1, except that the parody should be ingenious. If you loved LV1, do not watch this movie, see LV1 again !!
