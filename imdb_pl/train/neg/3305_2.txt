I absolutely do not see what's funny about this movie. Humor seems to be designed for corpses. It is slow. The story is too simple to be true. The characters do not arouse much compassion, omitting some irrelevant figures. Nothing strange is happening. What do the authors of this scenario think? "Oh, fun! Let's make an old lady high! Let's make them ... giggle! Let's make them ... behave like little kids! br /> This movie irritated me most of all the movies I've seen in the last five years.
