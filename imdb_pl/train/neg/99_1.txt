Some of the movies you chose for the pound were pretty good - the 23rd century films showed dozens of unknown Italian and American films that were great, but although Hardgore released several Fulci movies, most of their production is nonsense like The Zombie Chronicles. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it's not as annoying as Stink of Flesh. In addition, it is a very clumsy anthological film with technical competences of the Lego house built by a young man. <br /> <br /> It has been recorded elsewhere, but you really have to worry about a movie that contains action previews in the credit sequence, so before you get to the zombie attacks, you've already seen it. <br /> <br /> Bad movie fans will have a ball observing 18,000 continuity errors and devilish casting acting (especially a hitchhiker who was so angry that he made me laugh a bit) and also for Hardgore for getting him to the spirit of things, printing a print so bad that I felt like watching a beaten movie of a camping trip. <br /> <br /> Horrible, horrible things. We've all done such things when we have a camera, but common sense wins, and these movies are wasted somewhere. Avoid.
