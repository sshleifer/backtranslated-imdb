"Spielberg loves the smell of sentiment in the morning. But the sentiment at the expense of narrative honesty? No one should love it. " - Lucjusz Shepard <br /> <br /> The "violet color" takes place in the deep south at the beginning of the twentieth century and tells the story of Celie and Nettie, two African sisters. The film is opened by girls playing in the field of purple flowers, an idyllic marina, which is immediately destroyed by the appearance of a stepfather. This theme? innocence interrupted by men? it permeates the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a series of short sequences. Celie turns out to be impregnated twice by her stepfather, she is born in a dirty barn, she has taken her newborn child and she is forced to marry the local widow of Albert Johnson, a rapist who rapes her repeatedly, forcing her to cook, cleanliness and babysitting. <br /> <br /> All of these scary scenes have little time on the screen, and instead are surrounded by pixie-dust cinematic moments, intrusive symphonic scores, improper comedies and overly spontaneous camera work. The cumulative effect is like combining a Disney cartoon with a rape movie that was a shocking aesthetic that caused Stanley Kubrick to notice that The Color Purple made him so depressed that he had to turn it off after ten minutes. Ten minutes? It lasted a very long time. <br /> <br /> It is often said that the film is about "racism", "sexism" and "black culture", but it is not true. Alice Walker, the author of the novel on which the movie is based, claims she is bisexual, but in reality is a lesbian from the wardrobe. Her book is a lesbian fantasy, a story of women's liberation and self-discovery that paints men as brutal brutes who disturb women. For Walker, the only way out of this maze is to connect women to a specific lesbian utopia, a celebrated black sister and women's independence. <br /> <br /> Spielberg's film, however, changes Walker's story through a lens of comforting American mythology. It is a film in which the saving power of Christianity overcomes the natural cruelty of men. A film in which Albert finds himself in various absurd situations, moments of a lost comedy that makes him look like an inept fool. The movie, in which all characters come from racist minstrel shows, the cast consists of lusty men (always glowing with devilish smiles and smiling teeth), stereotypical thick mammoths, jazz bands and gospel choirs. <br /> <br /> This is a film in which Blacks are naturally childish, happily and happily accept their social conditions. A film in which Blacks are excessively sexually, carnal senses dominated by violent passions. A film in which poverty and class issues are completely invisible (Albert lives in a big house), and black men are completely inept. This is not the Old South, it's Old South, derived from "Gone with the Wind", MGM Muscals, "Song of the South", Warner Cartoons, "Halleluha!" And forbidden Disney movies. In other words, the South sees a child brought up on a TV set from the 1950s. It's all so cartoonish, so racist, that it reduces these human beings to one-dimensional ethnic stereotypes, that the black novelist Ishmael Reed famously compared it to the Nazi conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Of course, in a typical way Spielberg's film ends with healing family ties. This reconciliation was in Walker's novel, but Spielberg goes further because every character in history reconciles with their relatives. <br /> <br /> Apart from Walker's hatred of black men and the bizarre caricature of Spielberg's black life, we do not show anything to the black community. We only have the smallest ideas on how any of these characters earn their living and have no insight into how they interact with other people in their community. Instead, Spielberg's camera bounces, desperately fighting for our attention (one of Celie's kitchen devices seems to belong to the movie "Home Alone"), every emotion he played, the director never stopped just watching something or letting some life just pass. Combine it with the absurdly "white" music of Quincy Jones and you have one of the strangest films in cinema history: an angry feminist treatise filmed by a white Disney and Griffith Jew, conquered by a black man trying to imitate John Williams. <br /> <br /> The lack of white characters is also problematic. Consider this: the men in this film are not portrayed as being rough with themselves, nor do they dominate women, because they are brutalized by a racist society that reduces their masculinity. No, they are cruel by nature. And women, whether quietly suffering like Celie or rebellious and as hard as her sister, will persevere and survive only because men are too stupid to destroy them. A better film would not only focus on the oppression of women, because it occurs among the oppressed, it would rather show that social abuse has led to marital abuse, that enslaved black women are forced to do the same tasks as their male counterparts (though they still play traditional roles) women) and that domestic violence in African Americans is mainly due to economic factors, women are unable to support themselves and their children in peace. <br /> <br /> And so is the hidden ideology working here. Late in the film, one character tells the other that since he does not respect his wife, she was severely beaten and imprisoned by whites. This suggests that negroes must return to their African roots to restore their dignity and that it is their fault that the white people are unjustly crushing them. ie, respect each other in your poor minority community, and you will not be exposed to the dominant white culture. <br /> <br /> 3/10 - Failure to confront sex and lesbianism, improper music numbers, innumerable sequences loaded with foreign visual pizazziem, improper business, emphatic music sounds and crazy hypnotization - all this contributes to rendering "Color purple "worthless.
