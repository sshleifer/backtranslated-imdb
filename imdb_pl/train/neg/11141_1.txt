Man, this movie was sucked! I could not even see the hole (although my girlfriend did it). Really bad acting, computer animations so bad that you just laugh (a woman to a werewolf), weird clips, the list goes on. I do not know if it's just me, does this movie remind you of a porn movie? And I do not mean all the naked ladies ... It's something about light or something else ... Maybe Maybee become a classic only because of bad acting and all naked women, but not because it is an original white movie a nice twist. My last words are: I do not see it! It is not worth the time. If you want to see it, because nudity is much better to see!
