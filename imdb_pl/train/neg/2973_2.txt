I have two very serious complaints about this video. <br /> <br /> 1. That my local rental store has put on the shelf what is clearly "soft" porn in the "suspense" category. (If I knew what it was, I would not waste my time by renting it first.) And yes, this movie is a soft porn core.) <br /> <br /> 2. The title has nothing to do with the movie. Nobody in this movie is doing anything that is either deviant or obsessive, let alone the combination of the two. <br /> <br /> Actually, there are three main objections: <br /> <br /> 3. That for some reason I have been watching a movie long enough to discover the second point on this list. I regret this boy. Stay away from this movie. Learn from my error. This movie is worthless on practically any level.
