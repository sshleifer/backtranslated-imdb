I've seen a sneaky preview of this stupid movie. First of all, the movie is so posed and unreal, everyone is playing. They can not sing. They are too full of each other. It's terrible. Yes, children like 8 to 10 can be happy, but it's really stupid. That is to say, their manager is a child. And there the record label is false. This is stupid. Do not look. <br /> <br /> When it comes to setting up and directing, not so bad. This is a charming document, but a stupid document. <br /> <br /> See it only if you do not like good music. Besides, it is very trivial. It is not even tasteful. I hate being so mean ... but it really is a junk.
