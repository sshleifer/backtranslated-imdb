I recently caught a part of the GEORGE 2 TV set, but I could not bring myself to watch it to the end. Just horrible! I do not even remember the story. I only know that George and Ursula were not George and Ursula from the first movie, which was bad enough. There are many professions around, but the direction and editing were so shoddy and rough that it resembled watching releases or removed scenes. Owning the original Ape monkey monkey voice was not enough to warm me up. GEORGE 2 is probably the worst sequel I've ever seen, and that says something. Jeez, because of the IMDb 10 line rule, I have to keep writing when I have nothing more to say about this crapulastic sequel to the TV. Disney, hang your head with shame.
