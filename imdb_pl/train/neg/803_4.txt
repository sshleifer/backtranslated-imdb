A few years ago, I read the novel of Ben Mezrich the Reaper and last night I came by accident to see this adaptation. <br /> <br /> Although years have passed since I read this story for the first time, the differences between the novel and the movie are enormous. Very important elements that made the whole thing credible are simply written out or changed to bad. <br /> <br /> If the plot sounds interesting: go and get a novel. There is much, much, much better. <br /> <br /> Still 4 out of 10, because it was hard to stop watching because of the great story of Ben Mezrich.
