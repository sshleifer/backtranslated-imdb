As the director of Altman's experience, he could ever expect us to spend time or take care of what will happen, for a main character who is neurotic, moaning, a jerk without the features of redemption - this is the main puzzle in this deeply confused work. A huge piece of garbage. In addition to this paralyzing gap, the story requires serious concentration. The configuration in which Branagh comes in is so obvious from the very beginning that we are inclined to wonder whether the screenwriter and director have completely lost respect for their audience. This last issue is the essence of the film: it represents the director's indulgence with deep contempt for the taste, value and intelligence of the viewer. Unusual for Mr. Altman. <br /> <br /> Patrick Watson
