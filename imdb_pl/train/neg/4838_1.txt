I decided to watch this film, because this year he was nominated for an Oscar. I think that so many people really wanted to like this movie, but it ended up bored and disappointed. The first scene was fine, but the rest of the movie in camera mode with "trembling hands" is really annoying. <br /> <br /> I think that the main reason for making such a film and nominating it for the Oscar is: <br /> <br /> The American "military machine" (people who make money from the war) urgently needs an excuse or justification of war in Iraq, pushing something (patriotic). <br /> <br /> why these "heroic" efforts of the director and the main character to "announce" the audience with the idea of ​​"a war-loving like drug"? .. Oh, please, come on! What a boring! <br /> <br /> look at this to see how low can the movie academy fall ...
