Well, like most Steven Seagal fans, I know I will not expect a masterpiece every time I make a movie, but I expect the movie to have at least a smaller budget. The main problem with the copy I watched was terrible dubbing. I know that in some movies you have to do it and accept it, but when they exaggerate with a completely different voice of the actors and do it through the whole movie, it takes the magic of overdubbing. Also the sets seem to be built without care, because in one scene the moving glass top in a top secret laboratory has a huge crack. I was really disappointed with this movie and just hope that the next Stevens project will be more refined before sending the movie for purchase / rent. The story of this movie made me wonder if I was watching a science-fiction movie or not, some parts seemed alien, but they never fully explained what was going on.
