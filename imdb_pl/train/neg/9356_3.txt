Marilyn Miller made only three films before the untimely death - the wonderful SALLY (1929), the comedy HER MAJESTY LOVE (1931) and this little thing - SUNNY (1930). It is quite poor both as an early talkie and as a musical rehearsal - although it has four dance numbers, it sings only two songs (WHO? AND ONE MAN ALONE). The rest of the score, including the title melody, is rejected, though we hear it in the background. Miller is overweight and amateurish - there is no quality of the star at all. Even her dancing is bizarre. The film is very badly written, it is full of old and unpalatable jokes and stupid situations. If you're interested in Miller as a performer, check this out, but stay away from the general entertainment.
