After watching about half of the movie, I noticed something strange ... I was constantly switching over TV channels to see what else is included - this is not a good feature of the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is listed as being in many genres, I must say that in each of them he failed in the majority. 80% of the video I switched to look at the old repetition instead. Conclusion - the whole movie looked as if the ones that made you did not know what to do, ended up with a mixture without a noticeable taste.
