I do not know what you're talking about when I first saw this movie with two friends, we could not stop crying. It's one of the funniest pieces I've ever seen. This comment on pornography is correct, although hahahaha. <br /> <br /> Yes, this movie is actually worse, but it brought tears to the eyes due to false characters, bad dialogue and acting. Not to mention expensive cameras that they filmed ?! It looks like one of those movies from my drivers. grade. Props look like they came from a theater school. The music sounds as if it came from the original Nintendo system game. The only thing that even came close to haunting me was that he had a deadly clown who is not scared by thick, lurking clowns? hahaha, if someone ever saw it, he must pay attention to the verbal mistakes of the actors, such as lisping words and facial expressions. hahahaha I died. <br /> <br /> SUSAN
