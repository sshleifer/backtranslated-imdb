I had high hopes for this because I like Tim Roth. I was not happy with this movie. I liked Ang Lee The Hulk a few years ago, so I thought it would be noisier. First, I was very disappointed with the performance of John Hurt here. It looks like his eyebrows have been changed for this purpose. His performance was not convincing. He was not as good as one would expect. Tim Roth is as cool as always here. The thing in Gama did not really stick to the original storyline I do not think about. I think the end was the best part of the movie. She had a nice action. The only problem with the original was that it was too long. This one is not so long, but sometimes a bit boring. I remember some time ago when Walmart had this movie really cheap for sale and I always wondered why. Now I know. I was hoping that I would be blown away, but I was not.
