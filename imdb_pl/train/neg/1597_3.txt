This film is rated as a classic in sentiments, not in the quality of films. It goes from unlikely to unbelievable, from unrealistic to ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The amazing plot revolves around the attempts of two British soldiers and an Indian gopher to save a third soldier who was captured by the Indians. In the later scene, we see a full regiment with a drum and bagpipes marching in an ambush. In the British Army, the sergeant does not manage the rescue attempt, and if it passes, he does not try to take it only with one other soldier and an Indian servant when the full regiment is at hand. Indian insurgents are so incredibly inept, it's funny ... there are hundreds of them, but they can not hold the prisoner or kill two rescuers, of course not. At one point, we see British soldiers throwing stone blocks from the insurgents' blanks, who are scattered on the mountainside in an ambush ... you would have to have eggplant so that the brain could imagine that it would do any damage. After Cary Grant, when the saved prisoner is shot, lies on the floor, looking around the boy from the water ... almost does not work someone who was shot in the back. The boy with water bravely blows the trumpet (which comes out of nowhere) to trigger an alarm ... it does, standing high on the wall so that it can be seen and shot by evil guys, and we tear when he keeps trying to sound more when he is repeatedly fired, and the bugle-call collapses into weak clots ... instead of blowing the trumpet, hiding behind the cover, as everyone with half of the brain would do. This scene was deservedly parodied in comedy sketches. If they wanted to make Buster Keaton's comedy, they should have been employing Keaton and doing it better.
