Letting the classroom watch it in English was a bad idea. Films that are serious and more educational can affect, but it seems that it did not affect the class - every time the teacher left, talks quickly started - and I did not hear the words "Shakespeare" or "Storm" "Used at all. And when you look at it, it's easy to understand why. Acting is nothing special - everyone seems bored with pieces, just reading from the unattended side of the world. Shakespeare always preferred exposure to action and death, but I just could not understand the words that someone was saying. Costumes are not so bad and none of them are special effects - the class may not like the movie, but also did not accept p * ss. But it is difficult to make fun of a movie devoid of any inspiration or joy. The scenes on the ship at the beginning of the film were not too bad - although the rain looked a little unrealistic, everything else was well and well done. But where were the heads and exploding masts cut off? Where was death? Where was the inspiration? Ariel's character would have been taken more seriously if he wore clothes - but as everything was shown, it was just another joke. This movie in no way speaks to any sex. Women and girls will not enjoy any romanticism or comedy, and the abundance of naked men and lack of action or death will make most men and boys go away. Tempest was not badly made, but it was something the producers had to do, not something they wanted to do. And general boredom and lack of inspiration. 3/10
