Another awesome action / adventure film from the Quinn Martin Productions factory. Roy Thinnes plays Diamond Head's secret agent (Mr. Head, to you), working for his G-Man merchant "Aunt Mary", looking for a "Tree" who is on the mission ... well, just watch the movie. <br /> <br /> She deserved and received a full MST3K. As the boys and other reviewers noticed, the film "Fargo" had more places in Hawaii than the movie. Apparently filmed on a poor budget, the movie highlights the sprawling Hawaii diving shops, gas stations and cheap hotels. Zulu - later playing the role of Kono in Hawaii-Five-O - appears as a clumsy Thinnes midfielder, while France Nguyen models the diet of Jenny Craig terribly bad. Others sharing a blinking screen are the drunken knockoff of Richard Harris, follower of George Takai, not very smart hitman with Sansabelt pants sprayed and the "Tree" villain, with the British veddy accent. You can very much understand the story in the middle of the initial subtitles, but relax - just enjoy the dizzying mediocrity of this movie from the '70s. <br /> <br /> Whenever I think about this film (and I often think about this movie), I catch hyming, written on a flute and a tube ... no one knows why. <br /> <br /> Interesting fact - Diamond Head was directed by Jeannot Szwarc, one of three contract directors at Universal, who made much bigger films, in his case Jaws 2. The others were John Badham (War Game), and young Steven Spielberg ...
