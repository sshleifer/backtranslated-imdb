11-year-old Squeamish Luke Benward (as Billy "Worm Boy" Forrester) moves to a new city. In their new school, young Benward are chosen by other boys. They put the worms in their thermos. By controlling his gag reflex, Benward throws a worm on the bulldog Adam Hicks (as Joe Guire). Benward's plants can eat 10 worms in one day - without attention! <br /> <br /> High, ridiculed Hallie Kate Eisenberg (as Erika "Erk" Tansy) uses her archery skills to help Benward. The director and former SCTV writer Bob Dolman promises: "No worms harmed the creation of this film." In a related note, Andrea Martin, the SCTV star, has one funny scene. "How to Eat Fried Worms" is loosely based on the popular novel by Thomas Rockwell. Pre-teen kids in gross-out should enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> **** How to eat fried worms (25/08/06) Bob Dolman ~ Luke Benward, Adam Hicks, Hallie Kate Eisenberg Alexander Gould
