Nowadays this is a kind of trend to look at all the shows from the beginning of the 90s as classics (people are so easily blinded by nostalgia these days), and although some of these concerts were / are undoubtedly good, this one is just pure shit . In those days, I often watched this program because at the time I had a lot of repetitions on television, and even as a child I did not like it. Even an eight-year-old can see how much the people in Power Rangers are worried and how much special sucking FX he was taking then. When the show does not resort to painfully bad scenes of "fight", it harasses the viewer with this unnecessary soap opera about a group of teenagers and from time to time has small social problems. I do not know about you, but I have not given any of these things to a rat donkey, and it's a filler until they have to "fight" with some guy in a very kitschy outfit with fireworks or some toy-robot. You never feel "involved" in some way with this spectacle, and the fact that most of the actors behave as if they had no interest, except that it is a wallet, only increases the lack of feelings. <br /> <br /> There is nothing really memorable about this program, and it's surprising that it has so many spin-offs (Beetleborgs is a good example). All this is just a quick way to make money. I challenge every "fan" to tell me what exactly stands out in episodes that should be so good because I could not find anything that would even be a bit attractive to children. My guess is that most of the "Power Rangers" fans will tell me that "I just do not understand it" or something similar. I really do not care; it was nonsense then, and now it is still nonsense.
