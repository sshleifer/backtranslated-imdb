The orange shade of everything was just nasty. Oh yes, the main character lives in the ghetto, which is orange colored by orange people. In the meantime, in order to mentally escape from this crushing misery of the body, he plays a full immersion video game (which sucks that no rules are clear and there is no logic that follows the game). Apparently, he makes money on the game, but it turns out that he is not an employee of a game company. Many non-speaking pauses later, the story is slow. It uses an orange computer interface with an operational interface that is so annoying visually and I can only suspect the future release of Microsoft. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, I, the viewer, ask basically why a precious moronic game is wasting its precious time when there is barely a need for life? Oh yes, playing games is great fun, but what's the point when you're almost starving? While she meditates about her life, playing a bad, even orange-colored, lame video game with full immersion, her dog escapes (probably looking for an owner who pays him at least a moment of attention and regularly feeds him) or stolen a woman (while she ignores his poor, orange-colored reality). <br /> <br /> In the meantime, it turns over some game in which its band has lost an entire uninteresting movie. Yawn. So I want to be the best of the best, go after Ash Catch (he has to bore us all). Golly, this main character sucks as a human being and has no salutary qualities beyond her physical beauty (which she could change in some way to escape her overwhelming poverty). <br /> <br /> So it reaches the "real" level, or at least it sucks terribly, and she is sent to kill an ex-mate from the team sleeping psychologically at the "Real" level. Finally, the sucky boring movie in orange it's no longer a tedious duty to watch, but it has the potential to say something like "the main character is trapped in imaginary computer poverty, and she's in the real world right now." Maybe he'll murder now and live in the real world? and he disappears in the digital effect, wow, thanks to the idiot director, you suck, you suck so much, director. <br /> <br /> Here, the director had a bit of a chance to buy himself a bit by burying that bad, moronic movie with a philosophical turn shares. <br /> <br /> The director could say: "THE TRUE WORLD is there, and if you live in it and contribute to it, it will be better, it will not it will be a rough, orange-colored land of poverty. " A smart way to make this movie so slow that his lesson was a basic civic pride (for 1% of viewers who did not find something really entertaining or film masochists at the moment). <br /> <br /> No, director. The director had to screw it all up, tossing some damn digital effect and ruining all the chances of buying this awful movie, which was a waste of money, a waste of time and a waste of viewers' trust. <br /> <br /> Then it ends. Fun. I hope the director suffocates. I put this HACK on my "avoid at all costs" list for all other movies to which his name is attached.
