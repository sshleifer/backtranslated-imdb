I saw this movie in a real cinema (probably for $ 2.00) with my cousin and uncle. I think we were around 11 and 12 years old and really scary movies. I remember being so excited that I saw him because my cool uncle let us choose a movie (and probably never did it again!) And then disappointed !! Just boring and not scary. The only thing I remember was Corky Pigeon from Silver Spoons, and it was not that great, just someone I recognized. I've seen bad movies before and this has always been in my mind as the worst. It was from what I can remember, one of the most boring, not terrible, waste of our joint $ 6 and a waste of film. I have read some reviews that say it's worth watching, and I say, "For every his own," but I would not even bother. Even so bad that it's good.
