I commented on the film for the first time because I felt that if the right person read it, it can wake up and do something about it. In the last few months, the ABC family has started broadcasting a new movie format. I saw the last three and I enjoyed them. They were getting involved and doing a trick. My wife likes these movies. I could not wait to see "See Jane Date." The trailers looked and sounded great. Unfortunately, this is one movie in which the book must be light years ahead of the efforts of the writers and musicians involved in this project. It is 2003, the source (everything wrong), the result was as interesting as the elevator in the department store. It was intrusive and did not add any emotional content to the movie. It worked against it. I work in the film and television industry. I like to play. This is one case where I thought it could be worse. The scenario had lines from the next decade and I know that these women can act, but you would not know about this movie. To add to this holistic experience, the end of me shook my head. Advice for Disney directors, ABC, ABC Family and producers: under no circumstances hire a composer or musical supervisor to make any future films. They lost contact and must understand what the word "contemporary", "today" and "current" mean, describing the romantic comedy. The world passes you. A huge disappointment on the part of people from Von Zerneck-Sertner and ABC Family.
