Yes, unfortunately I came across a DVD with this and I found that it was incredibly horrible. <br /> <br /> First of all, the characters suck. I mean, give me a break if some dork in an orange cap who calls himself "Orange Sherbert" is the best idea that these guys could come up with for a character, they definitely should not be on the movie scene. Poor "costumes", bad "interviews" and basically no one "wrestler" on the entire album with a bit of charisma. <br /> <br /> "Wrestling" in Splatter Rampage Wrestling is just these idiots bouncing on the trampoline gently and playfully. They giggle together all the time, making the experience seem more fun than "wrestling deathmatch". <br /> <br /> Essentially, Splatter Rampage Wrestling is a pretty vague clone of Backyard Wrestling. Only, instead of blood, weapons, chaos and WRESTLING, we get a trampoline, giggling children, TERRIBLE audio and some guy named Orange Sherbert. <br /> <br /> Wrestling fan or not, avoid this DVD. It's terrible.
