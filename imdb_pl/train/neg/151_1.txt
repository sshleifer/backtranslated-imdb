This is really terrible. <br /> <br /> The only option that can help in this movie is that the next time people ask me what the worst vampire movie I've ever seen, I'll have the right answer. <br /> <br /> I think it's filmed at 35 mm, so it's already tacky as hell. I would not care about commenting, but I noticed that some fanboys (probably related to the movie) claimed that it was the best movie since the Matrix. Let me disprove myths and lies. <br /> <br /> There is nothing good in the film. Everything shouts cheesy. The actress is ugly. Battle choreography is the worst I have ever seen. The battle scenes are incredibly amateur. Imagine a girl helplessly waving her hands in a circle and delivering weak kicks that would not hurt a cat. Of course, the director simply pulled people off the street to give them roles in the film. <br /> <br /> I know that the director did not have much budget for the film, but even better films were made on a smaller budget. Unpardonable.
