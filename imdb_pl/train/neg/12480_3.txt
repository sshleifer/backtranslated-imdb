... More precisely, it's so bad that you will have the time of your life laughing at your ass when you watch it! "Deathstalker" by James Sbardellati in 1983 is certainly one of the most terrible productions brought by the sub-genre Sword & Sorcery, but it is very funny. Acting is terrible, the plot is clear, and the effects and photography can not be more amateurish. But it's bad acting, bad effects and many mistakes that make this movie so funny. <br /> <br /> - SPOILERY AHEAD - <br /> <br /> Deathstalker (Rick Hill) is an extremely strong and skilled warrior. One day a good witch obliges him to unite the three powers of chaos and creation, sword, amulet and chalice, to free the country from the brutal ruler, evil king and wizard Munkar. Getting a sword is quite easy, but the amulet and cup are owned by Munkar. Fortunately, the evil king organized a tournament in which the most talented county warriors fight each other until death. The winner is then taking over the king's place. Of course, the king does not want anyone to take his place, so he planned to kill the winner (instead of simply not organizing the tournament). Deathstalker not only has to gain three creature powers, but also save the old, good, wonderful daughter of the king (Barbi Benton) from the clutches of the evil Munkar. Fortunately, he is not bored on the way to the tournament, because in the meantime he is allowed to tan the great warrior Kaira (Lana Clarkson) ... <br /> <br /> The film has many great, incredibly stupid and funny scenes. Some of my favorite scenes are: <br /> <br /> - Deathstalker pulls the evil guy with his sword. The head that falls, however, is not the head of this guy. The falling head has a red goatee, while the guy beheaded by Deathstalker had dark hair and no beard. <br /> <br /> - When the figure of female warrior Kaira (Lana Clarkson) is introduced, she is first seen in a black robe, concealing her face and body. Deathstalker's traveling companion, Oghris (Richard Brooker), fights her, and during the sword fight her robe opens (under which, of course, topless), revealing her breasts. Her breasts are the first thing we see at Lana Clarkson, even before her face. <br /> <br /> - The last warrior Deathstalker has to fight in the tournament, he is a huge guy with the body of a man and the head of a pig. <br /> <br /> - Bad Munkar has an ugly little creature locked in a chest. He feeds small human beings with eyeballs and fingers. <br /> <br /> ... There are many other involuntarily funny, fun and great scenes. Acting is horrible, but Barbi Benton and the late Lana Clarkson are naive and even though I described the movie as "unintentionally funny", sometimes I had the impression that some actors were absolutely aware of how ugly the movie is. There's a lot of gore and a lot of naked women to keep the viewer entertained. "Deathstalker" is an incredibly horrible movie, but I still recommend it highly. People with a sense of humor will have the time of their lives!
