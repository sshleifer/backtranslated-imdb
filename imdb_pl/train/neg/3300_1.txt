Quite typical for Swedish films of this type. Strange that the acting was so bad that these actors usually give a good performance. Throwing was poorly made, it made you expect something (I will not tell you what). The main character was horrible ... I do not know where they find her. In any case, stay away from this and go see "Den Tredje VÃ¥gen", this is the Swedish action in prime.
