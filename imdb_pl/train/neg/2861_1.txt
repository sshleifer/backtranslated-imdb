I can not believe that I have wasted money to rent this movie. I thought it was a porn movie when it started and it never was better. Acting, music drowning actors. Awful. Save money! You have to read the movie all the way, because they knew that music would drown speech lines. I never got a role in a slaughterhouse or the need to show how cows and pigs are murdered. What did this have to do with the "real" assassin of BTK? I understand why there were no actresses of famous actors in this film. The script would turn me away from the first page of reading. It would be better if you were watching how the paint dries.
