OK, clear and simple, if you're a fan of other Tomb Raider games (yes, even AOD) KEEP AWAY FROM THE LEGEND. <br /> <br /> This is undoubtedly the most disappointing TR game. It looks very nice, it sounds very nice, but it is completely impossible to play and I gave up. I feel as if I have been robbed by Eidos. <br /> <br /> It's very simple. TR was a PC game against anything else. You control Lara using the keyboard. In 6 Tomb Raider games, the controls were standard. The AODs were "tacky" but still the same general control sequences. In the legend, they completely changed their methods of movement and control, and she is completely uncontrolled. <br /> <br /> I've seen comments from other people who say "Use your mouse". No, why should I? Others say "Use the gamepad". No, why should I? Others say, "But for years it has been a third party audit standard." Well, I do not care, this is not a standard for any other TR game, so why bother to do it. Oh, I know, because they do not care about the original, loyal fan base, they want to make money on new children who have not even heard about this series until movies appear and they do not make more money. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> My advice for every big TR fan is kept away from this game, and if you buy, complain about Eidos. I've seen a lot of other posts, mainly on the Eidos forums, from people telling them what trash they may be listening to.
