Just horrible! Why would not you use real actors? Listen, it must end! Stop using non-actors! If you want any credibility or any message sent through these low-budget movies ... please, love God, use real actors! Most will work for free ... use it! Returning to my comment ... in any case, the humor was lower than the humor in the bathroom and was not funny at any level. In terms of quality ... in one scene shot on a public transport bus, you could see the reflection of the crew ... guess what? It was one guy with what looked like a Sony camera and probably not even him. Well, I assume that the only audience for this movie are people with a high fetish ... and it was not even a good gore.
