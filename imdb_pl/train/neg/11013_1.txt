I'm in bad movies, but NIC does not allow it. Despite what the morons said above, it is NOT funny. I know comedy and underground movies, but it's so boring that the director / writer is not allowed to EVER steer anything but local cable access! To love movies and comedies is to despise this movie. I can never deal with how unpleasant and boring work was. If you like this movie, YOU ARE a monster, how sober NOTHING is not here. ZERO! If you want to compare underground movies, see "Kentucky Fried Movie" or early John Waters. The film begins with the definition of satire and opposes anyone who shows me satire. The principle of the comedy is THEN ... If it's FUN, you can say or do EVERYTHING, but if it's NOT funny, you're not satirical, you're not annoyed, you're just pathetic, and this movie is not just fun. ZERO!
