Isabelle Huppert is a great actor. The director of "La Pianiste" understands this, providing the viewer with long shots of Huppert's face, and it is a pleasure to see. Huppert is not an animated actor - he records emotions with the slightest raising of eyebrows or the flickering of a smile. <br /> <br /> In addition to the pleasure of watching how an experienced actor excels in his profession, there is nothing in it that makes me want to recommend it. (Well, if you like self-mutilation, sado-masochism, and bizarre behavior, "La Pianiste" may work for you.Of these attributes, I could not find any value in it.) <br /> <br /> Buried in this whole weird the material is the nucleus of truth. People who compete at the highest level - musically, athletically, whatever - start out as strange people and are shaped in strangers by a competitive environment. <br /> <br /> It's not worth traveling to the cinema to learn this life lesson again. <br /> <br />
