I wanted to like this movie, yes, it's SAW, blah blah ripoff, but I like these movies. If done well, it had all the ingredients of being a good, not brilliant, but a good movie .... unfortunately, these ingredients went! Acting was terrible, and this was first observed when captives were depicted with their abductor one by one (hoods removed), the attention and one liner are just terrible, yes I know bad writing ... but this is more it was bad writing in combination with bad actions. Two prisoners were in a relationship with each other and did not even admit it until the movie became even more ..... <br /> <br /> Excuse me, I'm even wondering why I'm bothering about this movie at all. <br /> <br /> I'll end up with PLOT HOLES, PLOT HOLES and MORE HOLES! DISAPPOINTING!
