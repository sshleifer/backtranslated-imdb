The first lesson that some filmmakers (especially those inspired by Hollywood) need to know - simply "style" does not sell. I think Tashan will mean style after translating. Secondly, if you are infamously willing to sell your style, it does not save you from a decent story. <br /> <br /> Tashan has a story that could be enough for a better director. But it is not slippery. For example, all three - Saif, Kareena and Akshay - are narrators at various points in the story. But this configuration is not used correctly. There could be a better connection and match their narrative. The action sequences come from the seventies. <br /> <br /> The movie's film-making is terrible. I think that Vaibhavi Kupiec just slept this movie. Vishal-Shekhar has a good result but is not part of this movie. Why is there a Sufi song (Dil Haara) in Tashan? Why is the cool song Hinglish (Dil Dance Maare) not on Anil Kapoor when he is an Englishman? <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is an economical grace of the film. But he is in his stereotypical self. You do not mind this movie.
