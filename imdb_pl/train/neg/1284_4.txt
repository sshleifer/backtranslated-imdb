This film was very extensive without climax. People who ultimately relate to sword fighting must either be deprived of their mind or not have one. Too often, this movie was soft. I'm not saying that soft films are bad. But no matter how much you like sugar, you should not have room for a T-bone steak. This movie was supposed to be revenge for crimes committed against culture, but ended up in a small battle. And there was only one of them who really knew what a sword was; The character of Tim Roth (and yes, he plays it well). Rob Roy was a weak "hero" who did not know how to use the sword, and the way he "won" was a disgrace. As a drama, the film had its periods, but the best results in it must have the nature of Scotland. This is one breath too little when it is referred to as "soap" in my book.
