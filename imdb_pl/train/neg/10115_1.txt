My personal mission was to follow the people responsible for this film. I even got a company hiring money from me because I claimed they had made false advertising. <br /> <br /> It's not enough that the movie itself is p.o.s., but the cover sold me. I did better makeup effects on my children in Halloween than what the film actually represents compared to the cover. Can you say "eyes shed?" <br /> <br /> I will not waste more time going into details, but give me peace, the main character of the movie is a Los Angeles police officer who was born and raised in Alabama - but he has German accent!?! It does not offend.
