it's not one of those movies, it's one of the biggest pieces of tripe I've ever had, working in the camera trying to be flashy, but it's really bullshit, the whole thing looks like red diaries from shoes, but no sex, The only reason for which I bought it, I wanted to try the DVD and it was the cheapest I could find, maybe the worst purchase in my life and it could tear you away from the DVD forever, the soundtrack is REALLY cheesy and most of the movie is made up of endless repetition clips from the first two films, why someone would like to make a movie as horrible as it is outside me, if they really tried to create an original movie and failed, I would be nicer in this review, but they do not just have the right to play the first two, and then edit and repeat them in this video with maybe less than 1/3 of the original movie material that them st comply with the standards of film school students, DO NOT buy this movie. The only entertainment that dvd can offer is to place it in the microwave and watch flashing lights! UTTER UTTER UTTER UTTTER UNUSUAL GARBAGE! 0/10, if the voting system allows it.
