This movie has a beautiful scenery. Unfortunately, there is no story. To have a plot, there must be a conflict. This movie had none. He spent two hours painting a beautiful scene and never put any activity in it. The painting tries to be artistic, but it does not pay attention to the basics of telling a story. <br /> <br /> If you love Montana's set design and fly fishing, you'll find value in this movie, just do not expect history. No such.
