A horrible movie with pieces of Ramones. Your worse than the average comedy format from the '70s and' 80s showing cool children taking over a school with some capricious plan. This movie is horrible. The plot consists of a girl who likes Ramones and a school that wants to fight the oppressive administration. Forget about this movie and watch something like Wild Zero with Guitar Wolf, if you want a fun B movie. A terribly acting, awful letter, a horrible conspiracy with the seal of Ramones, who probably needed quick money, so they said yes to this movie. This is the only logical thing I can think about because this movie is blowing.
