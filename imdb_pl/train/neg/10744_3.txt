At first, they were mainly giant rats, but there were also wasps and giant chicken. This one, however, is just a gigantic period of rats, giant rats and one really growing boy. It is about this growing boy and scientist who is trying to help him, so he accidentally creates gigantic deadly rats ... you know how it is. This movie has a few kills and its moments, but I think it is on par with the original, I prefer some variation in my gigantic films about creatures. Well, that's not true ... I actually like "Ant's Empire", maybe I just do not care about gigantic rodents. All in all, a fairly gloomy movie, though it has one quite strange turn of events in this one sequence of dreams that is really bizarre. I just can not recommend this.
