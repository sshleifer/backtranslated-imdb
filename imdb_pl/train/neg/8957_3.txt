Incredible. Is this something stupid? No way. Stupidity in this film would even embarrass Ed Wood, De Palma and Woo. If the first part of the series had an average dialog box and the second had a wrong dialog box, then a moronic dialog appears in this window. Amazing. But this time the story has also been reduced to the level of the dialog. Despite acting and dialogue, I liked the first two films, but "Cube Zero" will surely kill the franchise. The completely moronic plot is so clear from the frustrated leftist wing pen. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I wonder if these leftists even realize how anti-democratic and pro-dictator they are. In this movie, apparently they are targeting in the USA? democration. Why will not they attack Korea, Iran, Syria, China, Zimbabwe, etc. In anti-war films? Sure, most of these places will probably not create such a cube in the near future, but it does not matter. It's obvious: garbage writers really admire these kinds of regimes, regardless of whether they are aware of it or not. I would even go so far as to say that EVERYONE, who constantly attacks American foreign policy all the time, has anti-democratic beliefs in its core. <br /> <br /> Returning to the film: in addition to being so far-fetched that it is not even fun anymore, the movie has a lot of obvious illogicality. For example, for some reason, the two men who supervise the ankle did this for a while and are unaware of the pain and sadism that the project entails, but the first of them suddenly turns against the system! Anyone who has any idea about human nature will see this idiocy. Or maybe a moronic figure, one-eyed evil bureaucrat who speaks as if he was in the wrong comedy of Mel Brooks. In fact, as soon as this creature appears, the movie loses ALL the seriousness, and thus the chance of excitement: it really becomes a comedy.
