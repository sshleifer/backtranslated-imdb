You must realize that when the name of the star is mistakenly listed in the opening credits, you are not having fun (the credit is "Cuba Gooding, J.R."). Some nice car chase, shoot, shoot, if EVERYTHING you want is an action, because the relationship with what exists is, at best, frail and totally unbelievable. Motivations of heroes, especially Gooding at the end, are worse than unbelievable, they are irrational when they are not hopelessly confusing. I can only think that Andy Cheng must be a really nice guy to get many good actors for this filthy project (he can not have all of them on them, right?).
