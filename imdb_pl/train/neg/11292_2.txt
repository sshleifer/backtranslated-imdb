Cornel Wilde and three dumbbells are looking for a sunken treasure in the South Atlantic. <br /> <br /> The treasure hunters led by Wilde are fighting a group of territorial sharks with sweet, small taunts on their hungry faces. Wilde and his cheerful people have to find a way to remove the menu so they can start digging up an old Spanish galleon filled with bars of gold. <br /> <br /> After the crew engages in a small eternity of pushing, pushing, arguing and listening to Wilde's irritating health tips, 5 crazy condemned men get on the boat and complicate matters. Now is the battle of cunning when it comes to who gets the treasure and who will see what the interior of the shark's stomach looks like. <br /> <br /> At least Wilde is wearing exactly the same thing as "The Naked Prey" 10 years ago and he has been in excellent condition. <br /> <br /> Made of 75 cents budget.
