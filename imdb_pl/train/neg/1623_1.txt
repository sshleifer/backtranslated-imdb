The support of a TV series on the works of a popular author does not guarantee success. Yorkshire TV learned it the hard way, when in 1979 they bought the rights to books assigned to Dick Francis, three of which were broadcast under the common title "The Racing Game". Mike Gwilym was Sid Halley, a former jockey who changed the private eye after an accident in which he lost his right hand to replace him with an artificial one. Gwilym suffered from a sharp lack of charisma (and looked like one of the bad guys), while Mick Ford (who played annoying Chico Barnes) made me think about the horse's ass whenever he was on the screen. For six weeks this less dynamic duet accused the village, defeating evil conspiracies to repair races, usually with the same methods - blackmail, kidnapping riders or cheering horses. Yorkshire television threw money for the exhibition, but to no avail. Violent, sexist, stretched and repetitive, he was quickly transferred to the playground for knackers.
