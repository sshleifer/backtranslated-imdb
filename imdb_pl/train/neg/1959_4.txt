Fairy is the spirit of an old, distorted witch who lures children into his home to get a reward for their loose tooth and then takes their lives. The first few minutes show the beginning of the legend about the fairy from 1949, and then it continues to this day. The spent horror is largely saved by solid acting. They could have done without the Hammond brothers and a few other scenes, but in general the gore scenes were bloody, but fast, which had a minimizing effect. Eye candy is quite good for both sexes. The camera operation is good. Dialogue is honest, but tacky. I expected that the film would be naked, with a low budget, more modest and with few exchangeable factors. I was surprised by the quality of the film.
