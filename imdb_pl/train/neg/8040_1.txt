In the dorm, the guy is killed by someone with a scythe. His girlfriend Beth (Dorie Barton) discovers him and tries to commit suicide. It is institutionalized. A year later she left, has a new boy named Hank (Joseph Lawrence) and intends to spend Spring Break with Hank and four other mindless friends in BIG, a beautiful Florida home. Of course, the killer appears (for a reason) and starts killing again. <br /> <br /> A small destructive thriller - a textbook example of how NOT to do a low-budget horror movie. For starters, large fragments of this film are a BLENDER filler of these six idiots, who record video themselves, "playing" (more fun than the audience), getting drunk, playing stupidly, etc. Etc. There is no nakedness at all. I'm not saying that horror needs nudity, but EVERYTHING to revive it would help. No death is really shown (you hear them), they're just a little bloody and no blood. There is one REAL macabre - but it's not really. <br /> <br /> With some exceptions, acting sucks. Dorie Barton is terrible because the main woman and Tom Jay Jones are as bad as Oz. Chad Allen appears as Brad and is terrible. Lawrence is really very good - handsome and hunky, who gives his all. And Jeff Conaway appears in a small role doing quite a good job. <br /> <br /> Logic abounds - after they realize that a friend has been killed, two girls talk casually about sex; Baston's lack of reaction at the sight of killing his friend is quite funny and WHAT happens with Lawrence? His character disappears without a trace at the end! Boring, stupid, without blood, without nakedness - skip this one. <br /> <br /> Rated R for graphic violence and some vulgarisms.
