This remake of TV classic Billy Wilder from 1973 is worse than the original. Surprise! <br /> <br /> First of all, good things. Lee J. Cobb makes a great Barton Keyes. Of course, he's not as good as Edward G. Robinson, but that's the only reason to watch it. The only improvement of this remake compared to the original is that it limits the role of Lola Dietrichson, stepdaughter femme fatale, Phyllis Dietrichson. <br /> <br /> And that's good things. <br /> <br /> Bad things are numerous. The director records everything indifferently: if you watch a movie with muted sound, it's hard to get the impression that something particularly interesting is happening. Due to the contemporary bad taste, the film must be in color instead of black and white. Due to the bad taste from the 70's all sets are distastefully ugly. Walter Neff's particularly expensive apartment is hideous. <br /> <br /> A modern environment hurts in many small ways. Traveling by train was a bit more unusual in the 1970s than in the 1940s, so Mr. Dietrichson's decision about the train seems more ingenious. Men have stopped wearing hats, which prevents Walter from covering his brown hair, pretending to be white-haired Mr. Dietrichson. Women in mourning ceased to wear veils, which robs Samantha Eggar from the props Barbara Stanwyck, who used the key scene very well. (Oddly, Lola still has a line where she reveals that her stepmother was trying on a black hat and veil before she needed them.) Stephen Bochco keeps most of Billy Wilder's script by Raymond Chandler itself. But he does a lot of small, inexplicable changes in the dialogue that leave the scenario slightly flabby when he was once thin and muscular. Outrageously, there is no longer a famous banter on a motorcycle-clay, but look carefully and you will see what the post-production cut in which these lines should look like. Bochco may not be guilty. <br /> <br /> Richard Crenna is passable as Walter Neff. What could make this version bearable is really great Phyllis Dietrichson. Instead, we get Samantha Eggar, who falls like the typical villain of "Barnaby Jones." But who can blame Eggar? With the director who hardly seems interested in what is happening in front of the camera, how could Barbara Stanwyck escape well?
