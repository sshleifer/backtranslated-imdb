"Ask the Dust" looked intriguing with the trailer, and we especially like all the actors. Unfortunately, the movie was not convincing enough to be considered a drama, and it was not fun enough to be a comedy. Practically it seemed to be satirizing itself and giving no entertainment effect. After seventy minutes of waiting for the situation to improve, my wife and I left, appreciating that we are not wasting any more time on such nonsense. It simply was not interesting, moving, funny or artistic. It looks like it was written, produced and directed by a high school student; What is worse, it was such a heinous waste of extraordinarily talented actors, let alone our time and money.
