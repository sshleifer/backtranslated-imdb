It was one of the worst WrestleMania I ever saw. It just really did not stand out. As for the cards, I thought it would be quite good, but every match seemed to be short. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit Vs. MVP One of the better matches. Benoit carried it. I just did not think MVP was so great, but Benoit signed this game. <br /> <br /> Kane vs. Khali Wow, these two guys do not mix. Or maybe Khali and another living person do not mix. A terrible match. <br /> <br /> Melina Vs. Ashley I'm not a fan of women's wrestling. <br /> <br /> ECW Originals Vs. New Breed I was excited about this match until I saw it. Really, really disappointing. <br /> <br /> Edge vs. CM Punk Vs. King Booker Vs. Jeff Hardy Vs. Matt Hardy Vs. Mr. Kennedy Vs. Finlay vs. Randy Orton Absolutely the worst MITB match so far. Only a great disappointment for many people in the ring at the same time. He just did not live. <br /> <br /> Bobby Lashley Vs. Umaga O.K. not very impressive, but not the worst at night. <br /> <br /> Batista Vs. Undertaker It was probably the best match of the night. Very, very, very nice to see something good for change. <br /> <br /> John Cena versus Shawn Michaels I really feel that this match deserves the last one. People are in favor of Batista vs. Undertaker, but this match was just as good. I'm starting to get sick seeing that Price wins every game. It's getting a bit old. Now I have to say that I feel that this match is the best at night, but I'm a big fan of Shawn Michaels, so I'm a bit biased. Batista vs. "Taker could have been better, but I'm biased, so ... I'm sorry. The last two were without a doubt the best games of the night, and everything else really came out short.
