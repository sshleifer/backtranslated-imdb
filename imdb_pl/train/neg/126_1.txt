"I Am Curious: Yellow" is a risky and pretentious steaming pile. It does not matter what political views are, because it is difficult to take seriously at any level. As for the claim that the nudity of the male head is automatic NC-17, this is not true. I've seen videos with an R grade with male nudity. It is true that they offer only fleeting views, but where are the videos with the grade R with open vulva and labia? Nowhere, because they do not exist. The same applies to these shit cable shows: schlongs swinging in the wind, but not the clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies, like The Brown Bunny, where we treat the side of pulsing Johnson Vincent Gallo, but there's no trace of the pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or suggesting) a "double standard" in matters of nudity, the mentally blunt should take into account one unavoidable obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals, when actresses appear naked, and the same can not be said for a man. In fact, in the American film you will not usually see female genitalia, not to mention pornography or explicit eroticism. This presumed double standard is a less double standard than the depressing ability to reconcile with the interiors of women's bodies.
