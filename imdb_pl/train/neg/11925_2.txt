It's a very strange movie ... I was not sure what's going on, some of N London's can not find a silent kid in the woods, who everyone thinks is an oracle and somehow makes them all their own way, change something in their life that usually ends disaster. The movie ended after about 90 minutes, leaving me unhappy, almost annoyed with the vanity of all this. I did not care about any of them - none of them had a chance to get attached to the viewer. <br /> <br /> What was the message? Am I dimmed? It was just too weird. What happens to Runner? Why does Emilio shoot a kid? ... it did not make sense, senseless. Can anyone help me understand this mess of the movie?
