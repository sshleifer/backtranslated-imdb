The author embarks on a "journey of discovery" of his "roots" in the southern tobacco industry, because he believes that (completely and deservedly forgotten) the film "Bright Leaf" is about his ancestor. It is not, and in fact he does not discover even the gentle interest in this absolutely stupid and indulgent, homely film, suitable for shows at the director's drunken family meetings, but certainly not for a commercial or even non-commercial version. A good reminder of why most independent films are not picked up by the biggest studios - because they are boring, irrelevant and not interesting to anyone but the director and his closest circle. Avoid at all costs!
