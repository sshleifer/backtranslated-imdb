This is the best example of a low budget, winning with a good story. Let's bring back Samaire Armstrong (after seeing her work on OC I know she can do better), then find a better scenario and budget. <br /> <br /> The special effects were so bad, and mostly badly generated by the computer that almost lost me for the first time the wolf was seen on the screen. And Samaire Armstrong (vigilant!) Changing to a werewolf has been made by reducing her to the bad form of GCIF before she even begins to change (people of Final Fantasy, as well as Pixar did the ridiculous, think of the character as a naked Barbie Doll). <br /> <br /> The story was interesting, although the idea of ​​a bloodline for werewolves is nothing new. And he also got into the balance between evil, (maybe) not so bad, and the possible end of mankind, if these two lines would burn. The "book about the werewolf line" section, which for some time influenced some other characters in a spell-like manner, was effective, but it could be extended in explaining what happened in the past. <br /> <br /> Bring a better scenario and direction, and I'll come back again.
