He only gets a third count (for Arthur Treacher and Virginia Field), but this was David Niven's first role in the lead role, and he is delightfully stupid as PG Wodehouse's duo, Bertie Wooster, master (only by name) for Jeeves, the most steadfast the butler. As an adaptation, it resembles a more watered 39 KROKI than a real trip to Wodehousian. It's a pity, because the interaction between Treacher and Niven is not too far away. Unfortunately, the mysterious tracks of the movie "B" and forced comedy become tiresome even after a short 57 minutes. Another year of observation (STEP LIVELA, JEEVES) was even more unbearable, because Bertie was not in sight, and Jeeves (from all people!) Forced to play.
