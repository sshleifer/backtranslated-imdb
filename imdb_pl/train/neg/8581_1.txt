The apology for the film is absolutely nothing! Rachel Griffiths must have needed money. The film had to be made on a very low budget, because the lighting did not exist. I made a vow if I ever see Pete Postlesumthingor who is going to commit suicide. I would be happy if we knew if there was 1) a plot or 2) a script. I regret the most that I wasted my time watching this trash.
