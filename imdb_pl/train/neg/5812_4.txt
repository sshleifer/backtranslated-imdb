"This story is dedicated to women," according to the introduction, "who fought for their rights since Adam and Eve started a system of loose leaves". When the "Polityka" was filmed, the 19th Amendment, guaranteeing women the right to vote, was only ten years old. And the film deals with the exercise of political power by women as an electoral group. Opting for the ban and closing speakeasies was the main concern of the then women. <br /> <br /> The good-natured Marie Dressler (as Hattie Burns) becomes politically active when a young woman is shot and killed with speakeasy. She wants the joints selling alcohol to be closed; and he is incarcerated in the run of the mayor, after making a speech at a women's rally. Mrs Dressler is supported by tenants, the best friend of Polly Moran (as Ivy Higgins) and her stuttering husband Roscoe Ates (as Peter Higgins). The dress of the dress-keeper for the mayor of Lake City evokes male opposition in the city; So Dressler orders women to strike, denying them "everything" in the "living room, bedroom and bathroom". <br /> <br /> The movie sounds much better than it turned out. Honestly, humor is not very good; and contains some uninteresting and moderately offensive situations ("You look like Madame Queen" refers to Amos and Andy). And this time the mixing of shooters and slapstick is not good. Producers could have seen the movie more dramatic, focusing solely on Dressler and the characters played by William Bakewell (as Benny Emerson) and Karen Morley (as Myrtle Burns). <br /> <br /> **** Politics (7/25/31) Charles Reisner ~ Marie Dressler, Polly Moran, Roscoe Ates
