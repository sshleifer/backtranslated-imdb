I'm a nice person, so I gave this movie 2 instead of 1. It was without a doubt the worst movie I've seen in a long time. There was very little conspiracy, and the deeper interesting areas that were touched, i.e. What Jesus really wanted us to know, were transparent and instead got a heavy visual dose of sadistic punishment aimed at our heroine (Arquette). A complete crucifixion within the first 15 minutes would be more humane both for her character and for the audience. Acting was barely there, and the direction was little inspired. And if I saw another drop of water or a pigeon flying towards the camera, I could start screaming louder than Patricia.
