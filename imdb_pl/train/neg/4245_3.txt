This movie was based on facts? I sincerely hope not! <br /> <br /> We see how many armed cops empty the same amount of weapons in 2 guys who only have an armored torso. It's a great idea; aim at the armor! ... I'm sorry, but how about those big, thick, elusive heads or their legs to loud crying? Or maybe they were protected by invisible tanks? Was this something like that? <br /> <br /> This movie started quite well, but after 20 minutes of shooting it really turns into boring. <br /> <br /> And this documentary style did not work for me, but it is something that can be found nice or not. <br /> <br /> Very unbelievable things that make it difficult to see it to the end. <br /> <br /> 3/10 for correct editing.
