Wow, this movie was sucked. I've heard that this movie very well expresses the importance of friendship. And with all the internet hype in this movie, I thought, what could go wrong? However, the movie was just bad. It was boring, and character development never existed. Space travelers are also a terrible movie, if you did not like this movie, there is no way you would like it.
