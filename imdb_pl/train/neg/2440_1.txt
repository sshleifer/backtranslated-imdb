Koen Wouters is a Flemish singer and presenter. In the early nineties, he tried his hand in films. But this unbelievable piece of trash ended his acting career once and for all. She also finished her acting career of Dutch actress Nada van Nie, who was the wife of a football TV presenter and programmer. Actually, I saw it in the (almost empty) theater, because I was a fan of Koen Wouters, Clouseau. So I regret spending money on it. It looks cheap, it's a terrible story and it's badly done in every way possible. Some people think it's so bad it's funny. I'm not one of them. I just found an incredible waste of time and money.
