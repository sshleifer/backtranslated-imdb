... THE CAUSE IS A CRAP! This kind of movie that makes you want to go and hit the movie producer and say "WHY?". The awful work of the camera ... count the times when the camera tries to stay stable on one person and can not. Dialogue is funny. Acting is comical. It looks like they've taken over the ghost town in the west to see if they can make a movie with as little money as possible. I bet they will do it for $ 10, which they used home video cameras. Either that or most of the cameramen were drunk. Really trailers are more entertaining than a movie. If you ever want to host the 'worst film party', take this one. You want more entertainment ... gaping into the wall.
