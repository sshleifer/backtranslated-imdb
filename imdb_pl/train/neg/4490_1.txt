You would expect a movie made with about $ 300,000 in budget to at least provide entertainment for the time you spend time in the cinema watching it. "Matrix Reloaded" proves that this assumption is wrong. <br /> <br /> The "Matrix" worked better, despite the visible holes in the logic of history. At least no one could explain to me why beating the bot (agent) inside the simulation (aka martix) would harm the responsible computer program in any way ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the Wachowski brothers did exactly this "aggressive blow" is the main issue in "Matrix Reloaded": this is an o-frame with great sound. These battle scenes may be sufficient (or even cool) within 5 seconds. trailer, but extended for a few minutes, apparently faked, badly choreographed and repeated over and over again, it's nothing more than boring. Despite the promised stunts that have been promised, there is nothing more than simple, unimaginable strokes, eg. Seen (or better). "Movies" by Van Damme. The difference in post-production (etherything is 5 times faster, the camera hovers around and freezes on some scenes, and this repeats itself for at least 5 minutes) does not help here, all of this has nothing to do with the very meaning of "martial arts". In addition to these "fights", all actors do not want to do what they pay for: playing. <br /> <br /> What happens outside the fight scenes? Not much outside of Hollywood routine. This oh-so-multicultural group of hippies who have been drawn into "Waterworld", is processed as a citizen of "Zion" (supports the last city on earth), and on the order of Morpheus begin to dance, because it is a good opportunity to show a lot of barely covered tits and ass. O-so popular frogs aka French frogs talking with a silent accent "je ne sais quoi", who is wasting a fortune because of the "liason d'amour", is bravely supported. After this (and unwanted amusing) is the fight between Neo and the sinister supporters of the "frog", because it takes place in Erie Flynn like an enterieur, fortunately with a lot of weapons for decoration. For Neo posing with hellebarda, add only 2 stairs and many statues (for destruction, throwing on bad guys and the like) and you will get 5 more senseless, boring mines. this garbage. <br /> <br /> What can you expect? The usual merchandising hell. And "revolutions" that will happen or not - certainly without me.
