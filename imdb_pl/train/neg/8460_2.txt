I borrowed this movie only thanks to the promises of William Dafoe and Robert Rodriguez. I assumed that seeing the name RR on the cover (as an actor), this movie would be good. It sounds like a movie Rodriguez would have done if he wanted to give it his name rather than be good, right? WRONG WRONG. Definitely the worst edition since 'Manos Hands of Fate'. The way it was edited did not make sense and made the movie impossible, and after the first 30 minutes you will not even want to follow it anymore. I have no idea how Dafoe and Rodriguez got involved in this movie, maybe they owe it to someone, but they're good at it. Besides, they were only in this movie for a few minutes, and Rodriguez did not even talk. So if you want to see a movie with poor editing, bad acting and misleading story than being my guest, do not say you were not warned.
