This film is a great steaming pile. <br> I have no idea why our people (gay Americans) tend to perceive Striesand as a kind of treasure. At least in my opinion, she professionally reached the top with Funny Girl, and Bogdanovich's What's Up Doc. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and rent a class of Judy, or even the original (a great movie in itself), but please, please, skip this stink!
