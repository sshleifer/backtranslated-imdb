I rented this movie solely because I liked the cover. However, I immediately regretted the beginning of the film. It looks like they used a home video camera to shoot the movie and let the baby do it. They also used inadequate ghostly faces and shapes to try to scare people, but I found myself laughing, and I could put it together and do it better. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, I felt that he had some really good ideas, but because of suspicious lines and in some cases, they were in the shadow. He had no direction. <br /> <br /> I did not want to sit because it caused physical pain to watch him, but I always finish what I start, so I took a deep breath and let him continue. I've definitely wasted 98 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> I would have spared embarrassment knowing that you were watching "Haunted Boat" and found something that is more entertaining. I am a fan of low-budget horror films, but it was a big disappointment when I thought nothing could worsen after "Terror Toons", but it made me think again. And we owe our species. <br /> <br /> * with ***** (The star relies on the ideas that the worst fears will come after them)
