If you're experiencing the wonders of cinema for the first time, if you've never seen "Moving Picture" before, you think this movie is a child of gods. BUT if you've seen a movie, TV show and even Barney Dinosaur, this movie will not be impressed. Heck Barney the dinosaur was even more realistic than the dinosaurs in this movie. <br /> <br /> Now I like B movies. I just watched "The Giant Gila Monster" just before watching this sink and I liked the movie much better. It works like a B movie. It has a lamer dialog box, hacker acting, tacky effects and honest gosh as a monster! Carno 3 just does not put too many blows into the movie B. He's got a little gore, and this guy from Polchek is close to being funny a few times, but this movie is disappointing, almost ... flaccid. It's a small engine that could not be seen in dinosaur movies. I'm not saying you should not watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Some people can watch drying the rubber on the pavement and feel funny. If you are one of these people, give this film a chance.
