I know the fantastic book "Goodnight Mister Tom" for absolutely centuries and only recently have I had the opportunity to watch this adaptation. I have heard many positive comments on this subject, so I had high hopes. After the end of this movie, I was terrified. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a good movie at all. "Goodnight Mister Tom" was an exceptionally poor adaptation and almost 4.5 / 10 of the book was omitted. In particular, I discovered that many characters and some great scenes in the book were not in it. There was not much dialogue, it was hurried and too fast, but I was mostly nervous about the fact that you never saw the relationship and love between William Beech and Tom in the movie, which was a real disappointment. Throwing was not very good. I thought it could be really good, but it was so different from the book! Extremely poor adaptation, one of the worst I've seen. It deserves a decent remake, which should be 1000 times better than this pile of junk.
