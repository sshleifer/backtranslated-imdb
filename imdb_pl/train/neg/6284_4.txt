I liked the initial premise of this movie, which led me to hunt it, but the problem I quickly discovered is that one knows what will happen in the first 20-30 minutes (the double game will be come from behind the mirror and take over everyone). <br /> <br /> There is no real twist (which is okay), but the final disclosure also does not make much sense (how can it be burdened with uncertainty and fear of the whole movie if it is a bad id from outside the mirror?). <br /> <br /> Admittedly the scenes "out of the mirror" were chilling in their veins when they first appeared, and the murder of the blonde is also terrifying, but ultimately, unfortunately, it seems to be a movie seeking a story or a more immersive scenario, the atmosphere of piling in the atmosphere and over the terrifying sound structure for 80-90 minutes does not really cut it, in fact it gets quite boring.
