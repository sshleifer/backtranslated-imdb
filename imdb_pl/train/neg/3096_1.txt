For starters, "Hobgoblins" tries to cheat more successful "Gremlins". Bad enough, but they do not even try to create anything that resembles a movie here. Instead, this is a rather occasional basement, all you need to do to perform embarrassing scenes, an inadequate sound effect, playing a bland, tasteless tapioca and a script that takes away everything that people keep in their films and throws them down the old tube -aroo. <br /> <br /> The plot? Grrrr ... The meddling children will track down the gremlin-like creatures from the movie before they kill people, displaying their fantasies. It sounds good, right? Well, see this wall on the other side of your room? Run right, maximum speed, face first. You see, THIS is cooler than this movie. <br /> <br /> Do you dare to doubt? Quickly, name something else in which was one of the potential customers. What other scripts have been written by writers since "Hobgoblins"? Name another director effort Rick Sloane. How many "Hobgoblin" figures do you have? See? THANK YOU. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that I wrote about such a terrible film for so long. I prefer to write about more important matters; such as separation of church and state, economic restructuring in Europe, such things. But no, "Hobgoblins" is and this is bad - bad as the wallpaper of your grandparents, bad as pink flamingos on the lawn, bad as underwear that says "Home of the Whopper" ... and I think we'll stop there. <br /> <br /> Well, Mike and robots fight bravely, but try as best they can, they can only do so much with "Hobgoblins" before they realize that yes, the director does NOT have to kick in the shin. br /> <br /> Real, really difficult. <br /> <br /> One star for "Hobgoblins", seven stars for the MST3K version.
