I bought this movie for $ 5 in a used CD store and I regret this. Let me start by saying that I am a big fan of bad horror movies. They provide terribly cheesy cheap entertainment. This movie was entertaining for the first half hour because it was so bad that it was easy to play with it in the MST3K style. Then it became boring. <br /> <br /> Acting is the most terrifying part of the movie. While you can not expect great acting, it was ridiculously bad and, to be honest, it provided all the entertainment that was supposed to be. This is an additional page of the movie. Where the film really fails in the fun of writing, lighting and editing. <br /> <br /> This movie provides too much "What's happening in% $ @ #?" moments. There are many moments, such as a mother who has strange attacks on dinner, and then has absolutely no meaning in the movie. After dinner, someone responsible decided that every time he was served a meal, people watched as they eat sophisticated food for five minutes without dialogue. During meals and other inappropriate moments, the scene turns into pure darkness outside. Then he returns. And speaking of the dark outside, one of the funniest parts of the movie is the climate in which it is apparently not night unless it is raining. And speaking of darkness, the big problem in the movie is that it's so dimly lit that you can not see what's going on half the time, which is more frustrating than anything else. In one of the climactic scenes, you can not even say what should be shocking. <br /> <br /> And when it comes to climaxes, Unhinged contains one of the worst. I saw people saying "Wow, it surprised me, and it's good." I can say that the great disclosure surprised me because I did not see it coming. The reason I did not see it coming is because it did not make any sense. I'm not going to ruin you, but I'll tell you that my friend and I spent a good twenty minutes scrolling through different parts of the movie to find everything that would prove it, and all we found was more that it was not possible. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this movie is actually better when you watch it with comments that make fun of it. I love horrible horrors, but it was too much.
