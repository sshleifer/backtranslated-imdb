Writing in this movie was absolutely horrible for me. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saved this movie before rating it as 1 in 10 was the performance of Lacy Chabert, who thought he played a lot of personality really well. For me it was definitely the main attraction of this film. <br /> <br /> Dina Meyer was pretty as always, but her role was pretty bland, so I do not think her acting could be said to be great. <Br /> <br /> When it comes to the male advantage, Armand Assante, his interpretation of the role reminded me above all of the doctors from the series of cheeses from the 1980s. <br /> <br /> Everything I could live with. However, a terrible, terrible, terrible end / solution, the role of the psyche, and even the role of the psyche are just some of the worst writings I have seen for a long time.
