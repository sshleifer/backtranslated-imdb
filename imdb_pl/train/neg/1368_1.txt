One is the highest rating I could give this movie, given that zero and negative numbers are not allowed. Pee cis, a senseless mess in the movie with a lot of wasted b listers who did a better job, written and directed by a guy with a twelve-year-old mentality, who smiles and giggles from stupid puns, jokes from a pile and fart. For example, the character of Gene Stapelton (Ding-Bat from All in the Family) telling the character of Maril Henner that "swing in both directions" sexually, was a cheap attempt to sense humor pointing to the general lameness of the film ... Want a good, brazen humor? Rent Animal House, American Pie (Part One Only), Old School or Office Space.
