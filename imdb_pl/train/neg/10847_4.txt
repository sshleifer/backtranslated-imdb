The version for the directors I saw was very long for this type of film. Almost two hours is too long. If you have a choice, definitely go to a team that is not a director. <br /> <br /> The main theme has hardly been taken at all, the movie consists of the main part of several murder scenes that are connected, but the feeling is that they are only shown in order to fill the movie with splattering violence. The connection was not revealed until the second part and the lack of context bore me long before I was there. <br /> <br /> As horror does not work. You will never get the required sense of the characters due to mediocre action and general disposition (the character is presented, 15 minutes later the character is dead). These photos of the strong side lies in the spray section.
