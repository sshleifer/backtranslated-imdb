I never like classic movies. Films like Patton, Going My Way, How Green is My Valley, The Godfather, Casablanca, Annie Hall, Gone with the Wind, Lawrence from Arabia and Citizen Kane bored me. However, I would prefer to watch any of these films 3 469 times, being tied to a chair, rather than watching an American in Paris in the most luxurious apartment. If I did the latter, I would probably sleep all the time. <br /> <br /> I did not care about coloring and music, Gershwin or non-Gershwin. Dancing and singing can help you sleep down insomnia. The dialogue does not match Singin 'in the Rain. Essentially, this movie is boring. The only other movie that I fell asleep while watching was Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid. But you can not blame me. I slept only 5 minutes last night. <br /> <br /> 1 star / 10 (It is a pity that we can not give zeroes.)
