Jon Pertwee said: "It's very hard to be funny, but it's very easy to be stupid." Well, if it is, PASTE FACES is "Very Easy." David Baker (as the director / screenwriter) and his cast seem to be impressed that the comedy involves stealing scenes and styles from the best Britcoms, such as LOCK STOCK .. and TRAINSPOTTING, using a completely underdeveloped script and jumping up and down talking very much fast voice very loud. Alan McCaffrey is particularly suffering from this type of OTT performance, but not enough to ruin the movie because there is not enough movie to ruin. <br /> <br /> PASTE FACES is awful on all fronts, especially in script form. I could not understand why it ended up as it happened, it seemed to have stopped in a very violent and stupid way. Oh, other glaring mistakes are that you need a visa to visit the US and a green card to work there. This movie would make you believe you can get off the plane and start a new life in America without any permission - that I still pay for blood donation in America - people I know in America and who give blood tell me about donation payments stopped several years ago - and that you can buy any type of weapon from the weapon store. As far as I know, gun regulations in America vary depending on the state, but no weapon stores sell anti-tank weapons behind the counter. So we have a very wrong view of America from a very unreal and so ridiculous movie. Maybe it's revenge for BRAVEHEART, a very Hollywood view of the Scots? Perhaps, but this does not stop PASTA FACES from being a comedy of nonsense
