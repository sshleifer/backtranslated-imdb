As the number of Video Nasties records diminished, this little pile of garbage appeared on my "for rent" list when I saw that it was available. <br /> <br /> The assumption includes a model or something kidnapped and taken into the jungle to be held for ransom by a perverted crew of idiots. Another fool is hired to bring her, and he gets a bag of money that can be used as a bargaining chip, but if he comes back with the girl and all the money, he will get a significant cut. He brought a helicopter and pilot with him and, wow, this pilot is one of the worst actors EVER! Of course, all are terrible, and dubbing will make you cry with blood. After being stolen in the jungle, we learn that there is a cannibal cult nearby, whose earthly natural god wanders in the forest like human King Kong, seeking tribes that can ravage and devour. Now this guy is just a naked guy with the worst makeup, ping-pong balls for eyes, and that's actually it. His snarls and groans are always the current feature of the soundtrack and I found myself silencing many of these scenes. <br /> <br /> Oh, did I forget to mention the law of constant nakedness? This is probably the main reason why this film was banned, although there is one particular scene, about one second, in which god attacks the girl and draws her insides, but this is not a factor compensating for the gore fans. In addition, Jess Franco goes beyond the usual T and A and shows long close-ups of female genitalia, and, unfortunately, also men. So if you want "honest" in terms of use, you have it. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this basket to anyone. This is not even a good bad movie. It's just terribly padded garbage, which probably will only be seen by the Nasty video fan, and even if you go through the list, leave it for the last one. If you look at it first, you may have the impression that this is the norm for the list, which is certainly not true.
