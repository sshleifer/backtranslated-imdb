If you've seen fewer movies, it could be a big movie for you. If you've seen many movies, it's a joke. The action of real heroes is presented very badly. Not to mention that there are songs, there are many flashbacks, and most importantly, the fight scenes are stupidly performed. New characters, good direction, would do a better job, but because it contains all Bollywood characters / heroes, you can predict what will happen next. You do not feel sad when something happens, the emotions that you patronize are terrible, mainly because we've seen this actor in 1000 other Hindi movies. This is supposed to be a realistic film, but it does not show. Sometimes you wonder, you have thousands of military vehicles filled with moving soldiers and the Pakistani bombard them, and their bomb never hits them. Is pakis really poor in targeting, does the director make them look stupid? There were only a few characters that worked very well, but when it comes to the plot, the action is poorly targeted. This movie could be short if they took out songs, flashbacks, and stick to the subject.
