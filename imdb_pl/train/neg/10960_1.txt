Ooops! They are not much worse than this awful adaptation of the beloved novel by C. S. Lewis. While adaptation is very faithful to the novel, acting is simply awful, and the sets and special effects are on a scale corresponding to the school play. I read that the budget for this miniseries was the largest that the BBC ever released at the time, but they could certainly have collected a little more than $ 2 that it looked like it was filmed. The worst effect is Mr. Beaver. I know that the computer effects were not that level, and even profitable at the time, but the man in the costume dress looked terrible. It's better to cut a character from a movie than to do it with a role! Avoid this at all costs.
