I grew up watching the old cartoon Inspector Gadget as a child. It was like Get Smart for children. Bumble boob can not solve any case, and all work is done by walking dog Brain and his niece Penny. I heard that the live action movie is decent, so I checked it in the library. I rented this movie for free and felt that I should have paid to see it. <br /> <br /> Broderick is nowhere near the Don Adams caliber as the voice of the gadget. His voice was angry. The girl who played Penny did not look like Penny's cartoon. She is a brunette in which the cartoon version was blonde with pigtails. But she does a decent job considering what she had to work with. Dabney Coleman gives a good performance as Cheif Quimby. Saldy never hid in a strange place or had explosive messages thrown at him accidentally by the gadget. <br /> <br /> The mobile gadget was wrong. He never talked in a series and everything went well. Why did they do it? <br /> <br /> The gadget was too intelligent in this movie. In the series he was a complete idiot. Here he had a decent intellect half. It would be better if he was a moron. <br /> <br /> Also, he completely massacred the password. Borderick says "Wowser". This is and it should always be "Wowsers". It sounds bad without 's'. I got angry when they showed the announcements and they did not have the correct expression. <br /> <br /> ONLY decent gags were during loans. The missing Claw is in front of a support group for the recovery of supporters / helpers. In the audience sits Mr. T, Richard Keil also known as Jaws of Bond, the movie Herve Villacheze, Oddjob, Kato and more. This is the only part from which I laughed. <br /> <br /> The second one is at the end, where Penny checks the gadget here and tells the brain to say something. Don Adams calls a dog saying that "The brain is not right now. Please leave your name at the thread's sound. Hau. "Of course, this is not a loud laugh, just a nice piece of nostalgia to hear Adams in the movie. He should at least have said the stupid car. <br /> <br /> Children will like it, everyone who turns 13 will not. <br /> <br />
