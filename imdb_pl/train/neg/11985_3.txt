Have you ever wanted to eat worms? Here is the "document" that will show you how! Yes ... The kid eats worms live! And this is the most interesting part of the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie has been quite well summarized by previous reviewers as rather boring. I totally agree with that. The movie just does not go anywhere ... unless you like to eat worms! This is one movie in which writing a spoiler is almost impossible, because nothing happens. <br /> <br /> Technically: They should give this child a hairstyle. Who is trying to look anyway ... Bozo the Clown. It was almost comical ... I almost expected him to turn into a shaggy dog ​​or something like that. <br /> <br /> And in addition; the kid was too fat to look hungry! I should have kept him away from junk food a few weeks before filming. <br /> <br /> In total, this movie almost put me to sleep. And my children could only handle 15 minutes before they left the stage for something more interesting. <br /> <br /> I admit that the scenery was impressive. And if there was a decent story, it could be a hit. <br /> <br /> It seemed safe enough for children to watch: the bear scenes and eyeballs of the "weirdos" were too weak to scare most children, and the short skinny-dipping scene did not show anything. <br /> <br /> I gave it very generous 3.
