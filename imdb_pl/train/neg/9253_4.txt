If I had not read his name on the cover of the DVD, I would never suspect that this rather dense and old-fashioned musical was created by a man so closely associated with the French new wave. In fact, the film is so far away that I wonder if in the 1950s and 1960s the New Wave authors could not tolerate such films - it is ... yes ... unrealistic. And it seems that it has little to do with many of his previous films. It is not necessarily a bad thing - it's just very surprising. <br /> <br /> I was also surprised that some reviewers have made this film - especially when there are so many better French musicals. The songs in this movie simply were not particularly interesting, and all the characters seemed so bland and stereotypical. If I had to see another rich man who was afraid of how difficult it is to be rich or get a good sale price in designer clothes, I was going to vomit. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that like American musicals, not every French musical is golden. This film is not another "Les parapluies de Cherbourg" (THE ELEVATOR OF CHERBORG or "Huit Femmes") and despite the presence of Audrey Tautou, I see no reason to recommend it as something other than a boring bizarreness.
