About her. good cast, but writing and directing is an art, and writing a joke and a direct joke is a bit of a task. Even when making a good comedy, you must have the right moment and the right moment. I do not put it aside, there were parts in which I laughed loudly, but it was very rare. The main emphasis was placed on a quick free dialogue, which made some people in the film angry. It may sound great while reading a script in your head, but getting out of it and into the camera is another task. And the manual work of the camera gives energy to several parts of the film. The general direction was good, but the script was not for me, but I'm sure you read the script in your head that it would sound good. Excuse me.
