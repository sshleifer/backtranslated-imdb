This movie should be named Need For Speed: The Movie. For those who did not play games, Need For Speed ​​is mostly about hot cars and beautiful women and almost no story. This applies perfectly to Redline. The only thing in this movie that was A-Level were cars. Acting seemed forced and script-based, the assumption was weak at best, and the story almost did not exist. I really watched the movie just to see how bad it was and even though it was bad, it could have been worse. At least it was fun. I just want them to show Eddie Griffin crashing Enzo somewhere in the movie. To sum up, do not pay for it, do not go out of the way to see it, but if it's on Showtime or HBO and there's nothing else, it's a decent distraction.
