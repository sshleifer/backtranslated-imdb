Do not listen to the misleading title of "Werewolf Woman". Europeans are well known for their emphasis on sex and nudity in real horror in their horror films, but this one is a bit too big here. "Werewolf Woman" seems to have a dingy sex scene, whose title character has gone mad and brutally killed his partner. Funny first few times, but a hundred minutes it quickly becomes monotonous. He is not even a werewolf, but a schizo hatchling whose ancestor was hanged for lycanthropy. The film can not even decide on its tone, because the first ten minutes (retrospection) is a justified supernatural horror (I thought I was after a classic trash bin) for a rather bad study of a woman who was repeatedly mistreated and tortured to revenge thriller. At the end, the director claims that he is based on a true story. Yes alright. <br /> <br /> To be honest, there are some fun aspects of production. The title woman-werewolf is an observer and there are several nice effects of gore and naked scenes. However, they quickly become quite monotonous. Also, the dubbed dialogue is quite amusing in camp fashion, especially the most swinging doctor in the world (drinking at work). Unfortunately, the movie quickly becomes irritating. There is no real plot or anything else. It's a pity, because reading the description I felt that the film has some real potential. "Werewolf Woman" is too long, slow and a bit too pointless, even according to the standards of the exploitation genre. (10.4)
