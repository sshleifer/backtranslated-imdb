Seeing that the finale of the snooker world championship ended in a premature and disappointing way, when Ronnie O`Sullivan beat Greame Dott by 18 frames to 8, BBC 2 found a gap in his schedule and decided to give the movie WALK ON THE MOON a movie that I had absolutely no knowledge <br /> <br /> I missed a few seconds of titles, so I had no idea that Viggo Mortensen played in this movie and thought it could be cheap TVM, certainly openly with a pearl and Marta children in the camp during the summer they did something like a television, although brightly lit (too brightly lit) photos seemed to suggest that it was a movie film and only after the appearance of Viggo Mortensen as a hippie, Walker, I realized it was a cinematic release after someone from Mortensen's attitude he would not play on TVM, it means like a legend like Robert DeNiro appearing in the movie straight to the video. Wait a moment, will not Bob ...? <br /> <br /> Some people on this site mentioned that Pearl and Marty are unconvincing on the screen and I agree. I can understand why Pearl would be interested in an exciting hippie guy, but I have no idea why Walker would be attracted to House's usual wife, Pearl. The sixties were before my time, but certainly if you have a choice between hippie chicks and bored home wives, this is not a choice at all. Remember that many people took LSD at that time, so I think it translates <br /> <br /> I feel that the main problem of SPACER THE THE MOON comes down to the fact that it's a romantic drama at heart (Just like you expected in TVM) with a few uninteresting scenes from the era, so why turn on a fairly explicit sex scene? It is famous for the rest of the film and is probably intended for women of the menopausal age who were 20 years old in 1969. I say that it may be because the film seems to be directed to the teeenage market because of the scenes from the era, and these teenagers will probably be bored with the historical and social context of the man walking the moon and Woodstock. In other words, WALK ON THE MOON tries to attract many types of audience, but he probably will not speak to any of them
