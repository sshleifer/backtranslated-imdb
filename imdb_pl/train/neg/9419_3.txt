I never heard of it, and then I learned that it was a man with a deadly lens I had heard of but not seen. Connery's presence led me to buy, and that's not good. I want to be something like the intersection of Dr Strangelove and Mash, but it's not so funny unless the name General Wombat (?) Is fun. It turns out that it is a flat thriller from the 70s, up to the last ten minutes when it comes alive. There are many, many flat scenes in the White House between the President and his colleagues who do not work. It's almost as if the initial cut was too long, and the first half was edited to reach the entire plot of the nuclear ransom and attacks by suicide bombers, which I think are meant to be played for laughter, but again they are not fun. Filming in the place is perfect, but the studio looks like a cheap TV set. I could not believe that the man responsible for Key Largo, Crossfire and Elmer Gantry did. Just laugh: Connery throws the wig before he puts on his helmet and jumps out of the plane. That makes you never say never again does not look like a genius.
