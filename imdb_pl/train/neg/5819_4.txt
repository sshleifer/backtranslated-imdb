This is the story of a Jewish dysfunctional family. The parents divorced and my mother stays in the east at home. Father, Murray Abromowitz, moves with his children to California and moves around Beverly Hills so that his children can get the best possible education. <br /> <br /> Things really get funny when Marisa Tomei, Murray's niece lives with the group. <br /> <br /> The film is about various adventures of a family complicated by the drug scene of a wealthy neighborhood. <br /> <br /> Jessica Walter costars as a woman who wants Murray to move in because she wants a companion. <br /> <br /> Carl Reiner and Rita Moreno come in late. They play the brother and sister-in-law of Murray; they are also parents of Tomea. In front of the children, Reiner reminds Murray that he was paying the bills all the time. <br /> <br /> The movie ends with a sour note when the embarrassed family moves out of the fancy excavations and takes to drive through Beverly Hills in their car. I think the film promotes independence and good old self-esteem.
