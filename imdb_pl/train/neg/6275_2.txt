A very unnecessary movie with characters who behave so unpleasant that I really did not care who was the best (or was it the purpose of the movie to present some of the city's smoothly speaking New Yorkers?). without comedy. Acting is very flat and very predictable. What irritated me most is a constant joke with quotes from classic films. Man, do not you see that the more you quote, the less significant your film becomes? Try to be original! A small budget is not an excuse or a director for the first time. Crappy, crappy, crappy. No wonder it cost me only one zloty ...
