Well, I think I will have to say, "The Emperor has no clothes." When I saw this program for PBS last night, I was full of hope and fears. I loved "Morse" (I even went to buy a complete DVD set) and felt it, and I always liked Kevin Whately's Sgt. Lewis character, show YOU John Thaw, period! After seeing the new "Lewis Inspector" (as it is said here) I am more convinced that I was ever right ... What's fine (even if it looks awful (both bad and aged), but it's just not charisma to lead the show, like Thaw. <br /> <br /> And when it comes to his "helper" Fox, well ... maybe reviewers from England can understand what he's saying, but I mostly can not. <br /> <br /> What about Mrs. Innocent ... I can only say that I miss James Grout. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to say that they should have left "Morse" alone.
