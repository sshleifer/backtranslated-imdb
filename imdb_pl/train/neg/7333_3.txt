I enjoyed the impression of the first few minutes, but for 20 minutes I fully used the fast forward button. Too many shots of Stewart (Michael Zelniker), moving from room to room, down the corridors, through the door and street, and so many shots that look lost and lost. I had the impression that the story was to be initially short (20-30 minutes), and then extended to the plot of love between director Grieve and star Zelniker (co-authors of the script). <Br /> <br /> It would be more fun if any of the characters had something to say that I had not heard before in many other movies, or if the ending was not - disappointing - what I predicted three minutes into the movie (unusual for an independent / smaller studio film). At least her heart was in the right place - it was not your standard Hollywood formal manipulant nonsense.
