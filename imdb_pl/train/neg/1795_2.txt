I had the opportunity to watch this film as a member of the test audience, and the only thing that kept me in place was the opportunity to fill in the questionnaire after the screening. I felt that the biggest problem of the film is the lack of the main plot. Instead, it consisted of (too) many threads competing for screen time. As a result, there is not a single character that would be sufficiently developed so that the audience could create some kind of attachment. The director and the producer failed to show why we should care about what is happening with the characters. In fact, each sub-thread and related characters could be completely removed without seriously damaging the film. (The time gained would allow much needed development of the remaining threads and characters.) Simply put, the Hungry Bachelors club plate is full of toppings and entrees when entre is desired.
