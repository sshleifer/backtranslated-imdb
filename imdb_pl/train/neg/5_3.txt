I basically looked through the movie, but enough to catch the thread. In fact, it was boring to me, and in some places it did not make sense. The only reason I watched this movie was to see CHACE CRAWFORD !!! He's so hot, but in this movie his hair was a bit weird. But still hot. <br /> <br /> However, despite how hot CHACE is, she really did not make up for the movie. It seems to me that the plot is not so bad, but what really pissed me off is the fact that they argue like every sentence. Is it so difficult to express your anger without saying the word F every time? Screaming was annoying, and the whole brilliant, shaking camera made me headache. <br /> <br /> All in all, although the plot was OK, I found the film boring and dramatic. That's why I only cut scenes from CHACE. LOL Anyway, it's not worth renting unless you're a die-hard fan of a specific devoted member like me. Oh yes, the cast was hot. The girls were HOT !!! But the space is the best !!
