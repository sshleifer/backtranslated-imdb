We have a movie here that fails in almost every case where a movie can fail. A horrible scenario, bad acting, amateur directing, funny special effects ... it's just a horrible movie. Not to mention that when you get to the end, you will realize that the whole thing does not make sense. After spending the whole movie, wondering what's going on in the world when things are finally cleared up, you realize that history has been built on a foundation that is ridiculously impossible. In one of these hideous "villains explains the sequences of the whole movie" we were told that our villain did something that simply can not be done and that absolutely does not make sense. Oh, and then we see that some jell-o creature is also involved. I'm sure Drew Barrymore would like to pretend that this movie never happened. If for some ungodly reason you are tempted to sit down and watch this movie, I suggest instead spending that time banging your head against the wall for 104 minutes. It would be a much nicer experience than sitting at the rubbish.
