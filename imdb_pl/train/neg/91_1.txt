I rented this movie about 3 years ago and it still stands out in my opinion as the worst movie ever made. I think I have never finished it. It is worse than the home movie of a high school student. I remember they did something back to the 1970s. A man with a polo shirt, sunglasses and a newer SUV like a Toyota Rav-4 or something (I do not remember) appeared in retrospect. I do not understand how they could say they were in the '70s. He could also have a cell phone, I do not remember, it was just awful. I returned it to the video shop and asked why they even wear a movie and if I can get my life back. To this day, it's the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen some very bad ones.
