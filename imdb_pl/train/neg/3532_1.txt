It's as if you took the general themes of The Usual Suspects and Fightclub, took their style and class and mixed them with many pretentious new waves. "I'm an intellectual, so my film has to be difficult to understand." nonsense of the producer, mixed in a few additional styles for good, cut off at the end, there you have a revolver. <br /> <br /> Yes, I thought about it a little after seeing it, and yes it was nice, it makes sense, but it does not stop it from trash. <br /> <br /> Losing money. Waste of time. <br /> <br /> There, as the worst movie I've ever seen, there is not even a bad news film to buy it back a bit.
