I just paid the dollar for the DVD of this movie and it was not even worth it. It seems that it comes from bad print and is in the public domain, I'm guessing. <br /> <br /> Neagle - despite his glory, awards and reputation - is a home-made British gala who can not sing or dance or act. <br /> <br /> Some of the great actors of the Hollywood characters who were here had to think they were doing the classics. Director Herbert Wilcox (husband of Neagle) always thought that Anna is the most exciting and talented woman on the screen. He was wrong. It was unbelievably popular in Great Britain before and after World War II. Her "serious" roles are even more absurd than her musical appearance. <br /> <br /> Only a few famous songs are included and none of them is well presented. Skip this and find the one that plays Doris Day. At least you have a real comedy dance and professional style!
