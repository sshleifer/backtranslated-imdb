Drew Barrymore still sees his alter-ego throughout the city and it really starts to ache in his ass. <br /> <br /> When Dee rents a flat from a writer hack, her encounters with "other Drew" become more frequent. The writer-dude thinks his duty is to snatch the "real Drew" from her stupor, so he does everything in his power to help seduce her when he has some free time. Not very interesting or even less frightening, but Drew is sexy as always, especially when he gives a group of naughty construction workers a finger ... yeah Drew, it's hot! <br /> <br /> The best scene may be that Drew is stabbing her real mom, Jaid, a big kitchen knife ... hmmm ... how was your day?
