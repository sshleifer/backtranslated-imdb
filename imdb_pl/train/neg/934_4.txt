Macy, Ullman and Sutherland were as great as ever. Ritter was not bad either. What was her name, as usual. It could have been a good movie. The bad plot was terrible. It was completely predictable, banal and boring. <br /> <br /> From the first 15 minutes the rest of the film was arranged like children's paint by numbers. The figures were pieces of cut cardboard. There was nothing new or interesting to say and it completely outweighed acting, which is a pity. <br /> <br /> Finally, it is a pity that the screenwriter was not a victim. Especially with "premature" lines from a child who were completely unreliable. <br /> <br /> Again, only acting has prevented much lower points.
