For a movie to get scared in science, it must be really original or very good. This film is not either. Of course, there is a pseudo-original twist in which a guy kills people because of a toxin, not because of illness, but it's a very small change. There is a government conspiracy, the hero of the crusaders, who has personal experience ... <br /> <br /> And one of the disadvantages of this movie is that the contaminated person has no pathos. Although the character is written as a person who should be compassionate, he is not. Without mercy, the film is pointless. Other characters are so silly that they are funny. These threads are intricate and irritating. And the saddest thing is that the film is too flat for it to even be considered as a pretend material. Make a 45 minute movie and watch it.
