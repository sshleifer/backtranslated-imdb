Normally I would give this film a 6. It deals with a very important topic and does it relatively well - despite Katie Wright, which is an achievement in itself. <br /> <br /> I have no idea if I was properly instructed to play such a character or it is naturally annoying, but she did a great job, preventing me from taking care of Lexi. There is no dimension for her, except how confused she is, helpless and unconscious, and how well she is whimpering. I can understand how a young girl who blames herself for the loss of her friend and whose eating disorders have slipped out of control would be distraught, scared and in pain. However, the entire performance of Wright is based on constant wailing and harassment, the rest is whining. I could not help feeling that the problem of this particular girl was not caused by the bulimic bulimia, but because there is no backbone. I doubt very much that this is the movie that he was supposed to do.
