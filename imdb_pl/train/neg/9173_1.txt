I've never seen a worse movie. <br /> <br /> It is possible to take the shooter game and make it in a decent movie. <br /> <br /> Error 1: absolutely no connection to any character. In this movie you do not connect with any character, because ... you have no chance. <br /> <br /> The only character who is nice or even interesting is Deck Hand: Salish as playing Clint Howard. With the exception of this unique character, the result of the film is irrelevant, because all characters were devoid of life from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Mistake 2: the worst shooting scene ever. I love shooting. I love when the heroes are opening up to a badguy and a clean house. Hell, sometimes I like to watch an ugly clean house. But this shooting was strange. I think the best way to describe it is "apathetic". I saw people shoot with more emotion and emotions during the GAME VIDEO. In this movie, it looked as if the "Actors" were just passing through everything that moved without emotion. <br /> <br /> Why? Where do you talk garbage? where are the rages among the shooting? It's supposed to be kids who got caught in rave spoiled ... but even real soldiers working professionally and ruthlessly show their humanity. <br /> <br /> If you want a GOOD horror about an isolated home full of monsters, I recommend the Sam Rami Evil Dead series. DO NOT see the catastrophe that is the home of the dead. I hope they will burn the master and all copies of this film.
