An argument, an American family, a holiday in the west, discovers a strange ghost town in the middle of the desert. Little is known that this ghost town was once a testing ground for nuclear bombs, and the mortal presence persecutes them. Generally, I love such horror movies. Spielberg's "Cube", "Duel" and "Birds" are great examples of films that do not give an answer, but still leave us puzzled and want more. It seems that the screenwriter / director of "Disappearance" Walter Klenhard tried to do just such a movie, and whether he succeeds, depends on the viewer. Personally, I think he was halfway, then the movie just sank. <br /> <br /> The actors are just "noise." Theirs is not particularly bad, but we, as an audience, never feel their fear and react to situations in an unreal way. Is anyone else absolutely absolutely sick of the characters who are just coming out to explore the strange sounds?!?!? At least give them SOME reasons for this!?!?!? <br /> <br /> When it comes to films made especially for television, it is certainly an above average market. Director Klenhard should be praised for really milking the desert environment for everything he offers, and some settings were striking. There is a really cool scene in which two characters find an old nuclear test when the sand has been completely melted into the glass, if the eye has seen it. I wonder if it was real ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? we never even have a real clue as to what they are (mutants, aliens, ghosts or ancient evil spirits of India? Oh, that really narrows down for us!) or where they come from. <br /> <br /> There are also many stereotypes. Why are the urban people in these kinds of films always really, very stupid? Why is there always an old guy who thinks he's crazy, which turns out to be correct? Why? Why? Why? What is the new scenario, people! <br /> <br /> "Disappearing" tries to be different and intelligent, but in the end it disappoints that in many respects we are too familiar to horror fans directly on video. Hey, I've seen a lot worse movies, and disappearing is not bad, is it just ?? Average. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
