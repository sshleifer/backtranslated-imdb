This movie is complete! Avoid the waste of celluloid at all costs, it is chaotic and incoherent. I am proud that I put the depths of cinema in the 70s from everything from Salo to Salon Kitty. I like to be shocked, but I need a coherent story. If, however, watching accompanying horses distract you from the movie, it is for you. The saddest part was this lame, werewolf suit with a functional wang. I mean, it's just hard to sit down, not to mention that acting is terrible and the soundtrack is badly called. Please, I know that the cover is interesting (which looks like gorilla hands reaching for a naked woman's ass), but do not waste time or money because you will not come back.
