I saw this movie one day in the film school class and I have not seen Almodovar's film before, but I expected it to be good. Unfortunately, it turned out that it was a pointless film in which only a few laughs were mixed with two hours of pure boredom. High Heels is just a collection of random scenes that could work in their separate films, but together they do not add up to any significant whole. <br /> <br /> I thought so at least. Then, the next day, my film professor spent the whole class period, explaining all the hidden small details of the film, such as a mural presenting stereotypical flamenco dancers in the background of the drag queen scene is a kind of commentary on the lack of identity that Spain has developed as a nation fascist. Apparently the whole movie is full of clever, small visual tricks and references in this style. <br /> <br /> That's great, but you know what? It's still a bad movie. It takes more than depth and complexity to do a good movie - you still need to give viewers a reason to pay attention, something that will interest the viewer enough to really take care of all the subtle tricks. High Heels gives us strange, unusual characters, but keeps them in mostly mundane situations from other films, and Almodovar does not seem to use them to make any point. What is the significance of, for example, the revelation of the Hitchcock surprise that occurs at the end of the movie? Why is it there? To surprise us? <br /> <br /> There is one funny scene that is related to the message transmission. And that's all, it's the only entertainment moment. The rest of the movie is simply nonsense film references and visual hints, which apparently exist only to show us how smart Pedro Almodovar is. But no matter what my film professor says, the film needs to be good.
