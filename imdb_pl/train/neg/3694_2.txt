This is undoubtedly the worst films of Rajnikantha. The first part takes place on the spot with a solid comedy from Goundamani, but gradually becomes worse and completely illogical. Our hero makes copies in the Saints of the same name (Baba) through a horrible and completely poor one liner. In the first half Rajni utters his usual set of styles and styles, and in the other half he becomes a quasi saint after a beggar takes him through an interdimensional portal to the Himalayas, where Babaji (not famous for the saints he earlier dug) gives special powers for no apparent reason (other than karma). It really starts to be interesting, right? <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is that it wastes its magical benefits and strengths, fighting with politicians and the associated black magic. Plain predictable shit with fun realization. Oh, black magic never worked on our hero, because he had Param Vir ... er ... Shakti Chakra with him. Bad guys and ordinary political villains are stereotypical, overworked and ultimately completely irrelevant to a plot that is not going anywhere. <br /> <br /> But despite all the disadvantages, killing time was fun during public events with and shouting the one-man Baba. It's also nice to watch the curses of others about this movie. It is said that AR Rehman composed songs for his film on a mobile phone. It is important how he considered it. <br /> <br /> Rajni is very popular in Japan and two characters joined him (one of them is called Keiko ... why not Samsung?) Japanese origin in this movie only for the sake of it. But the way they are portrayed, dressed and treated is absolutely pathetic. The Japanese may stop watching Rajni movies after watching this. This movie was probably a promotional material for Rajni, who went into politics, but the results of the film itself would have killed all his political dreams. <br /> <br /> Funny, if you turn around a little.
