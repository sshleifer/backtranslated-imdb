I have read every book so far on the left after the series, and the film hardly makes any of them justice. Sure, I've seen worse movies, but it was amazingly disappointing. This movie would be a good episode of MST3K. The script was a frightening adaptation of the book and it seemed that the actors were reading their poems, and they did not speak. The heroes were stiff and unlike each other. The effects were poor and they looked terrible. The ending was terrible. First of all, she did not even go through the entire first book. Second, it did not make sense. If you did not read the book, you would have no idea what was going on. It must have been the most tacky, cinematic ending I've ever seen in a movie. I am nervous that I actually paid the money for this movie. If by some miracle it solves the problem, they should change it completely and let Hollywood take control. Those two would-be film producers and a would-be director should leave filming to professionals.
