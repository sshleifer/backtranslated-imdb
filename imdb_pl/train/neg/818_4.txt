This film stands out for three reasons. <br /> <br /> First, apparently benefiting from the success of the two "Superman" series, this low-budget feature was released and released for theaters, meaning George Reeves and Phyllis Coates. initial performances as Clark Kent / Superman and Lois Lane. Part of the hole is reused in the series. Outside of the city of Silby, the six-mile-long crude oil penetrates the "empty Earth", allowing the "Mole-Men" to reach the surface. Forget about other holes (those on the story). <br /> <br /> Secondly, unlike most SF invasion films from the 1950s, the hero plays a dominant (and controlling) power in proclaiming and enforcing tolerance and acceptance of the difference against the raging crowd of segregationist guards. There is no "gentle brought up reporter" here! Clark Kent, competent and confident, seizes control of the situation all the time ("I can handle it!"), Even helping in the hospital dress in removing the ball from Mole-Man! As Superman is gentler than Clark in relation to the pugnacious Lois, he is also the voice of reason and tolerance when he moves against the guards as "Nazi stormtroopers." <br /> <br /> Thirdly, you will notice that the transition from the animated Superman-like Fleischer flight in two series to the "live action" flying in "Adventures of Superman" has not yet been done.
