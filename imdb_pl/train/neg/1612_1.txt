It is amazing that with all the innumerable crimes that were discovered and unequivocally placed at the verge of Marxism, from the Berlin Wall to the Gulag archipelago, to the Cultural Revolution to the Khmer Rouge, still can be found admirers of communist totalitarianism in Hollywood continue to propagate in their favor. It only shows the moral depravity of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> In this movie a psychotic murderer is glorified. Needless to say, neither his crimes nor his psychotic proclamations were included. That both the director and the actor expect spectators to sit in this seemingly endless propaganda film, demonstrate the vision of the tunnel they have in relation to their object of worship.
