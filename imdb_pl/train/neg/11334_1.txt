Here is another blasphemous European story in which they undermine the religion of their country. (These atheistic filmmakers are relentless.) Here we see the brutal outbursts of Catholics and / or Catholic clergy (and I am not a Catholic). <br /> <br /> This winner really won an Oscar for a foreign movie. Probably because history has made Catholics and religious believers generally look very weak. One of the main characters is a priest and cares more about food than anything else. He is portrayed as nothing more than an idiot. No wonder that the Academy-dominated Academy loved the film. <br /> <br /> There is also a poignant fool who plays a guy who renounces his religion, so he can marry one of the four daughters described in this story. Daughters take turns to seduce a student "seminary" (who claims to have studied for six years, but says he is an agnostic!). I mean, how blasphemous is this movie? !!! <br /> <br /> This is a disgrace and another great example of secular-progressive bigotry of film business around the world (not just Hollywood).
