I was laughing a lot - because it's so incredibly bad - I'm sorry, but definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... I know it's a low budget, but still: the actors behave like playing soap, dialogues Absolutely bad, and the last time I saw such strange pictures was in the trash at some youth films festival ten years ago. I really appreciate that people gather together and make cheap movies, but at least a certain amount should be achieved. But at least one good thing: the first three minutes of the movie were quiet and interesting, and the result was really worth hearing. The DVD cover promised a lot, but it's definitely the best movie that this movie has to offer ...
