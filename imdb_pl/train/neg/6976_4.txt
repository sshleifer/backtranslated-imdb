The unsuccessful, novelty western Robert Altman from the book of Edmund Nowloon, McCabe, was overlooked at the time of its release, but in recent years has won steadfast criticism. In addition to the completely convincing boom-town scenario, the characters here do not deserve much interest, and the picture looks (intentionally) salty and unattractive. Bearded Warren Beatty is an entrepreneur from the turn of the century who settles down in a difficult community on the edge of nowhere and helps to organize the first brothel; when profits start appearing, Beatty is naturally threatened by the city that wants some of the shares. Altman creates a festive winter atmosphere for the film, which gives the audience a certain sense of time and place, but the action in this beautiful town is limited - most of the story consists of vignettes - and the Altman pace is deliberately slow. There is almost no statement (on the contrary), and the sleepy actors stare at each other without much of a mind. This is a suicidal picture, but in a weird way Altman is proud to be defeated. ** with ****
