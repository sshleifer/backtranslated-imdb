This movie is embarrassing for filming. I can not believe he was even mentioned as a comedy - it's not funny. The scenario was not only cruel, but the caster people should be shot. Gail O'Grady is just a great actress, but otherwise ... 99% of the rest of the cast ... ouch. Almost everyone ... wow, it's hard even ... wow. Here's the number one rule for the comedy "DO NOT TRY BE FUNNY." There are many very talented actors in Canada who can make dramas and comedies - none of them have been used in this film. Canadian directors of nepotism and casting help to preserve bad film production in Canada. I realize that it is technically a movie "American", but look at the director, actors, location, etc. That's what I saw at Bravo - they should be ashamed that they bought the rights to show this movie. There are many great movies again that can not get airtime and show it nonsense.
