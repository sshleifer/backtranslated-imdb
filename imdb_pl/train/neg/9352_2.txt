It can often be said that the film did not turn out as it should, thanks to the intense use of the narrator. This movie contains this device. Richard Jobson is not quite content with writing and even financing a part of this movie, he adds to his texts, reading fragments of his own semi-automatic magazine, which in combination with a beautiful edition manages to shine, which is a boring, depressing story that must be confused for a real home art. Kevin McKidd has good results. Everyone is fine. <br /> <br /> Budget constraints meant that all scenes are shot in daylight, although most of them are of course at night, although if you know serious alcoholics, they work mainly during the day, so for me it adds a bit of realism. <br /> <br /> The funniest part of this movie is the waitress who does not age for one day in 20 strange years that pass between her performances - a more extreme version of the problem that McKidd has going from 18 to 30 without changing more than his clothes. Bless.
