If it could be rated at 0, it would be. From the horrible wooden action to the boring, pulsating pace, the fluffy angle of exploitation and the sophisticated pseudolesbian excitement added only to sad viewers, this is a catastrophe of the film. <br /> <br /> The plot is predictable because from the beginning it is absolutely sure what will happen to all characters and how the plot will start. From a boring, unexpected beginning to a pathetic and bleak ending, every presence in this movie is wasted, and every stingy talent dug for this turkey is wasted. <br /> <br /> If you want to see something equally tenaciously gloomy with lots of childish excitement, watch one of Ilsa's films. At least they are carefree and open to what they are trying to do. As something terribly wrong to ever score above 5, it is a miracle of how people with no taste and demanding standards can sometimes meet in the most dubious targets. <br /> <br /> It is not scary, it is not interesting, and above all it does not arouse in any sense of the word. In my opinion, this is a crime; the crime is that such a horribly offensive and incompetent piece of trash has ever been thought up and received funds for the uprising, let alone the tragedy that is still being defended by pitifully misguided viewers. <br /> <br /> Even the cheerful Elvira personality and playful ways can not alleviate the blow that this terrifying parody causes. Avoid it at all costs.
