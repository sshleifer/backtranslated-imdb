The only advantage of this movie is that it was bad enough to be comedic. Everyone in this movie looks like a porn industry. I've seen better playing low budget porn. I thought that after this classic scene I hired some gay porn: Jim: Take care of yourself Nick: Watch yours (together): I will not leave you behind! <br /> <br /> The first sequence of actions shows how awful production is, but it is really fun: good people have a transformer gun! In one scene, everyone has false machine guns HK MP5. Next scene, AK-47 replicas! And finally, they make a gun, changing scenes from several M-16s! I think they had a budget shortage for weapons, not enough to walk between good and bad guys. The battle scenes are poorly coordinated and false as hell. You must remove the pin / spoon of pomegranate so that it explodes itself. You can not fire a rocket fired from the arm while driving a helicopter. The weapon you throw away does not appear suddenly. When the weapon does not have bullets, throwing it away is still quite stupid. Unless you have no idea how to reload them. Large free trucks in first gear cause awkward action scenes. I really can not believe that such films are actually produced. This movie would be fun on nitrous oxide, or maybe just drunk.
