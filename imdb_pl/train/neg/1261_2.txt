I'm a fan of Jean Harlow because she had the quality of a star. I do not think her films are good, and I do not even think she was a good actress, but she was certainly great in comedies. Every comedy in The Girl from Missouri is very good. But this movie is maybe more like a love story. Jean Harlow is wonderful in this and you can forget about the rest of the cast - their performances do not bring anything new. I am always amazed to think that Harlow's beautiful body was the body of a sick woman. This movie looks beautiful.
