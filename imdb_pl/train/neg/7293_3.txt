Aaron Spelling has produced this movie for the TV western, which becomes terribly clever for seventy-three minutes of the film. Game like probable unsuccessful series pilot. <br /> <br /> Handsome Clint Walker is an American marshal Dave Harmon, who goes to Yuma, Arizona Territory, to kill one of brothers of local farmer Bigwik, who is on the trail. <br /> <br /> Walker takes his second brother to prison. Walker also meets a "cute" homeless Mexican kid who sleeps in jail. One night, Andres slumbered when the villain and another man in a blue uniform take the remaining brother to the street and kill him, pinning the murder of Walker. Not good for the first twenty-four hours of work. Walker visits the local military fort and rushes the commander's chains. Bigwig hears about the death of his brothers and returns to town in time for his chains to be battered. The local indigenous population, which is changed by the army into their beef, is also kidnapped in the area of ​​chains. When all of these chains start to tease, Walker still has time to visit the local hotel owner. An army guy involved in the murder ends in death, the local cattle buyer is involved, the Indians make a lot of undecided speeches, and the climax causes an unlikely expedition because Walker must prove to the city that the crooks buyer has a boss, someone we suspected he was too helpful all the time. <br /> <br /> There is a half-subplot that includes the death of the Walker family from the hands of the invading army, and I think that would be the standing force for the series if it were received. Instead, the movie ends abruptly and I've been waiting for scenes from an exciting episode next week. Due to the disappearance of non-existent commercial breaks, the stimulation ends, and its history jumps. <br /> <br /> Walker is handsome, rugged and has a deeper voice than the well. The rest of the cast is full of TV actors you've probably seen in other TV movies. A large part of the action is quite poor, and the violence is lukewarm. The first killed brother gets a shotgun and falls without scratching. I did not expect "Reservoir Dogs", but this is a bad movie that you can teach children about the evil of weapons! Speaking of children, the Mexican child very quickly passes from "sweet" to "an aneurysm that causes irritability". <br /> <br /> If you do not like westerns, you do not like "Yuma". If you like Westerns, you still do not like "Yuma". I can not recommend it. <br /> <br /> It is invaluable, but it contains physical violence and violence on weapons. <br /> <br />
