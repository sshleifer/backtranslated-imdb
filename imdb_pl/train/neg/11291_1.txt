Hell! What a horrible movie. Tricky camera work, a scenario with more corn than Kellogg, and acting so damn that you can open a pig farm with it. <br /> <br /> To limit everything, he does not know which audience to head for - we have Cornel Wilde - is this Corny Wilde? - getting on his soap case about the dangers of smoking every time someone smokes a cigarette, baby, baby, and in another awkward scene we have a bad one, Lobo, forcing him, uh, if you like, "male friend" to do striptease dressed in bikini. Try to explain it to children ... <br /> <br /> Put in too fancy the plot of Treasure Island-cum-Jaws, and the result is a movie so funny fun that it's nice - I should not expect DVD Special Edition in the near future.
