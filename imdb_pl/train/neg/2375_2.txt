Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare, the sixth edition of the Nightmare series on Elm Street and another sequel to the next sequel. I think it is related to the last continuation of Dream Child. I was lucky that I put together a DVD from the Nightmare series on Elm Street for my birthday, so I saw all the sequels. I can say that I am more and more disappointed, although with these sequels, at least on the other, it seems that Freddy lost the advantage. It's almost as if the writers tried to give Freddy a soul and simply destroy her instead of inventing a story. It was a continuation that was not needed, I'm sorry Robert Englund, but it was far below what Freddy Krueger represents. <br /> <br /> Freddy has come back, but he has something that we do not know, daughter. Maggie, she does not realize that she is her father, but soon he learns what his dark secrets are and wants her help. He must do everything in his power to resist his powers, but it is difficult with all the good memories of a loving father. Ironic, right? But Freddy does not give up without manipulating her in his own way. <br /> <br /> Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare is also presented in 3D, radical, eh? Pay attention to sarcasm. This is one of the worst sequels associated with the fifth continuation of the Nightmare on Elm Street series, to be honest I would prefer to watch the second Nightmare on Elm Street. It just had bad acting, stupid editing and just a bad idea for history. I did not like this concept and just ruined the whole idea of ​​who Freddy Krueger really is, the master of the death of nightmares, and not the Father knows best. <br /> <br /> 2/10
