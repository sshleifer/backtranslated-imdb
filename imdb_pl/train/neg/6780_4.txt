This film was a critical and cash fiasco in 1957. It was based on a novel that later evolved into art - which hit Broadway. The story is about some naval officers who travel to San Francisco during World War II. They have a 4-day vacation, which they spend at the Mark Hopkins hotel. The film often writhes, and none of the characters seems real. Cary Grant is generally brilliant in comedy and drama - but here he plays a kind of wheel dealer, and he does not really do it. Tony Curtis or James Garner would be a better choice. Audrey Hepburn initially had to play alongside Grant, but she had other commitments - so Suzy Parker entered the game. She never played before, but she was the best American photo model. I think she did a good job considering all the pressure she was under her. Grant's pairing with Jayne Mansfield in a few short scenes - it really did not work. Studio tried to give her some kind of class, playing with Grant - but the character had no content at all.
