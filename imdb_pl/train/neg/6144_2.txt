Ironically, although he can do "divisions," Thomas is completely stiff as an actor. <br /> <br /> This movie is remembered in my memory as one of the most painful and incompetent movies I've ever seen. As such, I like it very much. <br /> <br /> However, the only reason why he gets more than one star is that Thomas is in great shape and it's great to see his tiny, muscular body performing various competitive gymnastic skills on scattered strange rocks and sticks about a rural East European side (including the infamous "horse-bowed" cap in the middle of a village square that Thomas uses to plant feet in the faces of various crazy residents). But let the poor man open his mouth and try emote, and any illusions that he may have a film career are immediately broken into pieces. <br /> <br /> At least Thomas had an excuse that he was not an actor. Everyone else in the film - actors, director, editor, guys from cameras, etc. They are at least as bad or even worse, and most of them are professionals. So Kurt does not go out as bad as it might seem. <br /> <br /> I hope poor Kurt took the money and escaped. If anyone ever asks him to re-appear in the martial arts film, I'll bet Thomas is kicking the guy in the face.
