I agree with everything that people have said on this subject, but I must add that the soundtrack is probably the WONDERFUL I have ever heard for my whole life! There are real vocals at times when you should listen to the actors' conversation! And the vocals are like the Broadway version of Danzig singing: "The darkness of the forest! Darkness of a dark, dark forest! "Or something else that is not so threatening. The singer has a horrible vibrato and has been recorded with a microphone in high tones over some synthesized string section and fake drum beats. It is horrible !! <br /> <br /> Yes, men are terrible. Like women. This is one bad case of gender stereotypes - it's so bad! Everything they say is about being a man or a woman, simply playing stereotypes to the max. I'm sick. Soooo boring !!! <br /> <br /> Children were so echo in their lines that you can not understand them. And why do ghost women always wear sweet, small bows in their hair, nice blue dresses and long hair? And the spiritual boys always wear clean clothes with charming, shiny blond hair? Not terrible - STUPID. <br /> <br /> Daddy's face was far too flawed, free and clean, to resemble the face of a man living in a cave. A nice beard and bangs, bye. Did you cut the knife yourself well, did you walk into the city and go to the living room? <br /> <br /> Stupid movie.
