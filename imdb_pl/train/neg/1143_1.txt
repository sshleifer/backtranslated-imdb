Even 20 years later, the Ninja Mission stands out as the worst movie I've ever been able to sit down. Scandinavian ninjas soundlessly enter the stage, shoot with a noisy noisy machine gun, and then quietly leave. Wow, how do we find these silent invisible killers? Just follow the casings of the shell and smoke! A painfully bad dialogue (was he genius and simply wrongly translated?), The Asians in the cast and a huge sum of 3 Asians among the stunt crew are not noticed. The story is ridiculous, acting is almost non-existent - once again the ninja can not work! Save yourself - avoid watching at all costs!
