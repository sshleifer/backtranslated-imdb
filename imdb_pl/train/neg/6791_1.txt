This is a film about cruelty to animals. Under the guise of a marathon race, we see images of extreme animal use, including literally running a horse to death IN FREE MOVEMENT. The guy who did this has a conscience spiritually cleansed by the flames from the funeral / burning of the horse, who is obviously still dead after being tortured to death. This is one of the worst, happiest movies I've ever had dissatisfied with watching. As Gene Hackman and James Coburn near the finish line on their DYE-sized animals, we should admire their spirit for completing the race. I would like to put the producers and director in a marathon race; I'll decide when they're done, probably about 20 minutes after they stop breathing.
