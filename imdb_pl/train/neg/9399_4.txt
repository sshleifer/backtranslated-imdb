The three of Bill Boyd, Robert Armstrong and James Gleason play Carnys Coney Island by competing for the hand of Ginger Rogers, a working gal that sells salt-water toffee. With the outbreak of World War I, three of them are enlisting and chasing Ginger from afar. The first half of the production of RKO Pathe is difficult, and three men lead experiences with overcrowded lines and "lively" dialogue, which quickly becomes tiresome. The other half focuses on the action sequences, because the US Navy chases both the German commercial and U-boat cruiser. These sequences are vivid and well-shot, but in general it is too long and unsatisfying comedy drama with a flat ending. Only for fans of stars.
