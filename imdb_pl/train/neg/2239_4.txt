The story has already been described by other reviewers, so I will add that my reason I wanted to see this movie was to see Gabrielle Drake in all its undoubted glory. <br /> <br /> Miss Drake must be one of the sexiest, prettiest examples of "elegant totty" that have been committed to celluloid. From her epoch and the like, only as great Jane Asher is approaching. What was it about actresses with musical brothers? (Nick Drake and Peter Asher) For those who like to admire me, Gabrielle, her scenes in this film will not be disappointed. He has a great figure and nothing of it is left to the imagination here. <br /> <br /> As a whole, the film is very poor and it is very cheap. The song, which includes the initial subtitles, seems to last forever and is terrifying.
