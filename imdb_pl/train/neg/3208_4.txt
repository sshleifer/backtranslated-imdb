This film was a great disappointment for me. I have been waiting for this film for years, and I was a faithful follower of Chaos Comics until they went bankrupt. They not only cut half the plot, but changed the information. The statement that Lucifer is the Father of Hope is untrue. He broke her father, but he is not her father. The voices also did not match the characters, and when you hear the voice of a loved one, the voice you heard in your mind can never be returned. I do not even remember everything about this movie that was bad. The bottom line is if you love Lady Death, do not watch this movie. He just did not do comical justice!
