There is nothing like a film about a group of friends who not only dislike each other, but also have no salutary qualities to make the * audience * like any character. There are films that are so bad that they are good (a la Ed Wood or Tod Slaughter), and it's just bad (like 99% of Uwe Bolla's "work"). This film is barely tolerated, even if you're a talented MST riffer (eg Mystery Science Theater 3000). Fortunately, when I'm quite talented in this respect (that's how my mind works all the time), for those who are not naturally talented in MST's riffs, in the end of * this * movie, you just want to pull your own head, painfully conscious that the movie "Taboo" robs you of an hour and twenty minutes, you will never come back. Even my MSTie talents barely matched this slow, boring waste of time. The most puzzling aspect of this movie is that * someone * green illuminated and / or funded it ... I hired "Tabu" only for the normally talented Amber Benson, who apparently had to be blackmailed in this movie. I have another lesser-known movie with her in the queue for borrowing, reviews that I'd better read first. Ironically, the best aspect of the movie was an impressive labyrinth residence due to the indoor location.
