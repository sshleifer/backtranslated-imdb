Well, you know the rest! This must be the worst movie I've seen in a long time. I can only imagine that Stephanie Beaham had several bills to pay, taking on this role. <br /> <br /> The main role (for me) is the complete unknown and I imagine that I just disappeared this turkey in oblivion. <br /> <br /> Bruce Lee was in charge of martial arts in the early 1970s, and from then on the battle scenes must be either martial arts or at least brutal if they use street fighting techniques. This film uses fast cuts to show martial arts, but even this can not hide the fact that the lady does not know how to throw a blow. The average 8-year-old would take her for this show. <br /> <br /> Excuse me, the only secret on the show is how it has not won the golden raspberry for a year.
