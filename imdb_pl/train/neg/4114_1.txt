There are some great philosophical questions. What is the purpose of life? What will happen when we die? AND WHY DO YOU MAKE BAD FILMS ?? The assumption is absurd. This action is one-dimensional. Special effects are exaggerated. And the movie is one endless battle between some of the worst photos Hollywood has ever produced. But if they were good shots, everyone would be dead in the first five minutes and there would be no movie. It is a pity that it did not happen. I was tempted to shut it down a few times, but I was stuck with him to see how bad it could be. I am glad that I did it because (SPOILER?) The last line is the crowning of the stupidity of the whole stupid, grim scenario. It is not even worthy of the second status on the third season in the off-season season. In addition to the general horror of the film, I deeply worry about its impact on the young audience. Americans are making such nonsense, and then they wonder why events like Columbine happen. It's really a trivial cinema on the Brobdingnagian scale!
