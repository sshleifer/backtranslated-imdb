First of all, I warn you that I saw this movie on TV and with dubbed English - which could completely ruin the atmosphere. However, I evaluate what I have seen and I hope that it will distract people from this version. I find this film extremely boring. The whole atmosphere of the film is dubbed, leaving a slow frustration of the film of persecutors. I'm sorry, but the worst sin of the movie in my book is slow, except for a film about philosophy. In this film, I did not see any deep philosophical significance. Maybe I missed something, but I have to say it as I see it. I rated it as "1". What can I say, maybe US-oriented flavors.
