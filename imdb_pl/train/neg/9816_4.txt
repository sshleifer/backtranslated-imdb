This movie was like a bad train wreck, however terrible it still had to be watched. My boyfriend and I rented him and we wasted two hours of our day. Do not get me wrong, acting is good. Just the movie as a whole has infuriated us both. There was nothing positive or good in this scenario. After this film, I had to rent something else, which was a bit lighter. Jennifer Tilly is a very dramatic actress, as always. Her character seems manic and not everything there. Darryl Hannah, although she played, does a great job playing in the situation where she is. I have often shouted at the television, telling her to fight or be brutal. All in all a very violent movie ... not for weak hearts.
