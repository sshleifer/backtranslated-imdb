I saw this movie for the first time around twelve o'clock on a Saturday evening. It's really the perfect time for this. Never, I have NEVER seen a movie that was more predictable and steeped in stereotypes. If you want to see an exciting action movie, do not watch it, because you can lose the will to live in half. However, if you want to laugh, watch it! I even bought the Chuck Norris 3DVD collection thanks to my nice Saturday night. I was especially struck by the fact that the Ã©very scene, which would have been expensive to perform, was copied from the Discovery documentary or the old special television program about the US Army. In addition, I was amazed that they did not put in the least effort to make the production look real. Afghanistan is, as far as I remember, nowhere near the sea, yet with one click Deke escapes from the castle with a sand castle and is taken by a submarine (probably Discovery). Later in the film, Deke throws a terrorist Islam against the wall. On the stage in slow motion, you can see the long hair of the Korean stuntman's flap in the air, when it crashed against the wall. I have to love it. I recommend that you watch it with your friends and a good amount of beer, but only then will you understand why I was mad enough to spend 6.99 euros per box.
