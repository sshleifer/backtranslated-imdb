I thought it was really a terrible movie - I shouted on my TV a few times. One or both homosexual males were wrong; there was no chemistry between them and Richard Ruccolo looked like he preferred to kiss a dog. The film tells about their long and tortured courtship, emphasizing each breakup and make-up, but without developing the reasons between them in no particular detail. These reasons would be for some interesting characters, not a fight or makeup scene in bed (lame, even if you liked the movie). <br /> <br /> Andrea Martin and Adam Goldberg shine like their characters, but it does not make the movie worth the rent. Save money.
