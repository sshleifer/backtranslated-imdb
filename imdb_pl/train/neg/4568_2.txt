Not quite a bad start of the program - but what a slap for real law enforcement agencies. The worst part of the series is that it tries to settle as a reality tariff - and it is nothing else. Men and women who devote their lives to law enforcement deserve better. What's next, medical school for a minute? Does Charo perform lipo? Charles Grodin helps in replacing the hip joint? Come ... show some respect. Even residents of Muncie set out with the program in staging. Police Academy = High School Gym? Poor edition (how many times can I use the Taco Bell picture from the car to the car?), Trashy siren effects (the same loop added ad nauseum for each "connection", regardless of whether it is a rolling code or not), and finally but no less important - more security problems for officers than one could shake a stick. <br /> <br /> If I wanted to see police and fake cops produced, I would watch RENO 911.
