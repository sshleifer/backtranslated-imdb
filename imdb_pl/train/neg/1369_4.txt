Amy Heckerling's second film, "Johnny Dangerously" is a parody of gangster films from the 1930s from the Warner Brothers tradition. Michael Keaton plays the role of a middle-aged gangster who looks at his life with heavy hits when he catches a child trying to steal something from a zoo in 1935. Keaton's mother (Maureen Stapleton) has constant health problems, so Keaton falls into a crime of early age through Peter Boyle. Meanwhile, Fargan Richard Dimitri plays a competitive warlord of crime for Boyle, and Keaton finally rises in the ranks. Joe Piscopo has a funny phrase as Danny Vermin, yes, right, Vermin! Griffin Dunne is the younger brother of Keaton who became a district prosecutor, Glynnis O'Connor, his wife, and Marilu Henner plays minor Keaton. The film looks very cheap, which makes it seem to be a TV series, not a theatrical film. <br /> <br /> The movie starts off well and then slows down as expected after the first half hour. Due to the combination of dialogues and gags, the film retains its lead in the first half, but then quickly loses a pair and falls into mediocrity and vulgarity in the second half. Keaton chews the scenery, making his best impression of James Cagney. Stapleton has several vulgar lines that are just awful and not funny. Piscopo is doing "once" a bit too much. Several supporting actors try to keep the fort like Danny DeVito, Dom DeLuise, Ray Walston as street vendor, Alan Hale, Jr. as a sergeant on a desk, and Sudie Bond as a scrupulous cleaner. The other half turns into a type of TV series that never returns. The final scene using The Roaring Twenties is an anachronism, like the movie The Call Of The Wild Clark Gable, which can be seen on an earlier tent in the movie. I think Heckerling should have known better, because the target audience would certainly be aware of the release date of The Roaring Twenties from 1939. * 1/2 of 4 stars.
