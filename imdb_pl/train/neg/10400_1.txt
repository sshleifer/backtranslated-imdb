Enough ... sometimes they just have to stop making movies based on a concept that's long gone. The first Tremors movie was great. The second one was funny. The third one was nauseating. The television series was depressingly horrible. And this movie just drives the rate deeper. <br /> <br /> Basically another excuse for cheap computer effects and puppetry, now we have a series set in the Wild West in the nineteenth century and fight with the Graboids. Like refreshing the first one, they have to learn how to overcome them. Mildly fun, I think. Otherwise, this simple video version, like Tremors 2 and 3, goes far too far. Oh, and I still wonder how there never is any record of these events ... or have they simply forgotten to record this unprecedented event? I think that would be a story, so our first movie buddies would not be so unprepared. <br /> <br /> Such movies that will ruin the original, just drive me crazy. Avoid this trash.
