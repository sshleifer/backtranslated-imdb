I remember watching the BSG pilot. I can accurately describe this night. I remember in what chair I sat. This performance was magical. Came to life. I liked the first two years of BSG. I liked the part of the third year and watched every episode of the fourth year, completely faithful, with great hope that it would somehow turn away. Well, no. <br /> <br /> I watched the Caprica pilot and I was fascinated. There was hope for something good here. Then I started to watch regular episodes and become more and more boring. <br /> <br /> It's too obvious, too predictable. It reminds me of the political correctness of his last unsuccessful show, Virtuality. <br /> <br /> Much of his work on DS9 was good. When he focused on BSG in an organized way, it was good. This was especially true at the beginning, when more or less followed the patterns of episodes established by the first BSG series. When they left, after meeting with Admiral Cain and Pegasus, everything went to the pool. It was as if he had written the rest of the program, not knowing where he was going. <br /> <br /> Maybe it will improve. Maybe it's just a few weak initial episodes. But I am very, very upset.
