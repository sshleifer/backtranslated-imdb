Well, I suppose the good news about William Winckler's opus from 2001, "The Double-D Avenger," is that he manages to unite in his painting three marions of Russ Meyer - Kitten Natividad, Haji and Raven de la Croix . (I can only assume that Lorna Maitland, Tura Satana and Babette Bardot were busy the week they did it ... or they managed to see a copy of the script earlier!) Bad news (and there are plenty of them) or this movie - if you can even call it that, which was shot straight into the video - it's a complete misunderstanding, a total abortion, brutal cruelty, absolute abomination and really one of the worst shots I've ever seen. Look no further for the best superhero movie! The plot here, like this one, is about Kitten, who gained superpowers after knocking down a rare cockazilla plant in South America to heal her breast cancer (oy), and later fights three megalung bikini dancers in LA. It is a pity that every lame joke falls out completely (you should forgive the expression) flat, that in the movie is ZERO real nudity (except for some old photos Kitten in her splendor), and that some shaving cream and paper-mache boulder are combined the sum of the special FX. Meyer's girls are a bit too long in their teeth / saggy breasts, taking it kindly, although Sheri Dawn Thomas, as a bikini girl Ooga Boobies (!), Potrafi, stand out well. So why did I give this juvenile, failed, embarrassed movie 2 stars instead of 1? Be concise: Joe Bob Briggs. His voice commentary in the special DVD features I just watched is absolutely funny, especially when he extracts about 100 synonyms of the word "breast" from over 1,000 on his "Canonical Hooters List" website. The man is a national treasure and manages to improve this skeet of the disk to the coaster status!
