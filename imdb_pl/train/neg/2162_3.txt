I do not believe in praise for this film. Art and film were a rip off of Sleuth. Michael Caine wants him to be Olivier, and Reeves wants him to be Cain. Caine even had the courage to do a Sleuth remake with Jude Law in his original part. Jude Law? You mean the one who did the "Alfie" remake? <br /> <br /> This movie was made during Caine's career, when it was obvious that he had to pay the gambling debts. He would do anything for money. He would play such award-winning films as this and "Beyond the Poseidon Adventure". What seems to fuel the praise for this film is Reeves' death. He deserves something better than to be remembered for this bad movie. Like Caine. This movie can be found in the $ 5.97 cost in Walmart. Along with jewels such as "The Island" and "Blame it on Rio".
