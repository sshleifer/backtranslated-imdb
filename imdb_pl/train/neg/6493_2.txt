Dear ... as an Englishman and a small part of the Welshman, fans of Anthony Hopkins' work in the industry ..... so far I am very disappointed. <br /> <br /> You see that I am someone who hoped for a better one. My comments are therefore "straw in the wind". But that's it? - I have nothing to say about the commercial value of the work. I am a full-fledged member of the big unwashed, I am going to see a movie that will be transported to another place. To do so, suspend your faith for a short period. But not to enter into a state of complete disbelief. <br /> <br /> If it was an unknown author and director, I would guess that this "production" would be doomed to oblivion. Unfortunately, no, and I was wide open and confused. Seeing some enthusiastic reviews, considering this work, I'm slightly worried .... <br /> <br /> Maybe it's because I try, without prejudice, to watch every movie based on my own merits. Regardless of the author, director, studio or even the publicity of the content. <br /> <br /> My advice, like many others before me: do not write and do not direct the same production. Is dangerous. Movies must be moderated to preserve the appearance of credibility. <br /> <br /> As they say in the school reports, "Can and can be done better ..."
