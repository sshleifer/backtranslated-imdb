The plot is rocky. Acting is somewhere south of the Jr game. High School. Cinematography is not bad, but it looks like it was cut with a machete. I could not decide that it was deliberately hokey flick or if the people behind him think they're making a good movie. Think Death Valley Days meets Mayberry RFD. People are running in the "unlawful" modern city, carrying fast guns 6 pistols. It has more than just participation in the "cutsey". Imagine how good guys drive up to the old farm house and park the Ford Mustang just in front of the drawbar. Imagine a clerk at a hotel watching a western (hemisphere) movie with a Japanese soundtrack, but with English subtitles. It's all really weird, but it can be improved if you watch them taking part in a small peyote. This is the real curiosity of contemporary similarities to every stereotype of the western film that you can come up with. In the soundtrack there is even a modern version of a good girl dancing in the dance hall, and also a brandishing Jewish harp. Really! If someone brings it home for a Saturday movie session, say that your DVD player has died.
