This movie deserves another bad review. Consider one reviewer praising the benefits of a movie that includes "no sex, violence or gore". Excuse me. The mere configuration of the movie makes us look at how young Cody's companion, with love for life and for whom everything is to live, is torn to pieces, leaving Cody holding his dead, bloodied body. And given the nature of the war, we know that Cody saw horror almost every day. So much for those watching this movie with such pink glasses that the violence that defines Cody's personality is erased from the viewer's memory. <br /> <br /> Sans, every family of his Cody, like John Rambo, wanders around the country on a long hiking trip to his hometown US in the guise of a place called Nevada City. No mention, lack of understanding of the fact that Cody is damaged goods. We know this because his CO practically declares him when he orders Cody to "rest" from the death and destruction of the war. He explains this because no one seems to notice or care for the obvious "flat" Cody effect. This is not bad acting. It is a flat effect of post-traumatic stress disorder. Not guessing here, remember that his CO told him to leave the battlefield. <br /> <br /> What about this "casual" kiss, as another review noted. The fall was an accident, the kiss did not. How exactly did Cody "respect" faith by hitting her, knowing well that she was speaking for her? It was a moment that was not family. The moment that is then announced in the nearest universe, as if it was published on YouTube. Of course, the passing of fidelity to faithfulness, as well as the "coming" of Cody to a woman who plans to marry another, is received in the spirit of Christmas, everyone is bargaining their cheated hearts and lips. <br /> <br /> does not know much about Faith's fianc√©, except he confesses his love to him, he does not take more than nano a second to accept his offer (he could wait if he thinks), he is generous, he loves her death, the family has nothing against him, believes that the marriage is based on compromises, and both have never discussed plans after marriage. There is no one wrong here. <br /> <br /> Asner is a great actor given by dialogue on the hill, "we love you, son ..." "You are part of our family" literally a few days after they met a stranger named Cody. And the "band of brothers' speech" in which this phrase was never intended to apply to virtual strangers from the battlefield. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: This movie is an Xmas sweat made from cotton candy, which is betrayed in many ways. Most blatantly, when he applauds the lack of respect for Cody's faith, physically hitting her, knowing that he knows well, he speaks for her. Again defining a family as we know it, accepting a virtual stranger as a full-fledged loving family member because we all "love you". How many of you did it or know someone who did it. NO.
