Absolutely one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time! It starts badly and it just gets worse. Katherine Heigl is pitifully mistaken in the role of Lolita, and Leo Grillo cleverly struggles with what is essentially a cardboard cut-out. The only member of the cast with enthusiasm is Tom Sizemore, who plays the role of a villain and completely overreacts with his role. The script is horrible, acting terribly and has holes on the set large enough to go through a double-decker bus! It's also the most sexist movie I've ever seen! The character of Katherine Heigl is completely unfriendly. She is seen as an evil, thoughtless seducer who lures a poor, innocent married man to cheat on his wife. It is implicit in the whole film that he is a minor, and the message that accompanies the plot, only begging believes! In the end, he is not even able to buy himself back by shooting a man who apparently (ha!) Got mad with rage and guilt, but the script allows him to kill himself, buying himself in the eyes of men all over the world. Awful. Do not waste time.
