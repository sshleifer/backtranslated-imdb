I'm usually a fan of a movie from the eighties and early nineties, which now has beens ... but this movie is so horrible that it was a real endurance test. Guys dressing up for girls were killed to death - but never so miserable. Corey Haim's performance was as fatal as ever, Nicole Eggert was not much better. There are no advantages, even if you're a fan of the number one actor / actress in this piece of trash - stay away!
