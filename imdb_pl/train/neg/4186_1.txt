My comment has nothing to do with the political mood in the film. In fact, they are quite compatible with mine. What unites me is the fact that when it comes to a movie, it is stupid and lacking in appearances of history, motif or dialogue. Maybe someone should tell Neal that replacing the lyrics of the songs that do not inspire anyone but the waning audience is not the same as creating characters who are motivated to speak because of the writer's or director's events. Stupid narratives remain so despite the iconic heritage of Neal Young. The most childish scene is the one in which the devil dances in the bar, slips the tonic into the unsuspecting protagonist, who then finds his way to the dance floor to express the words to Young's song to the heroine who is unaware of what happened. Somehow, these two invent a scheme in which they will go to the West Coast in search of ????? Excuse me, Neal, stick to the music and become a Steven Stills filmmaker.
