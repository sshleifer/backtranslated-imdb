In the last 10 years I have worked in 3 different independent wrestling organizations, I managed many professional wrestlers (including 2 Backyard Wrestling stars), I worked on 2 different wrestling television programs and led lecturers and comments to many wrestling DVDs. I have NEVER seen the level of amateur stupidity, lack of talent and skill, and cheesy quality of production at Splatter Rampage Wrestling. To even mention it as a wrestling movie of ANY kind is completely wrong time. Filmed with low-cost video cameras, they are mainly home movies of children fighting in the backyards. The sound quality is bad, the video quality is bad, and the acting is frightening. "Wrestlers" wear makeshift suits with hand-drawn t-shirts and ski masks, and they hit objects and half imitate wrestling movements. Sometimes "matches" are on the grass. Sometimes on the trampoline in the yard. EVERYTHING is poorly kept and performed with the shameless lack of any wrestling skills. In short, do not worry about this smelly one. Regardless of whether your interest in this DVD is entertaining or academic (both in my case), you will be terribly disappointed.
