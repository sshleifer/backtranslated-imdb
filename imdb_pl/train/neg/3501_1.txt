I understand jokes pretty well, they just are not good. The show is terrible. I understand this and this is another horrible thing. The only cool character he has ever played in is this one hobo in this episode, but then I see another episode, including this episode, and the show is terrible. This is not funny, NOT fun! I do not want people to say, "Only wise people get it," because if they are so intelligent, why do they judge people they do not even know and say they are not smart enough or intellectual enough to understand? It's like saying "Heaven is red", but he never looks outside. But anyway, this is absolutely the worst performance I've ever seen in my life, jokes are awful, I mean, you can understand them, they're just awful, her controversies are very bad, her jokes and other jokes about body fluids are really stupid and usually consist of really bad actions. I'm not sure what those "intelligent" people see in this program, but judging others when they do not even know anything about any of us is not entirely a wise commentary.
