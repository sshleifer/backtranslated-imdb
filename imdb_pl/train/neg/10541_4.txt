I have noted here some notes on the FIRST POWER, Lou Lambada Diamond Phillips, a satanic serial killer from 1990, yuppie hell-fest ... <br /> <br /> 1) Lou Diamond Phillips has recently been accused of beating his wife and maybe serve in prison. I just hope he can find the stylish clothing of Armani prison: One of the guilty pleasures of this movie is seeing his police detective in $ 4,500 designer coats, a designer silk suit for $ 7,300 and watching his $ 3,500 a month in Los Angeles loft studio apartment with décor interior by Mies Van Der Roeh. <br /> <br /> 2) Leading lady Tracey Phillips has a wonderful porcelain skin, flowing red hair that always seems stylized even on reverie, and amazing breasts that are highlighted in the second half of the movie - designer of a silk sweater, which unfortunately he remains on his torso even when she was prepared to sacrifice Satan. At least in the 1970s, our demonic killers stripped their victims before they got rid of them, although there is something that can be said to have left some imagination behind. For the last 10 minutes of the movie, I could only think about what her breasts would look like. <br /> <br /> 3) Professional psychologists living in Los Angeles can afford a $ 4 million flat on Mullholland Drive with a view of Los Angeles with a view that would make Brad Pitt decide to do it. In fact, the condom used in this movie looks exactly the same as seen in MULLHOLLAND DR. David Lynch, who at least made a good sense to become a resident of a successful film director. The only professional psychics with whom I met outside this film are currently serving prison sentences for wire fraud. <br /> <br /> 4) I forgot his name, but the villain in this movie is wonderful, and his "Jak goes", Buddy Boy? "line could be the best skipped film phrase from" THANKS FOR DRIVING, LADY !! " z CREEPSHOW 2. <br /> <br /> 5) Under the main metropolitan cities there are huge vats with bubbling acid that will explode into enormous balls of fire, if someone throws an ignited Zippo lighter in them, that's why all public waterworks have no there are no signs of smoking on them, although the idea of ​​smoking near dangerous water is obviously ridiculous. And because Zippo lighters have to be manually filled with a lighter liquid that often leaks and gets absorbed by clothing, the idea of ​​wearing one in a pocket of Gucci silk suit worth 7300 USD seems to me much more dangerous. <Br /> <br /> 6) The stunts in this movie are at least impressive, and one of the fun things about watching is staying alone that you do not watch computer-assisted special effects, but real stuntmen risking their lives and limbs to contribute to a film that won almost universal BOMB ratings from critics when it was released. <br /> <br /> 7) Movie satanists always amaze me: here's the guy who used some luciferian power offer, and yet instead of using it, do something useful, like, for example, enriching or making models engage in sex with him in a relaxed form, instead he has baggy ladies and tells them to levitate outside the apartments of people. Speaking of which, a guy who is indestructible can fly and is able to put his body in the body of other people - yet he obliges the star of Lou Diamond Phillips with a simple fist fight at the end of the movie, but there is no common sense to live in Arnold Schwartzeneggar or Apollo Creed to make sure he wins. <br /> <br /> And further and further ... Being watched in the company of shaky friends while eating beer. You will have fun as long as you persist in refusing serious treatment. <br /> <br /> 4/10
