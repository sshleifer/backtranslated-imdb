My girlfriend is in the habit of going to Blockbuster and choosing movies that no one has heard of. Admittedly, sometimes it led to some funny discoveries. Often the best thing you can say is that they are definitely running an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> She brought home 'Tips from Caterpillar'. She was excited because the box said it was fun. Fortunately for us, propaganda on boxes never lies. <br /> <br /> This movie was an exercise in patience. This is one of those movies where, if you are not a pretentious and shallow man who likes to watch movies about yourself, you will hate every character in the movie. Until you enter one nice character. Which annoying annoying pretentious hero will fall in love and act in such a way that in the real world he will push everyone away. <br /> <br /> MILD SPOILERS WITH HERE <br /> <br /> So a group of emotionally boring, imprisoned, pretentious artists curses love and finds success in a career. Then they meet a nice, intelligent, emotionally mature and loving character (almost perfect guy). Then we watch a woman, annoyingly pretentious artist (in her thirties?), Who turns around when she falls in love. So he tries to escape from a nice, intelligent, emotionally mature man and stay with a married man with whom he has wonderful but empty sex. She is rude to a man and does everything in her power to push him away. In the real world it would be a success. I certainly wanted to get away from her and I was not even in a relationship with her! <br /> <br /> Although nice that a man "fought for his love", I never wanted her to have it. (Neither my girlfriend) She did not deserve him. And why I wonder if the director thought that "almost perfect guy" should be punished that he must win a relationship with her? When the artist asked "almost perfect guy" to leave, we shouted that he would also leave. There's a problem with the movie when the movie character is so annoying, childish and stupid that you want her to fail. <br /> <br /> Besides, let me say that Andy Dick made me laugh a few times even though his character was also pretentious up to irritation. As for other characters, they were well-preserved, morally bankrupt and annoying characters. <br /> <br /> This is a comedy and I can say that I laughed a few times in the film. Unfortunately, not much laughter has happened for the last 10 minutes. But before I laughed, I prayed that the film would end too long. I had to bring out these miserable figures from my life. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch people you hate to fight with love for people you do not deserve, this is a movie for you.
