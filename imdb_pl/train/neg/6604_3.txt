The first one was the best. The second one sucked because the dialogue was terrible. Although the plot was not so bad (in fact, all plot lines are good and bad). I have been dispensing several times throughout the film. I know Jackie Chan is a great martial artist, but he's not a good actor in Rush Hour 2. Chris Tucker was not good either. And Zhang Ziyi, what can I say, a few lines, terrible acting (But this is based on her scenario). All characters were not so good. But some things that I like about Rush Hour 2 are always action and less sex scenes. I know Jackie Chan does not do those things that are good for him.
