Usually I'm quite a generous critic, but in the case of this movie I have to say that he was incredibly angry. I am stunned by how many positive opinions seem to be. <br /> <br /> There were some great shots, but it's a pity that they have been wasted on this film hollow. This could work if "Daggers" were pure action, not romance, but unfortunately the film is built around an empty love triangle. There is no chemistry between any of the couples, everything that exists between Mei and her men seems to be more desirable than love, and in the majority the dialogue is simply stupid. It may simply be a problem with the translation, but the frequent use of the word "flirt" in particular reminded me of the eighth grade, not the headgear, together forever, worth dying - for love; I also felt that we were defeated by the metaphor of the wind. The audience does not pay much attention to the characters that really care about, and thus very little emotional investment in the whole movie. I wanted the remote control to fast forward. I was slumped into the seat ready for snoring, but mostly I just crouched. <br /> <br /> ******* spoiler ***** <br /> <br /> Now the icing on the cake. Or rather, adding an insult to the damage. The ending was really one of the most terrible, funny I've ever seen. The boys are fighting for deer, they shout and yell at each other. Oh, and then it's snowing. Random. Oh, and then Mei (dagger embedded in the heart) suddenly pops out of the weeds. Then he throws a dagger, which seems to take about 5 minutes to reach the target, even slowing the center of the screen to hit a tiny drop of blood. Wow, cool. <br /> <br /> Well, then Mei finally dies, because she threw a dagger, which was placed in her breast and bleed to death. Jin sings, sobs, closes the body, the screen goes out. Me and people around me giggle. This is not a good sign. <br /> <br /> Stunning visually, but ultimately a failure.
