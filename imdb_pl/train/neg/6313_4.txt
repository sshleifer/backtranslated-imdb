Well, it's not so often that in the UK we have a movie about living in the city center from the perspective of the Afro-Caribbean community, the last example I remember was the underestimated way in which Babylon returned in 1980. about Bullet Boy, a movie advertised as the British version of La Haine! Well, La Haine is not! I agree that the use of dialogue and the environment gives the film authenticity, which was omitted in other British films late, but I'm afraid that this movie may unfortunately end. <br /> <br /> The film intelligently deals with the growing problem of violence against blacks, which is unfortunately widespread in London, but I'm afraid that filmmakers now use casting in the story, as opposed to characters that are equally harmful. Saul Dibb had a great opportunity to make a movie that would be both entertaining and inspiring for all of us, but unfortunately he missed and created a movie that only reinforces the view that being a young black man in London is the only future violence and tragedy
