The usual, cheesy, stupid story of Italo-Western, full of stereotypes and lack of logic, a few mediocre actors, dirty scenery, many fights with punch and people shooting to death on a large scale. <br /> <br /> This is nothing to do with Django. - At least not in my German translated version, this German version of the DVD is called "Adios Companeros" and has Macho Callaghan fighting with Butch Cassidy and Ironhead, because their gang killed him (he is the only survivor). Then you have Butch Cassidy and Ironhead fighting each other, because they had a fight and the gang split up. And you have Ironhead fighting everyone, because he is the biggest and most-greedy asshole anyway. Yes, that's all, no more cunning in the story, hehe. <br /> <br /> The small role of Klaus Kinski as Reverend Cotton is extraordinary (that's why I bought this DVD). In one scene, he tries to separate two fighting men by hitting them and shouting "I said love!". and on another stage wins the horseshoeing contest and rages for a second - FANTASTICFANTASTICFANTASTIC !!! <br /> <br /> It is also remarkable that JOE d'AMATO aka Aristide Massaccesi took pictures - I love this master incompetent exploitation - thrash, so it was "aahhh" for me.
