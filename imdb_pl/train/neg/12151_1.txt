this is probably the worst game I've ever seen in a movie ... ever. and what happens to the casting. the leading lady in this movie has some kind of nose disorientation and is almost impossible to watch for any period of time without attaching it to her nose. you can go to the local grocery store on a Sunday afternoon and easily find 50 more qualified, better-looking, leading ladies. I made an unfortunate mistake by renting this movie because it had a "nice" DVD case. This movie looks like it's just a class project for a group of multimedia students at a local technical college. I'd rather spend an hour or so that this movie was on public television ... at least the special effects are better and people on them are more attractive than anyone you see in this movie
