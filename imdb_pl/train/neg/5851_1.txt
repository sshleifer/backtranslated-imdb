I doubt if Jigsaw was fashionable even at this time, the whole topic of LSD got married to the mystery of murder, which is obviously an obvious attempt to catch a young audience of the era without even full understanding of the counter-culture of the sixties. Rejected aspect of the day, Jigsaw suffers from many problems, including exaggerated action, stupid and slim dialogue, LSD flashbacks that last infinitively long, even after the point has been pounded home in the first 60 seconds, failure to create real tension, Even the Actual plot is, on paper, a great vehicle to do it and an ending that is so banal and predictable (not to mention many bad TV shows) that the culmination is in fact an anti-climax. If it was a better movie, we could suspend disbelief on a few things that would help to get pleasure, but the weaknesses are so blatant that they only serve to underline the improbability that viewers might overlook. I've seen Jigsaw on TV and it's definitely a late night TV tariff that's supposed to fill the airspace and kill time to kill someone's insomnia, and not anything anyone should actively seek. Three out of ten at best.
