For those who like depressing movies with wretched characters and a dirty story, this one is for you! From the bleak atmosphere of New York, which is extremely bleak and almost hopeless, to two different leading characters deprived of a sense of morality, this film is a real fall. <br /> <br /> Why he won the Oscar, because it was so shocking at that time that Hollywood, a completely new freedom to show everything he wanted, with all the abandoned moral codes, wanted to celebrate this fact. The filmmakers were like an immature six-year-old with an unlimited spending bill at a local candy store. So Hollywood gave viewers (probably the first time) a dose of rape, prostitution, homosexuality, nakedness of children, homelessness and other such great views and sounds that only his twisted brain would think he was attracted ... and then rewarded his work . <br /> <br /> I also hoped that I was sure that it would shock the mainstream audience. Well, it has succeeded at this level. The audience was stunned by what they were saying and heard, and the Academy, proud of being able to show dirt and make money at the same time, could not help but honor this piece of gilded trash. <br /> <br /> Forty years ago, as a very young man, I find this film fascinating. However, seeing it again in the 90s left such a bad taste in my mouth that I never saw it again. <br /> <br /> Acting was good, but so what? Acting is good in many movies. No one has ever said that Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight can not act. Hoffman was especially good at his younger times in playing crazy people. He was a bit like Johnny Depp from his time, playing in this movie such as "Ratso Rizzo" and later "Rain Man". Yes, "Ratso" is a character you will never forget, and "Joe Buck" (Voight) is the one you want to forget about, but the story is so dingy that it overwhelms good acting. <br /> <br /> This film is not "art" and does not deserve many awards; in 1969, she pushed the envelope on a large scale and that is why it is so remembered in the film hearts of people and critics. It's two hours of vulgarisms and ultra-primitive, religious cheap shots, glorifying weirdos (Andy Warhol even comes into play - no surprise) and generally wicked people. <br /> <br /> I did what was catchy "Everybody's Talking" that made Harry Nilsson famous, but even it was fake because Fred Neil wrote the song and sang it better before Nilsson did it ... and few people heard about Neil (what is their loss). And - as already mentioned - the name "Ratso Rizzo" remained with you! <br /> <br /> The film is a breakthrough, but in the negative sense, I'm afraid it meant an "official" movie that Hollywood had gone to the toilet and has remained in the canal since then.
