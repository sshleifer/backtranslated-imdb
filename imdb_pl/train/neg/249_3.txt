That afternoon I saw this movie in my English lesson and I was surprised how bad this version was. Do not get me wrong, George C. Scott was great as Scrooge, but the rest of the cast fails very badly. Sometimes I could not stop laughing at silly acting and the recurring lines: "Merry Christmas to everyone!" Another time I almost fell asleep. <br /> <br /> The film is based on a story by Charles Dickens about a rich guy who does not think Christmas is anything but a humbug. After 30 minutes of a rich guest, they visit three ghosts who convince him to celebrate Christmas after all. <br /> <br /> I can not understand how this movie, with such a bad script, had to be written in five minutes, it can be judged so well. Instead, I recommend you a piece of Bill Murray Scrooged's comedy. At least it was fun ...
