I do not know what Margaret Atwood was thinking, that this movie would have the same name as her book. I've always been a big fan of Robber Bride and I was so excited that I found out that there was a movie in the movies. I know that translating a book into a movie is not perfect, but this movie was the worst in history. The names of women are correct, and some stories are correct, but that's the point. I feel that I lost a lot of my time trying to go through this movie. It really should be a mini-series telling a story the way it was written. <br /> <br /> The actors on Roz, Tony, Charis and Zenia were well-chosen, although initially I was skeptical about Mary-Louise Parker. I just want them to have a better script for work, because it had nothing to do with the book at all.
