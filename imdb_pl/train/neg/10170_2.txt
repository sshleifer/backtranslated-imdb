The championship match lasts only a few days, but things in New Orleans are not what they should be. From players with marital problems to overdose of drugs to gambling problems with a killer in the wild, life becomes an obstacle to what should be an unforgettable, wonderful time. Is it possible to restore order and the killer stopped before ruining the great game? <br /> <br /> Despite what you think, when you first read about Superdome, it's not a football movie. In fact, football is nothing more than a story and thought device. Instead, the Superdome is another of those bad soap operas from the '70s, films made for television in which Hollywood lives, and those that never will. The cast goes through all this, and nobody looks good. The best (or worst) example is Van Johnson in a very small role, looking generally lost, why is there. The story is boring, uninteresting and unbelievable. Donna Mills as a hit "man"? Yes, sure! It is just as credible as the romance he has with alcohol, soaked with David Jansen. The film also lacks pace. Trying to enter all four or five storylines in the movie preview, regardless of the flow Superdome would have. Without drama and tension in sight, the Superdome is a very poor example of a movie from the 1970s. The only attraction for me was to work on the lecturer of the late Charlie Jones - a sports listener I miss. The eloquent way in which the intrigue and exaggeration of the atmosphere in New Orleans is pure at its best. <br /> <br /> Like most people who have seen the Superdome, I did it also thanks to the Mystery Science Theater 3000. This can be one of KTMA's public access episodes, but this is one of the best examples of the early beginnings of the show. So although I rate Superdome on 2/10, I will give this episode generously 3/5 on the MST3K scale.
