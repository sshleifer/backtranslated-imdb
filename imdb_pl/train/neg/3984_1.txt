I saw this movie a few years ago on the BBC and sat in it. How? I do not know, it's there in the "bad, good" Kidman charts, Baldwin and Pullman have to cringe when they see him. I think Woody Allen would do wonders with a bizarre story and Baldwin could be played with enthusiasm by Leslie Nelson.it was back tonight. I tried to watch it again, but life is too short. for a few minutes I watched the charming Nicole who was so hot around 93, did Baldwin ever make a good movie? Pullman played the stock market as a "nice but dark" character whose "F" came out of his mouth when a lady with "frightening" confusion as a detective accuses him of murder, sounds so bad. stay away.
