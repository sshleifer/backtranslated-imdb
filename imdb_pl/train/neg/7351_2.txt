Sometimes you need to see a bad movie to appreciate good. Well, that's my opinion. This one will always be in a bad movie category, simply because all of Shu Qi's performances were awful. <br /> <br /> Martial Angel talks about Cat (Shu Qi), a professional thief turned straight after leaving his lover, Chi Lam (Julian Cheung), two years earlier. But her past is coming back to haunt her when Chi Lam is kidnapped for the ransom of security software owned by Cat. To save him, he calls his old friends from the orphanage's day, six other burly women to save the day ... <br /> <br /> I could have recounted the abstract, but it's a bad plot. In fact, the entire script and direction did not have any quality. Much of the dialogue was meaningless and combined with a story that was as thin as rice paper in water. If I could sum it up, make a bad movie by Jackie Chan, remove the comedy, delete the choreography, throw out the budget and you have Martial Angels: the formula of a piece of work without imagination. <br /> <br /> Remember, I have to grant credit where credit is due, and Shu Qi was probably the only person who emerged unscathed from this horrible action, because it was her behavior that shone. Okay, you can not say she was perfect - in the end she had absolutely nothing to do - but she managed to dig a character from her role. Besides, only Sandra Ng and Kelly Lin made a different impression - although they were mainly sparkles and very short. <br /> <br /> Elsewhere, the movie just broke up. The scenes and dialogue were totally unnatural and unbelievable, of course the special effects were cheaper, without trying to clean the edges between people and the blue screen mask, the poor editing included numerous discontinuities in battle scenes, camera angles that were elementary and unflattering and the direction I saw better from a lost dog. <br /> <br /> I think that this movie was too much a matter for the chefs. Most likely, the budget was delighted with excessive enthusiasm to have seven sticks on the same silver screen. It did not leave anything else. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the way the movie was made was like a cheap porn movie without pornography. Charlie's angels, this is not. In fact, while the sisters can do it for themselves, none of this was so obvious here. <br /> <br /> Definitely forget.
