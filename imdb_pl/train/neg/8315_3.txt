What a missed opportunity to make an interesting film about a complicated topic. There is little research on what it is like to be a simple (or gay) man working in a gay sexual environment. Dancers are still talking about their art, as if it had no erotic element. Not everyone can be a prostitute for rent, but in reality they are sex workers playing fantasies and selling private sessions, where something more than dancing is offered. The film has the impression that they refer mainly to women who go to gay clubs, and then employ "dancers" for private sessions. Even the shots in the club show only women on stage, and "dancers" only play for women in the audience. This is not the reality of these clubs. It would be difficult to make a living by doing private dances for simple women and couples. What do they really feel about their gay admirers and clients? We learn very little. Instead, we get a filler. A gay activist who does nothing to teach simple dancers. A manager who tells us about costumes for drags, but does not give insight into the lives and attitudes of dancers. <br /> <br /> Photos of Mexico City are general. The phony setup showing the sausage roasting is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> This is a completely simplified movie that should only interest those who want to see some pictures of pretty dancing boys. The rest of the movie is an insult to homosexuals.
