Probably it was just my DVD --- but I do not recommend anyone to try to watch this image on DVD. <br /> <br /> I had to increase the volume on my TV to the highest level in order to hear about 80 percent of the dialog. Some conversations were still inaudible. If you are from Scotland, you can have a chance, though slim. <br /> <br /> Folk voices have been drowned out by almost all surrounding sounds, including unpacking the parcels, steps, even a cigarette. <br /> <br /> After increasing the volume to the level at which voices are heard, I can guarantee that at least one of the neighbors will call the police when the scene turns into a loud environment such as a disco. And that you'll hurt yourself by diving so the pilot can turn it off again. <br /> <br /> There is art and there is art, even in the field of sound mixing. But this effort, during the war, would meet international criteria to be classed as cruelty. <br /> <br /> After about half an hour I gave up, not seeing anything else that could be in the picture.
