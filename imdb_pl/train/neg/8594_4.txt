At some point, Violet (Lucy Liu) tells Neil (Cillian Murphy) that he is constantly looking for adventure. She said "because I'm boring". This means that he can not really deal with his life by doing some obligatory activities. Well, I think her reason and the way this movie goes is very ironic. Because "Watching the Detectives" is a boring joy. <br /> <br /> Are any of these characters doing something exciting? Neil is a maniac who runs his own very small video rental. He and his other geek friends usually spend time in the shop and watch movies together, discussing them later. But Neil's life is completely reversed when Violet enters his store. She is an eccentric woman who hides a small secret from him. In any case, after some dates, they decide to see. The problem is that Violet is a person who is still joking with Neil and can not really do something normal while Neil is completely against her. The question is. Will they be in love at the end? You found yourself. <br /> <br /> "Watching the Detectives" is a stereotypical romantic comedy. And they even did it the worst, pretending something else. From the first configuration, we know that Neil is a very laid back guy who did not really commit anything. And then Violet enters the stage, looking strangely and annoying. At this point, we all know that we will sit through all senseless situations to find out how it will eventually end. Is it worth waiting? I would say no. <br /> <br /> As I said, they tried to give something more to the audience. "Watching the Detectives" tries to talk about involvement. To observe how far people are going to reach for something they want. In the end, we knew that the crazy things that Violet did, are a test of how far Neil is ready to get her heart (or anything). Well, I think it's complete nonsense. This movie will end soon enough if Neil told himself: "Forget it, this girl is one of the best women!" After working with many great directors recently ("Sunshine" by Danny Boyle and "28 days later", "The Wind That Shakes the Barley" by Ken Loach and "Breakfast on Pluto" by Neil Jordan), this is a rather strange choice for Cillian Murphy to shoot a movie with one of the Broken Lizard comedones, Paul Soter. In any case, he is not angry (as usual), but the talent of an actor like him should not waste time on this film. On the other hand, Lucy Liu is terribly horrible like Violet. Her acting is a mess. I mean, it's everywhere on the surface. Tony Montana would be proud. <br /> <br /> The last but not least mistake made by the film is a completely irrelevant title. You simply can not connect the dot between the story and its title; and then you finish thinking that it does not make sense at all. In a nutshell, "Watching the Detectives" is a nice, if not forgotten, movie that you may have a chance to catch on cable TV so fast that you can not imagine it. <br /> <br /> BloodyMonday Rating: 1.5 / 4
