This movie can be a decent horror movie. The main character was decently made and I felt sorry for him and there was a lot of decent history. However, everything else sucks. The director, Emmanuel, is incompetent in making films. Uses one of the most idiotic shots in history. <br /> <br /> - several random sequences of random images scattered throughout the movie. I do not know if he tried to be deep, intelligent and poetic, but he was not. It was stupid. Random shots of the trailer in which the main character lived, random buildings, random shots of buildings, a random cat that goes away. WTF? And clouds. Lots of dark dark clouds. <br /> <br /> - he really liked the technique of cutting the stage into different shots, not just one shot. EX: The guy is trying to light his weed, and the camera is circling him. Instead of one shot, he edits it in 10 different shots, so it's really EDGY! and HIP! and wise! stupid. <br /> <br /> Acting is terrible, but it makes the movie so funny. And the scarecrow is a gymnast, because he spins, turns and spins all the time. And some of the deaths could have been better. You expect the main tyrant to have a long, well-built death, but no. A simple corncob in the ear. The interest in love was hot. Sensual. That's why this movie gets 2.
