It is really sad that it was probably the highest budget for "Halestorm Entertainment" with which he had to work. Everyone involved should be fined for littering, because the celluloid they are wasting is good for nothing more than refilling. The magazine is not only horrible, it's awful jokes, but camera work and film quality are amateurish at best. The soundtrack sounds as if it was created on some portable computers. The worst part is that I really sat through the whole thing. I think it's only because I could not believe that I actually paid for the ticket and that the theater where I watched him agreed to show the film.
