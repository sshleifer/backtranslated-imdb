[*** POSSIBLE SPOILERS ***] The reputation of this movie precedes it, so I impatiently sat down to watch it in the mailbox in TCM. What a great disappointment. <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent and the production values ​​are first-rate, but the characters are without depth, the plot is thin and the whole takes too long. In the film, which deals with alcoholism, family divisions, infidelity, gambling and sexual repression, the film is strangely flat, prosaic, lifeless and restrained. One example is Frank Hirsch's unfaithfulness: his rather heavy plea to his wife that she "go upstairs and relax a bit", and then her predictable begging for a headache leads - even more predictably - to his evening cooperation with his secretary ( "Hey, Nancy, I have a blues tonight. Let's go for a ride"), all in accordance with the worn formula. We do not think they are real people, but cardboard cutouts that work in a puppet game. Also the source of obvious friction between Frank and Dave Hirsch is never investigated or explained. Dave's infatuation with Gwen, who is reborn again, is inexplicable in the light of her stupid inability to defecate or leave the pot. His later marriage of desperation with the character Shirley Maclaine / Ginny has, since being presented to the viewer, obviously doomed to failure, and it was clear - by the conventions of this type of soap opera - that he could only be solved by someone killed. The moment the jealous lover started running with his arms, I started to bet with him who - Dave or Ginny - would die. The whole was false with a large "P". <br /> <br /> Having said that, Maclaine's and Dean Martin's performance are distinguishing features. But generally, I think the interest in the movie is just a story from Hollywood history.
