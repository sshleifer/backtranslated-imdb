A disappointing, predictable movie in which a woman (Mc Teer) travels with her daughter from state to state because she can not maintain relationships and find happiness. In this genre "Anywhere but here" with Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman it was possible to get to know the mother's relationship with her daughter much better. With better performance.
