I can not believe that this wooden, filmed and directed piece of film was made. There are about four good-looking shots (the director should think about switching to a still photo) and that's it. A strong cast is completely wasted, the scenes end up in the least interesting moments many times, and the script says nothing new. Save yourself this movie.
