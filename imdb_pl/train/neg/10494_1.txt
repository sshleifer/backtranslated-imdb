In the program of Steve Irwin, he is hilarious. He does not even try to be funny, and he just is, but his movie was not even what I would call a movie - I mean, when this guy in the car tries to kill him, he just says, "Oh, that's one nasty guy!" and looking straight at the camera. He put his face too much in the camera! And when a guy falls off the car, do not you expect he is dead? And Terri had the worst acting I've ever seen! Like when the crocodile almost ate Steve, she just says "Steve." It did not sound terrified or anything, just "Steve." I mean, I hate to sound, but it was not worth seeing. I love Steve Irwin, but his movie was just too stupid.
