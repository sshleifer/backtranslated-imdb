I am a fan of Without A Trace from the first episode. I really can not express disappointment in this episode last week. This is a TRUE problem with which too many Afican families and Americans have dealt with. The lack of media coverage within the first 48 hours has been documented in a recent study. Law enforcement agencies, including local, state and federal, are also complicit. What was the purpose of advertising this topic and then withdrawing from the end? Seemingly TV can deal with almost any subject, except for the RACE. It's embarrassing. Collect them together or do not research it next time.
