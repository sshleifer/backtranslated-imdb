... and this is the movie. I imagine that if there is indeed a negative afterlife, cursed souls are tied to a rather uncomfortable couch and forced to watch the film in a continuous loop for all eternity. <br /> <br /> Okay, maybe it's not that bad, but it's probably the worst movie I've ever seen next to "Manos, Hands of Fate" ... and I've seen a lot of bad movies, believe me. <br /> <br /> It's just a bad movie B, bad filming at its best (or maybe it's the worst?) What I really did not like about this movie is the moronic duo they put in the comedy relief. A small comedy relief is a good thing, but most of the movie focuses on the adventures of these two cretins, not on the "heroes" of this movie, who are really shorter in it than they are! <br /> <br /> To be honest, Crown International really destroyed the movie by adding bad music and doing the job wrong. But honestly, it was probably a bad movie, so Crown really could not do enough to hurt him. <br /> <br /> It really has to be on the lowest 100 list. I would not like it on my worst enemy. <br /> <br /> Actually, it's my kind of Camp movie B. It was bad, but I still liked it, despite my one star rating.
