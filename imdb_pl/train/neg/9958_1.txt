If they speak to you completely easy, regressive, indulgent, anti-establishment, anti-civilization, this is the perfect movie. This is a very badly written script, with often inaudible dialogue and an annoyingly tiring manual camera all the time, it is a film that presents the world in attractively simplified Manichean terms: all adults (especially teachers, parents, priests and doctors) are insensitive at best and inept and predatory monsters in the worst case. The only escape from the horrors of civilization as a whole is a lot of primal screams (yawning) and children's regression (literally) in the primitive cave space in the forest, with a utopia taking the form of a rave party - again in forests (naturally ...). It displays all the weaknesses of the first movie and many more.
