God, I was bored with my head when I watched the pilot. I was expecting a lot from this because I am a big fan of James Cameron (and not only from "Titanic", I could add), and his name in the subtitles, which I thought was a guarantee of quality (again, he also wrote the main part of Strange Days ..). But this thing failed, attracting my attention at any moment during its nearly two-hour duration. During all this time, it barely went beyond the two-line summary and it would be very difficult for me to find a coherent thread from the whole mess of threads that have not gone anywhere. What's more, I do not think that the acrobatics outpaced even those from the regular episodes of "A-Team". As for Alba, of course, it's wonderful, but the fact that it displays only one facial expression throughout the film (pouty and surly) makes me very bored with her "wit funny attitude". You can count on it, Mr. Cameron!
