I did not like this movie intensely and left it during the scene in which the loyalist gang was shot by the British. The film effectively blames NI people for the cause of their own problems. This suggests that the 25-year war was a matter of tenacity and had nothing to do with the division of Britain by Britain and the dominance of its history, i.e. NI was created by Great Britain in 1921. Whatever the wishes of the rest of Ireland. <br /> <br /> The characters are portrayed as unfortunate fools, although I despise the loyalist paramilitaries for which they fought for the cause - retaining their artificial privileges over the Catholic community. It is known that the British intelligence collaborated with the loyalists during the war, no doubt to stop the Catholics and demoralize republicanism. <br /> <br /> Values ​​from the nineties about "machismo", masculinity, etc. They were transferred to the 70s Belfast and are portrayed as part of the allegedly unique Irish "psyche" that leads to violence. Stupid song of a woman in a club - old Irish green fields ... blah ... blah ... - receives a symbolic figure, ie Poor young fools fighting for the impossible cause. Tedious, ahistorical, cheap and nasty basket. O'Sullivan made a personal statement about the conflict, which requires serious political analysis.
