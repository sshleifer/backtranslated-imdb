A pretty bad Firestarter clone that seems like a bad television movie than a bad feature film. How disappointing is that Hooper and Dourif! <br /> <br /> Contractors perform an experiment with a hydrogen bomb. The boy, who was born with the experiment, still has a fever of 100 degrees, and when he is an adult, people in his life begin to burn spontaneously. He is trying to find out why. <br /> <br /> People who are completely torched are well-made, but when they get to the point that they are well done in a different sense, they are obviously turned into mannequins. When the fire jets fire from the figures' shoulders, it looks rather stupid than alarming. The fire is also funny, which evidently passes through telephone lines and explodes with huge streams from the receiver's receiver. How exactly is it going to happen? <br /> <br /> Something else hit me in the movie when the character has visions of his deceased parents. Later we will see exactly the same shots from these visions in home movies.
