This series gets 2 stars only because it puts a part of Dickens' Bleak House movie on the film and maybe somebody read the book. Contrary to assurances, Diana Rigg was as poor as Lady Dedlock. It was sticky and wooden. Lady D. is a reserved character, but not a martinet. Denholm Elliot is wrong, bad, bad for Mr. Jarndyce. So I stop and answer everyone who says, "I did not read the book, so I do not have to take this guy's opinion because he bases his grades on the book." True and not true. For example, Diana Rigg is evil in her role because of poor performance, regardless of whether you read the book. On the other hand, Denholm Elliot is a livable Jarndyce (though too old). The series fails not because it is unjust to compare it to a book, but because different fictional lines and characters simply do not combine to create a cohesive, dramatic, mysterious and attractive entertainment. It is boring and flat. If you want to create the best possible Bleak House, you have to spend 20 hours of film in 10 two-hour episodes. But I suggest that producers, etc. Leave Dickens alone (even A Christmas Carol). Television kills Dickens' genius, which manifests itself in his ingenious plots and unforgettable characters.
