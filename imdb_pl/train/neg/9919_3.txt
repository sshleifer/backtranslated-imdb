In the opening scene of Malta Story, Mr. A. Guinness had such a surprising resemblance to Noel Coward that I fully expected his first words to sound: "Some women need to regularly hit - like gongs" or some kind of world - tired bon mot. Unfortunately, his dialogue is not an immortal prose, and even the Master would have trouble putting it into practice. Indeed, Mr. Guinness wanders around the picture, as if searching for a focal point and not finding it. And this is the fatal weakness of the whole film. Mr. J. Hawkins also surrenders early and ends with the performance of "Jack Hawkins" without a bit of individuality. It could be combined with a dozen British war movies. Many of the early fifties of ordinary suspects appear and make their schtick to a very small goal. The Luftwaffe did not manage to bomb Malta in the same way that it failed to put London on its knees. The courage of the Maltese nation in the face of constant danger was recognized by the king, and the island received the George Cross award. A worthy topic that you can think about the film, but Malta Story does not even qualify as "worthy" in the most condescending sense. It looks like they hastily paved it together to keep the deadline, perhaps before the actors lost Will to life.
