This is a typical soft sex of the 70s in the genre Russ Meyer, though perhaps less bizarre than some of Meyer's works. This movie has higher "production values" than many of today's, which suggests a larger budget. However, the plot, writing and acting are straight from zone B. Recently, the film has become a pillar of B movie channels (such as "Drive In Classics") in the universe of 500 channels. If the soft core is what you want, it's "good" like everything else in the B range. Do not expect Polanski, Sarno is just Sarno. Nothing more nothing less. Jennifer Welles' performance as a "mother" is probably the best cast. None of the actors in the movie gained much fame, no wonder. Confessions of a young American housekeeper are far from the worst example of this kind. This is possible to watch if it's your type of movie. 30 years ago it would be an avant-garde and risky movie. Nowadays, in times of the highest audience, you can see more or less the same kind of stuff in the Showtime / HBO series.
