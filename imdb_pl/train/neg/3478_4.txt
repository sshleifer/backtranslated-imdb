Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) is determined not to be lonely on this holiday. Drew is not just a millionaire; but also unbearable and guilty of being very wonderful. Drew returns to the house where he grew up, and offers a family living there, Valco, $ 250,000 to be his "family" during Christmas. Tom Valco (James Gandolfini) is reluctant, but he is greedy enough to take Drew's offer. Christine Valco (Catherine O'Hara) has little to say in this matter, but she learns to like Drew ... not quite the same feeling with her daughter Alicia (Christina Applegate), but it also has a place for change. Drew's girlfriend, Missy (Jennifer Morrison), hunts Drew and wants her people to know his family. Real fun is in store because happy Noel becomes a funny, dysfunctional nightmare. Other cast members: Josh Zuckerman, Bill Macy, David Selby and Stephanie Faracy. Affleck is comedic, although strange.
