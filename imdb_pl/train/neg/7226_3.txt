I love comics. Although I have problems with full understanding of history? the visual style is unique with all dirt, dust and decomposition. So I thought that I know what I mean. Surprisingly, I understood the main story? but some very poorly made decisions relate to the visual style. <br /> <br /> I mean - really bad looking "CG human actors" - nearby? ??Why?! It did not work at all !! Horus - and other gods Egyption - was successfully made in CG and very similar to the comic version. <br /> <br /> I think that with real actors this movie could be a cult movie. <br /> <br /> What a shame.
