This is probably the most boring, inferior and useless movie that I saw last year. The story, which was supposed to have some philosophical aspects, appeared to me as a very bad empty copy of the matrix, with a lot of stereotypes: a lone policeman from a wolf, handsome, mentally disturbed, sleeping with his gun ... and a shy but good-looking scientist, you add 2 cents of the plot and you have I, Robot! I was terribly disturbed by the obvious advertising of such brands as FedEx, Audi, converse, etc. This film stinks of commercialization and seems to be a rather bad advertising spot, which unfortunately will not end after 30 seconds. I would not recommend this to my worse enemy, if you have some free time, watch a good TV program instead of or better read a nice book.
