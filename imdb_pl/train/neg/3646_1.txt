Oh ... my ... God ... it's definitely the best movie I've ever seen. Acting is bad, history is weak, characters weaker, and the whole movie just does not make sense. Combine it with the average director, really strange scenes (such as the one in which the child reaches through the ravine and mysteriously falls in) and a completely gloomy dialogue ("Look! Failure. Not to mention that the only asset that Mr. Atlas can overcome, is chocolate bars, but it's part of the movie's charm, sit down and watch it with some of your friends to laugh. <br /> <br /> I love this movie because it's so BAD!
