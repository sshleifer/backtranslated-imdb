A movie about a small town with an equal number of Mormons and Baptists. A new family is introduced, transmits an overwritten dialogue, mediocre acting, a green salad with jelly and chopped carrots, and every other "Mormon joke" known to man. Anyone who is outside of the Mormon culture will have difficulty getting the movie. Everyone in the Mormon culture will be a bit amused by giggles here and there. You will be much better at watching other Hess movies (Napoleon Dynamite, etc.) Than trying to sit down at it. Acting is mediocre. Jared Hess has made many more high-quality films, such as "Saints and Soldiers" and "Napoleon Dynamite". I recommend both films over this groan.
