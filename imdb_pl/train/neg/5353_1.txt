I had the "privilege" of participating in a special show "The Absence of Light" in the convention of horror in Ohio. <br /> <br /> First of all, you know you're in trouble when the director introduces the movie, saying: "Now keep in mind that we did not have too much money ..." Not that movies without a budget are bad, but when the filmmaker uses it as an excuse, the results are always weak. And there is no better example than this unobservable sleep fest. <br /> <br /> Actually, "Absence of Light" means the world's first underground cinema: It's the only time I've seen the dream of a talented species vet really bored me. Charismatic actors such as David Hess, Tony Todd and Reggie Banister randomly come in and out of the movie and turn out to be as uninteresting as the no-name amateurs. Who are their characters? What are they talking about? Who cares? It's all so boring, you stop worrying about anything or anyone. <br /> <br /> After thirty minutes of this endurance test, I gave up and left the theater. No wonder that the majority of cast members were present. <br /> <br /> All curious fans of the genre would stay away from it. With any luck, this movie will never see the "light" of the day.
