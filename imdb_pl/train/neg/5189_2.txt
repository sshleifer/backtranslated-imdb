This series would be much better if they did one simple thing: Made Ian McShane Code Name: Diamond Head instead of Code Name: Tree. A Diamond Head character needs someone who can handle the role of a nice villain, which McShane has proven he can do with the Lovejoy series. Roy Thinnes, the real Diamond Head, is really only in this role. McShane is not as good as a bad tree. France. The character of Nuyen, Tso-Tsing, does not seem to decide if he is a poor victim or a hard and ready woman to fight. She really deserved to pay at the end when she had to play the role of Diamond Head lover. After watching an episode or two, it did not end with what happened to anyone. The tree gives us a lot to hate, but Diamond Head gives us nothing to like. Unfortunately, the species of spies in the 70s was not the same as in the sixties.
