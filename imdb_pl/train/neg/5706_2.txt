This movie is like thousands of films of "cats and mice" preceding it. (The following may look like a spoiler, but it really describes a large class of movies) He is a passionate, wise main character, his goofy but well-intentioned hero with his missteps of humorous comments, initially hostile but soon relaxed beautiful lady that triggers the inevitable " an unbelievable "love story, beloved for hostages and of course a careless evil opponent with his brutal servants. Everyone has seen a lot of these films, and the "National Treasure" is like any of them, with only a slightly modified packaging. Every turn of history was easy to predict (and I can assure you that I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed). I'm tired of feeling cheated for money after I leave the Hollywood movie theater, and if you've ever felt that way, listen to my warning; stay miles away from this movie.
