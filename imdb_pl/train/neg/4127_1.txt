A movie as bad as it should be withdrawn from all stores around the world. A movie full of boring, bland, unimaginable characters and the main character with such irritating attitude and dry voice, constantly giving a thoughtless voice for every action and feeling. Because I paid money to own it, I felt obliged to see it and I regret it. My head ached because of the terribly boring characters and their senseless, less intriguing life. A group of children who have no knowledge of anything, are icy and the worst of all, have a terrible dialogue all the time, just thinking when the main character tries to make an appointment with the girl. Boring, so much that my friend trembled with hatred, and I was red with embarrassment that I threw out 6 pounds. The DVD was on eBay the next day and I did not get back too much money. Avoid like a plague.
