My child is making better movies than this! I feel cheated with $ 4.00 spent on borrowing this! There is no date on the video cassette, apparently designed by Wellspring; And what's worse, there is no production date of the original movie listed anywhere in the movie! The only date is given in 2002, which led to unsuspecting tenants to believe that they received the latest film. <br /> <br /> This movie was so bad from the point of view of being obsolete and unimportant at any time, but exactly when it was created that I'm amazed that anyone would spend time and money to bring it to the market as a movie . It may interest students studying the counter-culture of the 1960s, anti-war, anti-official, tuned, including and abandoning culture; but when you read the back of the video tape, there's no indication that you're getting it. However, if you make a mistake by renting it, it is probably best to watch it while using drugs so that your mind is more in line with the wavelength of minds of directors, Fassbinder and Fengler. Regardless of the state of your mind while watching, I can tell you that after the first scene is no better; so, knowing that, I'm sure you'll sleep long before the end.
