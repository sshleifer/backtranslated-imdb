As others have pointed out, this should be an excellent Hammer-style movie and it seems to me that most actors have been instructed to play it ... but the script is so leaden, lousy and full of boring monologues (poor Timothy Dalton is burdened by a majority of them) that everything is too exaggerated and important. This is Dalton's unusually weak performance, although he quietly nails the climactic scene in which Dr. Rock finally realizes what he did. The only actor who comes out really well is Patrick Stewart, who is the most desirable view. Freddie Francis could have been a great operator, but he was a poor director.
