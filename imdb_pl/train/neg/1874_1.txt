I've been a strong supporter of Hal Hartley since I saw his short "Surviving Desire" in high school, and even then he was still completely discouraged by his incredibly brilliant "Henry Fool". But this 10-year continuation is not only unnecessary, it is shameful. <br /> <br /> After a hard and fast start, "Fay Grim" turns into pseudo-intellectualism, boring and finally unjustified - and unwanted - nihilism. And this is just a plot. <br /> <br /> Most of the new faces are as frivolous and underdeveloped as the movie: one extremely flat character finishes half the time we spend with the infamous Henryk Fool, and it's his only spoken scene in the movie! <br /> <br /> It looks like Jeff Goldblum's agent, Fulbright, is the only bright character (a word game certainly intended also by Hartley). So how was he? ** SPOILER ** Dead by bombing the car, easily making this mild, the most brutal Hartley movie so far, and tonally wrong in the movie, which is bad from the very beginning. <br /> <br /> As for other new characters, Angus James, Ned Fool (or maybe Grim?), not to mention Fay itself ... well, I will not ruin their lives because the movie does a good job everything on its own (when it is not occupied by another, horrible, inclined angle, which causes a disturbing impression that Hartley is withdrawing from Auteur to a bad student of the film). <br /> <br /> This song is a complete disaster, a terrible mess that is not good enough to enjoy its mess. Instead, he freely stuffs the seemingly funny appearances of his director's hipster in the "real world", one uglier and smaller than it must be, but not that ugly or enough to get closer to having something to say. In doing so, Hartley follows all my memories of these people and the wonderful world that he originally created for them. <br /> <br /> I was rarely so depressed with the movies and I'm counting "Leaving Las Vegas, which at least developed new, new characters that we loved before they were destroyed, instead of immediately ignoring the characters already beloved. <br /> <br /> Indeed.
