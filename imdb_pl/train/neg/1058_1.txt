No fireworks despite violent actions. <br /> <br /> Science fiction movies that reflect quality are really rare, mainly because the transposition of the imagination of the genre on the screen too often is not effective as a result of insufficient financing or inadequate invention and unfortunately for its producers, in both these works lack this work, pitifully for the latter. Essentially, without a budget to act, it is a serious mistake to try to present a range of events like those in this scenario, in particular the special effects of the operatic war in outer space, which seem only clownish, while the seeds from writers' imagination is fallow due to some of the the most stupid misunderstanding of the basic scientific principles that can be found. Among them are frequent gun shooting in a closed environment and the recalcitrant law of gravity, which allows the freedom of movement of cast members, while inanimate objects swim in weightlessness, but it is easier to accept them than pretend that one of the episodes has the basis of credibility. The conspiracy involves escaping prisoners from the colony of a criminal space station to a landfill site on our Moon and their various attempts to get to Earth, with several talented present players who are led by the first man Paolo Mazzucato, whose production team wastes effort, such as holographic pornography, while ignoring the urgent and basic requirement to create states of tension and impetus. <br /> <br />
