I recently bought a DVD, forgetting how much I hate the film version of "A Chorus Line". Any change that director Attenborough put in the story has failed. <br /> <br /> Thanks to such a significant relationship between the director and Cassie, the whole band comes out of the window. <br /> <br /> Some music numbers are accelerated and accelerated. The hit of the hit series takes on momentum when he was given the character of Cassie. <br /> <br /> The overall staging is very conscious. <br /> <br /> The only reason I'm doing it is because 2 it's still possible to admire a few wonderful numbers, even though the movie tries to squeeze out a little bit of joy and spontaneity.
