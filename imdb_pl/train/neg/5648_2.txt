Boston Legal turned his tail and headed for the door of the barn and the pig's nest it had created! When this program broadcast for the first time almost four seasons, it was a humorous slap in the legal system, which all actors seem to be proud of. It was fun, varied and to some extent factual. The characters presented were acceptable and to some extent true in their performances. Comment and sexual activity were limited and fun. Julie Bowen is and was beautiful, as in other series in which she participated, but now she is dragged to the inferior depth of Media and Sex and Violence programs. Julie is an excellent actress and I need a more stable platform than this "production". Rene Adjurdubois He is a great actor who from the time of "Benson" to this production had his own in the field of entertainment, always showing humor and respect for production. Captain Kirk is "." Candace Bergan is funny and fun and she should be admitted for the continuation of this production and she is a good actress. James Spader has no doubts about his acting abilities, but he should return to his beginnings XXX, such as "Crash", because it seems that he has a lot of talent and inclination in this direction. Please, make this series destroyed, because it is already and really starts to smell !!!
