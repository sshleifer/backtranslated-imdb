This is an interesting way to treat a topic that is quite controversial (all you need to do is read the other comments for this video). Apparently you like it or you hate it and it seems that most people make this distinction depending on whether they believe that oppression and end times will take place in the film. <br /> <br /> Basically, the movie - and its sequels - were made for about $ 1.30 each. The production values ​​are there at the "Plan 9 From Outer Space" level, and the acting is on the same level as "Glen or Glenda" (my apologies to Ed Wood). Putting aside the religious message, history is as scary as it appears. Just add the slightest thought that this story may be close to something that might happen in the future and become even more frightening. <br /> <br /> This film and its continuations did not try to give reasons why there was pressure when it happened. "Left Behind" and "The Omega Code" tried to get everything that "Thief" and explain all the policies and maneuvers in the Middle East. The net effect was "Thief," who did much better work in the frightening part of the film, instead of spreading too thinly, trying to explain what was happening in the Middle East at the same time. <br /> <br /> Forget about politics and watch this movie, and its sequels, about what they are - horror stories. That they can be scary stories told indirectly by God, make them much more terrifying. If he makes you think about this topic, he did his job - even if you never believe it.
