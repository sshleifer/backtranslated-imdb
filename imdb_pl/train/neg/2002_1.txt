A trembling hand-held camera was used, probably to give the documentary a documentary look, but the effect was so exaggerated that I began to feel motion sickness only after seeing it. It seemed that someone with cerebral palsy was holding a camera (no offense to people suffering from CP, but I do not think you would expect a lot of work as an operator!) Working with the camera was so bland and distracting that my wife and I we thought it was unobservable and after 10 minutes of torture we gave it up. I checked a bit later (it was shown on TV) and it was not better. I suggest you miss it unless you have to get rid of the bad sushi you could eat!
