A female village singer with the nickname "Big T" - seriously, that's what they call her - risks that he will start a musical career and his life, falling into the company of a poor drunk (Busey) who wants to become its manager. His mother committed suicide, her father is also an alcoholic and has a violent temperament. You can imagine where it leads. In the meantime, there is a lot of music, as Parton with his fluent vocal talents releases a song by song (at least half a dozen about Texas). Avoid this mess and check it out in SIXTH FIVE or STEEL MAGNOLIAS instead.
