I was looking forward to the film by Kathryn Bigelow after endless noise and 6 Oscars. Unfortunately, this is not a good movie. The picture of the situation certainly seemed accurate and credible in all respects, but otherwise the story simply turned out to be incomplete, and the direction of the film seemed uncertain and accidental. The actors made a good effort, but for me I did not really get what the movie wanted to be. It is not as moody and thrilling as Full Metal Jacket, not as epic as the Band of Brothers, not as full of action as ... well, anything. I certainly do not see the reason why he was nominated, nor why people "feed him" to these epic proportions. Remember, given the caliber of films from the last few years, I suppose there is nothing to choose from.
