This, and immoral stories, both left a bad taste in my mouth. It seems to me that Borowczyk is disgusted with sex, and these two films are warning stories about what will happen if you have sex. As a movie, it's not very well done - some of the acting is really epic (eg "American" woman with a French accent). A sudden flap of a young woman from anxiety about marriage to being interested (when it seems that it should be the other way round), and the sudden awareness of aunt by a young man does not make sense - they are not explained again. I also did not like how the relationship between the daughter and the black man was presented as a sign of distortion or dislike of her family for bestiality. The main idea, the idea that there is this "sexy beast", if you prefer, who lives in the forest, could be the basis of a perverse, but funny story, but instead is used as the basis for a nasty, sex-negative game of morality.
