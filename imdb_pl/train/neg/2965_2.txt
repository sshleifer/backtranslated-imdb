This movie was quite interesting ... I had to watch it while studying India, but the summary says that this movie is about one thing when it really does not contain much cold, hard information about these details. It really is not consistent with the summary until the very end, where they are reluctant to try to combine all the elements together. However, the gore factor is excellent. Even at the very beginning you want to look away, because gore is quite intense. Watch this movie only if you want to see a cool gore, because the plot is thin and will make you sad that you wasted your time listening to it. I have seen rumors on other websites that this movie is based on real events, but you can not find any information about it online ... so basically this movie was a waste of time to watch.
