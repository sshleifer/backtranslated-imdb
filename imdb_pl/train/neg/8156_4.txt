Prom Night 2 is a great horror movie, but the ferry evening is much better, and films about how Queen Mary Lou in 1957 is killed by her boyfriend and returns 30 years later revenge. The best actor in this film is Micheal Ironside and the film also features other actors and actresses such as Justin Louis (I), Wendy Lyon, Lisa Schrage and Richard Monette (I). And there are good gore scenes, such as Mary Lou, who kills a girl who tries to hide herself in a cabinet, crush cupboards together, and how one of the students is on the computer, and Mary Lou smothers him deadly. Over all this is OK / good horror, and my rating is 4 out of 10.
