What a waste of time! I tried to sit in "Sky Captain ..." about 6 times and each time, in about 3 minutes, I start doing something else - everything else! It's a completely boring movie, acting is terrible, boring writing, and of course the first director because it's stiff, and I wanted to love it, I love science fiction, old cliffs and I appreciate the attempt to bow towards Flash Gordon and Metropolis, but my God, what a I worked for Paramount Pictures and wrote Sherry Lansing in 1993 about using a blue screen for screen tests She told me that they would never be interested or have to do it 10 years later, the release of Paramount Sherry was right in 1993, but she had to forget about to her advice when she let the dog blue: blue screen with effect, but not the whole movie Do not forget that Jude or Jolie are not great actors (but easy on eyes) Paltrowa's performance reminds me of my high school effort, it's a pity - it could have act ed, but only under the supervision of a qualified director. The funny thing is that Sky Captain's director will continue to work, even after that shudder. It's trade, not art!
