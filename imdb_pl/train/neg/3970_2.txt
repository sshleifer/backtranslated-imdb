Fine. Look - I've seen a lot and I mean a lot of movies of this type. You know, those in which the DVD cover looks so good and scared that you can not WAIT to see it? Well, I have a GOT again. And it tired me a lot. But digression. It is very easy. Ssal (I know, rather juvenile), but it was. And I SO agree with another poster that if we had to sit through a boring thing, why oh WHY did the main actress have to be so unattractive? And the threat she had used conveyed an unresolved pain / grief after her daughter's death did not help much. I mean, Jesus ... Oh, but the fact that the demon crawling on her back was pretty good ...
