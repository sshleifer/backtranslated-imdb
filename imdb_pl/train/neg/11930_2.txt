Times are difficult for Angel Town, gangs rule an iron fist, and for the most unknown reasons (mainly because of embarrassing writing) gangs want a street kid, Martine, to join the gangs, so they beat him every day. However, due to the presence of the Olympic boxer (Olivier, "The Holiest actor in the world" Gruner) named Jacques, hope is on the way. Angel Town is seriously one of the most inept films ever made (and I've seen my share), it seems to be made up of the idea that all gang-inhabited neighborhoods need French boxers who can not work. The worst thing is that there are so many awkward moments that are just really fun. The best thing is the exchange between Gruener and Aragon, which basically sums up how funny this thing is. To Wit: "Do you like fighting? (Olivier grabs the best Asian friend on the head) I can kill him, right? When I want him to die, he dies! The reason I do not want to kill him is because I'm scared of him and I know that if I kill him, his son and wife will kill me, that's why he does not die! "<br /> <br /> Of course, the fact that killing someone is bad, let alone that your best friend is obviously out of the question. Weird. <br /> <br /> But do not let me make this sound that I hate this movie, far from it, it's so terrible that it's priceless. The biggest laughs appear at the end of the disastrous finale, in which Grunner meets gang members who (the biggest logical gap of the film) refuse to use pistols. A disabled veterinarian from Vietnam also helps by shooting a machine gun to the gangs while Gruner digs the rest. All this is embedded in the sound of horrible "Mexican" accents and surrealistic energy, which make it unforgettable for fans of cinema trash such as this one. <br /> <br /> Another feast about this movie, for some reason Olivier Gruner never goes to college, even though it's the main reason he's here in the States, not in France when he's here with his girlfriend (at the cemetery in the awkward beginning of the movie) Angel Town is undoubtedly a failure at all possible levels, but if you laugh at moronic movies with crazy action levels that do not make sense at any level, this is the perfect movie for you . On the other hand, make sure you go to the tequila, like the funny song opening "There is no mercy in Angel Town" <br /> <br /> * from 4- (Bad)
