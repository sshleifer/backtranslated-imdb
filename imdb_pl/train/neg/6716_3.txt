Fluffer may have strong elements of the pornographic industry - but that does not compensate for the fact that it is poorly directed and played - and with very mediocre script. <br /> <br /> Class B from the beginning to an extremely extended finish. <br /> <br /> It would be embarrassing to think that the audience was offered this piece as an example of cutting-edge gay movie making. <br /> <br /> I hope he has a limited life at the gay movie festival and can die a natural death on video. <br /> <br /> This movie will open Queer Film Weekend in Brisbane on April 10, 2002. I think that his success will be a strong influence on the amount of alcohol consumed in the previous cocktail - they will need it.
