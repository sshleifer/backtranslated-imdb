An illegal immigrant opposes the social support system, causing terrible consequences for many. Well filmed and preserved, although the story is a bit forced, but slow stimulation really ends the conclusion. The feeling of being lost in a big city is effectively transmitted. A small person lost in a big society is something we can all relate to, but I can not support the way out to see this movie.
