<br /> <br /> The movie begins as an ordinary comic-hero-movie. It's about a boy who has been elected, no parents and is madly in love with girl number one at school. No wonder in the movie, there is nothing that can not be guessed in the movie. Toby Mcguire shows us that either he is not a good actor, or no actor in the world can save such a script. Maybe children at the age of ten can enjoy the movie, but it's a bit brutal for the little ones. You can not get away from thinking about movies like X-men, Batman and Spawn. All of these titles are better. I almost came out for the last 20 minutes! One of the things that could be good was computer animation, but even this is not something that you can put into a Christmas tree! So my recommendation: do not watch this movie, even if you pay for it!
