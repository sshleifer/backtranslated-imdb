Considering the original film version of "The Haunting", I found myself in my ten best films of all time. " I approached this adaptation with concern. I was right, thinking that this movie is a poorly written and badly made load of old tosh. the original was terrifying for me as a child for one reason! you can not see anything Robert Wise used innovative camera work and perfect lighting to generate fear and that's why it works. based on clever special effects and pyrotechnics to go from point A to B, sadder is the fact that there were ingredients (actors like Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta Jones) to do something else. This film should only be viewed as an example of a butcher's workshop!
