Where was I? Oh yes, "The Projected Man", yes ... ZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ........... <= 8. <Br /> <br /> Oops, I'm sorry. Yes, "The Projected Man". Well, it's British science fiction about nothing. A guy with orange hair throws himself on a laser, death afflicts him. Finally, it disappears, the end. Actually, the movie is not even so interesting. Boring, buzzing, starchy, stiff and boring, "The Projected Man" is 77 solid minutes of nothing that nobody plays. Boring like a sink. Dull as dust door handle. Boring like Ethan Hawke - we are really talking DULL here, people! But wait, in relation to our boring cousins ​​from all over the puddle, MooCow will now make the right review for "The Projected Man": <br /> <br /> ZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ............ .. <= 8.
