It is rather a tame passage about breaking, stealing WW II codes. Acting is about what I expected from this cast of MGM "B" actors. <br /> <br /> One big caution. Jean Rogers, who did such a great job playing the very sexy Dale Arden in the first two series of Flash Gordon, is simply awful in this film. Her character is very annoying. Absolutely, he never gives up on abusing. We should believe that at the height of the World War in an object that would of course be a top secret code, it would be allowed to simply enter and exit any chosen office, although it does not have an official function. From this point of view, I'm sorry for ever watching this movie. This changed my perception of Mrs. Rogers forever. Talent, it's extremely light. <br /> <br /> Lee Bowman is his usual "I", which means that he is simply adequate. <br /> <br />
