I love B movies. But come on ... it was not even worth the assessment ... The end was stupid ... b / c IT WAS NOT A REAL CONFERENCE !!! .. not to mention that he is living on his own ... I mean the lack of lighting storm or crazy demonic powers? Slow as hell, and then they start killing characters one by one in 15 minutes ... and I will not even start with what kills one guy without a head ... and then you do not even see what Jigsaw is doing even with his so-called " a new puzzle "... Unless you have nothing better to do ... Look how the paint will dry before I recommend this forgotten movie to anyone else ... oh, and to make it even better a second movie totem, you see a guy throwing in the window basement of one creature ... it was fun as hell and probably the only good part watching the movie's waste
