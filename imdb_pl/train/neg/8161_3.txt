Mary Lou is a whore whose spirit seeks revenge on those who allowed her to come to her fiery doom in 1957. <br /> <br /> Well, the movie takes place mainly in 1986. The film falls into the trap of the 80's / stupid special effects, including some bizarre-looking rocking horse. <br /> <br /> In any case, Mary Lou's ghost does bad things to people and tries to take over the body of one person. Regardless of whether you succeed or not, you need to find out to find out. <br /> <br /> In any case, the film is largely boring and based on a group of worthless characters. This is also not a continuation, the only thing in common with the first is the name of the secondary school. Has an average horror flick, fall back, gore, pointless nudity, knocks on the Catholic church. Basic things, boring movie. <br /> <br /> Acting is decent enough to give him 3 out of 10. You can waste time doing something different.
