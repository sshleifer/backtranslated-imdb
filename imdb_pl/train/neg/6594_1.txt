I've seen most, if not all, classic Laurel & Hardy movies. I always liked it stupidly, even after seeing it over and over again. This new movie tries to bring back the classics to two new actors who resemble both Laurel and Hardy, but for various reasons he fails to do so. One of them is how out of place their clothes are (at the beginning of the 20th century), but both are presented in the 90's. Some of the previous dialogues have been restored, but they also fail to get closer to the classic series. This movie may be the worst movie I've ever seen, and it should be taken off the shelf and locked forever. The real Laurel and Hardy revolve in graves in such a bad imitation.
