After watching this movie on DVD, I watched the trailer. Lektor describes the film as surreal. Well, it's surreal and surreal. <br /> <br /> There really was only one part of the movie that seemed surreal to me, but to be honest it was more confusing than surreal. Other unusual pictures, especially the dining room scene, where everyone is on the floor, were so meaningless that it did not matter. I have nothing against imaginations that mean nothing, but these scenes just seemed irrelevant. <br /> <br /> I have the impression that the director tried to convey the internal monologue of Logan. I do not know what else would explain what's going on. Unfortunately, nothing I saw did not give me an idea of ​​what Logan thinks about, what is his perspective, and even his emotional state. All I could say was that he was not particularly happy with his physical appearance and that he fell in love with an older boy. <br /> <br /> I thought the ending signaled what the relationships between the boys had become, but not much more. The deliberate juxtaposition of ambiguous scenes with those that were more simple seemed more like a policeman than an artistic decision. <br /> <br /> However, although the movie was tiring and without content for me, it was a definite change of pace. I really liked Madagascar Skin and I had the impression that this movie aspires to this kind of narrative, maybe even style. He did not even come close. For me, there is no doubt about it: this movie deserves A for the effort, but D for the execution.
