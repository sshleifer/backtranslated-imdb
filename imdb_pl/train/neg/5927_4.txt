I am a very non-politically correct guy, so when I say sexist, I really mean reducing the role of a female guest, Dr. Miranda Jones played by Diana Muldar. in spite of all her alleged brilliance and self-control, nothing more, but a great, jealous, unreasonable child. Now you have a conspiracy after her technical assistant Marvik, also a rejected lover, is thrown out when he tried to kill Medusan, Ambassador Kollos, with jealous rage, but instead he saw first. (You think he could just walk into the room with his eyes closed and slide the box off too easily), take the Enterprise into a non-navigating space outside the galaxy before the boys manage to control it. Well, the ship got stuck in the abyss, at this point they could go to a good lady doctor and discuss it. "Spock must connect the mind with the Medusa so we can go home. I mean, beetch, do you want to stay in the drift until we run out of stocks and die? "But a real Star Trek woman is a jealous monster who whimper and cries when an idea is touched, even when her Medusa idol told her to close and go with them. So the malt beret mixes with the fused Spock, causing him to forget to put on a peephole, which makes Spock go crazy. Kirk naturally figured out how complete the talk was and embarrassed her to fix Spock with her higher telepathic powers. Of course, at the end, you and the Medusa will leave, and everything is forgiven. You almost want the president of Battle Star Galactica to appear to throw the witch out of the lock for her devastating feat. But in the land of Star Trek ladies can be completely unreasonable and cruel, but at the same time there is allegedly sexual equality. That's what I mean by sexists.
