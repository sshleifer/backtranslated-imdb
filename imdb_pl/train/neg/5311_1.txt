It's almost the worst movie you'll ever see! 2012 Doomsday currently pulls the rug from underneath, for me. Props are a great example of what Frank Zappa once called "cheepnis". Space scenes seem to have been made at a power plant from the 1950s, just before the demolition. Music really sucks. Acting is wooden and ham. The characters they depict are shallow and unconvincing. The plot is predictable. It is immediately and brazenly obvious that they copy techniques and ideas from other films. The quality of the direction finishes faith. <br /> <br /> But you have to see it, if only to experience what must be one of the biggest wastes of a small budget. It's a priceless example of a stupid movie!
