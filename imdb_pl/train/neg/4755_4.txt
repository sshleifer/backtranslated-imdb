I thought the movie was good in part. The beginning was exciting. The first 30 minutes of the movie was good. The camera's angles were strange in the first 30 minutes and I did not like it because they were not completely covering the actors. <br /> <br /> I think the last 25 minutes of the movie really were not so great, many of which we expect for such films. <br /> <br /> dialoques did not make sense and I do not think they were very witty. <br /> <br /> I felt like they were trying to copy movies, such as phonebooth, in terms of dialogues, but unfortunately they failed. It seemed that many scenes between actors were taken into account and made no sense in history. <br /> <br /> the whole movie contains only the right and the cain. <br /> <br /> I do not think it was a waste of time, his movie OK, but not gr8
