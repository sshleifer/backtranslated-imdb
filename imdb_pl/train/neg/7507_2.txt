This movie is bad news and I'm really surprised at the level of talent of a big name who would ever agree to appear in such a piece of rubbish. I imagine there were a few strangled agents on Hollywood Blvd. as a result of this fiasco. What really drives you is that it could be good. The call of directors and the subject was enough to arouse interest and sell tickets, but this flop. Multiple story lines go from bad to stupid after shooting, and you feel like a mouse in a maze looking for a piece of cheese that turns out rotten. Spike is able to take revenge on all Italians who beat him when he was a child or offended him, because the film does a lot on preserving outdated and probably insulting Italian stereotypes. As with any Spike Lee movie, there's really a really thought provoking and magical job. He has the gift of capturing his psyche and moving you to his vision, even for a few unforgettable scenes. But the question remains ... can you endure the remaining 2 hours of scratching your head and watching the clock, wondering and waiting for the ending that must be there somewhere.
