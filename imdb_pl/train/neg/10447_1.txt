I decided to watch this movie because it obtained a good result on IMDb. But many people either have a really bad taste, or someone fixed the result. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it was a real disappointment. The film is exactly as stupid and far-reaching as the title suggests. There is really no reason to summarize the story - but here: it seems that someone thought: "Would not it be nice to make a movie in which there were snakes on the plane? And then snakes for some reason would go crazy and started to bite and stuff?!? And that's all! The story is thin and unoriginal. Snakes are bad CGI (but it makes sense to cut corners from a movie that no one will recommend to anyone!). Acting is poor, and all people are incredible stereo types. <br /> <br /> In conclusion: it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen - stay away!
