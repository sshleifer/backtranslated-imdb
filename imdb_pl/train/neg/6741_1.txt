Seriously, I'm in favor of sticky romantic comedies and will fall into Miss Congeniality as easily as Goodfellas ... but this movie? It does not make sense !!!! And I'm not even talking about wanting to suspend disbelief that does not make sense. Why does her family live in England? Or at least, why is there no British accent? She is sure she is cozy with her dad and surprisingly forgives that she has not been home for the last two years. (On this subject, no one ever does much to keep her away for so long). And what about silly clothing for a hen party? I do not even intend to enter into the fact that the escort she paid for falls in love with her - it could have been overcome by better filming. I'm just saying that characters, surroundings and story are not sufficiently developed to create a somewhat coherent story. And the worst, in my opinion, is the consistent application by the filmmaker of the most unflattering angles on the nose of Deborah Messing - I would sue the filmmakers if I was her! I mean, to be honest, I'm for women who are who they are, but why, in the course of the seven loyal years of watching Will and Grace, did not I notice how incredibly strange her nose is? ABOUT! Because these producers are nice to her! This film, like my least favorite movie, Armageddon, is the fault of filmmakers, not actors. I see both Messing and McDermott in these roles with a better writer, director and producer. <br /> <br /> Thanks to that my voice is one of the worst movies I've ever wasted time on. I am glad that a friend lent me his DVD, so all I've wasted is time. If there was a way to make this review a ZERO star, I would do it.
