The summary provided by my cable TV guide made it sound a lot more interesting than it really is. "Slaughterhouse Rock" is by far the worst horror movie I've ever seen, the title previously owned by Urban Legends: Final Cut. From the initial scene I could say that it would be really bad, but I was so bored that I did not care. This movie contains fun acting, especially by a guy who's tormented in his dreams, unbelievable, like in unbelievable twists and some of the worst songs I've ever heard, and I live in a time when people like Britney Spears and Nsync dominate in the airwaves . The biggest problem with "Slaughterhouse Rock" is that it is not fun. One would be so boring and so boring, so NOT scary, because it would try to spice up a bit with some fun links here and there, but not. The selfish Tormented Guy tries to be funny, but instead he was so annoying. (spoiler) And please, tell me who in this crazy world is crazy enough to visit a terrible prison in the middle of the night? No one! If you're going to create a horror movie, at least make it credible. This one is different than.
