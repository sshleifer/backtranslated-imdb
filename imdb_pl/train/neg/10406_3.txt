Warning: This review contains minor spoilers. <br /> <br /> Well, the writers of the first Tremors officially have no ideas. I am a big fan of the first movie, and the first two sequels are pretty good for a movie directly. Tremors 4: The Legends Begins is a very boring movie. Where the hell are Graboids? <br /> <br /> Due to the relative lack of Graboids for the first 90 minutes I am convinced that this entry in the series is to be a "character study". Unfortunately, there is not one interesting character in the movie, except the character Billy Drago, which has too few lines, too little to do and, in the end, not enough time on the screen. What saved the second and third film was the presence of Michael Gross as Burt Gummer. Each time there was no action on the screen, you could be sure that Burt Gummer would be interesting to listen to and / or watch. However, in this film Gross plays Hiram Gummer very poor and boring deputy. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, when the Graboids (Dirt Dragons in this movie) are on the screen, they look good, but it's as good as it gets. <br /> <br /> I was impressed when I saw that the Tremors 4 was replaced after 101 minutes. Pretty good for a video. But after watching this movie, I'm sure that this movie is a good 15 minutes too long. There are long sections of dialogue that are boring and do not lead any story. Was there such a rush to make this film? I think no, more time could and should have been spent on the script. <br /> <br /> I thought I was in a gold mine, when I saw Tremors 4 packed for sale with .... Tremors !!! What kind of luck I thought, pay for # 4 for free # 1. After watching Tremors 4 I like to think that I paid for the original and got this mess for free, I can not imagine paying a Tremors 4. It is best for fans of the series to forget that Tremors 4 : The Legend Begins even exists. <br /> <br /> Tremors 4: The Legend Begins evaluates 3 out of 10.
