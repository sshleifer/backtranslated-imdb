Hollywood, a house of hype, glamor and profit-seeking, is rarely ruled by spiritual values, and therefore it is no surprise that his attempts to study spiritual life are thin and often stupid (better to go further - to the films of Bresson, Dreyer, Rossellini and Bergman, to probing spiritual representations). "Strange Cargo" is no exception. This strange hybrid of an adventure film, a love story and a religious parable trivializes the insight it is trying to convey. That the figure of Providence and salvation would work to match Verne (Clark Gable in his most humble and selfish opinion), and Julie (Joan Crawford, snarling and spitting out every word to become the Queen of Tough Dames) at best ridiculous. Is this the Star System Patron at work, matching the fighting ego before sending them to further criminal captivity in the M-G-M lottery? BUT. . There are good supporting performances and moments that stop the eyesight: shady prison barracks; a boat escaping in the light of the moon or in a painting landscape of clouds; Julie walking by the sea when the wind blows; Julie and Monsieur Pig (Peter Lorre) bargain for Verne's freedom during the storm; an extremely ennobling romance of a gay prison between two convicts. . First of all, it is a stately and detached performance by Paul Lukas as Hessler, a murderer who can appreciate the virtues of Cambreau, but he turns his back on him. In the most shocking moment of the film, Hessler, leaving Cambreau, stands in front of the hut. We hear the wind through the jungle, we see shadows on his face that transmit a moment of fear and doubt. Then he goes out into the night. At this point, Hessler achieves ambiguity, depth and existential strength that none of the other heroes are able to achieve. is the film's secret that his deepest sympathies are allied with Hessler?
