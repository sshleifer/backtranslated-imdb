This movie is horrible. I really could not wait, because I thought "Lantana" is great. <br /> <br /> The following review may include * spoilery * <br /> <br /> ***** <br /> <br /> First of all, good stuff: it looks great, some performances are OK. Bad things are different. <br /> <br /> The story, as you probably know, concerns some of the guys who fish and discover the body, with a surprise that they will find it on Friday, but they still catch fish and eventually report it on Sunday. in a mobile phone (mobile phone). However, the film takes its time (boy in no hurry) to reach this central event. <br /> <br /> From a group of characters (about a dozen), no one seems to like the other (which is, I suppose consistent, because they are all unacceptable). I was very frustrated with the lack of a proper explanation of how characters are connected, and only at the end of the movie could I vaguely construct a family tree. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to think about a movie that is inexorably gloomy, which is a failure in the structure of the story, because the life of the characters seems just as bad before fishing and after. Once you set the bar so high, it's hard to ascend - it's not enough if everyone commits suicide. <br /> <br /> They are stupid logic. The killer drops his body into the lake, and then he drifts up into the mountains somehow. Fishermen leave on Sunday morning, but for some reason Byrne returns home late at night after his wife went to bed. Then, the next morning, the policemen hit the door to make him go down to the station. Um, have not you heard about the phone? At the station, the media knows the whole story, less than 24 hours after they reported the body? <br /> <br /> Completely missing in the history of the debate that the guys certainly had after finding the body. It's a secret - everyone asks them "how to do it?" And the audience asks the same question. (The debate on what to do with the body is the key scene in "Deliverance"). I know exactly what I would do in their situation. Somebody has to go out to the car, go to the range, call the police, wait, and they will lead them back to the place. If others are waiting for the camp and the fish, who cares? <br /> <br /> Much of this seems simply false. The only thing that called was that when the girl was black, the local natives used the fishermen's actions as racist - "they would not do it if it was a white girl". <br /> <br /> At all times there is a strange indifference to who could kill the girl (I think the topic is mentioned once), and there is no secret, because the audience sees the killer in the opening scene. /> <br /> So I sit there at the same time bored and confused when there is a turn of action - not in the story, but in the subject. Suddenly, it comes to the quiet dignity of the mourning indigenous people, leading to an absurd ending with incoherent things about black and white reconciliation. Huh? <br /> <br /> This is an Australian film "at its best", according to The Age.
