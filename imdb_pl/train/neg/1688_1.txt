Wow, what a shitty movie it was! I do not understand what people think so much about "The Grudge". The director plays one trick (I would have to admit that a very good one, which has been brought back to life in a very stylized way), then repeats it until the end of the film. As a result, I was surprised a few times in the first quarter of the movie, but when I got to know the drill, I practically fell asleep when The Grudge became more and more predictable by the minute. In conclusion, I can say that in the beginning there are many better movies in this genre, that the so-called predecessor "The Ring" was much more frightening, and buying a ticket "The Grudge" is a waste of money.
