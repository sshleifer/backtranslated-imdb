Cult of personality raised the status of Roger Corman, Sam Arkoff, Lloyd Kaufman, etc. As kings B. Because the people at Crown International were so key, they were not elevated to the rank they deserve. A film like THE VAN may now seem like a one-time track-esoteria, but it was a significant hit when it was released (not to mention the next release as a double feature with other Crown hits). <br /> <br /> THE VAN was a perfect example of Crown's hit strategy, which was to take over the mood of the audience at the time of the film's premiere. There was sex, drugs, rock'nroll and a short "Custom Van" fashion. As others have pointed out, the irony is that the hit song in the movie refers to Chevy when the title vehicle is Dodge in the movie itself. I had a city manager, in which I was then, even announcing that these vans are "mounds of sin on wheels!". An excellent advertising line for the movie! <br /> <br /> An ordinary assortment of "good" and "bad" girls, muscular heads and low-browne low-fat (including a piece supporting Danny DeVito). In many respects, this is not much different from old 60's Beach Party movies, but now spiced with nudity and drug use. Of course, in a limited budget and with a limited schedule, the film runs pleasantly with airy charm, which compensates for some, according to today's standards, unmistakable views of women. <br /> <br /> The classic accent is the Toaster for Bobby's sins on wheels. Yes, toaster! Hey, you must have something hot for those crisps! <br /> <br /> Grindhouse Fest.
