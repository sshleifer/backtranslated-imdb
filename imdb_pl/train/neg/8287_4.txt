This is a very television version of the story, the movie begins as an episode of "Xena ...", with a small meaningful dialogue or character description. After some time, it becomes a bit more substantive, but all characters are still cartoonish. <br /> <br /> Salma is an exotic beauty. Richard Harris is a bad and sexually suppressed Frollo, a devil who is banging into Salma. Other characters, including Quasimodo, are completely forgotten. <br /> <br /> It's also a somewhat liberal version of this story, Frollo is a suppressor of the ideals of the Enlightenment, like the abbot in the "Name of the Rose", and Quasimodo is the master of freedom. The shadowy side of Quas is ignored, although it spills liquid on people. He is really just an outsider because he looks different and he likes to play with ringtones more than the average person. <br /> <br /> Maybe the movie is intended for children, but I doubt it, given that Frollo is bleeding himself, to improve, wanting to spit a monkey. Mostly uninteresting and forgotten, but not terrible, and sometimes funny, interpretation of the story.
