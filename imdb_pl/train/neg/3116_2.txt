Most of what was said about the negative aspects of the movie is real. <br /> <br /> ALE .... If I have to sit in a movie, then: <br /> <br /> Director <br /> <br /> Photography director <br /> <br /> Editor < br /> <br /> You can not miss the Doom Microphone Boom appearing and exiting the movie on almost every chapter of the movie, how I can enjoy and focus on the story, as well as believe in the complexion when the technical details of creating the film remind me !! !!!!! <br /> <br /> WAIT FOR A DVD OR DO NOT LOAD
