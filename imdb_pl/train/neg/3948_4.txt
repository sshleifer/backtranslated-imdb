This is not a nasty movie, but only because it appeared in 1994 when they were probably tired of all this in the UK. This is 75% rehash The Boogeyman and would have been banned for the same reason - whatever it was. <br /> <br /> At first I was confused because I thought Annie (Kelly Galindo) might have been different to Lacey, but she had trouble with the boogeyman psychic visions similar to the one in the first movie. Fans will immediately notice that they are not the same person. <br /> <br /> After seeing the murder in the bathroom, as well as seeing the address, Annie, her psychiatrist and psychology student who very much resembles a guy on cheap romance and butter commercials, head to the house and, of course, the same bathroom . 24 hours later, the murder happens as described. Of course, we have no idea who this woman is or why she was murdered. <br /> <br /> Then the film moved on a replay of The Boogeyman history with additional material that we did not see in the original. It is worth noting that the boogeyman is shown in contrast to the original. Unfortunately, some good scenes have been cut, but 90% of them are there. Why is it worth repeating this movie? Did they find the material in the basket? What was the purpose? <br /> <br /> We will never know and, despite the fact that the psychologist tells Anna that he is cured, we all know that this scare will never die.
