I saw this movie last month during a free preview and left. That was awful. While trying too hard, they behaved and made a horrible movie. I was disappointed because I felt that all the actors were making serious choices in the past, so this one could not be that distant - but I was wrong. I was hoping that at the end of the film, they would publish a questionnaire so that I could tell them not to release the film. I was lured by the free aspect of the preview, but it turned out to be a waste of my time - and I'm usually very amused. He tried to be innovative and creative thanks to shots, ideas and filming, but because they put together so many ideas at once, it failed. Usually I'm not picky about movies and I usually do not feel the need to display my opinions about movies, but I had to warn everyone not to watch them. I registered with IMDb just to tell you all
