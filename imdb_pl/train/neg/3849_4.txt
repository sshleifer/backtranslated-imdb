Debbie Reynolds thumbs in circles, tango and, yes, tap dance in this ordinary thriller, which has a clearly fabricated atmosphere of the 1930s. Two ladies gathered, when their sons commit murder, try to start your life by running a dance school with a tap for kids in Hollywood. The problem is that one of them is plagued by neurosis. Can you imagine this thing 10 years ago with Robert Aldrich, director Bette Davis and Joan Crawford ...? No, Bette would never allow Joan so much time to screen her things, and I can not imagine Bette Davis in the second role, dancing her heart. It is a purely false piece of the macabre, written by curled Henry Farrell (whose idea for a good "shock" is to carry out a mass murder of a group of rabbits!). Not a bit of fair play throughout the summer package. * 1/2 of ****
