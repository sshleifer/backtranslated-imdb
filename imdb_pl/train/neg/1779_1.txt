It could have been a wonderful story based on the ancient races of cats, but it was not. <br /> <br /> This work could have been this way; wonderful and full of mythological references that sustained my fascination. The main characters (Charles Brady played by Brian Krause, and his mother Mary, played by Alice Krige) were shallow finishes, they did not have the depth of personality and were not liked or drawn. Even MÃ¤dchen Amick (who played the character of Tanyi Robertson) did not fit this description. <br /> <br /> However, as I have said many times, when you adapt Stephen King's novel to television, you just have to take into account the fact that his books are not written for television, and his talent scenario unfortunately has no fire and depth which he exhibits as a novelist. <br /> <br /> This is another unsuccessful attempt to take the magic of writing Stephen King, be it his novels or the original script. Just to cut and paste his work on the small screen. His novels are completely stunned, and everything you create is a nice movie; nothing less, but nothing more. His scenarios are hit and miss. Unfortunately, this script translation was misguided. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, I'm sorry, movie. <br /> <br /> This movie gets 1.0 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
