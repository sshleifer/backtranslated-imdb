This movie was bad from the very beginning. The only purpose of the movie was that Angela wanted to get a high number of bodies. Acting was terrible. The killings were carried out very badly. Like when Ally was pushed to the toilet, I think she was in an abandoned cabin. But when the end of the movie comes, and Molly and the other are in the cabin you see Ally, so Angela had to come in to take her. The part that really caught me was that the black girl and Angela were in the cabin, and Angela took the guitar string and wedged her. First of all, it was awful acting, and two, why would not you just turn around and hit the bitch?!?!? Then, when Molly is chased by Angela, if you're right, why do not you turn around and stab? So stupid. This movie was sucked ...
