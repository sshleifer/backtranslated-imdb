Joe Don Baker is ... Thomas Jefferson Geronimo, a chubby, sweaty, murdering fool in a stupid cowboy suit from which Roy Rogers would laugh. Somehow he still has a badge, probably because he lives in Texas and will let EVERYTHING be enforced by law. <br /> <br /> This fat loser is the sheriff deputy near the Texas border. No wonder he was once a Texas Ranger, but he was thrown out because he thought the law was his own bouncing ball that you can play at your own discretion. This includes shooting suspects who cross the international border to Mexico, beating the suspects, cheating in weapons fights, threatening women, starting shooting that could have been avoided AND managing the life of a child threatened by this process promised to help and protect, will only be killed so that he can get out of jail, etc. This guy makes the LA cops look like saints in comparison. <br /> <br /> When his partner is killed by a couple wandering around Italian assassins, the character of Joe Don hunts them and kills one of them. Then he takes another to Italy at the request of Mr. Wilson, who rightly thinks Joe Don will screw up the big time. In the record time, he loses an Italian and gets a Maltese taxi driver blown up. This is just the first of many deaths and serious damages that Joe Don leaves behind on the track when he races through Malta in search of Palermo (an Italian assassin). <br /> <br /> That's how the band begins the movie, where our hero is arrested, lectured by the Maltese head of police, he comes out and causes more trouble, he is arrested, lectured by the head of the police ... and so on, and so further. Until you want to blow up an ivory gun from Joe Don and end up in horror. <br /> <br /> Joe Don proves his uselessness not only when he first escapes from Palermo, but in a later chase of a boat that drops with one blow. He is then picked up by Palermo after threatening a woman with a hanger for coats. You hope that Palermo will indeed torture him in a cell in the cellar he put in, but no, the stripper he threatened came and pulled him out because he promised to protect her. Her throat cleaves quickly (big surprise), and Joe Don escapes into the night. <br /> <br /> And here you hope he drowned in pursuit of (another one) boat. But even the ocean does not want him and spits him ashore, where the poor Maltese family is looking after (what have they ever done to deserve it?) Returns to the city where he was arrested by the police, lectured by the police chief ... arrrgghhh! The policeman who escorted him frees him so that they can get to Palermo. Why would he do anything to make the brain so dead that he would destroy his career, because this great slob is beyond me. It's just a scratchy head. <br /> <br /> They go to the villa where Palermo is hiding and start shooting. Joe Don blithely cheats and kills Palermo. Then he utters a wonderful and dazzling last line of the film: "This big one has my badge. Can you go after me? "Thank you for this immortal line, Mr. Baker. This will be recorded in the history of the film as the most literate, incredible, wonderful last line ever made by the film's protagonist. Certainly fits everything else in this form. Bravo.
