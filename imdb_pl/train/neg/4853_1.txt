I am a huge fan of war movies, and as a veterinary veterinarian in Vietnam I have some experience with technical details. I've worked with guys with bombs more than once and I have no respect for them. Other veterinarians, especially veterinarians from Iraq, very well summarized the inaccuracies in this film. Poetic license is one thing, but this movie is a complete fantasy and for this reason it fails very badly. No bomb disposal unit or unit would ever tolerate this dishonest operator for more than 5 minutes. Military units, for some reason, reward compliance and discipline, save lives. The opening scene made me particularly nervous. The guy with the cell phone would be shot immediately. The scream "Stop dialing" is not an effective deterrent. From there it was worse. Scenes with the sniper were particularly scandalous. As others have pointed out, your average EOD guy does not know that he is a sniper, and thinking that every Arab sniper is good really stretches the imagination. Abduction of an Arab businessman for some form of personal revenge would not be possible. Someone may shoot him, but this type of risk is limited to movies. I can continue, but as I said, others have pointed out these things in detail. This is not a good movie, and if it ever gets any rewards, it's another reflection of why "La La land" is so named.
