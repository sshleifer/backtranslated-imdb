Thirty years ago I went to see this movie in our university theater because I liked Bruce Dern in Silent Running and Family Plot. To this day (sorry Jack Nicholson), it's still the dumbest movie I've ever seen. It lasted and lasted without a visible point, and then - it just ended. The lights came on and I watched everyone look around in the confusion. Did the projectist miss the spinning wheel? I never wanted to find out. I just remember that it was a non-dramatic movie about some of the annoying basketball friends and their coach. The most pleasant part of the movie was watching completely misleading audience poems. Fortunately, this was just an exception for Jack, Bruce and Karen Black.
