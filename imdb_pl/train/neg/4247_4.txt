Painfully chronic, nauseating and predictable drama, my twenty-fifth movie of Sidney Lumet, Garbo Talks, is suddenly reported at the end of my low-quality mission. <br /> <br /> The film documents a young, bullied man named Gilbert (Ron Silver), son of Estelle Rolle (Anne Bancroft), eccentric, pugnacious, and above all obsessive fan Greta Garbo. When Estelle is touched by a brain tumor, her son decides to embark on an obsessive, own adventure: track down Greta Garbo and take her to her mother. <br /> <br /> Anne Bancroft is fully committed, Auntie-Mame's chewing-scene mode here, this kind of pugnacious gala that she loves the movie in which she talks to people and favors her ideals, all the time she goes to prisons. She stands outside the film as an obvious artificial construction, and every scene with her is yuk-yuk lame; every note is false. The rest of the character is equally one-dimensional, but incredibly less interesting. Ron Silver is flat, and his tried love triangle is as telegraphic as anything else in the movie: he meets affluent Lisa Rolfe (Carrie Fisher), but he gets enchanted by Jane Mortimer (Catherine Hicks) and I call each scene three scenes before happen. <br /> <br /> It's a different problem. One-dimensional characters can survive if they are put in an intriguing and captivating story, but there is nothing here. The pace of the film is icy, dazzling with foreign material that absolutely does not reinforce anything, and when the film begins to follow the linear plot, it is both plodding and uninteresting. There are so many guest stars, including Harvey Fierstein as a homosexual New Yorker (imagine this) in another very unimportant scene. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie he tries to make a decent statement about the nature of idolatry and his role in our life, but until then none of the characters existed as real people, and the film bored me to surrender, so it works as a case too little, too late. The movie is my twenty-fifth film directed by Lumet, making it easy for me to become my most watched director, but apart from a few scandalous misss (Aliens among us, whoever?), He did not penetrate the painfully uninteresting depths of Garbo Talks. <br /> <br /> {Degree: 4,5 / 10 (C / C-) / # 21 (z 24) 1984 / # 23 of 25 Lumeta Movies}
