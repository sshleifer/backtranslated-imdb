I am sorry that I am against flow, but I thought that this movie is unrealistic, boring and too long. I was tired of watching Genena Rowlands for a long time struggling with myself and the crisis she experienced. Maybe the film has some film value or was an important step for the director, but for pure entertainment I would like to skip it.
