Where was his criticism of democratic administrations, as well as republican ones? After all, he served for over 17 years in government, where his influence was unwavering. Oh, I forgot about 8 years, when he was the second commander of the most powerful nation on Earth. The film is happy to show shots of young Senator Gore asking why the NASA scientist was forced to change his proposal in his scientific article, but he does not ask for Clinton / Gore's participation in global warming. Probably too close to the election year, and maybe it would hurt Hillary's chances in '08. Anyway, he is a political coward and partygoer to the very end. It does not criticize consumerism, there is no criticism of capitalism, there is no history of industrial development that led us to this moment. <br /> <br /> After all, this movie was more about Mr. Sam Gore than about any real problems our environment. Mr. Gore, if you really want to make a campaign movie - shorten it and name what it really is.
