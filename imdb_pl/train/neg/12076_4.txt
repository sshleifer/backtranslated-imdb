You all know the history of "Hamlet." I do. <br /> <br /> Well, the phrase "To Be Or Not To Be" (not the speech itself) has been hit the ground so many times that it is not very interesting (in fact it was not so great first). In FAKE I consider "Hamlet" to be a good, but highly overrated game. This is not even the best work of Shakespeare: "Julius Caesar" and "Romeo and Juliet" are ten times better, and "Midsummer Night's Dream" and "Othello" are not too far behind. "Macbeth (knock on the table, drawers, the disc will change, OW!)" It's not so bad either. There are many others that are better than Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> I will not really comment on the film too much, I would rather share a terrible episode of MST3K. <br /> <br /> OK. . . Mike and Bots win the card game, choose a movie. . . they ask for "Hamlet", Pearl sends them to them, yadda yadda yadda. . . and get ready for the most boring section of science-fiction MST3K in history (although I have not seen any of CC Ones). <br /> <br /> While "Blood Waters of Dr. With "makes watching this episode terrible, because it is not really a movie, rather random, interwoven scenes (I recall the line of Mike from" Future War ":" Maybe it is an anthology of short films without a storyline " ), SOL Crew and many out of many good cracks. Here you can not say the same. <br /> <br /> Riffs are falling, host segments (usually par) are mediocre at best, and the movie itself (which is not so bad) is BETTER (I mean that as a high quality movie, not a camp like "Prince of Space") than the MST3K version, you know that the performance must be bad. I laughed (last time I saw it a few months ago), oh, maybe eight or nine times throughout. I tried and tried to have fun - but I just could not. Only from time to time, like "The Head of the Hail Queen Dilbert!" (And when it is the funniest part of the episode, well, ahem) - and occasionally I mean every ten minutes, maybe even giggles. The second time, when I tried to watch him, I did not even laugh at a few jokes that I thought were funny before, and I just gave up forty minutes before. <br /> <br /> The movie is not terrible; it's just a German version of Hamlet. The actors are good enough and although the dubbing is not the best, it is not a reason to hate this movie. <br /> <br /> Four stars for "Hamlet"; THREE, THREE for the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> PS: WHY WHY, MST3K!
