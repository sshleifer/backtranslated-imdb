I just looked at the monastery for the second time. Earlier I liked it and I thought it would be a good drunken movie on a Friday night, a bit gore, some style, a bit of humor and the like. It saddens me that I can not appreciate it anymore. It seemed that someone decided to revisit epic epic films such as Night of the Demons for a contemporary audience, but he lost the things that made this original worthwhile. As a reminder, I'm not even a big fan of Night of the Demons, but there were a few things that I really dug about. The monastery is making cheese, but not so good. In addition to the main girl (sympathetic performance of Joanna Canton), gothic and sweet girl episodes Adrienne Barbeau, almost all the characters were terribly dissimilar to each other, festering at the absolute lowest level of moronic, insulting playfulness. The film is then seriously hampered by a total lack of sudden nakedness, which means that given the terrible dialogue, it is difficult to watch the characters and it is harder to appreciate the advantages of the film. Bad nuns are original in appearance and have many good scenes, although they are not terrifying, they are certainly cool, and the film also contains a lot of shapely blood. At the end, when Adrienne Barbeau arrives on stage, the movie becomes quite funny because all the unbearable people are dead and his evil nun goes crazy. The stylized direction also sometimes gives good results, although sometimes the camera moves too fast. In conclusion, it was a movie in which shining good points simply can not make up for what I hate. Those who like this type of film more may enjoy it more, but for me it was not a good time.
