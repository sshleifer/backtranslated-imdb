I made a big mistake watching this movie a few nights ago. God, I'm still trying to recover. This film does not even deserve an average of 1.4. IMDb must have 0 votes for videos that really deserve it. 1.4 is TOO HIGH. <br /> <br /> I heard how awful this movie was, but I really did not think that the movie could be so bad, especially nowadays. I came to the conclusion that all the bad movies from god come from the 1950s and 1960s. My God, I was wrong. Trust me, this movie REALLY IS THAT BAD. This is beyond terrible; it is not pathetic; he is beyond any kind of word that I can come up with for him. BATTLEFIELD EARTH looks like the best picture of the year compared to this movie. SNAKE ISLAND (who has been the worst movie I've ever seen before) looks like he deserves a few Oscars compared to this pathetic effort. <br /> <br /> I seriously can not believe that the creators of this movie thought it was a justified serious effort to produce a Hollywood movie. It has nothing to do with the movie. In the first 25 seconds of the movie, I seriously thought that I was watching a high school theater class trying to make a short film. Or better yet, I thought it was some Saturday night live. I mean, it looks exactly like that. Acting is terrible; the whole movie looks almost like it was shot with a 20-year-old VHS video camera. special effects ....... good good ruler Enchanted for a long time had better special effects than this movie. The scene in which he is shot at the door is out of laughter and out of trash. I'm serious, my Intro to Acting class four years ago in college, we could all create a better movie than this one. And the worst part of the whole movie, in which Arthur is naked in the bathroom. Oh, my God, I almost got there. I have a strong stomach, but it was awful. Some people should never be naked, and he is one of them. The plot of this film just seems completely nowhere. They talk about legal issues that we never hear about again; Ben talks about entering music that we never hear about; Arthur says he's looking for a job and money to study, and the next thing we see is running a porn shop. Everything in the movie is simply awful. <br /> <br /> It really does not have much to do with my criticism, but so that everyone knows I'm not gay. However, I support gay rights and I believe that we should all be treated as equal. And I supported every gay in my church, in contrast to the cruel priest of this movie, who incidentally seems to curse every other word. (WHERE IS F * (# * ing white out?) Hahaha But I did not want anyone to think that I hate this movie just because it's about two homosexuals. It has nothing to do with it: it would be just as scary a movie, like Ben and Jill instead of Ben and Arthur. <br /> <br /> I just watched this movie to see if it really is as bad as they say. I read it. Let it be a warning to everyone: ONLY watch this movie if you want just sit back and laugh at how pathetic some movies in the 21st century may be, if you watch this movie and you really expect a good movie or some entertainment, I have no compassion for you. <br /> <br /> Last thought : how in the world there are 7 films in the ranking BELOW on IMDb? There is no way there are 7 films there, they are worse than that!
