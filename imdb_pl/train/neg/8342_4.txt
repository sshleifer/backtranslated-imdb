Recovery: 4 out of 10 days Åšwistak meets the horror of the Christian coalition. Okay, maybe it's not that bad. But it is close. <br /> <br /> Claire (played by Alicia Silverstonesque Lauren Currie Lewis) is persecuted and probably killed by a serial killer (Chris Ferry, who is quite dangerous and brutal). I say, perhaps because it wakes up and it was just a dream ... Or maybe? (Cue music) <br /> <br /> The basic problem with the movie is that these fifteen minutes of the story (well done the first time) are repeated over and over again. And because Claire wakes up every time, and every scene is clearly a dream or an alternative reality, I just stop worrying about what happened to Claire and started to wonder what I'm going to do next. <br /> <br /> I supported the screening (which would make more sense), but instead got one of those too obvious by half of the surprises (Think the Village or Below). So the movie falls faster than the directors of Donnie Darko. All the great endings in the horrors of The Sixth Sense, the original invasion of the body hijackers, Happy Birthday to Me worked because the audience did not expect an explanation in the left field. (Heck even a kayak ending on Friday 13th was worth a shock) <br /> <br /> On the other hand, screams wriggle with each change of the scene. Another annoying disadvantage is the soundtrack of one piano (although the featured tracks were decent), obviously filling in time (Claire doing the dishes, mother Claire's threads), the way Claire says "hello, there's someone" every time she thinks that there is a killer series around. <br /> <br /> Also some of the acting roles (especially Claire's mother, played by Maureen Olander, who resembles Mary Kay zombie) shows for the first time an actor with low budgets. <br /> <br /> Both for being smart by half, and not smart enough, Salvage is interested, even to see how they will fix this mess. The problem is that it really is not.
