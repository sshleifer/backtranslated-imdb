I logged in to comment on how stupid this movie is. It's a movie that makes you appreciate watching a movie that can take the same basic ideas and do it well, except that it is a scam of executive decision or Air Force One or any other terrorist story. It is difficult to blame the actors when they receive such a stupid, stereotyped script for work. Bad enough if you moan once in the film, when you come across the insult of your intelligence, but when you start to moan, you have to come to the conclusion that the director is not the brightest bulb in the film industry, nor are producers who decide to transfer this story to the screen. Actors with the lowest rents who can justify taking over this task, because they most likely came to get money and exposure, not that being part of the movie joke earns them recognition. It may end up embarrassing them for such a bad judgment to engage in such a loser. I do not see the point in summarizing the conspiracy, nor even in providing any examples that could prove my case, because it would be cruel and unusual that no one who got involved in this defeat would be able to stand it. Just as studying well-made films can inspire you to do a good, skilfully combined work of art and beauty, the only thing you can learn from watching this monstrosity is what NOT to do and what does NOT work! Be warned.
