This version of Paramount / ripoff OKLAHOMA! / ANNIE GET YOUR GUN / CALAMITY JANE is not so unusual or innovative at all. Marketing comments and intro can be there to save what is really a bad western musical film shot on the sound stage and like a live TV program. I do not find the use of cyclamama in the background, illuminated in different scenes yellow or pink or red, or ... all of this is innovative. As already mentioned, it looks more like a film made in the television budget: the entire sound stage, with minimal sets supported by lit cycles! (Compare with NEW FACES (OF 1952). However, the actors are doing well, and this style was much better realized when Paramount shot LI'L ABNER in 1959. They think?
