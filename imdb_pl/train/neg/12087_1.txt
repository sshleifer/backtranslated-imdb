I saw all kinds of "Hamlet". <br /> <br /> Kenneth Branagh was the most ambitious, Mel Gibson was quick and kind, Laurence Olivier was the best - without a doubt. But now we come to the mention of Maximilian Schell. <br /> <br /> First of all, it is a dubbed version of the German television production of the venerable chestnut William Shakespeare. But if somewhere somewhere slower, more tangled, more lethargic and worse staging, it had to operate at primary school level. <br /> <br /> Seeing this on MST3K, Mike and robots make good jabs in the old man, breaking the depths of black and white television, Shakespeare and wisdom (?) of the Germans playing the English game and makes it look like the rejection of Ingmar Bergman . <br /> <br /> Of course, the best parts are MST riffs. The best lines? "Free the Dane", "I do not think," breathe "," Meet the Beatles "," Hey, Dad, will you help me in my research project "and, my personal favorite, during the event -" Garrison Keillor leaves Germany (YAAAY !! ). " <br /> <br /> But then is Schell, playing the biggest character of Shakespeare, like a mannequin from a department store, but not as expressive. No doubt he is a great actor, but here both Paul Newman and "The Silver Chalice" appear. Have you ever seen it? GOTTA will look at these two on a double bill! <br /> <br /> In the end, this is one case where it is true that it is better to read a book. At least the book is not dubbed by Ricardo Montalban. <br /> <br /> One star only for this "Hamlet"; ten stars of course in the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> Goodnight, not very sweet prince.
