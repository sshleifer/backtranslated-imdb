It's the worst movie I ever remember. Everything was unbelievably trite and delayed. Acting was terrible too. The camera's work was not bad, but it still could not use it. The writer / director of this film has to suffer from a fall syndrome if he believes that this movie will help his career. I want one and a half hours of my life to come back, that I wasted watching this shit. I'd rather watch a film about growing grass. I can not believe IMDb has me write 10 lines to post it, but I feel that this movie is so bad that I still have to warn others about it. The reason why I came to this movie is that my girlfriend asked the local library for it, thinking that it was Kris Kristoferson's film entitled "Disappearing." I do not know whose fault this trash went to my DVD player, but I feel that someone owes me at least $ 20 for my time, pain and suffering. In conclusion, the director / screenwriter of this movie hopes to ever recognize him on the street.
