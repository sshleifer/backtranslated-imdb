The Horror Channel plays only erotic, soft gothic porn movies every evening from 10pm to 4am, but their "scare" is very limited, if it exists at all. I'm sure I'll see that a lottery worth millions of pounds will win more frighteningly than anything the channel has to offer. <br /> <br /> The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance deserves special attention because I feel that it is the undisputed low channel full of falls. I can not even tell you how bad the movie is, but in order to finish the minimum of 10 lines required by this site, at least I will give myself peace of mind. <br /> <br /> First of all, the title is misleading and there is no similarity to the action on the screen. In fact, the film could well be called a "toothbrush" or "wallpaper" because it has to do with the plot. At least they used toothbrushes ... at least they had a wallpaper. <br /> <br /> There are no bloodsuckers within a mile, and even worse, there are no dances, not one. I'm sure they made two different films by mistake. <br /> <br /> A more appropriate title would be: "Horny Italian Count leads five people to the terrifying castle and Bores us Silly for ninety minutes." Yes, it fits better. <br /> <br /> Acting is horrible and dubbing horrifying, and this guy who plays Seymour, he was almost as wooden on his walk as he was in his character .... miserable. <Br /> <br /> The only saving of this movie is a small, but slightly interesting lesbian sex scene, two small and very interesting heterosexual sex scenes and an additional attraction that each feminine character gets its set. Bonus. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, control broad births from this. No vampires, no dancing, no scenes of brutal or macabre nature and no way to the Divine Land. I will ever, ever, ever watch it again. <br /> <br /> Without a word of lies, this movie could put you away videos for life.
