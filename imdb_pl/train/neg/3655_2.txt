Oh my, I think it can be one of the most expensive film I've ever seen. I'm serious, this is one of the best b movies. The first proof is that it's not a DVD for $ 5. Oh, no, that's the mainstream. I have it on VHS, from the basket full of rental movies in my local video store. <br /> <br /> If I can quote blurb: "In the seventeenth century Japan lived a samurai who set the Standard forever. His name was Mayeda. He was sent on an epic journey around the world to get 5,000 Muscat from the King of Spain. Mayeda must fight all the opportunities to survive and secure the fate of his beloved Japan. Then he says: "A multimillion epic action adventure taking place on three continents" <br /> <br /> I had to see a different movie. It was not an epic, and it certainly was not a million dollars. No, "Shogun Mayeda" is really crazy adventure English-language Mayedy (Sho Kosugi). He is not even Shogun, but it is not important. The important thing is that it makes a really cool impression of John Cleese's repeated charging into one castle in "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" and his ability to move from serious scenes to showing his samurai mind power. Awesome. <br /> <br /> The biggest advantage of this movie is Engrish Sho Kosugi. The film can run out of almost everything, which makes it a good movie, but makes up for it with some of the best lines in history, provided by the coolest Engrish accent. And to be honest, do you really want something else? You can quickly scroll "Shogun Mayeda" to the end and repeat the last Kosugi line. The tape will probably wear out before you get tired of this one line. Awesome. <br /> <br /> 2/10 - So trashy.
