First watched 11.07.2002 - 2 out of 10 (Dir-John Bianco): Pretty bad gangster movie about a family similar to Godfather in Brooklyn, who like to say four-letter words and kill people. The only interesting thing was the attempt to show the federal, who are very similar to the gang. This is the only attempt to make good movies. The rest of the movie was predictable and cheap. The quality of photography on some scenes in strips and liquid joints almost made you think that there is a problem with the DVD player due to the bad contrasts, and some actors sometimes hard to hear because of the bad sound. Acting was quite characteristic of all your favorite gangsters from better movies with bizarre names like Vinnie `Knuckles 'and Jimmie` Tattoos', and the plot also followed these patterns. So see a better gangster movie before you spend the money on this movie.
