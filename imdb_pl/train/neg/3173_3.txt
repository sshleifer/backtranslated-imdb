This film is similar to the art called "Blithe Spirit" by Noel Coward. The story of a spiritual wife and medium is strongly related to Coward's writing. I am surprised that such films do not recognize the writer's original concept. I realize that the public may not be aware that this is a fake, but it is. <br /> <br /> Sad. These films are so expensive to produce. I do everything when the script is original. I break even when it is an innovative way to perform a work that was previously released. Several samples were mentioned (such as Topper, etc.). <br /> <br /> I realize that movies are still a relatively affordable form of entertainment. However, I do not like it when the public taste is taken for granted. In this situation, the taste of the audience is skipped. <br /> <br /> I am looking forward to better movie production. <br /> <br /> In this case. I rather see the game.
