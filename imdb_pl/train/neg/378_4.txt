... but the keyword is "usually" here. I know I love movies EVERYONE thinks they are stupid. But in the world of movies with grade B, this one is rated by Z. Absolutely ridiculous. I respect most of my favorite B rated movies because they do not take themselves too seriously. The creators of such films treat the film lightly, even if it is a difficult topic. I have the impression, however, that the producers of this film approached it seriously, as if they were creating a 10-star classic, with weak attempts at moving lines and stupid shots. Still, STILL gave him 4 out of 10 stars, because I'm focused on movies like this one. However, if you are a class B fan, I would try to find him.
