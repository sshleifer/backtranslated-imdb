This is another bad movie you should probably avoid. The plot could be "thicker" than it really is and would be better as a hit-type movie. <br /> <br /> The actor leaves a lot to be desired, although you can not completely put your finger on it. <br /> <br /> This is one of those you watch on TV late at night, maybe in the US, simply because you can not fall asleep. Follow if you like, but do not expect too much from it.
