This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen. From the story, though, photos, "special effects", acting and did I mention the story? Every thing is sucking! <br /> <br /> This is a good example of what "excessive doing" means and I will try to explain: <br /> <br /> I understand what the creator of the movie tried to do; it was supposed to be one of those movies you can not say what the hell is going on. You sit hypnotized, not knowing who is dead, who lives and who killed who and why, and when you think you have the right timeline, you find out you are wrong and the movie ends - leaving you with your mouth open for the next 5 minutes ! Something like "Unbreakable" or "The Job" if you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> But Olga Levens, the writer of this trash, yes, Olga ?? Screenwriter, director, producer, script writer, Caster, set designer, artistic director, costume designer, and the double hero of one of the characters are scenes ... it's basically a woman's movie, and when it comes to Olga Levens from "Levens Productions" you can be wrong :-) <br /> <br /> Well, it can be shocking, but "this time" Olga had a great time jumping from stage to stage, from dreams to reality ... but wait! It was after all a dream ... was it? The image disappears and I realized that nothing happened, the girl was alone on the ship ... actually there was no ship ... do not wait! There's a ship and guys again! They are alive! Thank God! No, they call her to join the cruise ... but then the ship disappears, so maybe they are dead at last? or maybe they never lived to begin? ??? <br /> <br /> If you understood what I just said, you might like this movie - otherwise it's a boring job and the only reason I chose this whole shit is to find out how the hell can end this movie. ... <br /> <br /> Do not watch this if you value time, in this case 90 minutes is a waste ...
