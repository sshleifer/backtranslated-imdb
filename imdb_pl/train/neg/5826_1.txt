Slow and nice images have changed each other, sometimes with annoying music (you know Bjork) in the background, for the first 75% of the movie. If you do not have enough sleep, it's a good time. <br /> <br /> But in the last 20%, the director decides to recall the idea of ​​rebirth, re-incarnation or other, through the photos of S & M: "Spirit lovers" cut each other's bodies with knives. For me, it was very disturbing and actually changed the general impression of a combination of abstract art and images of contemporary Japanese mystery. <br /> <br /> The operator and director are wonderful, but weird. <br /> <br /> He did not like it at all.
