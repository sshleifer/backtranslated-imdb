What I can say was stealing my time when I was taken to this movie and I must say what a terrible experience. Fay Ann Lee is a terrible actress and is not convincing in this film. Larryjoe76 is of course a shill reviewer. The plot is thin, to put it mildly, the Cantonese dialogue is not funny. See this video at your own risk. <br /> <br /> David Tang from Shanghai Tang should be after the film for little or no revenue that this movie will generate. Banal conspiracy tries to compete with other rom-coms and simply blends in with the scenery. It was like watching dry paint. <br /> <br /> In short this movie was a total waste of time and space. I've seen better YouTube videos.
