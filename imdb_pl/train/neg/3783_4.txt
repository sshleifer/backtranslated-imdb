It was not the most senseless experience in the animation cinema, but you certainly can not admire it as much as it tries to be good. Combining the Dreamworks animation and computer graphics, this is the story of a Mustang, later named Spirit (Matt Damon, providing narrative of the first person), and his journey across the boundaries of the Old West. Basically, it is born free among all other horses in a beautiful area, and then it is kidnapped to be used as a saddle horse, it manages to shed all those who are trying to reach it. However, when he escapes from his cage, together with Little Creek (Daniel Studi), they both form a friendship, oh, and he apparently has something to do with the Little Creek horses. Finally, after several more escapes, pursued by Colonel (James Cromwell) and his men, and the last great jump through the ravine, Little Creek lets the ghost go, and he also releases his female horse and runs a house in the countryside and horses. The main role is also played by Chopper Bernet. Adams, Jeff LeBeau as Murphy / Railroad Foreman, John Rubano as Soldier, Richard McGonagle as Bill and Matthew Levin as Joe. I expected the horses to talk in this movie, but it turns out that it's more like Dumbo, and Bryan Adams's songs are not the most addictive, but it's not a scary movie. He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Film and received a Golden Globe nomination for the best song for Bryan Adams's "Here I Am". Fine!
