Deceptive advertising ... I saw the Carlitos Way ad: Rise to Power, which says: "From the producer Scarface and Way Carlito" LET THIS SIMPLE ... Michael Bergman did not produce Scarface, in fact he was the "assembly assistant" for Scarface. Not to take away talent from Bergman ... but in my opinion he should have some more class. I think I can speak for the masses when I say ... We hate being grossly lied to. As for the film, it was weak at best. I thought Puff Daddy did a good job. Although Luis Guzman should be ashamed of working on this film. In general, the film did not do a good job, filling empty spaces on Carlito's Way. It is obvious that this project was an attempt to quickly make a rather good movie.
