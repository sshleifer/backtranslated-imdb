First, this movie, according to slick, said he won "the best film" at the film festival "Worldfest" in Houston, Texas. Hmmm had to be a peaceful year. <br /> <br /> I would not call it the worst film in history, but it certainly sucks, it's just as horrible as another Aussie B "Body Melt" grader, but at least it did not look like it was shot on video in HI 8. <br /> <br /> My guess is that the creators of the film watched many Tromy movies and really bad B-type movies, thinking that they too could break into business by releasing the film. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I love really low quality movies, just the fact that some characters use fake American accents, almost as if it gives them more chances to sell in states or something like that. A really disappointing ending, the showdown could have been more exciting and some good fighting scenes. You can completely see that the creators of the film try to copy the "Bad taste" with the entire car explosion, rocket launcher and an endless number of people shot, but the finale lacks humor or "bad" style taste ... <br /> <br /> If you like watching really bad videos from up, or you're interested in uneconomic movie making, watch them, otherwise stay away.
