Look, there's nothing spectacularly offensive in this movie, it's just boring. This is a typical rom-com with ending that you can see before you have seen as much as the trailer. The key difference is that classic rom-coms deal with their stories with wit and no pretense. This film has no grudge, but it really has no movement, you feel as if you can get up and leave at any moment. The production of the film also has the character of a debut film made about fifteen years ago. I recommend revisiting a classic movie such as When Harry Met Sally instead of this shallow imitation. Oh, one more big problem ... without chemistry. If you're used to Michael looking pretty like Vaughn in Alias, you'll be seriously disappointed with the way he made me look here.
