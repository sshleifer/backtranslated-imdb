Let's see. In the final "St. Elsewhere "we learned that there is no hospital and that everything was in the mind of an autistic child. "Newhart" ended, telling us that it was all a dream. And "Roseanne" ended up telling us that all this took place in her mind. Very creative. "Annoying was more similar." Yes, it was just a TV show and it was not real at all. The point is, when you run into a great movie or TV show, in the end you want to at least believe that it's all "real." At least as far as the reality on screen shows, this type of series finale was done twice before and it was old, frustrating and just not cool to watch. "Now," Newhart "is all a dream? At least in a creative way that far exceeded everyone's expectations who loved the program, the idea was not too addictive, but it was so well done that it was probably the best series finale. Roseanne left me feeling cheated after being such a loyal fan.
