I'm not looking for quality; I'm just trying to go through 74 famous films that were banned in the UK. This was initially banned and re-released in 2001 with a 10-second interlude. <br /> <br /> Some college kids spend their holidays preparing a dorm for renovation. Scary figures and four children lurk around. Which one is a slasher? Actual killings are not very bloody, so this nasty movie is not really nasty. It is required to flash tits, but this has nothing to do with college kids. <br /> <br /> I had a suspect very quickly and it turned out that I was right. Maybe I saw too many of them. The final phrase was clever; I have to acknowledge the writers' recognition for this originality.
