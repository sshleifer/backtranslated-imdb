About her. While Chevy Chase and the SNL gang set new heights thanks to the sketches format, at every level this fails. Fortunately, Chevy has nothing to say at all and you can not blame him for the tripe. It is very, very bad. Although it was supposed to be a political commentary on the USA at the time of its publication (1974), it is still neither funny nor hard to watch. Sketches are far too long, and any satirical effects they may have have been lost because they are all drawn to a point of boredom. This is considered Chevy's film debut and I'm happy that everything he did after this has improved. Avoid even if you're curious.
