If you look at Corey Large's information here on IMDb, apparently in production is a movie called "Reload" (from June 2008), in which a character named Sebastian Cole plays. <br /> <br /> First, how did such a shit movie ever get a sequel ... and secondly, did not Sebastian die at the end of the "Loaded"? <br /> <br /> I watched it in the early hours of the morning when I was fighting insomnia, so I drifted and drifted when it was turned on. I'm sure I missed a few feature points, but overall, it seemed very poor. Major's performance was (for me) one of the most powerful parts of the film. I am also a bit surprised by all those who comment on beautiful girls, because I thought that the actress playing Brooke was pretty, but not exceptional.
