Elvis left the building and is lucky because he did not have to watch this unpalatable stink. Scene by scene director Joel Zwick finds ways to make the uncomfortable script even less fun. Filled with unsavory deaths, banal gay characters and hack jokes, this movie is more desperate than funny. It's a movie that makes Kim Basinger follow Doris Day for early retirement. Let's remember about her as she was (talented), not about who she became. David Leisure, delicious Dennis Richards and the rest are wasted talents here. Zwick finds a way to minimize your talents at every step. The guy playing Elvis sounds more like Gomer than King. The only really good cast is a young girl who plays Basinger as a preteen. She really looks like her and she's pretty good. The only other reason for watching this movie is to look for the scene of Tom Hanks. The cameo is not that funny, but at least it's not painful. You have to wonder if Zwick has Hank's burdensome shots or something that would make him make this movie.
