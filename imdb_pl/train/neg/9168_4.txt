Randolph Scott leaves the US for the greener pastures of Canadian British Columbia. He wants to set up a cattle ranch with partner Bill Williams and chef Lee Tung Foo there. They are crowing their small herd over a paid bridge built by Victor Jora. Later, Jory rustles their cattle, and Williams loses his left hand during fracas. <br /> <br /> From 1945 Until 1962, When he retired, Randolph Scott made a series of good thematic topics for adults, some of them considered real classics. Unfortunately, the Cariboo route will never be listed among its best westerns. <br /> <br /> It's more like the material that Roy Rogers or Gene Autry can use. History is sometimes stupid. Williams, who was on a ride with Scott, wanted to go looking for gold, because then there was a big strike. He does not blame the rustling, he blames Scott for persuading him to go on a journey to lose his hand. <br /> <br /> Also in the film is the scene in which Scott, Lee Tung Foo and Gabby Hayes are captured by Indians. They run away because Gabby mule was taught to kick the command, and he throws himself on the Indians, letting our heroes escape. I'm not sure if it would play Rogers in the movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, history really wants you to believe that the seeker Randolph Scott accidentally stumbles on a golden strike after just a few lessons from the seeker Gabby Hayes how to find gold. <br /> <br /> It was a parting part of Gabby Hayes' movie. It would be better if he came out in good western style, and before he did a few better ones with Randolph Scott. <br /> <br /> I will say that, although no Caribou film appeared, it is one of the few Canadian films from the past that did NOT have any Mounties. <br /> <br /> But if I were you, unless you're a big fan of Randolph Scott or Gabby Hayes, do the next detour of The Cariboo Trail.
