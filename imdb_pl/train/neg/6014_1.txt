Left Behind is an incredible loss of over 17 million dollars. Acting is weak and uninspiring, and the story is even weaker. The audience is invited to believe in a completely unbelievable and often ridiculous story and did not give anything in exchange for good faith. Not only is the movie badly played and written in the script, but it is missing in all technical areas of film production. The production structure does not help in the credibility of the operation. The effects are completely unoriginal and flat. Lighting and general continuity are unforgivably terrible; even compared to movies with one tenth of the budget. However, none of this will matter, because millions of families will undoubtedly embrace the film for its health and its religious inclinations; and who can blame them. It is a pity, however, that they will be forced to accept third-level amateur filming.
