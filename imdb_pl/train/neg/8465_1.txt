I can not believe how awful this movie was. I feel generous, even referring to it as a "movie". Acting was flat, the editing was terrible, and the plot left many important questions unanswered. The assumption was fine, if not genuine: a small group of aliens lives in the US and tries to take over humanity slowly. But from there it drops quickly. How could they convince a "man" to accept a stranger as his wife to make them a foreign-human hybrid? They show alien larvae, but they never show what they do. They have a plastic surgeon who can produce perfectly looking skin on an industrial scale. They throw in obligatory huge alien monsters with teeth. The ending was almost too painful to be seen. I suppose I'm mostly disappointed that Bruce Boxlietner would have something to do with it. How could he say to the great cosmic monster with teeth: "Get away from him, son of blah" with a simple face? This is the long fall of his Babylon 5 days. Avoid this at all costs.
