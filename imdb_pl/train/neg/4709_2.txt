Cartoon Network seems to be desperate in ratings. Beginning with Samurai Jack's cancellation, the network seemed determined to remove all the programs that made it so popular, such as Powerpuff Girls, Dexter's Lab, Dragonball Z, etc. When the ratings began to drop sharply, the CN began to prepare nice average shows. Although Total Drama Island / Action and Chowder are distinguished by clever writing and public-friendly tricks, there are many other programs that either scary remakes (George of the Jungle) or other programs such as The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack, where the title character behaves the same as Spongebob, and then Johnny Test, which is something like a substitute for Dexter's Laboratory, although it is much more than just a tear. <br /> <br /> The protagonists of the show clearly come from the Dexter Lab, but this time we're focusing on Johnny, the blonde (or fiery-haired) character who torments her twins, Susan and Mary, who just look like Dexter, from orange hair, glasses, impossible technology. There is even a rival genius named Bling Bling Boy or Eugene who seems to be sitting in Mandark. Then there's Dookie, Johnny's best friend and talking dog, one of Dexter ... I mean, early experiments of Susan and Mary. <br /> <br /> Dexter's lab was probably one of the best cartoons on TV, with its simple yet effective artistic style, nice hero and episodes that do not seem to be a long drag. Johnny Test is completely different. The artistic style here is not so pleasing to the eye. In fact, it looks absolutely horrible. Characters have motivations that make them really annoying or repulsive. For example, like most episodes of the series consists of searching for the devastation of Johnny and Dookie in a neighbor girl Sissy, which Johnny secretly likes, or obsession of twins over a boy from the neighborhood. Seeing how the two geniuses faint when you see abs and the fact that Johnny seems to be someone you NEVER want to associate with, there is no real connection between the viewer and the characters. <br /> <br /> One thing in the series heavily uses in his name that Johnny is the sea pig Susan and Mary for experiments. They include hesitation from Johnny, ugly, monstrous, and even to a woman. The twins help Johnny in any plan he plans in exchange for his services. Whenever it comes to an episode that includes this type of "win / win", it usually seems that it will not be resolved, and those that do not completely fall off the rails, never end satisfactorily. <br /> <br /> The range of writing varies from the average frightening. The "fat" episode still repeats "To Phat z PH. There is a difference, you know. "Which is a line that should never be repeated, especially when it seems that the episode PROMOTES childhood obesity, and Johnny becomes a famous star with money and video games, becoming fat. <br /> <br /> Let's talk about how it looks completely tear Dexter's laboratory. The show throws a lot of characters, from two men in black, Mr. Black and Mr. White, a military general who seems to need all his problems solved by Johnny and his sister, and MANY evil villains, though even here the series again steals ideas for other sources, like teen clone Mr Freeze, an evil cat with a butler who wants to for cats to rule a man (like a bad talking cat from the Powerpuff), a clumsy maniacal champion, a trio of "dudes" of an evil skater, and even Mole Man, who is probably the most banal villain in the media. <br /> <br /> In addition to the ugly animation and dissimilar heroes, the voice acting is either passable (like the voices of Mr. Black and Mr. White) simply ear-splitting (Johnny, Dookie and almost every villain in the show). This song seems to be the only catchy thing in this concert, but then it was only re-made for a few episodes with a band that just ruined it. <br /> <br /> So in the end, Johnny Test is not a good cartoon. His horrible references and jokes about teenagers 'culture will eliminate the interest of young children in performing, while his bright colors, cheated characters and long stretches will ruin the teenagers' experience. This is another of those nonsense shows in which Cartoon Network is exaggerating to get people to watch it (like MTV towards rap). If you need a show that will please your kids for half an hour, better stick with Spongebob because Johnny's Test is more a "test" of patience than anything else.
