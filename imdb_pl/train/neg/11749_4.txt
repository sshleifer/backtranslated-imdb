Phil the Alien is one of those bizarre movies in which humor is based on the weirdness of everything rather than on real punchlines. <br /> <br /> At the beginning it was very strange and quite funny, but as the film progresses, do not find funny jokes or quirks. <br /> <br /> It's a low-budget movie (it's never a problem in itself), it was quite interesting characters, but eventually I lost interest. <br /> <br /> I imagine that this movie will appeal to the stoner who is currently taking part. <br /> <br /> For something similar, but better try "Brother from another planet"
