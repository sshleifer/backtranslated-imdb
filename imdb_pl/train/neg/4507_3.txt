Despite the overall nice plot and costly production, he wonders how a director can commit so many clumsy cultural mistakes. Where was the Japanese wardrobe and cultural consultants? Apparently not on the payroll. <br /> <br /> My Japanese friend actually laughed loudly at some of the cultural absurdities she had seen before her eyes. In a later conversation she said: "Imagine a Finnish director making a film about Fnnish on the Civil War with Swedish Swedish actors as a trade union army and the French as a Confederate. there was a rim and a sports hairstyle from the 1950s. Maybe some people in Finland may not be aware that the hoop skirt "missed the rim" or recognize Jane Mansfield's bizarre hair, but in Atlanta they would not believe their eyes or ears and laugh at corridors ... perfect history and photography let them be damned. <br /> <br /> So ... watching the memories of a geisha was painful for anyone who knows Japanese cultural nuances, a real geisha or a Japanese dress, and that was the theme of the movie! Hollywood is amazing in the short-sighted approach to film production. They often get big money, letting the details that really polish the sophistication of movies be embarrassingly wrong. I thought that "The Last Samurai" is the crowning achievement of how bad a good movie about Japan can be. The geisha diaries are both embarrassingly better and worse.
