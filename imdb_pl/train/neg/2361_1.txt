This movie is the worst of the series. Although New Line can simply look at sales, everyone knows that the only reason why he earned more money than the previous one was due to the end of 3D. It was not that the three-dimensionality was good because it had three-dimensional three-dimensional lenses with red and blue lenses (anaglyphs). The fact that people wanted to see what it would look like. Besides, this movie was so badly made! Bad scenario, bad characters, bad behavior, worse director. This film tries to move the camp factor almost to the point where it's like the episode of "Looney Tunes". <br /> <br /> Seriously, not for the recipients of horror movies, because it is banal and not terrifying, and it is not funny or fun for the comedies. Just a total mess with a few really bad scenes that are still trying to play the whole thing as a camp and do not fit what they probably wanted. <br /> <br /> I remember that most of us were fans, this series just prayed for it to end at this point because of how bad it was. This is one of the films that helped take the horror out of popularity and see that the audience really wants to laugh at some stupid comedy than to see a good and terrifying horror movie.
