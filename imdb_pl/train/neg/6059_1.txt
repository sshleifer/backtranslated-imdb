I must say that I am a fan of a man who created Halloween / The Fog / Christine / The Thing - probably his best films. <br /> <br /> Then you have this POS. I can not logically think that he put in any effort, as in the case of Cigarette Burns. At least his son made a decent soundtrack. <br /> <br /> You have to look at it from the point of view that it did not look like a movie. It seemed that someone else directed her to one. I will not believe that Carpenter will put in any effort. <br /> <br /> I just listened to his old soundtrack H2 / H3 / The Fog and it was amazing, especially for the times. > <br /> He used a style that no one had and worked so well for his films.
