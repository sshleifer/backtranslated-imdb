I would like my reviews to be short and simple, but in sum it sums up. You can not beat the two original ones for many reasons, one of which is Chris Columbous's directorial talent. <br /> <br /> This movie had a terrible direction hidden by even more horrible acting. I can not even believe that these people are considered actors. <br /> <br /> Trying to sit and watch. The plot was a complete joke about the secret chip and the Russian terrorists during the tedious attempt to recover it. Terribly, rent one of the original tugs and have fun! <br /> <br /> The movie was not even set during Christmas like the original. Home Alone has been transformed from a great comedy family movie on Christmas into a joke without morals and storylines!
