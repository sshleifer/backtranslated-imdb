Perhaps being Moscow alone and having a flexible sense of humor makes it impossible for me to throw this film in the "arthouse / festival crap" trash. This is not the best movie of 2005, nor is it a complete trash. It just has a lot of problems. I sincerely doubt that this film will be banned because of "ideological fears", "conservative taboos" or for any other reason why this film can be called "bold" and "uncompromising" abroad. He was forbidden because the censors knew that 99% of Russian filmmakers would find it offensive because of their bad taste when filming and editing this otherwise boring movie. <br /> <br /> So we have a strong opening of the shot. A great sound project, an excellent premise - full of meaning and symbolism. The use and placement of symbols will consistently be the strongest aspect of the film (it's not that the number 4 is a difficult visual challenge). In the next 40 minutes we have an equally strong configuration. A funny and well-written conversation between the 3 (main) characters and we feel the pathos for these people, the great country of Russia, the human condition and the like. Then the movie begins to slow down. We start to wonder what awaits us. <br /> <br /> The rest is quite boring, just. Sure, the guy in the village is tugging at the heart, and there are some funny moments. Nice sound. But the joy of this film, not to mention the plot, is seriously threatened by stimulation problems. And this, the lack of payment for the fact that he sat through all (nicely wounded) misery and sadness, is what ultimately angers people to "offensive" things (personally the main offensive scene bordered with the depiction, a pathetic way of appearance of harmless drunkards). <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a nice movie in which Russians are wasting a lot of time (the whole movie), see detailed information about National Hunt. Much more satisfying post-Soviet things. Yes, 4 out of 10 out of 4, nice and symbolic for my post-average movie.
