do not look at the Serbian documentary and Serbian propaganda that considers this document, and you will see the facts and the truth http://imdb.com/title/tt0283181/ <br /> <br /> documentary series The Death of Jugoslavia (from five episodes) a meticulously elaborated and researched description of extensive mass bloodshed, which marked the end of the old Federal Yugoslavia and covered almost the entire first half of the 1990s. It contains a huge wealth of information materials and interviews with the involved parties, both "Yugoslavian" and others. The only real "improvement" that could be made in this amazing achievement would be the inclusion of subsequent events in the Balkans since the program's implementation. Indeed, it was done at the end of the 90s to repeat the show on BBC television, but adding some even more current events would help complete this extremely detailed and complete work. Perhaps the next whole episode will be justified? The very concise title of this document became all the more appropriate since the term "Yugoslavia" was finally dropped by what is now called the Federal Republic of Serbia and Montenegro - a very late and formal admission of what happened years ago. /> <br /> no fiction like in "Yugoslavia: The Avoidable War (1999)"
