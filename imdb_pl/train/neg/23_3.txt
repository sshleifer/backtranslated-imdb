I rented this on DVD without previous knowledge. I was suspicious when I saw Michael Madsen, who appeared in a movie I never heard of, but it was a freebie, so why not check it out. <br /> <br /> I'm guessing that Mr. Blondyn would like to forget that he has ever participated in such a shameful film. <br /> <br /> Apparently, if your script and dialogues are awful, even good actors can not save the day. Not to mention the amateur actors who flooded this movie. Too many non-native speakers of English reproduce fragments of native English speakers by reading lines from a script that should be ejected and not changed into a movie. It's unbelievable how incredible all the lines in the movie are. Music is awful and completely out of place, and the whole thing looks and sounds like a bad school game. <br /> <br /> I recommend watching it only to appreciate other, better films. That's why I gave him 3 instead of the one he deserves.
