For me, this movie just fell on his face. The main problem for me was casting Glover as a serial killer. I do not know if it grows out of throwing fonts or just because of its behavior, but I doubt that Glover could ever introduce a convincing villain. He's a good guy and it's always obvious in his performances. In addition, the movie is your story about the serial killer of the mill. Nothing very innovative.
