In short, this movie is completely worthless. <br /> <br /> The idea is to make a movie from the point of view of what a person from the beginning of the 20th century can think about the future. An interesting idea, but the lack of a fascinating story or character prevents us from suspending our disbelief, so the idea simply lays. <br /> <br /> Apparently the whole movie was made with the actors in front of the green screens and we should be impressed. But as a graphic person, excessive softening was an obvious bullet to hide the difficult problem of a sharp edge with a green screen. The color is mainly rinsed without any significant effect, except for the reduction of visual quality. And I do not understand why anyone would think that something in this movie was supposed to be a breakthrough. If anything, the funny backwards graphics have lowered the bar for really bad graphics - they do not even measure up to the ancient graphics of Jurassic Park. The robot models were so simple, simple and very simple. There were many strange prehistoric animals on this island, but they are not explained in any way. <br /> <br /> This story is terrible, unbelievable. Actually, I can not believe I did not leave this movie. The relationship between Polly and Joe is not motivated, and the whole movie is based on distrust and deception. Why is the figure of Morris Paley there? We are not convinced in any way that Joe is heroic - I mean that he is flying by plane and saved one person (Polly) for personal reasons. Yes, there is a great hero for you. Dex has very little time for the screen, so why should we take care of Joe who wants to save him? Who was Nepaleaza who shut Joe and Polly in the mine's vault and why would they do it (remembering that the entire Totenkopf operation was a job)? <br /> <br /> Holes: (1) Why does the character of Bai Ling (a serious drop from her perfect character in "The Crow") stop the robots that caught Joe? They were looking for vials and did not find them. (2) Why the hell was Dex captured, but not killed (he does not know or know about the vials, and the bad guys did not know that Polly had vials and was connected to Joe, and so to Dex)? (3) Polly points out that "they" do not know anything about Totenkopf, but she has a secret source about him that contains something that seems to be quite a complete FBI-style file. (4) Empty space on the map described by the Nepalese - if they know everything about this mysterious area, why the hell is their map empty in this place? (5) At some point, Polly and Joe have to give up their clothes (they are burned) - Joe receives new clothes that were identical to his old clothes, but Polly is forced to wear a strange-looking massive dress and then in the same line of continuity suddenly, Polly has her original clothes. <br /> <br /> * sigh *. How far am I going to change my brain to watch this nonsense? <br /> <br /> We are to be excited about the music produced above, even if nothing interesting or remote is happening on the screen. > <br /> And acting? Are we to be impressed by some bad British accents? Which character is not annoying? I think Ling Bai's dialogue was probably the best in the whole film (there is no one line). Dialogue was not camp and did not rise even to the level of cheese. It's just bad and annoying. These people are not heroes or convincing; they are people you try to ignore or disconnect if you have ever had the misfortune of meeting them in real life. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that this movie has above average IMDb. IMHO should compete with "Batman Forever" on the 100 lowest positions of all time.
