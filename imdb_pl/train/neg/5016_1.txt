The nickname of Nick Stahl, a young actor and an attractive VHS cover made me buy and watch this movie, expecting to see a good teen movie. What a crap! Full of stereotypes, scenario, dialogues and performances are horrible, terrible, very bad, terrible, scary? in short, a complete waste of time. There is no horror, black humor, just an absolutely boring story, with disgraceful feature points. The film begins with six characters, or actually three pairs, together like a group of friends, but in reality very nasty people who seem to be enemies playing an absurd, pointless game called "Taboo", and each of them writes "yes" or "no". some taboo problems. That means: the lack of prior character development, the viewer does not know who they are, their motives and relationships. Then it is a year later, and the same group gathered at the New Year's party, offending each other in a very disgusting way. But the plot and twists are so funny, predictable, mediocre and unbelievable that they do not deserve any additional line in my review. One advice: do not waste time or money on this trash, you will certainly regret it. My voice is one (horrible). <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Taboo ?? Jogando Com o Assassino "(" Taboo? Fun with the killer ")
