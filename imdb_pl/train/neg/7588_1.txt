Warning for potential viewers: if you're looking for adaptation of the classic story "The most dangerous game", look somewhere else. "Seven Women for Satan" <br /> <br /> only superficially refers to the original work, using the name Zaroff and speaking about the murder of the character. <br /> <br /> Some of the following may be considered by some to be spoilers. Or not. <br /> <br /> Borisa Zaroff plays writer / director Michel Lemoine. While his ancestor was hunting people because they were the only prey that was really difficult, Borys's victims are usually in a position where they can not defend themselves. The film moves from stage to stage with almost complete lack of brightness. The director seems to totally underestimate the pace and leave the viewer with a stuffy boring movie. A few single scenes are not very interesting (eg. Sequence of a stand for torture), but as a movie unit is not entertainment. Viewers who are more <br /> <br /> interested in an assortment of attractive and semi-attractive actresses at various stages of undressing, may consider the film to be viewed. Most of them will probably find better time to watch Mentos ads. <br /> <br /> By the way, the additions to the DVD included a lot of information about the film's history. Apparently, he was banned for a few years in his native France, which almost ruined every chance of dissemination.
