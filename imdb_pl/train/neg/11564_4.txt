An Italian horror / suspense movie about a wealthy English lord who swims in pubs and taverns for girls with red hair, just like his recently deceased wife Evelyn. You know that he really loved his wife because he brings them to his home - a big, rotting castle - and makes them spread, then torture, whip and kill. The most bizarre aspect of this movie was that after the film ended, we see this guy played by Antonio De Teffe as the movie's hero. Anyway, soon, on the advice of his uncle playboy Roberto Malder, De Teffe settles with the girl he meets at his uncle's party. She moves and strange things begin to happen in the delicate state of mind of De Teffe. He starts to see and hear his dead wife and finally, just look at the title if you're still curious. Family members and friends also begin to die in the most brutal fashion. Poor Aunt Agatha (looks like she may be even younger than De Teffe and has her in a wheelchair and tries to look old) meets her fate in a foxy way. He is injected with the other man and bury him alive. And of course there is a whole explanation of why Evelyn did what she did. Director Emilio Miraglia does quite a few things quite well: the settings in the film are well adapted to this film, although the attempt to convince us that it is England is absurd at best. None of the actors looks English. Many with dark black hair and Mediterranean complexion and English-clad clothes would not get caught dead. Cars drive on the wrong side of the road. But despite everything, the crypto scene was effectively shot and I liked the tacky resolution. And of course, every movie with a stuffy red-haired Erika Blanc is always a plus. There is a band of sexual perversion; but I think it is a bit scary that torturing women was fine and healthy to free one of his mental demons. Come on.
