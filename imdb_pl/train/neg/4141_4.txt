Well ... the movie was a funny watch. The main problem with this movie is that it is contrary to everything that most vampire myths adhere to. Like vampires who walk in the sun. Although there are parts that simply make you enjoy the way society creates movies. The scene in which the vampire is stabbed and screams: "It hurts ... It's really stuck." It looks like there are no scenes, but after some time you will get used to it. And there are random dream sequences that really do not help in the story. Think about it, nothing really made sense, but I just got a group of friends and watched it twice to get the full effect. Think about it, the battle scenes were horrible, and the zombies were just pleasant to watch. Slowly, writing more, I like this movie more. But you know, you can not really expect the Schindler List, but her funny watch.
