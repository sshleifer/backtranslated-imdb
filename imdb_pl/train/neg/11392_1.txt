For years I have been remembering reading about this "Trouble With Tracy" program in the TV Guide. CFTO-TV Toronto every Saturday morning at 6am! I lived about two hours north of Toronto and we could not get CFTO, but you know how it is - we always want what we can not have. <br /> <br /> Well, I knew what I wanted and wanted to see what was going on in this "Trouble With Tracy". Did she have a beautiful girl in the lead role? Was there nudity? Was there tension? Was it a comedy? It would be good if there was a show promotion. At least I could know what I missed. But no! The secret was driving me crazy until CTC's CKCO built the transmitter in Wiarton, Ontario, and began to broadcast "Trouble With Tracy" at the same time as CFTO ... Saturday mornings at 6 am !! One Saturday morning I woke up and turned on the TV at 5:59 and finally saw what it was "The Trouble With Tracy". Yes, "Trouble With Tracy" consisted of the fact that it was Canadian content and stuck in a harmless place at 6 am, so no one will ever see how horrible it was. <br /> <br /> The talented Canadian actor Steve Weston died a few years later, but many say he successfully "died" for the first time when he appeared in this program. When I saw it for the first time on this cold Saturday morning and fell into a depression back to my bed, part of me died as well.
