The topic seems pretty old today. Adapted to television from the book Rony Jaffe; We stumble and go through fantasy. Four students take part in a live game of the board game Mazes and Dragons (based on Dungeons and Dragons). One player, young Tom Hanks, goes into the fantasy world too deep. His co-mongers must help him and save him from self-injury. <br /> <br /> David Wallace, Wendy Crewson and Chris Makepeace complete the game. The support staff consists of veterans such as Murray Hamilton, Vera Miles, Anne Francis and Susan Strasberg. <br /> <br /> On this day it seems hard and tame. The highlight of the show is, however, seeing Tom Hanks between his salad days "Bosom Buddies" and his big splash in SPLASH on the silver screen. The youngest viewer will have the greatest pleasure.
