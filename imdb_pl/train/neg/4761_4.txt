Harold Pinter rewrites Anthony Schaeffer's classic play about a man who visits a lover's husband and has everything on his side. The original film starred Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine. Caine has Olivier's role in this version and is connected to Jude Law. The film was directed by Kenneth Branaugh. <br /> <br /> Acting is spectacular. Both Caine and Law are gangbusters in their roles. I really like chemistry and the clash of personality. It's wonderful and enough reasons to watch when the direction turns towards the script. <br /> <br /> Harold Pinter's dialog is sharp and sharp, and often very witty and I understand why he was chosen to rewrite the game (which is updated to use surveillance cameras, etc. The problem is that the way in which Micha√© Caine leads Law through his strange modern house with sliding doors and panels, for no real good reason.This is done many times in different places.I know that Pinter did it in his plays, but in this case Why do we need a couple to keep repeating that the Law is sleeping with Caine's wife? It would be good if at some point the law said enough that we did, but it does not work as if every time It was the first time that the script did not take Caine through his law manipulation so well, let's start with the fact that it's starting out blindly, so there's no chance Now these and scare us (do not worry about late revelation of the game that makes you wonder why worry) In the original, never suspected what was happening. here we do, and although it gives an advantage, it somehow feels false, because it is so obvious that we are forced to wonder why Milo Lawa can not see that it is set. There are several other cases, but to say that more would be too much. <br /> <br /> Thinking about the movie in retrospect, I think it is a film about lost opportunities and mistakes. Opportunities are a chance for better fireworks between Cain and the Law. The mistake is that the choice of flashy settings and strange changes in the plot takes away tension and a credible thriller. Instead, we get a clever dialogue and great performances in a movie that does not allow them to be real. <br /> <br /> despite great performances and witty dialogue are just 4 out of 10, because the rest of the script just does not work
