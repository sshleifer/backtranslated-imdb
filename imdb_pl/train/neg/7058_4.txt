I came to NEW PORT SOUTH expecting a replacement movie about the massacre at Columbine school similar to SON Gus Van Sant and certainly a summary in the TV guide stating that the student sociopath rebels against the system made such an impression on me, but it is very boring film where little is happening, so watch out for yourself <br /> <br /> The story is about Maddox, a Chicago high school student who decides to strike what he considers an authoritarian regime. The main problem is that the character is insured, and the actor who plays Blake Shields is not able to embellish any lack of scripts. You have a feeling that Maddox should have the bad charisma of Hitler, Saddam or Bin Laden, but he never turns out to be more than a frustrated, threatening teenager, and you can not believe he could gather all students. The subtext of your overthrow of one manipulative authoritarian regime just to replace it with another manipulative regime is too obvious, which means that NEW PORT SOUTH is a completely unconvincing drama that is not worth losing out of the way
