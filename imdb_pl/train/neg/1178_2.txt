A completely absurd movie "periodic" is just a thin excuse for his extensive, graphic representation of the heroine's romance with the "beast", a monster who supposedly appears every century to rape some women. This is exactly what he does, and the picture of the beast is really terrible; it's basically a tall guy in a fur suit with a mask and a huge PVC tube that you can come across a lot of white liquid on. For fans of fake animal porn, it's probably a real driveway. I was, however, amused, opening shots of horses having sex on a public square.
