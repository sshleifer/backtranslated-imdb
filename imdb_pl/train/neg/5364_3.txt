Complaints are important, for me the biggest problem is that this soap opera is too directed to women. I feel good with these night soaps, such as Gray Anatomy or Ugly Betty, or Western Wing, because there are stories that are interesting even if they never end. However, when the idea is similar to daytime soaps, the aim of which is only to put hunky men (Taye Diggs, Tim Daly and Chris Lowell) in sexual tension and brawls and in many funny situations in the so-called small hospital, it seems that the hospital general ... or the female equivalent of Baywatch. That's what men wanted and they had it, so if a woman wants it, the idea that it's a high-end show (or something that men will see) is unrealistic.
