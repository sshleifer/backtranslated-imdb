It is hard to believe that in 1997, David Duchovny was at the peak of fame, with X-Files, one of the best science fiction series in history, being on top of fame. Nine years later, he is almost forgotten, and his countermeasures to do it on the big screen have failed. I can not even explain why he is an honest actor, but probably his moment of fame cast him into an eternal role that requires him to be very talented. <br /> <br /> At the same time Angelina Jolie was much less known, and she was really happy that a movie such as "Playing God" did not lead her career to a dead end. Fortunately for her, "The Bone Collector" and "Girl, Interrupted" waited around the corner, and when Lara Croft came, her career began. <br /> <br /> There is not much to say about the movie. It's the only movie on Andy Wilson's big screen, and there must be a reason. Everything is trivial, and most of what happens on the screen is expected in the story of a former doctor who saves the life of a shooting victim in the bar just to work for the crowd. The voice off the screen is particularly bad, with a moralist text that kills all shades of cinematographic experience from the movie. You probably will not meet a movie, but in DVD or TV rentals. Try to find something better.
