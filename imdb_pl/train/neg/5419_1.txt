Why are filmmakers always opposed to the author's work? I mean, yes, things have to be condensed because of the viewer's interest, but look at Anne from Green Gables. They did a great job, combining important events into a coherent whole that was simply delightful. I can not believe that they decided to combine three novels for Anna from Avonlei in such a terrible mess. Look at everything they missed by doing it. . . Paul Irving, little Elizabeth, widows, Windy Poplars. . . and school years Anne, for God's sake !!! Would not it be great to meet Priscilla and the rest of the Redmond gang? Kevin Sullivan should do things one movie at a time instead of mixing them all and combining characters and events in the way he did. This movie was good if you leave the novel! But the beautiful work of L.M. Montgomery can not be denied. This movie was disappointed after seeing the successful way in which he revived Anna from Green Gables.
