A very bad attempt at a young spine piercing. At least the music in the spine was good. <br /> <br /> It's really a very sad case of Hollywood's nepotism at the worst. A group of Hollywood performers, bad musicians and producers creates some kind of "poopie" program, so their children can be the center of attention. Oh please !!! Night's humor was even bad. I hate it when there are really amazingly talented children (musicians, actors and artists) who destroy their butts to succeed, and that shit appears. Why was not Gene Simmons in it? The taste of America goes to the toilet in entertainment.
