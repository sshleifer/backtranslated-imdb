I would not call it horrible, but nothing is shining in this film and it is burdened with a serious, unbelievable development of the story. It starts well, but once the main hit is over, it changes into a long thread around a young girl who is not convincing, and some action scenes that are unrealistic in the absurd theater. For example, there is a long shootout at the airport, where the lighting is completely strobe. No explanation. How reliable is that the storage area at the airport will have flashing lights that will flicker and go out, just enough to let Snipes make his incredible escape? This is one of the few action scenes interrupted by senselessly designed settings that simply do not allow you to suspend your beliefs. <br /> <br /> In addition, it seems that the entire US CIA team may shoot a place, but escape the British, saying "national security" to the British. This grip is based on a stereotype that is far from reality to be satisfying. <br /> <br /> There are much better action movies. Better formulated, better made. This one is sometimes funny, but it does not have enough meat in the bones and after a while it becomes almost boring - something that should never happen in a good action movie.
