Film very little positive to say. <br /> <br /> First, it has zero pace and is devoid of any drama. <br /> <br /> In addition, it is extremely slow The Empty Acre seems devoted time and time again using the same footage. I lost count of how many times I saw "that" field at night or that piece of cracked earth. <br /> <br /> It also has the fundamental disadvantage of thinking that if the audience does not know about things, he will be caught, not just confused. So without any signs that problems suddenly arise, marriage is not what it seems to be, despite the impression that it is alright. We see that Jacob is probably the worst farmer in the universe, because it seems he does not spend time on the farm and he seems to have bought land with a completely useless acre. Beth has the key to the book store? There are many other questions, some of which will be resolved later in the film, much later, in fact too late. <br /> <br /> And on acre. Horror writers note that large inanimate objects are not terrifying? and if they are to be big acres, then yes. <br /> <br /> There is also a terrifying lack of sense, how does Beth (the best performer in the song, then Jefferson?) suddenly seem to be accused of everything under the sun just because he is on "medicine". <br /> <br /> With a full ten minutes plus running around the fields in search of a missing child (if he crawls a window? He's six months old) the film goes into a badly written scene after a badly written scene. Bad plinky plonk "horror" does not add atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Often, bad movies can be fun, but not The Empty Acre, which is just bad.
