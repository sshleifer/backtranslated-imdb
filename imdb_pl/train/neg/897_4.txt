Two years before "Arthur" was written and directed, Steve Gordon had a small hit with his script for this awesome comedy of Henry Winkler, followed by television "The Fonz." Thespian from the 1950s (and a versatile moron) is a co-owner and gets married without employment prospects on the horizon; to make ends meet, he turns to the extravagant world of wrestling, eventually becoming the star of "Magnificent George." Turning a sympathetic Winkler into a hideous fool probably sounded like an interesting idea (and a sure way to separate him from his television alter ego), but jokes and situations are often misdirected and mean, rather sloppyly staged director Carl Reiner. Particularly primitive is the scarier participation of Herv√© Villechaize (from "Fantasy Island") introducing moves to Polly Holliday (Flo from "Alice"). As Henry's beloved, Kim Darby looks a little different - especially when it's surrounded by all of these TV bars - making romance an aspect of the non-relevant script. * 1/2 of ****
