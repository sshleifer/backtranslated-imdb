The above seemed a much more appropriate title, when my suicides and my subordinates decided to watch this masterpiece of contemporary bzdur <br /> <br /> Erotic, scary, tense, thoughtful, that's all that this movie can not do. . <br /> <br /> However, this is extremely funny, slow sound effects and bad dubbing adds to this one of the biggest comedy I've seen in recent years. And yet this movie does not even try to be funny and it is one of the great film achievements, it becomes a comedy without even trying to entertain. <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie, an old guy who looks amazing as Santa Claus revolves around zombies and smashes vampires to the ground. It made me not believe in the title of the movie, if it were vampires versus zombies, why did not vampires and zombies fight? Well, whatever, there were more disadvantages to this rental than the title. Such as this one; in America there is a virus that creates zombies like creatures that hang around like ordinary tourists. And yet there are only four zombies in the whole movie. Another problem is that one store is empty. Surely you would see zombies wandering in the forest or in the background. In fact, I believe they just went round the woods because they did not have enough budget to film in a wider spot, and the director did not want to waste his precious time filming the forest areas he was supposed to occupy while sitting in the trailer, struggling to deal with such trivial matters. <br /> <br /> In fact, the director had such a good time that he did not have time to hire a large cast and even an editor. So he told the eight cast members that they would dress up for different people and try not to look inconspicuously while I assume he changed his name and began to randomly cut on film rolls "the assembly is not really difficult?" The only reason for this "movie" was in our bag, the fact that we somehow mixed it with Freddy vs Jason, it's strange how it happens. And the only way we managed to do this is to fasten the gas masks and attach them to our skulls to avoid the stench of this sickly mess. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah, we were laughing at the end, but I'm sure it's done very often when he lost his mental health .................. .
