A terrible ending - and I can not believe that Moore spent a year inventing this. Smacks of L. Ron Hubbard and Dianetitcs, which Hubbard claimed to have feathers in just three weeks. It was so disappointing that I could throw my records from the first 3.5 years. Now the first 1.5 hours were full of actions, although absurd in the assumption, and then worsened to the slow, painful, classical breakup of the series. Unbelievable how slow and exhausted this last hour was. Should we think deeper? If I wanted to teach a-materialism, I would read Ishmael Daniel Quinn again. Absurd thinking that 38K people would give everything for a "fresh start". Absurd to cast the disappearing Punishment and again appear Baltar and Six. Absurd throw a Mitochondrial Eve. Simply absurd.
