I do not know where to start, so I'll start with the fragment on the back of the cover of this movie. "Alive combines the tension of Vincenzo Natali's ankle with his own Versus from Kitamura." I did not see Versus, so I can not comment, but I think Cube was a great movie that I recommend to everyone. However, in this case, someone clearly mistook the "tension" with "boredom". <br /> <br /> I will just go further and ruin the whole story, because in addition to being one sacred Swiss cheese of the story, it's also moldy cheese, and the movie is not worth spending time, even if you do not know the story before, so It does not matter. If I misunderstood the plot, do not hit me - it's probably because I had to fight for my eyelids to be open. <br /> <br /> So the American army in Nevada once lost the desert of UFOs and Nambi. It seems to make sense, because both are deserts, so they are certainly the same place. Different continents or not. The monkey broke into a UFO and acquired something foreign that was given to a Japanese scientist who had to eat a monkey to survive in the desert. Anything. A foreign thing is now passed on to anyone who is "bloodthirsty" enough to kill the present host. The Japanese army wants to use it for military purposes, so they decide to pass it from the current host (daughter of the researcher) to another guy. But instead of choosing someone from an army that is full of blood-thirsty people and on the side of the army, they decide that it is a rather good idea to choose a criminal from the death cell instead. Oh, and the reason they chose this particular death cell killer is because he was the first person in history who did not die because of non-lethal electric shock, which is the standard method of exercise, because everyone dies as a result of the placebo effect when they are paralyzed. I do not know if they are doing so that they can giggle in the staff room, how everyone is dying, even if it is not fatal, or just want to lower the electricity bill. <br /> <br /> Then the movie turns into what the Matrix would be if it was really bad, and the unnecessary fight bored us to tears in an hour. And wait, now remember that they already had a guy infected with foreign things, so the whole movie so far was in fact a total waste of time, as well as human life. Then everyone dies. End. <br /> <br /> The only moment in the movie where I did not want to go, sleep or eat a sandwich, was when the guy was pinned to the wall with a pipe through his chest and hangs next to it, and another guy walks by. Dude hanging on the wall "Hurt me, shoot me". And the living guy looks at him, and it's not that he's a mean guy or something, so he really looks sad and does not want a guy on the wall to suffer. So he shoots at him. <br /> <br /> (Retoric pause.) <br /> <br /> In the stomach. "Gee THANKS FREAKIN" HEAP ".
