I found this movie as a great idea that did not bring. It seems that they have found a way to build up the tension, but they could not pay back well. In one case, the police are on the clock to find the hijackers' hideout. They carefully move from the dentist to the dentist to match the dental documentation. At the same time, the kidnapped man (Mason) escapes through the elevator shaft. After this time, the police arrive at the same time as he becomes free, which is at least anti-climatic. There are also large narrative scenes that take us "in thinking" of a terrorized husband and wife, which rather reduces tension than it adds. We are fully aware of their tension, and the lector is an insult and deprives the viewer of any chance of personal experience with fear, as Hitchcock has proved many times, is much more effective. The biggest disappointment is going through the whole movie and a quick, rather bland ending. I mean ... it ends with snoring.
