The word sums up in a summary d'oh;) Five girls are lost, trying to find their way home, when they stop in the store to get clues, hit the parked car, breaking one spotlight, fleeing the stage. getting into trouble, but suddenly they see one reflector (ooooh) in front of them. <br /> <br /> From then on, everything screams, cries and violence when they try to escape from the crazy person who lost her because of the reflector;) Well, screams and crying almost remain in the whole movie (very annoying) The film is shot with a cheap camera that makes it seem "real" or "shocking". however useless. There is something better to compare with "Blair witch style". <br /> <br /> Screams and crying for almost the whole movie with shit sound were top-notch annoying, it literally hurts your head :) <br /> <br /> Excuse me, but it was not scary, just an annoying painful piece nonsense movie.
