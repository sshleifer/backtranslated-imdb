Some people do not like animation. Personally, I think that the animation was amazing, considering when this movie was finished. There are many older cartoons that I just love. My problems with this movie are not animation, but the way it was built. All characters are just ... stupid. And it should not be for this movie. Apparently, everyone at LOTR has an embarrassing problem (for starters). The way they behaved at all annoyed me. My two sisters and I were laughing for most of the movie. I think if many people saw it before they see newer ones, they would not leave. I'm glad I rented it and did not buy it. There are a few movies that cause me a headache. It was one of them. However, this is not the worst movie I've ever seen, although it takes a place there. Or there, depending on the view.
