I saw this movie, and sometimes I was upset believing that this movie "saw me". Munchie damages "farce" for many years. Watch Star Wars again, do not watch Munchie. <br /> <br /> As a responsible parent (I'm talking with those who are now parents), I (you) would not let my (your) child ever participate in this video festival of pseudocultures. Munchie's insinuation is satanic, for the co-viewer, he probably prohibits chilled "duh". He is devilish, alien, rodent and completely sinister - like Bogey who became a body, invisible to adults, tempting children with a lifestyle that they could never afford (without income possible thanks to years of self-denial and sound management). He is a trader of easy answers and false ideals. He is everything that is not a morally conscious viewer. He is his own devil, Ron Popeil. <br /> <br /> I'm praying (I mean literally and figuratively, with emphasis on the first one) that this movie did not cause the DVD to be skipped. I hope that this kind of "yellow filming" died in a mournful death on the cold nights of 1994. <br /> <br /> Munchie also loves a pizza. I forgot to mention it. It's a lot.
