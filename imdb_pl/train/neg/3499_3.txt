Comedy Central has been successful thanks to its original programming using professional comics. The Chapelle Show, Mind of Mencia, The Daily Show and the extremely popular Colbert Report all the comic stars of the show and all are, or in the case of the Chapelle Show, were solid shows. Considering Sarah Silverman is one of the best women's comics in the industry, I was expecting good things when I tuned. <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> There were some mildly funny sequences, but given that the star is Silverman's caliber, the performance could have been much better. It was only a pilot and I hope that the next week's concert will be better. If not, get her help in the form of better writers for the exhibition.
