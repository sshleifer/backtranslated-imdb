In the seventies, WPIX led the "Adventures of Superman" every day in the afternoon for several years. From time to time, we congratulate the neighbors on "Superman and the Mole Men" shows. I always waited those days. Watching it lately, I was surprised how bad it really was. <br /> <br /> It was not bad because of special effects or lack of them. It's true that Superman's George Reeves costume was pretty bad, the edges of the foam lining made it look more impressive, which was clearly visible. And the truth is that Mole's men's costumes were even worse. What was supposed to be a fur coat would not deceive a ten-year-old, because zip fasteners, sleeves, and poorly pilling fabrics badly tailored into loose costumes were painfully obvious. But these were forgivable shortcomings. <br /> <br /> No, what made it wrong was sophisticated feature devices. On many occasions, Superman did nothing to make the situation worse. A dungeon crowd looking for creatures? Instead of delving into the hysterical crowd or looking for creatures, he stands around explaining the dangers of the situation to Lois and PR. Are the creatures trapped? Again he stands around watching and talking, but does not save them until they are shot. Luke Benson, the city's rebel, shoots him? Trying to kill every reasonable person, but Superman releases the man over and over again to cause more problems. Superman had plenty of opportunities to solve the problem in the bud, but he never used it. <br /> <br /> He said that both George Reeves and Phyllis Coates played their characters well, apparently immediately felt good. If only they would get a better script to work.
