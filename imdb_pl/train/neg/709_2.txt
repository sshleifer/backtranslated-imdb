This film was so badly written, directed and acted that it did not believe. It should be reworked with a better script, director and casting service. Acting is the worst problem. On the one hand, you have Jennifer Beals, which is sophisticated, professional and completely reliable, and on the other hand Ri'chard, which is pitifully confused and just shakes this particular song. Peter Gallagher and Jenny Levine are simply horrible as slaves holding (and holding) a pair, although both of them usually do a great job. Actors (and the director) should not try to accentuate at all - they are inconsistent and unreliable. It's much better to concentrate on doing a good job in English. Casting is ridiculous. Why were the children of the "African" buyer (and therefore less socially desirable for the society of gens de couleur) cast by actors with very pale skin, while supposedly socially desirable Marcel has distinct African features, including of course dyed blond "from"? It's as if the directors of the casting could not care about reading the script they are casting, and selecting the right actors from a large group of extremely talented and physically diverse color actors. It's so strange! This can be a great movie and should be reworked, but with people who respect this material and can choose the right and qualified actors. There are a lot of good actors out there and it would be nice to see how Jennifer Beals, Daniel Sunjata and Gloria Reuben will do with the right cast, good script and decent direction.
