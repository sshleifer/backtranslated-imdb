A boring thriller about a haunted house discovers that an American family is moving into a 200-year-old home in Japan, where a brutal love triangle about suicide has occurred. <br /> <br /> The new setting is the only interesting element of this very slow motion of the horror movie director Motel Hell. The film generates zero voltage and consists of slightly uncertain scenes that rarely seem to run at all. <br /> <br /> One obvious example is the relatively early scene in which a man visits a temple after realizing that his home is haunted, as the monk had previously warned. The monk tells the story of the house (which the viewer already knows from the opening sequence), and then the film simply cuts away from something else. Earlier, the monk offered help. Where is the help? The family is still in the haunted house when the situation gets worse and the monk is not mentioned until the very end, when he reappears to do what he should do an hour earlier - try to guide the ghosts away from home, though until then the viewers It's difficult to worry. <br /> <br /> There are (probably) unintentional laughter from campus, seeing how American actors are finally possessed by Japanese spirits and suddenly I start to do bad martial arts, I say probably because the scene resembles a little duel with a chainsaw the same director at Hell Motel, who apparently was supposed to be funny, but in general, it's a forgotten dud.
