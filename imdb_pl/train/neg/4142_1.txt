This is absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen !! There was absolutely nothing good to say about this movie. I've seen bad movies, but this one takes them. There is no plot, and most of the movie either rewinds the movie quickly to make it faster, or you wonder what the hell is going on, because you can not seriously think that someone has thought about this movie and watching it. I feel sorry for anyone who has to sit through this painful hour and a half. Please, take my advice and DO NOT WATCH this film, because I know that you think that this is the greatest waste of time you have ever spent in your life.
