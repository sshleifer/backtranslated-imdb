"Power Play" starts interesting but falls quickly. The only good actor is Tobin Bell and has a very small role. Beyond Bell, "Power Play" has no value or interest. "Power Play" has more earthquakes in a few days than California in a year. The earthquake scene in the mall is so imaginary and totally unbelievable. And all action scenes look like a third class crowd that starts playing. It's awful, just awful. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, if "Power Play" was made in the 60's or 70's, it would be considered a poor movie of class B. The fact that "Power Play" was made in 2001 is really sad . Is there such a thing as a "D" movie? If so, "Power Play" casts mold.
