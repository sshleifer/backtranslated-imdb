I think if you're in the sixties like me, you're bound to waste about 80 minutes of your life watching this barely observable train wreck. Savings in this eccentricity include surprisingly accurate social commentary on values ​​from the 1960s, as well as a series of relatively well-known actors caught on early (and troublesome) film materials. It's as if the Laugh-In producers sat down and decided to write a full-length movie covering all the most important points (and more) of problems between the flower children and the plant, and then put it in the hands of several hippies and gave them about $ 10,000 budget to complete . This is not a classic, but in its own way captures how strange this time was, stupidity, excessive idealism and the uncertainty of the establishment. Of course not for everyone.
