Another film with an interesting assumption and wonderful special effects falling into the trash bin. <br /> <br /> Boring direction and performances (with the exception of the charming Annabel Schofield, which is much prettier like a brunette and probably deserves better material, and always serious Charlton Heston), scores the real stinker. <br /> <br /> It's amazing to watch Heston, who reaches his usual level and show how bad the movie is. I even play a sub-story that interested me to see how it relates to the main line of the movie. The way they solved it was that they did not. It just falls from the end. <br /> <br /> Really. Do not waste time on this.
