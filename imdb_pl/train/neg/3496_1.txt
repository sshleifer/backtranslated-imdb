I remember that my parents did not understand Saturday Night Live when I was 15 years old. They did not understand Rock n Roll and many other things. Now, when I approach their age, I still remember and understand that I understand many things that love my children. But it is pathetic. I can not say I saw some Sarah except for a few shows here and there. They were reasonable. I do not think it's anything special. But this show is so much below what I expected from it. The IMDb record made it sound like a potential. That's why I started watching the first episode. I turned him off halfway. Everything else is better than this. Jokes that are intended for a 5-year-old depicted in an alleged adult program. Well, Sarah, this adult person is moved to throw you out. I just can not believe that someone actually funded this insult to comedy. The only good thing I can say is that there are so many bad jokes that save other shows from such shame.
