Inconsistent mess with grotesquely deafening soundtrack "Soul Survivors" is the latest entry in the horror genre "who is dead and who lives". Two teenage couples, Sean and Cassie, Matt and Annabel, are preparing to go to various colleges, but before they part to Thanksgiving, they take part in the last throw at a rave party in a burnt church for a suggestion of passionately slutty Annabel (Eliza Dushku, aka Faith, the second vampire slayer). Mindless, frightening guys start paying too much attention to Cassie (general Melissa Sagemiller) for reasons that will never be explained, and soon the quartet will leave the party. Driving away in their SUV, they chase after them, and then they pass by mindless, terrifying guys who quickly and inexplicably make deliberate 180 in the middle of the highway, causing a nasty and deadly accident when the SUV rolls over the embankment and submerges the river. Sean is killed (or is he?), And Cassie spends the rest of the movie, struggling with loneliness and guilt (guiding) when she is not haunted by Sean's ghost or pursued by mindless, frightening men. Much unexplained inconsistency occurs when Cassie's psychological condition continues to degenerate until we reach a predictable conclusion. So who is dead and who lives? After ninety minutes of this purgatory, who cares?
