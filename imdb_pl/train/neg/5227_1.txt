........ and very bad in this !!! How long did this train wreck last? 14 episodes or something like that? Now I see why. <br /> <br /> I bought an episode of "Serenity" from Amazon Unboxed. It was my first purchase, so it was free. To ONLY a good thing from experience (incident) <br /> <br /> I will not comment on acting really, because they were probably new people who did not really get a job right now. At least I've never seen them before in any big show, theater or television. If I did, I forgot about them. <br /> <br /> But the special effects were absolutely terrifying. It is true that this is not exactly a multi-million dollar project, but the original Star Trek did it better than it was THIRTY FIVE YEARS ago. I especially laughed at bad ships (harvesters or something like that) as he raced through a comic-looking Firefly, from the smoke coming out of engines that looked like a gigantic model rocket. I was fully expecting to finally see Wiley Coyote riding at the top, chasing after Roadrunner. MODERN jet / rocket engines do not even do it so badly. <br /> <br /> And it was not even the worst. Wild type shootings made me wonder if I'm actually watching science-fiction or Gene Autry. <br/> <br /> Regardless of the noise, do not waste your time ... I did ... all 80-minute disaster called "Firefly".
