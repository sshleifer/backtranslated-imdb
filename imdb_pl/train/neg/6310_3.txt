I watched this movie last night and was a little disappointed. Many "facts about time" were excluded. At the beginning of the movie, my grandfather commented on that grandson and his friends about how they felt when they hit 9-11. This movie was supposed to take place in 1994. In addition, one of his grandson friends was wearing an Eagles Donovan McNabb shirt. He has not been appointed yet. The plot was good, but the facts and timeliness of the timeframe were so distant that the film seemed tacky. My boyfriend is an avid reader of books and memorabilia from the Second World War. I rented this movie with the hope that it would be good. Acting was so-so. The dog was charming. But the way this movie was made made me happy that I only paid 4 dollars to rent it, unlike 50, that I would watch it in the theater. I hope that whoever reads this, understands that I do not mean dissatisfaction for those who fought in the war, but the facts and timeframes should be slightly more monitored.
