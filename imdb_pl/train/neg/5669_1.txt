The director, dressed in chains and leather, warned the audience on Friday night at the SF Frameline film festival that soon we will see an "experimental" movie. Experimental? Leave the video camera in the back of the car, let the tape roll and edit in the whole senseless shudder in sight. The winding, pastiche road shows a mania that starts nowhere and does not take the place of the audience. The unjustified violence that opens the film led more than one patron from the Castro theater. I would also leave, but my pal needs a ride home and has all this to see even the worst possible end. Before the lights appeared, the audience thinned considerably. Sharp applause. The pro forma form of the director who seemed satisfied with the product. Avoid this movie!
