Why, oh, why do not they learn? When you have a cool, juicy grip, use it! Do not be angry, trying to be deep and prudent; you only end up looking stupid. <br /> <br /> Christmas Evil is the story of Harry Stadling, who saw a little too much kissing by his mum (daddy-dressed-like-) Santa Claus came back when I was a child. So, of course, Harry grows up obsessed with Christmas and finally, when his disappointment becomes too great, he turns away, dresses like Santa Claus and wanders around the city giving away toys to good children and fiercely killing anyone he considers naughty. <br /> <br /> Simple enough and not a bad place to start. (After all, how many other Christmas horror motifs does the same schtick use?) Unfortunately, this movie wants to be more of a "Santa, Portrait of a serial killer" than "Silent Night, Dead Night". Two-thirds of the movie is spent documenting the slow but inevitable breakdown of Harry when I would be willing to buy this story until the first titles were opened. You know that the film is in trouble when you convince the killer to do it. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Harry's descent into madness could have been in the hands of a competent director, but unfortunately, we have a guy named Lewis Jackson. Apparently this is his only movie and it shows. The action jumps from place to stage, without establishing shots or explicit views of the actors, to let us know where we are and who we see. <br /> <br /> Even when the movie is spinning, we're still treated as an aid to pitying over Harry, uncertainty and neurotic behavior. More depressing than scary, Christmas Evil is one that should be avoided.
