I've never seen Spike Lee's earlier movies because their trailers never interested me. I have seen and admire the work of Denzel Washington and Jodie Foster and some of their DVDs. However, I was completely disappointed with this film. If this movie is a sign of Spike Lee's ability as a director, my advice is to "get a job" and stop wasting time and the talent of others. <br /> <br /> I wonder if other IMDb commentators watched the same movie that I saw. I can only assume, based on their favorable reviews of lovelorn, that their love of Spike Lee blinded them to the banality of this work. I paid only $ 2.50 in the "Second Run" theater and I still felt that I had wasted my money. <br /> <br /> IMDb "Ciekawostki" website says it all ....... <br /> <br /> * "Shot in 39 days" - How can you expect to make a big budget in such a short time? "Blockbuster" (as promised by the media)? No wonder everyone was so weak. <br /> <br /> * "Ron Howard made the film for the first time ..." - Perhaps he made this project a bit of justice, he gave more time to do so of course. Although the writing was terrible, the premise had some advantages. <br /> <br /> OK! may not. I'm sorry! This movie was so rich in pitiful clich√©s, unlikely scenes and bad characteristics that maybe even he could not do it. (Hey Ron, remember to thank Russell ... Good conversation!) <br /> <br /> * "Jodie Foster filmed her role in three weeks." - And it showed! Her portrait of "Fixer", which makes people's problems go away, was as unbelievable as the scenario she received. Did she even want to be there? <br /> <br /> Other peeresses: <br /> <br /> * How many bank robbers would bother to get to the door and inform the uniformed policeman that they are robbing the bank, and he better stick to it from a distance ... or otherwise? <br /> <br /> * When "Detective Frazier" (Denzel Washington) enters the bank to see if there is still a corpse, how many bank robbers, without a gun, "would lead" a policeman (much less "let" a policeman return to the front door, allowing the policeman to follow him? <br /> <br /> * Det. Frazier claimed later that he gave the thief "all the reasons to shoot me." So why in his short fight did not even try to reveal the face of the robber? That could get the answer he was looking for ... the bandit would shoot him only to prevent later identification, and why did "Steve, Stevie, Steve-O" (the partner of the robber) need him so long to come and help? <br /> <br /> * I understand that these were not your typical bank robbers, they had a different program and they did not want to hurt anyone, but the cops had no reason to think they would not do it, for them it was a desperate situation, so why two Wrong guys went outside to "pick up the pizza?" They were not taken. (First, how many thieves would go outside without using a hostage as a shield? Is this a NY City or SNL version?). Destroying them would reduce the number of bad guys, screw up their plans, and the other robbers would probably give up. If not, there will be at least less bad guys in the middle. (Give SWAT something to do or send them home!) <br /> <br /> * What kind of police department in this country would allow Madeline White (Jodie Foster) to simply go straight to the bank and discuss the case with thieves that he will not reveal im first? She had no authority, no government powers; and besides, it was an "already" hostage situation ... add one more? <br /> <br /> * Why did the bank president (Christopher Plummer) not destroy the incriminating documents? long ago? Screw sentimentality! Diamonds, he could sell. <br /> <br /> * Who was this "schmuck" (character, not actor), with Jersey accent, who, conveniently, volunteered and said he knew the recording was "100% Albanian", but he he could not say it himself .... SIR! CHANGE HAND! And his ex-wife! What was "schlump" !!! Both were completely unbelievable. <br /> <br /> * During interrogation of suspects, why Det. Frazier, constantly harass people who apparently were not part of the robbery? (Ie - telling the older woman that she could leave and then she could not, then she could, then she could not?) Give me a break! <br /> <br /> * Who, seeing bank robbers, demands that the hostages put on their suits, could not deduce that their escape plan included going out of the bank, pretending to be some of the hostages? <br /> <br /> * At the end of the film, it was shown that a false wall had been built in the supply room, for which Clive Owens was hiding for 'a week' ... where did the materials from? (plasterboard and pegs). It should also be assumed that they broke into the channel, so he could free himself. The bank's employees did not complain about this smell for a whole week? Hello! <br /> <br /> * After such a defeat; since the documents "fell" into the hands of the robber, what kind of "reference" was expected by Mrs. White from the chairman of the bank, if he was to be targeted by blackmail because of her defeat? > <br /> * And finally, but certainly not less, What about the "Electric Glide" that Denzel did? HOW MUCH! Was this to indicate his "decision" to put those people in court? It looked more like a man who jumped on a cart trying to prevent defecation! "Cheeee-Zheeee" !!!! <br /> <br /> Other than the average plot; bad script; bad behavior; and generally pathetic management ...... yada, yada, yada. <br /> <br /> Hopefully, this will give you enough insight into the video to help others decide whether to waste money or not! <br /> <br />.
