I thought nadir horror was achieved thanks to the Book of Shadows, I was wrong. This movie makes it look like "The Magnficiant Ambersons" compared to that piece of shameless, indefinite fecal matter that has the audacity to be called film. I would write more, but I'm still angry that I was so idiot enough to spend 3 pounds on borrowing, bobbins. <br /> <br /> And were these people English? and where is the forest> I lived in the UK two-thirds of my life and, as far as I know, there are no dark, unexplored forests in the central part of the country. The whole thing looked like a national conifer plantation. These angels looked like anorectic porn stars (most of them were, my research). I liked it when Judd was torn to pieces. <br /> <br /> P. I love and admire Tom Savini, but I CAN NOT WORK
