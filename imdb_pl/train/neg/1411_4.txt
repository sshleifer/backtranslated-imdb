This movie was great for the first time when I saw it when it was called "Lost in Translation". But somehow Bill Murray turned into an eccentric black man played by Morgan Freeman, Scarlett Johansson turned into a spoiled Latina played by Paza Vega, and Tokyo in Japan turned into Carson, California. Instead of meaningful conversations and silence, which we liked in translation, we get meaningless blabbering in 10 subjects that border on annoying. Instead of thinking and introspective characters, as in Translation, we get characters that cast meaningless advice on topics they have no idea about. How can a character who wears 100-dollar t-shirts and never be in a Target department store give advice to a working-class woman, how to prepare for an interview as an administrative assistant? Do not think it stops him. If she does not give her advice on clothes, she tells her what she should eat. The most annoying part of the movie for me was how they supposedly hurried to visit, and yet the characters still have time to start another job, be it car washing, stopping at Arby, or just lying on the list. with 10 items or fewer lists of things that they love and hate. I still wanted to shout at them saying, "Did not you say you have where to be? What the hell are they doing? One minute ago, you're practically late, now you eat roast beef and wonder about your life! "Until I saw this movie, I never really understood how to" insist on myself ", but I think this movie does exactly that and undeservingly. Dialogue makes the characters cheesy and unpleasant, except that I feel sorry for both actors for signing this project.
