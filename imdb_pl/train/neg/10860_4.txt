It was a disappointing movie for me. He came to me through a box set entitled "Classic Film Noir", which was a present from someone who knows that I usually like films made in this style (I insist that noir is a style, not a genre). I do not think it's a movie noir. It seems that there is a tendency to label and sell every black and white B film made in 1947-1955 as noir, and the label does not always match. There is a persecuted male hero, Ed Cullen (Lee J. Cobb), and most of the film's action takes place indoors. These are just some elements of the noir that I have seen. There is no ubiquitous paranoia or any real reason why you should sympathize with Ed Cullen. Jane Wyatt was exaggerated and unconvincing, like femme fatale. I do not want to spoil this film to potential viewers. However, I would like to hear what other noir film connoisseurs have to say about it.
