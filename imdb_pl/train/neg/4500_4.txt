This movie is not really scary. Someone commented that Mo is a type of American Europeans. But there are some, not necessarily Anglo-Saxon Yahoes who do not care for the French; and Xavier's character will not sway them. <br /> <br /> Consider his stereotypical features of the Frenchman: <br /> <br /> 1). Cynical - very cynical. Check. <br /> <br /> 2). Reedy, immature look, check, despite: <br /> <br /> 3). Great appreciation for the kitchen. Check. <br /> <br /> 4). Dissuade the work ethic. Check. (Forget about the fact that he is a rich stockbroker, it seems that he spends ten hours of work watching it in the film). <br /> <br /> 5). Beautiful wife, check. Nevertheless: <br /> <br /> 6). A loose interpretation of the marriage vows. Check. <br /> <br /> 7). A big sexual ego that says that an American girl owes you sex if you buy her dinner. Check. <br /> <br /> Regardless of whether Mo is hick or not, there is no reason for her to fall into this satisfied European duplication, except that the scenario demands it. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, as other reviewers have noted, I really liked the charming, small body of Karen Allen. I'll give the movie four stars; two of them are intended for this.
