While 3-D animation (the main attraction of the program) did a good job, most of the other elements fell flat. It was as if the creators of the movie thought "well, it will be 3-D, so we do not have to work so hard on the story or character development". And the fact that it is a movie for children, there is absolutely no excuse. The audience attracts three-dimensional characters (Shrek, Nemo's Dad) just as they are attracted to three-dimensional graphics. The only dimension that one of the main characters showed was the two-dimensional Scooter, which from time to time distorts the plot, forcing it to eat everything that is in sight. <br /> <br /> And an absolute kicker? The appearance of Buzz Aldrin at the very end (after watching an extremely robotic version of the same historical figure for an hour and a half) appears to ruin everyone's good life, calling the main characters a film of "pollution" and announcing that the situation on the screen was virtually impossible . <br /> <br /> ??? !!! ??? Did you just want to tell the children that Easter Bunny and Santa are not there when you're in it?
