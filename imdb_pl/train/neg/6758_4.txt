Quite probably the nicest woman in show business and the sexiest, Debbie gives another great performance here. Although her work at American Nightmare was much better, it is still worth watching in this film. <br /> <br /> The cast is filled with typical Melrose Place types, carved features and seductive curves that I've never seen before. Other than Debbie, Laura Nativo was the only actress I'd seen before, in the Delta Delta like Delta. <br /> <br /> The plot focuses on a group of Californian arrogants who initiate poor naive Debbie Rochon to his clique. They tell her that they have a club of murders and that he must kill someone who will be admitted. Debbie wants nothing more but to be accepted by these cool people, so he quickly kills the person, and now the group has to decide what to do with it after it's joking. <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $ $$$$ (Abundant! Debbie Rochon occasionally has blood stained and all murder scenes are done on your face. Gore dogs will definitely enjoy!) <br /> <br /> NUDITY: $$$$$ (Also abundant Debbie Rochon has a couple of nude scenes, like many without actress and actress names.The party in the pool seems to be just an excuse for the nakedness of everyone, man and woman Julie Strain has also topless cameo, but she disappeared after the first five minutes). <br /> <br /> STORY: $$ (He could have received a higher voice, because the plot was very interesting and unique, but the plot serves as a fill of naked scenes. I understand that B-Rate movies often use nudity, but this is excessive transgression . <br /> <br /> ACTION: $ (The action is at least standard.Rochon is always easy, the best B-Rate actress in today's business, but her character in American Nightmare was better. Danny Wolske is doing great as an object lust for Debbie, but the other actors had nothing to write about.
