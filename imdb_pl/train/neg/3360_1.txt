Somewhere in his book "DANSE MACABRE" Stephen King suggests that one of the secrets of writing terrifying stories is to avoid showing readers exactly what awful is waiting behind the door to get them. If the door finally opens and pierces a ten-foot bedbug, the reader may be a bit scared, but he'll also think, "Well, I can deal with it. At least it was not a hundred feet high. "There is nothing more terrifying than what is lurking, invisible and unknown, on the other side of this tightly closed door, waiting for it to catch you. <br /> <br /> THE HAUNTING is so completely misunderstood that the director Jan De Bont more or less begins his film metaphorically, opening the door and shouting: "Look, everyone, look! It's a ten feet high bug! Is not it SCARY ?! "The law of diminishing returns is immediately turned on. At the end of the film, the director jumps up and down, pounding madly at CGI pots and pans, and with a hoarse cry: "Look, look! ten bugs about a hundred feet! ... And now hundreds of thousands of bubbles are coming! <br /> <br /> The filmmakers apparently believed that the special effects alone can compensate for all other shortcomings in the project (and there are many). They can not and can not. The special effects are so impressive that they are so insistent and obsessive that the distracted viewer stares at them - whether with admiration or irritated - instead of immersed in the story. <br /> <br /> For me, the stupidest stupidity of this film appears when the statue with the "blood" gushing from his mouth tries to drown Liam Neeson (as Dr. Marrow) in the fountain. The creators of the film apparently did not know what to do with this alleged idea when they already had it, so they just told Neeson to sway a little in the water, waving his hands and glug-glug. At the next stage, the good doctor apparently dried up and, humming, forgot about the annoying incident. <br /> <br /> It seems that Shirley Jackson's novel has been overwhelmed by this ridiculous scenario of the low IQ adolescent committee who thought that the way to scare people is to make each effect bigger and louder: "Okay, next, let's do the ceiling, you know, you look like a frightening face and come down to her ... and all those spiny things, like, they'll trap her in bed. "<br /> <br /> The only economical treat of TEACHING is that it eventually becomes so awful that it is really fun. Before Owen Wilson (like Luke Sanderson) fell to the floor, and then went to the Magic-Carpet Ride O 'Death, I almost fell to the floor, laughing. <br /> <br /> Poorly constructed, unthinking, grotesquely heavy, absolutely incredible and full of clumsy dialogues and senseless scenes, this void HAUNTING is a textbook example of how NOT to make a horror movie.
