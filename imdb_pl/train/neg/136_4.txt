*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Are all teens spinning because of the originality drought? It looks terrible. First of all, this is a noble assumption that could be well used. A rejected young gull who is growing up, persecuting and murdering all the girls who tortured him when he was in high school? I can not say you have nothing to do. But this film is going through the same movements as all other recent slashes. Everything, from the result to the angle of the camera, allows us to accurately predict when a false alarm will come and when the killer hits. We already know this pattern. These stupid press videos are increasingly pushing the credential envelope from minute to minute. Let me ask you something: who, in his right mind, will surprise his friend in a dark, grim morgue in the middle of the night and just surprise her in blue when she is alone and surrounded by dead bodies? Does it have any damn sense at all? <br /> <br /> "Valentine" is only sometimes innovative. One good shot is the demolition of Denise Richards. She gets trapped in the pool and the killer punches her with a chainsaw. There are several good songs in the soundtrack, including one nice Orgy song. The music video is in the special functions section on DVD. <br /> <br /> Even acting is mediocre at best. All actors sleep through their roles. Of course, David Boreanaz is often stoic, even in the role of the title character of the "Angel". Denise Richards, however, is a great actress and keeps a stony face throughout the film. <br /> <br /> "Valentine" is exactly what you'd expect: a pretentious, unbelievable, forgotten, bad and fearless view. Do not worry. <br /> <br /> My result: 4 (out of 10)
