I can not believe that this inclined, chauvinistic material is passed on to the Americans as a material of a house of art. At the beginning, with such eloquent lines as "we want to be sure that they are playing for the right band" and manipulative framing and lighting, A Love Divided shows its true face. The stupid manner in which Irish Catholics are portrayed as hegemonic, Protestants as peaceful and oppressed, is just as poor representation of history as early American Western paintings depicting the struggle between cowboys and American Indians. The truth of this story is distorted by the stereotypes and overt denigration of Irish Catholics in history; corruption allowed by the filmmakers themselves! It is sad that today's people still think that they can gain a moral influence, making the film so easily recognized because of the obvious intention, so far from the attempt of art. This movie has no interest in any legal cinema or library.
