Let's start by saying that "JAWANI DIWANI" is simply a pathetic movie. I agree with the last person who said "I missed joy". lol. <br /> <br /> The jokes were just awful. The performances were medium. Something went wrong with this movie. Emraan completely deserved something better. CELINA JAITLEY did everything. Hrishitta bhatt was fine. Emraan hashmi was fine too. <br /> <br /> MANN (EMRAAN HASHMI) is a desperate guy who wants to become famous. that's why he uses RADHA and pretends to love her, just because her father is a musical director and can help him become famous (because his father listens to everything his daughter says). One day MANN and his friends go to GOA to have fun. There he meets ROMA (CELINA JAITLEY) and completely falls in love with his gaze and tries to flirt with his BLA BLA BLA. <br /> <br /> Then ROMA can not open the door to her room that night, and MANN decides to help her. Seeing that he also can not, ROMA asks for help. When it is not there, MANN is able to open the door and decides to go inside and sit on the bed of BLA BLA BLA. ROMA comes in and they have one night. However, in this one night ROMA falls in love with him. This morning they see the world of the underworld (MAHESH) who sees it all. Don loves ROMA and could not stand what he saw. He orders them to get married and, fearing, MANN obeys the order and Merry ROMA. Then their messages about marriage get to the newspaper. MANN later learns that he loves ROMA after recording a music video together. He is now trapped between love and fame. BLA BLA BLA. <br /> <br /> the movie is terrible. The songs "SINI NE SINI NE" are fantastic, and the remix version is even better. "DIL DIWANA" is also great. The title track is also amazing. Guys, avoid watching this movie.
