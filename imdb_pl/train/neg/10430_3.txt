The new BSG has many good things: for example, in models 8 and 6 there are many Cylon roles that both acted brilliantly. There is an old industrial design on Galactice ("My ship will not be connected in a net, over my dead body!"). Also all cosmic battles, special effects (although an experienced science fiction observer will recognize the cartoon character of it all) The darkness of the heroes, their essentially flawed nature. <br /> <br /> The more bitter is that the ending was so childish. <br /> <br /> Yes, the first part, scenes in space, raid on Cylons and everything was very good. But this is a nonsense ending? I always watch movies and show these days with a hidden clock, so I never know how long it lasts until the end. For me, it was a special type of torture to see that the end is taking place over and over again. Every time I thought, oh, this is the last scene, the last shot, I have one more. Each frakking character has its full ending! It was not really necessary. <br /> <br /> What really emphasized the student amateur approach to all this: young scenes of Roslin. Why is it important for us to know that: {a} she lost her sister and father in a terrible accident and {b} she has one evening with a former student / student? What does this bring to history? Where was the connection? Now I am for a European-style approach and accidental acts in movies and programs, and so on, but it was just ridiculous. It did not bring anything significant to this story. <br /> <br /> I also saw "Last Frakkin special", in which Ron revealed his ignorance about the plot: he could not come up with a good ending of the story, so ... he just did not do it! There's never as much about heroes as the last episode. The whole idea "it's been thousands of years in the past", the mitochondrial myth of Eve, was also used in the Guide to hitchhikers around the Galaxy and believe me, there are many BSG observers who know this particular H2G2 story. Speaking of Hera, now there is a plot that was NOT well worked out, IN THE WHOLE. Instead, we get Roslin, who does his ex-student who is 20 years younger. Do not get me wrong, I am for older women with younger men. The more power for them. But that ... it just did not make sense. <br /> <br /> In total (writing) this series is as flawed as its heroes intended. It's even more tiring for the last episode. I hope that Lost and 24 will do better with the finals of the series.
