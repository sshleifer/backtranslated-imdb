We loved the School of Rock and Jack Black. We could not wait to see this movie. It was the only time in my life the movie was so bad that I wanted to leave. My husband hated that too. The only funny parts were in the trailers. My husband and I wanted to stand in front of the cinema and make people save money. Writing was terrible. He had all the terrible stereotypes of Hispanics who should be totally offended. The film was not so long, but for us it seemed like an eternity. The people in the theater were so restless and silent that it looked like dry paint. I made my husband stay because I was sure there would be some salutary parts. Save money and time.
