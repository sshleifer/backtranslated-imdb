If you're under 6 or 7, you'll really like this movie. My youngest daughter is glued to the TV when she watches it. As an adult, I can not stand it! I'm ready for sequels ... when they have a solid storyline. But it does not come close to the standard. Please, forgive me that what I am doing is a children's movie, but when you have to sit in it almost every day, when your children who love so much will understand why. My daughter will watch this movie over and over again the same day, if we let her. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 4 out of 10 only because it gives the youngest entertainment.
