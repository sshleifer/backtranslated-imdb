Imagine the worst sketches from Saturday Night Live and Mad TV in one 90-minute film. Now imagine that all the humor in these bad skits has been removed and replaced by foolishness. Now imagine something 50 times worse. <br /> <br /> Do you have it? <br /> <br /> OK, now go to The Underground Comedy Movie. The vision you just had is going to be the funniest one. UCM is the worst movie I've ever seen. There were a few cheap laughs ... very few. But it was lame. Even if the intent of the movie was to be lame, it was too bad to be funny. <br /> <br /> The only reason I'm not angry for wasting my time watching someone else I know bought him. He wasted his money. Vince Offer has not written or directed anything, and no wonder why.
