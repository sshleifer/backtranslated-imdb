The film was made in 1942, and along with World War II, the film industry decided to take advantage of the fact that the spies were around. <br /> <br /> The movie is cool to watch because of Eleanor Powell's fantastic dance. The late Miss Powell was certainly a great copter in every sense of the word. Again it is paired with the very young-looking Red Skelton. They also performed in "I Dood It." <br /> <br /> Moroni Olsen, who 3 years later was wonderful, because the interrogating policeman in "Mildred Pierce" reappears as an officer asking Powell to deliver an item. The problem is that Olsen and his rogues are really Japanese spies. <br /> <br /> Bert Lahr is his usual genius yoker here and he gets a lot of support from Virginia O'Brien.
