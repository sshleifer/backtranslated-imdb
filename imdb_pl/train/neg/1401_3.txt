Someone mentioned editing. This is poorly edited, and what began as quite intriguing has become an unintelligible mess. For a start, let us know what you are trying to do with these experiments. Why are these people the best choice for the type of experiment in which they are involved? And what exactly are they testing? Apparently there is a great plan that an agency intends to use. Acting is very bad. Everyone is exciting. Everyone keeps secrets. They often mention that if it was not for money, they would suspend it. There is a mad minister who writes the scriptures. Still. But again, the biggest suspension is the lack of establishing the playing field for the actors. There are a few really bad items. These little rooms and those chaise longues. This awful wallpaper (was it wallpaper?). It was interesting, but it was nowhere.
