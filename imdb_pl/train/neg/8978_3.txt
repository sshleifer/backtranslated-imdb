If John Waters wrote and directed "House of 1000 Corpses" after repeatedly hitting the head with a heavy object, the result would probably be something like "The Blood Shed". For the first half hour it is slightly funny, but then it goes into something like an endless scream of constant screams, and people make each other's genitals with electric scissors, cutlery and tongs. Susan Adriensen (Sno Cakes) is incredibly annoying, and Terry West (Elvis Bullion) is almost as bad in what he does in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> Maybe the best thing about "The Blood Shed" is that most viewers will not forget about it for a long time.
