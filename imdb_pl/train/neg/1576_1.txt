this movie has everything; skillful camera work, reminiscent of martin scorcese or oliver stone, tight action of "heat", explosive action of jerry bruckheimer, witty dialogue tarantino and epic mood of "godfather" <br /> <br /> judge reinhold shows a fiery temperature, but also it shows true emotional depth and intensity. his performance reminds me of the portrait of Jake la Motta robert de niro in a raging bull. <br /> <br /> action scenes are truly breathtaking, not from the time when bullit has a movie showing such high octane, but stylish car scenes. Special effects push the boundaries of technology and create movies to the limit. The Independence Day set a standard that clearly fits the film, and far exceeded it. <br /> <br /> In general, great acting from the list (like a list of invitations to the oscars night party!), Classic locations, catchy action, and a tight scenario.
