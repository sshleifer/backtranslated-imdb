It was not a well made western. You have that walnut riding in the buggy with an umbrella in the blazing sun, killing people for your own reasons. You have the same person sitting in a snowy cave during a blizzard, cutting off pieces of his anatomy that have been thawed. Then you have a woman in the middle of the house, shooting wolves who are not there. What is the meaning of this movie? Could Bruce Dern find something better? It was a waste of film.
