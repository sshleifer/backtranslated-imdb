Oh Dear, Jerry may be the undisputed king of talkshow, but movies are a completely different ball game and he is out of league. The screenplay for this movie is so poor that you have to believe it and is sad to see such little-known actors as Michael Dudikoff (action from the 80s? B'movie king), Michael Jai White (Last seen on the flop of Sci Fi "Spawn" ) and Surviving the Games' William MacNamara (who takes part in the only half of the funny situation in the whole movie!) He leans so low to take a job. If you're a fan of Jerry, stick to his TV show, because it's a total waste and an hour and a half. After I finished sitting, I managed to catch the last half hour of Rocky 5 on TV, which in comparison to the movie looked like a masterpiece, I think it says more than enough !!! <br /> <br />
