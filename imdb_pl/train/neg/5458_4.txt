This film is a pathetic attempt to justify the actions of Mary Ann Letourneau. To do this, they threw a 19-year-old girl, probably not "to do it". They could not have cast a boy at the age of 12 or 13 in any way, because love scenes would push everyone out (if they were even allowed to do it) - as they should. Boy Mary Ann was my nephew's age, making her a pedophile. Sixth grade, people. The pedophile definition does not have to include many children - one thing is enough. <br /> <br /> I really do not care about her upbringing or unhappy marriage. She had a duty to her students that she could not match. The reason is that she is bipolar, she rejected the diagnosis and refused to take her medication. It is understandable that she did not think rationally. We hope that he understands his actions now. <br /> <br /> Now that she and Vili are married and have two children together, I pray that she would be on medication and think clearly. <br /> <br /> In addition, Penelope Ann Miller was completely persuasive and perfectly committed to the role.
