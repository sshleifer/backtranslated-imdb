What can be said about the grainy, poorly filmed 16 mm deer film, in which the best and most attractive contractor is the German Shepherd? Nothing that would be positive. Avoid this parody at all costs. In any case, it would be difficult to find, because bestiality remains taboo and illegal in the US. I strongly suggest that IMDb revisit its weighting formula for rating, because an 8.8 score for this piece of feces is absurd! I am by no means pruder and spent many hours enjoying classic porn films from the 70's and 80's; however, this product is worse even in the case of looser (then illegal) stag loop.
