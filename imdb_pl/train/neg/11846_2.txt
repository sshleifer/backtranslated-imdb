After watching this movie, I complained to my local cinema about the quality of the soundtrack or whether the cinema sound system may be faulty. At least in the first half of the movie it is extremely difficult to understand what someone is saying because of the background music and scratching the soundtrack. I was ready to blame the cinema equipment, but it was not like that - it was the director. <br /> <br /> I was told that the subject of my complaint is an essential part of making a movie. Music and sound were to be distorted to create a very disturbing effect in the film. Nowadays, directors will do everything to make their movie special. Unfortunately, regardless of where and how you see this movie, the sound result will be the same. <br /> <br /> So apart from the historical inaccuracies of this movie (which you can find out for yourself elsewhere), the soundtrack of distortion itself is a good reason to give this movie a longing. You will hear only a distorted scratching of the soundtrack, and certainly not the meowing of a cat.
