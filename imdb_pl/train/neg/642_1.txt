First of all, if you're a comic fan, well, you'll be very disappointed, I'm sure! Low budget movie !!! Largo is supposed to be a Serbian in a comic, now he suddenly becomes Croatian, pfff! chicken producers, they gave some comics and spices (in the movie his father speaks Serbian and speaks Croatian ... Lol). A striking building of N.Y. Winch becomes a common average small yacht in H.K. A good-looking Largo becomes an unshaven guy with a Tzigan / Turk. Freddy, a cool "scarface" pilot, becomes fat, unruly, sad, average. Simon, good buddy Largo, does not exist at all !? He gave me a little pepper! Largo does not throw knives at all, but only some snake stares ... The whole story is confused and looks like a pretentious TV movie. French directors and producers, if you do not have the money, the ability or the technology to properly adapt the comic book, stick to some romance shot in Paris. A very bad movie, a good thing I have just rented, do not count on me that I will watch the sequel (if it is!).
