He had all the stereotypes of this type of movie and no content. The plot is nowhere to be found and at the end of the movie I felt like a sucker to watch. The production was good; however, the script and action were the quality of the film B. Casting was weak, because there were good actors confused with crumby actors. Good actors did not have any, and others did not pick up. <br /> <br /> This movie is not worth more words, but I will say more to meet the minimum ten-line requirement. James Wood and Cuba Gooding, Jr. they play caricatures of themselves in other movies. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for mindless entertainment, I would still not recommend the movie.
