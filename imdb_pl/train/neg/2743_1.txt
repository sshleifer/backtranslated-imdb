I must admit that I did not finish this film because it was incredibly stupid and it is not worth watching. I watched him in a room full of kids who also did not laugh at stupid and raw humor. The director, Bob Dolman, seems to be so obsessed with sphincter and genitalia that he replaces the real story in which I grew up. THIS IS NOT A GOOD FILM FOR CHILDREN! Aside from the fact that the content is so primitive, the movie is simply stupid, has a bad flow and has no intelligence behind it. What a waste of a perfectly good story. If you read a book when you were younger and loved it, do not waste time watching a movie that will make it so tired that it makes you angry. Instead, buy a book for children.
