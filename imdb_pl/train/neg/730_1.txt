I did not see the first movie and if it does not have much desire. <br /> <br /> Having just watched this a few hours ago, I try to remember that. <br /> <br /> From what I remember, the main thread seems to be a group of very annoying people who stay at home with this suspicious old lady on Friday 13 and are persecuted by a wooden board. <br /> <br /> Some people die, the movie ends, I start a lawsuit against the person who sold this movie to me because I want compensation for the missing time in my life. <br /> <br /> I'll pay you 1 pound for taking this movie from my hands ...... wait, I've already given it to my "friend".
