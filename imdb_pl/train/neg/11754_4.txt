I must admit that I am a big fan of this program, so you must know how disappointed I was when I watched this movie. First of all, the story was awful, I thought it would be something more interesting, for example to see what happened to Arnold's fathers, or something more interesting, but NOOOOOOO, maniac wants to destroy Arnold's house, among many other places, so many people try to stop. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that the story was not so bad, but what really sucked was the steps that Arnold and his friends are doing to stop this maniac, become spy friends; they travel by bus (based on video games, for God's sake), and what's worse, they make super moves on the bus, things that many people have already tried and died, but not Arnold, Gerald and Helga, because they are video game experts. <br /> <br /> To be honest, my mother, my sister, even I was very disappointed after watching this movie because it was the worst way to finish a really good cartoon. I must admit I used to like "Hey Arnold!", It was one of my favorite cartoons on Nickelodeon, but after this messy movie I'm not sure if I'll watch "Hey Arnold!". as I once saw it in the past. <br /> <br /> Besides Nickelodeon, with this huge number of dynamites, I can assure you that no straight street will explode, I think the whole city can explode this, oh, and please, if all your future movies from good cartoons are , do not make more movies, you give a bad critic to cartoons that were once good. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I think it was the worst way to end this concert, a good show turned into this shitty movie.
