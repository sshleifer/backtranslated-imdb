I saw my participation in badly thought out endings and final turns to movies, but I do not recall any movie that would commit suicide like this. <br /> <br /> The creators of the film hoped that the great phrase "will surprise" us all ... and it did, but maybe not in the way the directors hoped. I felt surprised that Connery, Harris, Fishburn and Capshaw had something to do with this turkey, individually or collectively. <br /> <br /> The movie for the last thirty minutes was rather addictive and I like the way in which history evolved and the nature of the film in general. But when the turn of the action came out, the holes in the story and the inconsistencies were extraordinary, the motive underlying revenge was badly conceived, and the manner in which things so carefully worked out for Bobby Earl were ridiculously strained. What's worse, after revealing the returns the rest of the film has become extremely predictable. <br /> <br /> Harris gave a great performance, and Connery is like Morgan Freeman, because he never gives bad results, even if the movie is not so great! In summary, everything starts well and the development makes the viewer interested. The last 30 minutes is one of the most memorable nose dives in cinema history.
