It's the most boring, worthless piece of shit I've ever wasted in the hour of my life. All I can say is thank God that it's been an hour. More than half of this "film" is material from the original "Criminally Insane". At least I was able to see the most important elements of this rare classic use, because for some opposing realities my video shop only has "Criminally Insane II" (as it was, "Crazy Fat Ethel II"). But the rest of the movie is one of the absolute worst home movies and movies in the yard you'll ever see. Why does my video store have it, not the original? Why do these things really go to video stores? Why do people rent her and not immediately burn a copy when they see her plain horror? Why? or the character repeatedly stabbed to the side (do not ask) or monologues murdering brain cells about giving poisoned tea to his wife, and then complaining that the whole conversation made her own tea cooled or delayed eating the fly soup or just want to see Crazy Fat Ethel dancing with a bloody knife in the garden: do not watch this movie. Repeat: DO NOT watch this movie. Do not rent this movie. If possible, do not walk past the shelf in the video store with a copy of this movie setting. You can still be saved, but it's too late for me. . .
