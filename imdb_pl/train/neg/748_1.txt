I love movies and will watch every movie all the time to give it a chance. In the end, I can say that I found a movie that I can not watch all the time. Acting is terribly outdated and monotonous, CGI looks like a computer maniac doing it in the basement of his mother with minimal software and ..... long scenes ... walking !!!! And this movie is THREE HOURS LONG !!! I did not do it for 15 minutes until I turned the DVD over quickly. The alien scenes are very short. Ummm, instead of calling this "War of the Worlds", let's call it "The War of Long Distances." It costs 5 million dollars! What are the money for, the dramatic opening song? <br /> <br /> Oh, but with a positive attitude, one scene you have to watch is when the aliens start killing people. It's funny, not because people are dying, but because when they turn to skeletons they still sway for 20 seconds. <br /> <br /> So ... as I said, if you're a fan of nausea, out-of-date, action-free movies, here's one of the DVD collections. But I did not write it for you, I wrote it for billions of other people who hate this movie. It's not worth your time or money. <br /> <br /> I know it's a book, but the book is not that long and I'm a complete book of robaka / nerd / geek / whatever, but why? Download Steven Spielberg's version, that's not all, but it's 10 times better than this !! <br /> <br /> I give it a BIG, FAT ZERO of 10.
