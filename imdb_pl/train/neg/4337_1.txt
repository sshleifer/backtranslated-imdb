This is simply the massacre of the great story of Edwin Torres. This film does not follow the plot of the book. And there are so many incompatibilities with the original movie that you have to wonder if the screenwriter even saw the first movie. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino (original and still the best Carlito) leaves the prison in the beginning of the original. Here Carlito leaves with her woman in paradise. <br /> <br /> What happened to Gail from Lorain, Ohio? In this part, there is no mention of her, and Carlito retires and probably marries another girl. <br /> <br /> Where is Kleinfeld? I think he was in the first book. <br /> <br /> I also like Mr. Guzman playing a completely different character in this film. In Pacino's time he was Pachanga. Now he is Nacho Reyes, an assassin from Cuba. I remember that Nacho Reyes had a much bigger role in the book. <br /> <br /> It's been some time since I read the book, but where does Sean Comba come from? I also think that this movie really revolves around racial tensions in Harlem, which Torres wrote about. And the rabble does not get the treatment they did in the book. They are also erased in this movie. But magically, the Pleasant Avenue group is near the second movie. <br /> <br /> The book told a great story. This movie could tell a great story. It is a huge disappointment. Read a book. Make better use of your time.
