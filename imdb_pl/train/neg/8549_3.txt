Okay, what the hell did you watch TRASH now? "The Mountain of Witches" must be one of the most inconsistent and crazy Spanish exploitation films, and at the same time it is strangely persuasive. There is absolutely nothing here that would make sense, and I doubt that there would ever be a script to work, but somehow I could not turn it off. Scratching the head with confusion begins right away, with the initial sequence of an angry little girl who killed her mother's cat. So you think this movie revolves around children possessed by evil forces? Heck no, because after this introduction the girl and her wickedness are no longer mentioned. Then go to the guy with the most impressively trimmed mustache you'll ever see, who breaks up with his girlfriend in a somewhat un-subtle way. When he asks him to spend holidays with her, he immediately calls his employer, asking him to give him any kind of task! Great traffic. The film finally begins now when it travels to a secluded mountain area to photograph some of the peaks. Though not before, he picked up a new girl (Patty Shepard) and photographs her topless! There are strange events throughout the journey, which ?? you guessed ?? they are never explained. The girl wakes up in the middle of the forest, loud, petrified music plays everywhere and someone even steals a jeep! Really, car lifts? Apparently the owls of the silent witches are the owners of the mountains and practicing voodoo on intruders. It is as close as I describe the story, but is there a good chance that I will leave? The atmosphere is more important here! "Witch Mountain" is sometimes very scary, with its terrible music and interesting photos. Supporting characters look amazing, and thrilling Patty Shepard plays a good heroine. This is a European horror story that could be legendary if only somebody took the trouble to write a script.
