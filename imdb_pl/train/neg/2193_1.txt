A girl with dementia is headless, so she brings her head back to life. Honestly, this is the plot of the movie. She tries to get another body for her, which she will search in the dingy area of ​​the city, looking for the perfect body. For some reason, he has an ugly monster in a closet in his cabin. Sleaze-style film is funny. Nobody in the movie can work, including the head. The monster in the closet is a man with a mask and you can really say that. The plot is slow, weak, and the ending is so badly done. Watch the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version of this move. Believe me, I would not watch this movie alone.
