Bad plot (though good for B movie), good fight scenes at a fast pace, at most 5 out of 10. But something always bothered me in this movie: how did it happen that Mariska Hargitay never talks? In the television version, he shares a few intimate moments with Jeff Speakman and even a kiss in the garden. However, in the regular version (video) most of her scenes are cut out and she never speaks at all. It worries me because it not only draws a feminine (though cliched) point of view from the film, but also makes the final shot seem frightening. This movie would be better if they kept their scenes because at least in these scenes he has a personality that undercuts everything that Speakman says.
