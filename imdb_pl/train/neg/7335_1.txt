This is probably the worst version of the play I've seen - a few times on the stage outside the movie. <br /> <br /> A very nice idea for the setting - the American South can provide a reliable background for the extreme round of alleged Hero offense. <br /> <br /> But the execution! Widdoes is a very raised Beatrice, which gives particularly poor results. Waterston, a great actor, is not much better than Benedykt. <br /> <br /> Don John has the worst performance - he makes Keanu Reeves look good. Perhaps the desire to make it a caricature like a villain who attaches a virgin to the railroad track, fits the keystone kops with Dogberry Capers and his people - but acting makes you want to cower. <br /> <br /> Successful settings include a scene in which they cheat Benedict to believe that Beatrice loves him - would competent acting be wonderful. But the use of the river and the visual humor of Benedict, who is approaching, are well-produced. <br /> <br /> Generally I had to force myself to watch, but it certainly did not catch my attention. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing. <br /> <br /> Regarding the last comments above, I am almost 40 years old. I watch Shakespeare's stage and screen productions for over 2 decades. Can I suggest that when you try to defend your friends, you talk to the song, and do not attack other reviewers when you are so inadequately armed in fact. However, I can assume that because of your distaste associated with youth, you are in a sufficient age in which the submissive behavior of the days past more suits your taste. <br /> <br /> My favorite couple was Rylance and McTeer on the stage in London. Unlike Widdoes, McTeer, a skilled and charismatic performer, can work.
