Extremely funny musical comedy that artificially tries to marry a breakthrough rock'n'roll explosion with the sensitivity of a suburban classic to the middle class. The effect is noisy, outdated mish-mash, which will not satisfy any of the audience who followed the music, but at least it will keep its parents in fullness. <br /> <br /> A quick look at a promotional video about the subject of the back of the video should give you a picture of the content. Tom Ewell is a drunk agent, full of such small comical skills that you almost expect him to roar, "hello my love, I'm home!" Blurb places him as "so funny in" The 7 Year Itch "". It sounds almost like an excuse. What other movie would sell to the fact that the leading player was good at something else? It sounds like this: "So funny in" The 7 Year Itch "... but it is in this trash". <br /> <br /> Mansfield, a beautiful girl with rumors about a 50-inch estate, is unfortunately a bargain basement Monroe with all the acting abilities and comical time of rotting haddock. Its wooden delivery combined with the OTW Ewella double series makes it a comedy from Hell. For his part, he sells us: "[Jayne Mansfield], whose more obvious talents are the cause of many of the biggest laughs in the movie!" As you can see, the film sold with the thought that its lead has a large chest is not the most sophisticated. Most of this "humor" is that people literally fall over, their glasses break in Mansfield's place, etc. Only the Freudian nightmare of a full bottle of milk casts doubt on his "U" certificate. <br /> <br /> For the music side, the most adenine players are selected. Would you really like to see how Eddie Fontaine offers: "I love your eyes, I love your lips, taste even better than potato chips" in the song "Cool It, Baby"? Only the burning Little Richard leaves the MOR, but is forced to sing some of his more father-friendly songs in a four-minute sequence. And why do all acts sing without a single microphone? The satire attempt in the industry is wide and childish in their concept. <br /> <br /> From a technical point of view the picture was quite advanced, with special effects (including similar to ghosts Julie London) and deluxe colors (which now looks flat and In fact, with red spots and artificially-looking shades of the body, resembles a colored film). However, the direction is not outstanding, and the sound quality is also quite poor. <br /> <br /> Maybe it comes down to being so old. A time when men were still smoking on the screen, disagreeably lovely actors made adult comments, and black servants cooked and danced. (All this is happening here). Yet Some Like It Hot, African Queen, Ben Hur and many, many more are examples of films from this period that can be admired today, so the "good at this time" argument does not really arise. Deep in the heart, the girl can not help. It's a cynical and condescending undertaking that is not under strict control. 4/10. <br /> <br />
