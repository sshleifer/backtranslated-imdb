A manipulative drama about a charming model (Margaux Hemingway), raped by a cool but unbalanced musician (Chris Sarandon) - whom she was introduced by her younger sister (played by siblings Mariel), of which she is a music teacher. While the central court action draws attention - mainly due to the impressive role of Anne Bancroft as a lawyer for Hemingway - the film is all too often shiny, but also dramatically unconvincing: the jury allegedly takes the side of the musician because a) girl invited the sensual character of her profession to attack and b) did not set resistance to her alleged aggressor when her sister came to the apartment and accidentally saw a couple in bed together. What the hell***?!; was clearly connected - what resistance could realistically offer? <br /> <br /> The second half of the film - involving the rape of Sarandon's sister, who with curiosity predicts IRREQUENCY (2002) appearing in the tunnel - is rather imaginary: Mariel should know better than trust Sarandon for what he did to her sister, but Margaux herself goes unreasonably back to work, which indirectly led to her humiliating experience almost immediately! The climax - in which Sarandon gets her own desserts, and Margaux suddenly turns into a fearless and resourceful eve - but it is the pleasure of the crowd in the style of DEATH OF JEWY (1974); By the way, the ubiquitous Italian film mogul, Dino De Laurentiis, was behind both films. <br /> <br /> It is worth noting that the two lives of the Hemingway sisters took on very different turns (it was a film debut of both): Margaux's career never took off (despite her undeniable good looks and commendable participation here) - while Mariel she was soon nominated for an Oscar for MANHATTAN Woody Allen (1979) and, interestingly, she played a wonderful victim of rampant violence when she assessed the role of Dorothy Stratten's real play "Playboy" in Bob Fosse's THE STAR (1983). With the added pressure of several failed marriages, Margaux took refuge in alcohol and eventually died of drug overdose in 1996; Chilling Hemingway's family had a history of suicide - especially the grandfather of the sisters, the well-known author Ernest, who died of his gunshot wound in 1961.
