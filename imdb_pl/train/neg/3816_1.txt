He has very bad acting. Bad stories. Bad characters. You should never watch this program if you see it. TURN IT OFF. Or you'll cringe for another 30 minutes. It should never be broadcast. This is not great. You should never see it. NEVER EVER. So if you want to watch this program, please do not. Please refer to THE CW for Smallville. Or Disney Channel for Hannah Montana, Wizards Of Waverly Place or Nick for Drake & Josh, These are much better family shows. So believe me, I watched it before. And to be honest, I'm honest, the worst program I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of television. So do me a favor and never watch this program.
