I admit - Emma, ​​in my opinion, is one of the greatest novels ever written. It is as close to perfection as any mortal creature can be. Jane Austen achieves the summit of her art here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is palimpsest at best. <br /> <br /> A comparison with the version of Gwyneth Paltrow is inevitable - this version is much more faithful to the witty spirit of the book and much nicer to watch. <br /> <br /> There are some good elements here - Kate Berkinsale (formerly playing Flora Poste in Cold Comfort Farm, clearly more intelligent spiritual twin Emma) is a wonderful Emma. Raymond Coulthard creates appropriately decorative Frank Churchill. The production is handsome, but the interior is too dark. <br /> <br /> However, there are some serious problems. The first of these is Mark Strong - firstly, it does not suit Mr. Knightley. Perhaps because he plays the role of a censor Victorian priest. He is ill-tuned. <br /> <br /> The second problem is long. Simply put, the film is much too short - it would have to be twice as long to get the right style. <br /> <br /> Finally, and most importantly, the quality of adaptation. Austen is the dream of the adapter - the whole dialogue already exists. You just need to cut and arrange accordingly. Andrew Davies seems to think differently. First of all, it's a pretty gloomy movie, and the last thing Emma should be is grim. More importantly, Davies thought it appropriate to rewrite the end as something like a bucolic feast. Which planet or smaller work of Thomas Hardy does he come from? It is completely devoid of the style and spirit of the novel. And I believe that trying to improve - perfection is extremely arrogant. <br /> <br /> Watch the Paltrow version or watch Kate at Cold Comfort Farm.
