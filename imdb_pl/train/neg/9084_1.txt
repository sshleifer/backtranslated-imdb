It was the worst movie I've ever seen! Molly (molly hall) could not work EVERYTHING! she did not have any emotions, it was all blah blah blah as she read from a boring book. An intelligent child and kid who loves food (names there were not worth remembering) were so annoying that they were driving me crazy. Mollys Dad did not show enough emotion about the disappearance of her daughter. The policeman and father Mollys said the same thing four times. it was just awful. Everything was repeated very often. Beatrice should have seen her something bad for being so mean. I just wasted my life watching this movie!
