I love these actors, but they have been wasted in this movement. <br /> <br /> I can only wonder what they thought, agreeing to this nonsense ?? in; Dennis Quaid and Arliss Howard were caricatures. Some thought it was deep. Well, if you liked "Breaking the Waves", you'll probably like it too. I hated both. 3/10
