I watched "Envy" two nights ago on DVD at a friend's house. The message of this movie is quite promising, Jack Black and Ben Stiller in a comedy with great potential, but they do not pursue it completely. I watched him with five friends and no one laughed at the whole movie. Jokes (which are few) are NOT fun in any way ... the story is nonsense, and they never answer the question ... WHERE SH * T GO? Of course, the answer to this question is NOT TO BE DONE. This film lacks any comedy value, and as several other users have said, the only thing that makes it even worth watching is Christopher Walken as J-man. None of the characters is developed, the threads are so thin that they are almost transparent - and should this song be fun in the whole movie?
