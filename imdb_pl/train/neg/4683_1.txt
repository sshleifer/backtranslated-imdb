As an underwater submarine, it was one of the worst underwater movies I've ever seen. Above all, the rebellion aboard any American naval ship, especially a submarine with a nuclear-powered trident, is unthinkable. These men are the best of the best and are devoted to their mission. The responsibility they carry is incredible and takes it very seriously, from the captain to the youngest member of the crew. I have never seen a crew of any ship that would share its alliance between the captain and the executive director. The executive director, who acted as a character played by Denzel Washington, would be released from duty and Court Martialed, and then drummed with the Navy. No wonder the navy refused to send a technical adviser who would help in making this movie. Finally, if any member of the crew of the submarine makes noise on this ship, he will be seriously reprimanded. Submariners learn at the beginning of their careers as silently as possible to avoid detection. They do not slam the door or even speak softly and wear soft shoes in the sole. I was amazed at how loud they were presenting the crew during the trip. Loud music would never be tolerated. I know that submitting underwater life would not actually sell cinema tickets, but it is too painful. I do not recommend this movie to anyone.
