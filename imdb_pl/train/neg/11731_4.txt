As for me, this silent version of the Merry Widow is the worst version in history. In this version, there is no tenderness, neither love nor spirituality, it is all macabre, Germanic, sinister nonsense. It reminded me of love Nazis; who cares? <br /> <br /> This silent version of von Stroheim is not a faithful adaptation of the original story. In this book, we're dealing with John Gilbert and his abomination towards the prince lusting after this stupid American actress, played by Mae Murray, possessed by a modern hairstyle and an incredible feminist way that threw me over and over again. I like my love and light romances with slow building; not sharp and sadistic like this one. And come on, those bees have baked their mouths, get rid of them, girl! <br /> <br /> Go see the live show, if you want to get a real idea of ​​the sweetness of the original operetta Franz Lehar. Otherwise, wait for the TCM to show the sound version of Jeanette MacDonald - Maurice Chevalier. It's much better.
