We have an average family. Dad is a famous rapper, we have a "rebellious teenage daughter", an adopted white kid and a lovely little child. And we have a careless maid, what kind of show did the maid show? Do we have brady bunch broken? Yes! When it first came out, I thought it was really cool, mainly because I was young. The music was bad. The rapids were so bad and they were too appreciated. All his raps concerned his family, friends and problems. Dad was a kind of dad "Danny from Full House". I always gave advice. But he was not a pure freak. They had a host for it. Remember? The plot was basically Lil 'Romeo had some trouble, or ... that was not the point. Oh, and maybe some preteen drama. Yes, that's good. Not quite. But it is still a good program for children. But Nikelodean could do better.
