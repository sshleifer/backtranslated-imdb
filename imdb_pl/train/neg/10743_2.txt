This film is really bad, with a script full of "unforgettable" lines and incredibly bad performances. The special effects are also bad (not the worst I've seen), and the music is so bad that you have to listen to it to believe it. Only two short motifs (lasting about 30 seconds) are repeated throughout the entire movie. <br /> <br /> In total one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
