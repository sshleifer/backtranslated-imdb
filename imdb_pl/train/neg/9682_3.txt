To overcome the death of his wife, an old man does what everybody would do in his natural way (at least in Peter Greenaway's movie): he and his son populate their home with eight and a half (one has no legs) women set off in a sexual odyssey. It's a Greenaway movie, there are a lot of pretentious and uninteresting blabberings and of course there's no need for male nudity. In fact, father and son share a sleeping bed naked. Disgusting. Besides, who wants to see an old guy full of frontals? For those who are not on the homo-erotic scene, one of the women likes to do nasty horses. There is no history - only a random collection of boring scenes.
