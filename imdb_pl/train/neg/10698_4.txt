Darkling was a very interesting and entertaining movie, while F. Murray Abraham was in it. Spoilers: About half past F. Murray is spoiled because Darkling is a kind of demonic creature who likes to live vicariously. He takes tramps and losers and distorts them further, giving them everything they want when it comes to success. He feeds on their joy of the seven deadly sins. However, some of them involve getting people who may be defective, but not completely evil. Otherwise, he can not "distort" their natural kindness. That's what a little guy in his voice, Barry White, thought I was charming and funny. Mostly fun. How do I imagine Barry White if he was a little dwarf and he told Aiden Gillen, "Dee Plane, Dee Plane, Bos, Here eet come, Dee Plane!" Throughout the movie, Dee Dwarf (actually a robotic cherub) talks to Aiden Gillen in Barry White's voice, saying things like "It's okay to be bad, you know you want it." "Now you've committed a murder, you're really moving around in the world" and other comments that sound like "Being Evil" Stores or something like that. This is really fun in a sick way. <br /> <br /> In any case, Aiden Gillen is not F. Murray Abraham, but film tanks, as soon as Murray gets an ax (or a knife?). F. Murray brings a certain happy hostility to his role in this film. He is a good actor. On the other hand, Aiden Gillen has a steady smile on her face and looks like she can remedy an English comp. the class has never hit the mythological characters and could not imagine what the film is about. ENDING is really scary and yet almost comical. If this movie was a travesty, the ending was perfect. If it was not a parody, it was terrible; but a cheap way of using a little girl to provide an abomination that the movie itself could not provide. The people who created this movie lost everything they wanted to do with it before the end. It just ends as if they realized they were running out of money and had to film a quick ending.
