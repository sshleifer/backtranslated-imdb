Watching "Speak Easily" is painful for Buster Keaton fans. Seeing such a phenomenal writer, actor, comic, director and stunter subjected to this humiliating spectacle is like watching Picasso used as a droplet fabric, or perhaps more like seeing the best Camembert adulterated with whey bodies and processed into Cheez-Whiz. <br /> <br /> Keaton is poorly manned as Professor Post, whose obscure vocabulary is the only thing that keeps him from saying, "Tell me about rabbits, George." (Post would say something like: "Please, kindly inform me about the status of small mammals in the Leporidae family of the Lagomorpha family, kind ladies, which I think is mainly addressed to the" George "epithet.) When Keaton created his own characters, they may not have concepts, but they were not stupid. They quickly studied and became masters of their worlds. Not so with a Fast that never stops stumbling and tripping, and who has no more control over his destiny than a Titanic bilge rat. And while the original characters of Keaton had enchanting naivety and innocence, Post is such a deep sexual delay that if he was ever physically aroused, he would put an ice bag on the swelling and look for medical help. <br /> <br /> There are a few small, redeeming moments, such as Keaton's attempts to get rid of vampire Themy Todd or his suggestion for a proper dress for Greek dance, but it's just not worth it to endure the whole movie to see them. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of bad movies, get drunk and watch "Speak Easy" with friends, and the la Mystery Science Theater 3000. But stay silent besides. Let them be 100% of what Buster Keaton remembered for.
