I did not expect it to be a great movie, but I did not expect it to be so horrible. I hated my mother form so much that I had to turn the channel. I turned it over, hoping it was just one part of the movie, but no. And for her daughter to sit down there, she feels embarrassed or almost finished work or led to madness in her own home? Are you joking? I was raised to respect my mother (and even to be afraid), but I quickly put her in the nearest hotel, if he proves it in MY home. In the end, I expected that I would follow the rules in my mother's house. <br /> <br /> I did not buy any. I tried to give him a few opportunities, really. Excuse me.
