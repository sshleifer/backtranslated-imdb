I was also cheated by the packaging. I also fell in love with the bloody packaging and DVD case, which claims that it "saddened the fans because every copy was pulled out of the shelves." Although it was inexpensive (6.99 USD), it was not really worth it - without fear and a very limited gore. The ending was very cheesy and did not provide the blow that should have. I really do not even know what happened to "Video Nasty" with how tame it is. History stretches, characters are obvious amateur actors ... they do not fulfill their promise. The DVD bonus feature ("interview") is very strange because the director seems very inconsistent, not everything. The main actress says she appears in Shakespeare's production. It's a great laugh.
