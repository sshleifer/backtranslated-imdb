I really have to say that I could not stop watching this movie from the moment it was started. Just for how bad it was !!! It's a bit like watching dry paint was much more confusing. I mean, you are sitting there and waiting for something to happen, anything in reality, preferably something that will make the whole movie make sense! At the end of the movie, I actually sat, wondering if there was any chance that I missed the first hour that explained everything or whether I unintentionally fainted during the movie and missed the parts that stuck the plot (if there was one) together! The main thing that really confused me in this movie is almost the end of the main girl (if she really was the main girl) in some alternative reality, I mean, what the hell was going on here ?! she suddenly woke up and found herself in a psychiatric institute, chained to bed stoned by doctors or something like that, and then faster than it would take to cut my wrists, she turned and was eaten by some random vampire! It did not make sense! I am tempted to send an e-mail to the creators and demand my time, I mean that I wasted 2 hours of my life watching this junk! It seemed to me that someone edited all the bits that could make it make sense, although I think the movie would have to last four hours! I am on the side of the second person who wrote the second review, I was deceived in a kingly title, and myself. I'm just so grateful I did not buy the movie, no matter how many times I saw him in the local pound store. One would think that it would give me a clue that the movie was a complete bunch of steaming movie trash, but to be honest, I think 1 pound is too much money for this movie !!!! what a terrible waste of time and a good razor, I mean, I wish you OD, it's less painful than watching this movie !!!!
