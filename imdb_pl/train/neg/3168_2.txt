I had to turn it off after about 15 horrible moments ... <br /> <br /> I was hoping it could improve, <br /> <br /> What I saw was poorly preserved, directed and written. > <br /> This movie should never even be released directly on DVD. <br /> <br /> The main character, who is the fianc√© of HELL, is wearing a huge ice sculpture that kills her. She was such a hideous person that I did not even regret. She walks up there in some heaven, and was still repulsive, I left soon after. <br /> <br /> Ewa Longoria portrays her and I hope that I will never see her again, she can not even act. Irritating. <br /> <br /> Paul Rudd, an actor who normally can not do anything bad, was also in this bagpipe. <br /> <br /> Jason Biggs (no longer a teenager) is also present, <br /> <br /> I like comedies, but not stupid about fools. <br /> <br /> Mark: * (out of 4) 30 points (out of 100) IMDb 2 (out of 10)
