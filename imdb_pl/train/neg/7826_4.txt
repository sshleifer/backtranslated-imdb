Special effects? Good. <br /> <br /> Script? Horrible. No plot. No depth. Irrelevant. This movie made Superman a hero without meaning, a hero without an archetype. In the original film, he represented America in the Cold War. Here he represented only Hulk. <br /> <br /> Of course, the actors were doing well. Kevin Spacey was a good choice, among others. <br /> <br /> It still does not solve the problem that this movie had no depth. I do not see how anyone can go with something significant from this movie, when Superman was and is created daily to be a significant hero not only in comics, but also in the minds of people. It was a real waste of money, considering how many directions this movie could take. <br /> <br /> Just a few examples: Lex Luthor could be the villain of global corporatism, political domination, totalitarianism, and more. He was the next incarnation of Hackman in goofball. <br /> <br /> And Superman? Why did he stand in this movie? Nothing else but a "savior". <br /> <br /> Wait until you get to the dollar theater, if you see it at all.
