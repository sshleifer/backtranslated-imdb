I knew it would be so, but I gave her rent for a bit of laughter and perhaps mindless fun. Anyone who has read a few of my reviews can see that I like them easily. I really did not think it would end with this negative feeling. <br /> <br /> The story is about an ancient army of dragons led by a huge snake that will destroy the world, unless the chosen heroes who inherit responsibility can ?? become one of? good dragon? or something?? I do not know. It was so stupid that I did not bother to keep it. <br /> <br /> Contains a really stupid story full of absurd moments and unwise concepts. So many events were simply accidental and sudden. <br /> <br /> I assume that there have been disturbances in the studio or something like that because the biggest problem I have with this movie is that history seems to be so great and epic, but everything happens so fast and it passes so quickly. I feel that I just hit a million points and action sequences in one big ball. The film is like a blow to the face. Establishing a character or drama does not take much time. Imagine the Lord of the Rings trilogy in 90 minutes? You could have most of the epic battles, but there would be absolutely no complications and it would be difficult to take care of the outcome of these battles. That was the case with Dragon Wars? 90 minutes of not giving me nonsense, waiting for it to end. <br /> <br /> Fantastic CGI game with some good direction, but horrible acting, quick stimulation and silly story made it very difficult to enjoy for any reason. I would probably love it when I was 6 years old.
