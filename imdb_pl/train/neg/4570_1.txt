Funny. This film is actually a vehicle of the Ramtha School of Enlightenment. If you are wondering who * Bluep * Ramtha is: "Ramtha is a thirty-thousand-strong spiritual fighter who appeared in JZ Knight's kitchen at Tacoma in Washington in 1977. Knight claims to be Ramtha's channel. Ramtha and leads the sessions in which he pretends to go into trance and tells the Hollywood version of Elizabethan English in a throaty, hoarse voice, has thousands of followers and has made millions of dollars appearing as Ramtha at seminars ($ 1000 for the crack) and at her Ramtha School of Enlightenment and the sale of tapes, books and accessories (Clark and Gallo 1993). He must have hypnotic powers, seeking self-realization, otherwise normal people obey her order to spend hours with blindfolded in the cold, a muddy labyrinth without a door. John Wheeler, one of the best American theoretical physicists, would have turned his eyes on this film. He has recently criticized parapsychologists for their misuse and misinterpretation of quantum theory. This film does the same as those fools. <br /> <br /> There is a great review of this film in Skeptico. I recommend it to anyone who thinks about watching this movie before participating in the iconic cassette. <br /> <br /> http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2005/04/what_the_bleep_.html I noticed one IMDb reviewer here, tell me to take this movie with a bit of salt. It will take enough salt to kill the horse who will go through thinking about the trash of this movie.
