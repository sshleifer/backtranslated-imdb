Plot = Melissa is a new girl in the city, she is fifteen years old and her birthday is approaching during the week. Because Melissa is beautiful, every boy in the city wants to connect with her, but few who can catch her interest mysteriously die. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the real reason why I wanted to watch this movie is Dana Kimmel from Friday the 13th Fri 3 was in it, which is not enough reason to hurry up and see the movie. When I started watching it, I realized that "Sweet Sixteen" is not a very good slacker, it is really boring and boring, and it just does not go anywhere. After only an hour, only three murders took place and history did not develop in any way possible. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully shot with pretty cool photography and a good director, but like with many other slasherami cinema from the 80s, the film suffers from too dark times. Acting is actually quite good, and Melissa's character is easy to sympathize, even if he is a complete whore. <br /> <br /> The plot is not completely trivial, but it's just too boring to interest you, the only thing that interested me was Melissa, who was stunning, and Dana Kimmel who was really sweet and sweet in this movie. <br /> <br /> In all, quite a boring, finer movie that will not go anywhere, I recommend it to Slasher fans.
