There are two types of characters in SHIELD: people who try to do their best, how they can and act properly, and people who are constantly striving for their own interests and commit every mortal sin when they can tell themselves and everyone else that there are heroes and the only hope all. More than any other show, THE SHIELD talks about hypocrisy and self-harm. Unfortunately, the hypocrite and self-mutilating are the heroes of the shows and as such have the typical incredible immunity of the heroes of the genre to overcome or catch and come out on top, making fools out of all their peers. <br /> <br /> The show offers excellent work with the camera. Leading and disappearing are always great. It's really a work of art. Unfortunately, history is a record, a frightening scenario of fulfilling the wishes of unjustified violence, rape and lies. <br /> <br /> The protagonist who pulls everyone with him in an unsuccessful scheme after a failed plan is wiley like a warner bros a cartoon character, always running away and mocking all the elemers (everyone who does not support him in his lies and crimes), automatically attracts every good looking woman supporting a character who comes to the show, always going through every attempt to bring him to justice, and ALWAYS scraping your ears with his terrible self-definitions. If another policeman detects something wrong with what he is doing and someone is injured because of his actions, he always blames the suspected cop, regardless of the fact that his plans and complicated lies and doomed plans are always the cause. Whenever. <br /> <br /> Like the 24, this show is based on ideas and countless delays to drag your story to season after season. Boring, unbelievable stories of a long history are introduced into the storyline of each season to provide a skeleton on which you can suspend bloody, perverted pieces of meat that are corrupt deeds and inevitable lids. <br /> <br /> The most disappointing, however, is the pride of writers who try to change viewers' sympathies back and forth, creating characters on whims. Sometimes they want us to see Shane as an enemy. Sometimes they want us to see him as a poor, incomprehensible soul. Sometimes they want us to see Vic as a dangerous sexual dynamo. Sometimes they want us to see him as a poor man with a golden heart. Sometimes they want us to see Mara as a low mean Jezebel. Then they think that if they show her that they are sitting and talking to Shane about their dreams, we will discover that she is sympathetic and tragic. <br /> <br /> None of this manipulation is enough to get the desired sympathies. As soon as they show that these characters are destroying the lives of other people for their own purposes, that's all. It makes no sense to try to turn back and forth. But it is also nonsense to produce seven seasons of these clumsy clowns who pull out every super model on their beds and run a criminal syndicate straight from the police station, right under the noses of all.
