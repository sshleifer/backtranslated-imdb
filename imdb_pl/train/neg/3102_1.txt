No matter how you look at this movie, it's just awful. <br /> <br /> If you perceive it as a horror movie, then this is an inconsequential movie with monstrous puppets. <br /> <br /> If you look at it as a comedy, you'll notice that most of the humor falls and is just bad. <br /> <br /> If it's an affair, you'll wonder why the guy will stay with such B ** ch! <br /> <br /> If you look at it as an action, you can not really pull a nasty hero. <br /> <br /> As you can see this movie just does not deliver anything remotely fun. As mentioned, the monsters are obvious dolls, and this movie was another rehearsal of the Gremlins type film. However, it has the worst monsters of this species. The Critters looked pretty good, like the Ghoulies, even the Munchies dolls looked better than these. Characters in this movie are unacceptable. The hero is a tough bodyguard, his girlfriend always complains, have a tramp friend who has a boyfriend with a jerk and another friend who is spazem. At some point in the film, the hero and the warrior are fighting with rakes ... this movie is simply stupid. I like this scene when they are in a terrifying club scum (which is obviously not a club, but more likely it is a dinner), and the hero tells the waitress that none of them is 21 years old. younger than any of them.
