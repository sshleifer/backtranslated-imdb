The moment he moved forward, I knew we were in trouble! The assumption is funny at best. The plot was even worse if possible. <br /> <br /> Acting was stiff and the actors felt lack of experience. You expect more from Slater, Reid and Dorff. The lines were delivered like from a robot. And I'm sorry, I like Reid, but she was VERY unbelievable like an archaeologist. Slater and Dorff chose a bad movie to try their returns. <br /> <br /> Continuity was turned off throughout the movie. The creatures were not bad, but they were not good either. <br /> <br /> Conclusion, I want my ninety minutes of life to come back. They can keep the money, but give me time! What a loss.
