Blonde and Blonder were uncomfortable. Essentially, it was a rip-off version of Dumb and Dumber, but less fun, and they used too much background and music. It starts extremely boring, and TOTALLY inane. It is not able to quickly reach momentum, and I felt more frustrated when this nonsense was successful. I found it a bit fun and interesting because it was coming to an end, but it was the only part. Besides, I could not help, but I liked the characters Pamela Anderson and Denise Richard a bit. Even if this movie did not laugh from me, it attracted my attention. I would not say to completely avoid this movie, but there are thousands of better movies that you can spend your time and money on than Blonde and Blonder.
