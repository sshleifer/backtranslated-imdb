I do not know why this movie was advertised as a wild, bizarre, laughable comedy. In this film, there is not much entertainment or entertainment for the film-maker. Annette Bening (whose acting was deserved of an Oscar) appears here as an upbringing, with her routine. Brian Cox's character is tangled and annoying, and the main role is played by Augusten ?? Joseph Cross? it seems that there is simply no personality that could play its role. The best thing about the movie is Evan Rachel Wood, but it's not enough to support this boring, unpalatable movie. <br /> <br /> The movie quickly disappeared and there seems to be a good reason for it. I found some distasteful scenes (the scene with Brian Cox and his just used toilet competes with the worst scenes from "You and Me and Everyone We Know" and "The Squid and the Whale"), a bit embarrassing and most of them disturbing. The whole experience was a waste of time for me. You are not wasting time?
