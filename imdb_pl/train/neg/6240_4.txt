A hint about which I think can be collected by various comments about this thread. <br /> <br /> I was amazed at the number of people who liked this movie, wanting to make it "obligatory" or "obligatory". <br /> <br /> I think it gives us some insight into the reason why this film and the underlying issue are so polarizing. <br /> <br /> The issue of Global Warming is very appealing to people who want to force others to "do well". It is especially appealing to more "liberal" people leaning out because it has nothing to do with the morality of the bedroom, which usually makes the conservatives want to force you to "be good". <br /> <br /> And this is a problem with the movie. Al Gore is a politician. And very successful. He simply can not refrain from appealing to people who want to force others to do what they want. Political attractiveness is simply too great. <br /> <br /> We have a scientific question that can be of great importance, reduced to a political issue that appeals to people in politics with a taste for forcing others to "do well". <br /> <br /> Another interesting question is how the environmental movement has been kidnapped by such people?
