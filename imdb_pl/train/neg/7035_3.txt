An extremely thin "plot" of satanic rituals or something like mumbo-jumbo provides a hokey pretext to entangle abundant sex scenes. Simple sex with vanilla, masturbation, lesbianism, S & M, bestiality, incest and some other sexual proliferation is in the spotlight. The problem is that the plot is so boring that after some time raging sexuality becomes quite boring. Who knew that a movie with an intimate meeting of a goat / girl could be so damn boring? What I do now. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Venessa Hidalgo shows everything; Helga Line provides T & A (both on the display quite often); women viewers get their penis from time to time. <br /> <br /> My class: D + <br /> <br /> Region 1 DVD Extras: Trailers "Pick Up", "Legend of Eight Samurai", "Do not Reply to phone," Prime Evil "And" Sister Street Fighter "(on the same DVD there is the second feature film" Evil Eye ")
