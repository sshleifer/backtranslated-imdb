It's amazing!! .. Yes, someone wrote in front of me that it was time to waste space and watch this movie .. it is! Do not do this! I'm totally annoyed! I liked Wesley Snipes and found it funny that he played his name in the movie. In any case, I wanted to see this movie (of course only at home), but now (after him) I'm totally disappointed! It was his worst film ever. Inwatchable !! Bad acting game! Bad cameraman! Bad scenario! .. Only one good thought: this wonderful girl! Certainly it must be a mannequin! Eeeeh !! MB .. 10 minimum lines ?! I do not want to waste my time reading my opinion! I hope that I was clear and not stable enough because English is not my native method of speaking. So have time and see good movies, as I will try too ... Peace!
