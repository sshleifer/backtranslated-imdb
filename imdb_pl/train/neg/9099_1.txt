This review also includes the spoiler of the first movie - so if you have not seen any movie and you want, but you do not want spoilers, do not read this review! <br /> <br /> While this is the movie should be about meeting Christian and Kathrin for the first time, the movie is a bad copy of the first Cruel Intentions. The actors they played as Christian and Ryan Phillippe and Kathryn Sarah Michelle Gellar are very weak substitutes. None of them can break away from the disgusting, snobbish attitude of the rich children that the original actors did. It is absolutely terrifying that some of the dialogues were literal - not so much between Christian and Kathryn, but if you listen carefully, you will recognize it. There are also inconsistencies in the story - if it was really the first meeting of Christian and Kathryn, why Christian fell in love with the girl at the end of the movie? Apparently he was to be in love for the first time in the original film (with the character Reese Witherspoon). <br /> <br /> Also the connection with the photograph / "You can be a model" comments the end was completely bad and did not add anything. Overall, this movie was a waste of time. I can not believe that they did cruel intentions 3.
