(spoilery) <br /> <br /> I should have guessed. The DVD did not even show time or time. I thought Wild Cardz was the worst anime movie I've ever seen. This one is much worse. Does not make sense. The story is thrown together. All this so that we can see big breasts on a character who does not support them. <br /> <br /> It must have been a student film. It has to get the class C <br /> <br /> 2/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 1/10 Entertainment: 6/10 (until I found out that it would not end). close did not make sense <br /> <br /> Reproducible: 0/10
