Is nobody else tired of this old clich√©, in which almost a dead person appears in horror, gives us some information, and then blew his head for no apparent reason? I know that I am. <br /> <br /> It's sad that its use in this movie is worthless. If you saw the first movie (the first remake I should say), then the information given is completely worthless because you would already know it. I guess it's not worthless for the main characters ... but why is the idiot shooting himself in the head? Would not he want to live? Sure, he would die anyway ... <br /> <br /> This is the second movie entitled "The Hills Have Eyes II". The first of these is the continuation of the original movie from the 70s. It's a bit complicated for someone like me. You see, I am probably part of a minority of people of my age who even knew that HHE2 is the beginning, let alone the original HHE1. And now, when we have the sequel to the remake and the fact that this sequel was named exactly as the continuation of the original HHE1 ... it's only worse! But anyway ... <br /> <br /> Wes Craven's Original Hills Have Eyes were decent. Ultimately, however, the idea was better than the presentation, but most likely had a low budget. Honestly, Wes Craven is not a good horror director. He only made some good horror movies (Nightmare on Elm St., New Nightmare), some good (Scream) and a group of horrible (Cursed, Shocker, Vampire in Brooklyn). Oh, and he did Swamp Thing too ... but the original HHE2 belongs to the second category. I only saw a few minutes, but it was awful. <br /> <br /> Now he's the co-author of the new HHE2 .. and it's such a disappointment! Last year's HHE remake was even better than the original movie. It was tense. I think it was related to the fact that the main heroes were the family, not a bunch of beer and crazy teenagers. We felt dirty. For the first hour we were in hell, and finally in the last few moments good guys took revenge on the bad guys and it was good .. <br /> <br /> This new movie has no tension. Without tension. Only violent things happen mainly to stupid people. There is no dangerous presence here. Just an ugly hobo hiding under the rocks. <br /> <br /> I am tired of horrors in which people die because of the stupid mistakes they make. It was only on the second day that I watched the "Deep Blue Sea", where Samuel L. Jackson was walking on the water, making a speech, and then he was devoured by a shark, just because the idiot was close to the water .. Something that no one would do in the given situation! Here's exactly the same. People go out alone to make a leak, even if they know that people are dying. And then, when you think people would learn, someone else will go alone! Seriously, is not it more frightening when the heroes bring their A-game and are still losing? I think that yes ... <br /> <br /> It is even able to deliver. It should have been the first remake reminiscent of the "The Fog" remake (which was less dangerous than the "Becker" episode). More bad guys. More time in caves. More tension. More everything. <br /> <br /> But this actually reduces the quality. Less angry. Without tension. Of course, we have more time in the caves, but there is not much going on. In the end, it seems that there are two or three bad guys. The last movie made it look like a whole tribe of people. Where is the tribe? Who keeps watching them through binoculars? Seriously, these are the things that this film should bring to us, but it ends with exactly the same promise that the last movie gave us, with exactly the same "watched" scene. Come on! I will give the devil what he deserves. The movie's appearance is good ... but that's it. <br /> <br /> I do not even think that fans will like it, although I'm probably wrong! It's gore (though most are accelerated in the dark), but without the tension and the characters you care about ... gore does nothing in my book! In the end, you are not afraid. You are not shocked (unless you are an 8-year-old girl). You do not even feel that you've seen something new.
