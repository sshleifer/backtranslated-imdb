God, I'm fed up with the nonsense that comes from America called "Cartoons"! <br /> <br /> Since the anime has become popular, American animators or produce a cartoon with a 5-year-old lazy asshole style of drawing (Kappa Mikey) or a little betrayal of Japanese animation. (It usually spoils classic characters) No wonder anime beats American cartoons! <br /> <br /> They are not trying anymore! <br /> <br /> Oh, I just heard about this night; I live in the UK, and when I found out that this program first appeared in 2005, I never knew that Great Britain is up to date with current programs.
