Right away, this movie was funny. Not that it did not have salutary aspects? For example, the best thing about this movie was the beautiful scenery of the background. Anyone who does not live on the east coast should know that the South has no beautiful mountains like those found in the West. I knew it was Utah right away, but perhaps Dalton could not suppress his English accent, so they had to justify it by saying it was a southern city. Turning his accent to the south was easier. Of course, the movie has twists, but its false sense of location was something I could not cross. It's not like Utah has no meteorological laboratories ... so why writers thought it necessary to pretend to be in the South, it's outside of me. <br /> <br /> Another thing in action shots always puzzles me. Why do they always make an "amazing" sound effect when the character pulls out an automatic gun? It seemed that every other sound effect in this movie was "chuk-chich" meaning that 9 mm was loaded and ready to fire. Of course, the weapon already had chamber balls, so it was not necessary. <br /> <br /> At the end of the pyrotechnics was on top. But hey, this movie was directed to a certain "market segment", I think ... It's a pity. Each of the actors can work, but this movie was bad.
