Woody Allen has made some of the best comedies in history and would seriously consider Annie Hall to be the best movie ever, but if I really think about it, I'll probably think about one or two that's better, but it would be difficult. He had, of course, several films that are not quite good, but not as bad as Manhattan Murder Mystery and Sweet and Lowdown, but he has never had such a bad movie as Melinda and Melinda before. Not so tired and ridiculous, his films are usually humorous and funny, but how did this happen, is it still our good old Woody? The action revolves around four friends who together eat dinner. Two are writers, and one of them mentions a funny story that happened to her friend. It's about a young woman who unexpectedly hits the party. We never hear the rest, because the two games start debating whether it would not be a better comedy or tragedy. Then we start to see two points of view. Both are focused on the woman named Melinda, who has problems with both drugs and her ex-husband. In tragedy she is an old friend of a family who, after a suicide attempt, decided to appear at the door of the old best friends for no apparent reason. The comedy tells about Melida, who stumbles at a party after firing 28 sleeping pills. They both lead a crazy whirl of events that never make sense or match, or make you laugh more than once or twice. There are some nice performances by Radha Mitchell and Will Ferrell, but they can not match each other. They can not stop him from sinking further than most other movies this year.
