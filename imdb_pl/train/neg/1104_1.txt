This is one of the worst written movies I ever had to sit down. <br /> <br /> This story is nothing new - but it's a cartoon, so who cares if it's pretty and funny? <br /> <br /> I do not intend to go as deep as the characteristics, or I will be here all day (except that there are none, characters change personality whenever it's convenient for the story)), but whoever wrote scenario and visual direction should be forbidden to access the pencil and paper. Thumbs down? I would vote for cutting off my thumbs. <br /> <br /> "Narrow the object / prop. Move back to zoom in on the character. The character gives a look that the audience can not even understand. Repeat this several times, with different objects / props. "<br /> <br />" Let characters not pay attention to all the huge lumps of rock hovering around, striking against each other, generally falling damage on all sides that can kill them all at any moment - but make them stop and they gasp with fear when they see a harmless-looking, almost pastoral green rock in the distance. "<br /> <br /> The whole thing is a long series of events, actions and behaviors that are only for the writer's convenience, to protect him from thinking or making any effort to write the story correctly. <br /> <br /> This is a plan for 9 CG cartoons, except that Ed Wood does not want to be nice to watch. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor: spend your budget on Pixar movies.
