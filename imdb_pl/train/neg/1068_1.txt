My wife and I just finished the movie and came to IMDb to feel sorry for reviewers who found the film less than satisfactory. However, from 10 pages of the review only a handful is negative. I feel that this movie is a great idea that went terribly and I want to warn those who want to watch the movie in the future. <br /> <br /> I admit that I am more inspired by writing reviews when I do not like the movie than when, so my handful of reviews is negative. This does not mean, however, that I am focused on the fact that I do not enjoy the movie, but I often find more meaningful reviews of the films I like. <br /> <br /> Paris je t'aime is the most pretentious movie that I "have seen for years. Using the "intelligent" concept and attaching great talent to several ways to many short stories, the film ends the worst of all worlds. It's art for art, but something that a two-year-old can come up with and achieve. Giving the director a free 5 minutes of time on the screen proves why there is a division of work even in entertainment. Directors can not write, writers can not direct. (I would also like to add that Clint Eastwood is overrated, but that's because he is the director of actor's turns (which also rarely works)). <br /> <br /> What ends up on the screen is a distorted mess of short stories that do not make sense, they are not finished within 5 minutes and they will spoil Paris. Why do we call it Paris je t'aime, when the more aproposic title is the f * ck cluster? There are only a few stories that you can watch, especially the work of Alfonso Cuar√≥n, but everything else will fall into oblivion. Coen's short brothers are passable, but can you call them a movie that does not contain a guitar scene? It's as if all the directors decided to do everything they want and chose Paris as the place where they would do it. As we all love Paris, including the current company, we are blinded by the fact that this movie SUCKS. To tell you the truth, I think they put the directors' names on each of the shortcuts because the directors saw how weak the film was and decided to make sure they were blamed only in 5 minutes. Seriously. SERIOUSLY. <br /> <br /> People, Natalie Portman are NOT a good actress. She is not a girl who dreams about being yours. And Maggie Gyllenhaal, why?!? Are you acting people or simply returning performances from other movies? I look at you Natalie Portman (Garden State, Closer), Elijah Wood (Sin City) and Catalina Sandino Moreno (Maria Full of Grace). <br /> <br /> One of the last comments on acting: I give a double kudos to Nick Nolte for playing and looking more human than you've been in for ages or maybe once more. Find his short text on youtube, because his 5 minutes is quite pleasant. <br /> <br /> Writing short stories is very difficult and only a handful of authors understand this well. I think about Ernst Hemingway, Raymond Carver, F. Scott Fitzgerald and John Cheever, just to name a few. It is much harder than writing a full novel and only truly talented people can achieve it. The same can be said about short films. It seems that only one director will live in the annals of history. <br /> <br /> If you keep Paris as a jewel you want to discover and reflect your own lens through your own lens, do not expect to enjoy this movie. The directors either did not care or were lazy. In each of these scenarios, when you read this, it means you borrowed them. Praise that you did not pay $ 10 for that.
