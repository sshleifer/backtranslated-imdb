It's probably one comedy I will not forget about for a while. <br /> <br /> I usually would not care about the commentary on this movie: it's so small that nobody will look at it anyway, but it happens to be popular in p2p networks such as Kazaa, so this saaad production needs to be revealed what it is. <br /> <br /> So what is it? Well, of course this is not a comedy; instead it is intended as a horrifying horror - "intended" is the key word here. The screenplay is a completely inconsistent and unbalanced mess, special effects are unique only because they are particularly pathetic, and when it comes to acting, let's say that if it was my graduation game in elementary school, my teachers are bursting with our talent. <br /> <br /> Of course, I realize that this is a very low budget movie and that in such cases you should lower your expectations, certainly in terms of such things as special effects. In addition, although I am a huge fan of the genre of horror, I realize that these films are rarely a place where you can look for interesting scenarios and top-class actors. <br /> <br /> But still. /> <br /> B movies often have some advantages to compensate for the lack of funds such as humor. The only laughs in Cradle to Fear are in funny performances. If you can find humor in it - and maybe for the first 20 minutes, gradually napping after that - it will be the only thing the movie has to offer. Oh, that's two or three pairs of breasts. <br /> <br /> Woohoo, how exciting. <br /> <br /> When it comes to history, it is not even that it does not try to convey anything: victims use drugs and / or take part in serious crimes. Lesson: Watch out, naughty boys and girls, because one day you'll have to pay for what you did. <br /> <br /> I rest in my case. <br /> <br /> So, in general, a bit of sex, a lot of drugs, but absolutely no rock'n'roll. <br /> <br /> I rate this one in 10, but I could 0. Or maybe not: it deserves 1 for correct writing of the names of the actors in the titles. I mean, it's something, right?
