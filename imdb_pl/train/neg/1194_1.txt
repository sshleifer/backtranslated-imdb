I have seen many movies in my life, but not as much as this. It's a movie that pokes fun at fat people, does not have a real story, has bad actors, is not fun, and much more. Is this a movie you would like to see? I suppose not! <br /> <br /> I think that the creators of the film tried to be original and creative, but it looks like it was created by a 12-year-old child, completely devoid of film skills. The so-called fun parts are as much fun as making cakes on the faces of people or breaking the wind. No matter if it's the kind of humor you like, this is the movie for you! <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money on this movie!
