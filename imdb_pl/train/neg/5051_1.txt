I am amused and outraged by people who say that this film is so accurate about Vietnam and it WAS NEVER. This movie is almost as real about the entire Vietnam war as Rodney King's beating concerns ALL police officers. Yes, bad things happen (and it happened), but generally people are like you and me. They have morals, they are not killing machines, not all drugs. Atrocities were the exception in Vietnam, not the rule. They were much less likely than "noise" to lead to faith. Oliver Stone has a talent for making films that show war in Vietnam as this brutal bathhouse, but in reality they rely equally on Star Wars. If you sincerely believe in the stereotypes of Vietnam, do yourself a favor and know the truth. Fact: Viet Cong and NVA did far worse to the South Vietnamese than any soldier in the US armed forces. Fact: soldiers during the Second World War treated the enemy much worse than soldiers in Vietnam, and were welcomed when they returned home. The good Americans who served this country in Vietnam deserve our respect; although the war was badly fought from a political point of view, no one could ask for more than our soldiers, and the big disadvantage is the claim that this kind of "mostly real" fiction is the way things really were.
