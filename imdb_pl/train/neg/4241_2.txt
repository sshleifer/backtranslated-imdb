Yes, the character of Madsen - when talking to a woman from the TV station - is right: LAPD IS a corrupt, brutal and racist police. And this movie does not change anything. Okay, here are the good cops, the moral cops, even the blacks, the Christians, the martyrs. But this is a fairy tale, admit it. Reality is not like that. And the most important thing for action fans: shooting is boring. It's just shooting, shooting and shooting. Nothing more. Play Counter Strike, or at least you'll have something to do. The only moral of this movie is: LAPD is good now. No more bad cops. If you like uncritical euphemism ads for police and military service, watch this video. This is the longest advertisement I have ever seen. (2 points for camera and editing).
