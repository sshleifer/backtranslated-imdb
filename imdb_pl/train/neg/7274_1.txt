"National Lampoon Goes to the Movies" (1981) is simply the worst film ever made, much lamer than even a failed "Plan 9 from space". <br /> <br /> The film "Lampoon" is told three segments, each supposedly impersonating a conventional film genre, but each of them lands at our feet with a disgusting clatter. There is no rhyme or reason for those nasty vignettes and no discernible plots. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer on this site wrote that the only good sides about the movie are naked scenes. It's true that Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry make a body flash and it's very nice. But the directors seem to be unaware that even T & A needs a good story to surround it. There is nothing here. <br /> <br /> Probably the worst of these three segments is the last with the participation of Robby Benson and Richard Widmark. Here we see Benson as a young, bearded cop who is connected to the cynical oldtimer played by Widmark. And for a moment those of us who are still watching this hideous film exercise are excited to think that soon we will see a redeeming story of how a young, idealistic policeman introduces a cleansing change in the approach of an elderly man to police work. But there is no happiness. As we said, this movie has no redemption value. This causes nausea until the final disappearance - which, perversely, is stretched longer than it should last on the screen. Apparently the filmmakers knew that something bad was happening and they wanted to do as little as possible.
