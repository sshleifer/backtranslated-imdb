Did HeidiJean really see this movie? A great Christmas movie? Not even close. Blunt, insipid and completely devoid of imagination and heart. I watched the movie all the time, wondering who the hell thought Carly Pope could play the lead role in this movie! The woman has no detectable personality and gives completely poor results. Bara≈Ñski was as good as usual and provided only a bit of curiosity. Probably her involvement was the only reason why the project was green at first. Maybe I expect too much for the Lifetime movie played 15 days after Christmas, but I sat down thinking that with a different director and reworked JJ with an actress who can at least bring sympathy, it can be quite a sweet little movie.
