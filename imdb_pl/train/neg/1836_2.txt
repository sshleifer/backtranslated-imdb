How can Barry Levinson collect the heated comedy talents of Ben Stiller and Jack Black, the great Rachel Weisz, the old professional Christopher Walken, and continue to deliver such a humorless death? <br /> <br /> Stiller and Black are friends for the latter inventing the sprayer, which will make the dog's mess disappear and become a striking multimillionaire. <br /> <br /> The rooms are thin, but they sound good enough in the right hands to be a springboard to a great bitch between two stars, but everything involved overplay in each hand, every chance they can. <br /> <br /> Stiller and Black are just too funny for too much time, Weisz looks like always sensational, but it is not well used deliberately, except for Walken as a barfly bat, who calls Stiller to take revenge, is it's a hard march to the end of this tense farce.
