I really hate films from the end of the world. They show what bored Hollywood people think about the rest of the world, and apparently they think we're a bunch of sadistic idiots (or at least watching sadistic idiots react to things in some way fun). I was in LA. many times, I have a family who works in show business, and I just want to say that they are * last * people whom we should look for to check reality. Some catastrophic films at least paint a clever picture: Children of men, 12 monkeys, but usually the message is: "people will do everything to survive, everything is dark, sad and pointless, we should all be ashamed". <Br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I like the idea of ​​a story that explores the rejection of the social order system and testing people in the face of horror, and I believe that some people will act like this film aside, but aside sadistic idiots, I seriously doubt whether society will simply dissolve in each person for himself, it is only offensive.
