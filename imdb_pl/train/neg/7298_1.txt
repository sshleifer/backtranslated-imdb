no redemptive qualities can be expressed. I would like to regain my time. the pretty face of the skull is wide, really smiling, bright in the camera when the disease has already ravaged the badly informed script. I was ((spoiler)) happy to see all figures dead or seriously overpowered until the end, especially party buyers who drink contaminated juice on the way to the alleged sunset. Eli Roth shines for a moment, maybe ten years, presenting the theory of how well the weeds are burning in the woods, while others really feel well at the top of beer consumption. In general, I thought that most of them are pointless, though without unreasonable violence and insufficient nudity, happy to witness the fall of the cast, though in a sense, regretting that this trip never happened (it should probably have been spread instead of watching TBS) late night, ugh).
