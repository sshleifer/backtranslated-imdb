Weak Tobe Hopper. He directed the classic horror movie "Texas Chaimsaw Massacre." Since then, everything he did was horrible. This is probably the worst ... and it says a lot. It's about a man (Brad Dourif) who can make things (and people) light up ... or something like that. This is not an original idea (everyone remembers "Firestarter"?) It's a real mess ... literally EVERYTHING is badly done! Pathetic acting (even Dourif!), Secret script, worst production values, shitty special effects ... everything is BAD !!!!! You have to miss ... even for laughter.
