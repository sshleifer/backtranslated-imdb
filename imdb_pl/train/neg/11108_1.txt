Where to start. The movie started quite well, but after 30 minutes I found myself watching the clock. The horror film at the beginning of the movie was good, but then the story began. It's just that time has become dumber and stupider. <br /> <br /> The actors gave an average performance in this film, but got a little bored Vinny Jones with a constant grimace in the film. <br /> <br /> As the film dragged on and did not let the word go from it, it dragged on, it just became more and more strained. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER ALERT *** SPOILER ALERT *** SPOILER ALERT *** When I thought that the movie can not get worse, towards the final load, if there are monsters looking like skeletons, only after it was to eat dead people, which made no sense at all. It turned out that it is a cult of eating meat, and good people die at the end. The ending really made me laugh how bad it was. When the main role gets rid of Vinny Jones, he becomes a new killer. <br /> <br /> Finally, the movie made Creep look like the best horror movie ever made. I gave him one star, because the women's advantage did a good job, but even she could not save this wreck!
