Greenaway seems to have a habit of deliberately disgusting his viewers. This film begins with incest - and purposeless, meaningless, incest. It's a big Greenaway problem. He prefers salon tricks to shock the actual doing anything. Technical skills are not enough. It's a bit perverse because of the perversion.
