"Speedy Gonzalez" Friz Frelenga was the second cartoon in which the title character appeared after "Cat-tails for Two" by Robert McKimon. In this cartoon, Speedy was an ugly little creature with a large golden tooth, but after his second appearance, the famous project has already been adopted. Even though he looked much more handsome, Speedy never developed into a big character. A big hat, incredible speed and bad Mexican accent do not create a classic character and that's what Speedy has ever had for him. Nevertheless, this conceited mouse turned out to be extremely popular and played in many short films, including really bad films from the last days of the studio. While these early Speedy shorts are better than the later cruelty in which he was often (rather strangely) paired with Daffy Duck, they still leave much to be desired, based on predictable gags usually based on a similar chase formula. In this episode, Speedy is recruited by other mice to steal cheese for them from a local factory that is protected by a New Year's cat. Although it brings additional weight to the return of the star to the cartoon, the role of New Year's Eve could very well be fulfilled by any other generic cartoon cat. His personality is weakened by his compelling predictability. not requiring the role of a persecutor. It was always a problem also in Tweety's cartoons, but Speedy makes even the opponent more boring, thanks to his disgusting self-importance and the glaring impossibility of capture. Poor old Sylvester would be forced to appear next to Speedy for many years. Despite the basic formula and minimal laughter, "Speedy Gonzalez" won an Oscar and an unshakable star was born.
