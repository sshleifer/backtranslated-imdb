How can you take seriously the hard, brutal story of the bounty hunter with this * accent? It's absurd. In addition, the director's visual style is bland and sly, the plot is shallow, boring, lost in a gangster movie, and the acting is unconvincing. The film introduces new characters throughout the film and is told in fragmentary retrospection - most often out of order - seemingly just to be nice and confused. In the film you can always see THINGS THAT I DO NOT REALLY HAPPENED and then say: "it really did not happen, it happened" - see (apparent) killing (false) "first ladies". What did we see as the first, bad, sequence of events? <br /> <br /> A terrible choice in the casting, intricate, sloppy plot and director's style causing a headache. 1/5.
