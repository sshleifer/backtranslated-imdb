The old axiom that bored people are boring people is well shown in 'Women in love'. The script, taken from a novel by D. H. Lawrence, contains an infinite flow of concepts that are, at best, sophomoric. <br /> <br /> What a pity that so much effort was put in such a vain exercise; what an empty array of characters drew attention to this. Despite high production values, this film is as tedious as its staff. <br /> <br /> Re-visit in 2001. Only confirms the impression of juvenille minds in adult bodies, nowhere outgoing, and clumsy at every step.
