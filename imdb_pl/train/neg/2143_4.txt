I grew up watching the original Disney Cinderella and always loved him so much that the tape was a bit worn. <br /> <br /> Therefore, I was excited to see that Cinderella 2 is coming on TV and I will see it. <br /> <br /> I should have known better. <br /> <br /> This movie joins a club of movie sequels that should have been left alone. Keeps absolutely NO of the original super charms! It seems to me that it is quite rough and almost brutal, from (not) Sing-a-longs to make-up. <br /> <br /> I remember that the character tells a story through a song, the soundtrack of this movie was arranged on top and did not match. The transformation of Jaqa into a human is a perfect example: when he walked and ate an apple, adding a few small jokes here and there, he should dance and sing about how great it was to be tall! And in the ballroom there is old country music in the style of a barn. It's as if writers have forgotten where and when this story was set. An optimistic violin certainly did not fit. <br /> <br /> Even the graphics and animation in Cinderella 2 is not up to zero with the original. The graphics in this movie seem rather harsh and less detailed. And we can see some of Cinderella's skirt, which does not feel good. <br /> <br /> The film itself could have been my own story, I think it should be like that. I would not say that I hate it, but I believe that it has many disadvantages. It seems that it is significantly lowered from the beloved original Cinderella.
