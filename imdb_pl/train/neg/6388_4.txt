The Brothers Quay directors, judging from conventional thoughts, should have made short films. I really liked their first feature film, Institute Benjamenta, but judging by their second song, The Piano Tuner of Earthquakes, I'm inclined to agree that they're not getting closer to their past genius with the length of the movie. The Piano Tuner is undoubtedly a great movie to watch and often listen to. Unfortunately, the borders are painful to sit down with its intricate narrative and the glacial pace. Reading the abstract of the story, it sounds like a pretty good story. But the brothers bear a pitiful death. One thing they should consider to avoid in the future: dialogue. My God, it's terrible here. A huge bust.
