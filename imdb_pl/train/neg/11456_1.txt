It's one of those movies that makes you think: did Hulk "The Real American" Hogan do the same? Honestly, I do not think so and he would be right. I'm Italian, I can not boast about my country for many reasons, but I would not take part in another team (for example, the French) because I'm in love with Juliette Binoche. In addition, the hero does not fall in love with the British girl at the end of the movie, but in the company of a countryman, so why rowing against Yale. When it comes to acting, all players behave very poorly. And then, you know, I hated the atmosphere of "The Dead Society of Poets." In fact, this is another movie that I hate.
