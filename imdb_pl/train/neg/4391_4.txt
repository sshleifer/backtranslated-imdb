Young scientist Harry Harrison continues his father's research into the regeneration of limbs in flying colors, but his disturbingly dominant mother and her doctor, a lover, want to sell serum. When he finds out, there is an accident involving Harry, who loses his hand. So he's trying to get the serum, and what's emerging is a genetically insane arm that has its own mind. <br /> <br /> Oh, we've seen it so many times before, but what raises this very camp and quite gummy shonky junk is the performance of film icons Elke Sommer and Oliver Reed. Actually, this is not a bad movie Fangoria; they simply exist better, similar to each other. "Servered Ties" simply does not have its own distinctive style. Strange nature and unpleasant splatter resembled "Re-animator", and even a bit of slapstick got out like something from "Evil Dead 2". <br /> <br /> The comic tale is really crazy with its black humor, but it can be melodramatic and somewhat dry in the fun factor. There are surprises, especially the final result. Which is well accepted because I thought I could deal with something more accessible. In the case of low-budget production FX can look stiff and very stupid, but there are also grotesque moments that will make you smile and not curl. Even a brush of sexual tension improves the story, thanks to the strictly juicy performance of Elke Sommer as a mother. Oliver Reed is quite funny deadly in a bad sense and he's doing very well. They were both very distracted, like the couple you loved to hate. Billy Morrisette is delighted with the irregular performance of Harry. Director Damon Santostefano briskly enters the film and orchestrates stylish scenes of thrilling and stunning horror. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's juvenile and stupid nonsense, but you have to give it to some undemanding entertainment.
