this movie was by far the worst movie I've seen in my entire life and I've seen some very bad movies. I did not like the way the movie was filmed. all the actors are unknown and it looks like a group of friends have gathered and decided to make their own movie. but it's absolutely horrible. I've never seen a worse movie. the story is so false and I just discovered that it took really long to get to the end of the movie. there was no story, it did not seem to have been planned before the shooting started. the story is too strange. I did not like how easy it was to get to the bottom of the movie. there was no point in even filming this movie. if you're considering watching this movie, no. you are simply wasting your time.
