Good Earth is probably the most boring movie I've ever seen in my life. The story is slow and is missing. Acting is comical from the borderline. When I love Paula Muni, now I can say that I have seen a film that does not meet his true justice. The only saving I found in this film is its production value. The use of hundreds of additions throughout the film creates a very credible and interesting environment. In addition, the beautiful effects used to create the illusion of millions of oscillations oscillate easily and were revolutionary at that time. In addition to the value of production, I can say that there is little or no good in this film.
