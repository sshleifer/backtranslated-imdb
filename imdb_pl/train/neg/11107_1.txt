It was a horrible movie. There was no story. To top it all off, when they could not explain blood and blood (the only good part) ... they threw a few aliens! I hate it when the directors (or whatever) end up with ideas and then blame the aliens! Watch this movie if you want. But do not say I did not warn you. Two things: how could Vinny say "hello" when he did not have a tongue? It is a pity that Mr. Jones did not have a big role. The second thing that eavesdropped me, why we showed Vinny Jones boils, and he cut them off and put them in a blue liquid, they have no further role. Why not? I do not like to be shown, and this has nothing to do with the plot. In brief. Bad story. I would not waste my time - I would like to watch Mirrors instead.
