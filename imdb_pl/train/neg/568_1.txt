It's "debuted" today on the SciFi channel and all I can say is "I have no speech". I had high hopes, now I'm shredding the closets looking for the length of the rope so that I could hang myself. Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I would like to be able to say something nice, such as "It was fun to laugh at the movie", but this movie gives me nothing to do. I know that you should not post spoilers here without warning, but I'm going to "This movie sucks" anyway. I said it! They should show this movement to film students to show them what NOT to do! My nine-year-old niece could make a better movie. The only decent feature of this movie is the sound and / or soundtrack. ABOUT! I just found a rusty C clamp in my old toolbox. I'm going to put it on the thumb of my left hand and tighten it until the pain erases the memory of what my eyes have seen. I could just record this VHS, but I think I will burn it in the hearth instead. I could wash with soap, but I'm afraid I will never be clean again. Holidays are coming. Buy this movie and give it to people you hate. -Microphone
