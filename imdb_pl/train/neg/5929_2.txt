People who praise this movie are real disappointments - at least I hope Leonard will see some good money out of it, because a few years ago his savings were misappropriated by the manager, and he is over 70 years old. But this movie is simply awful. At the beginning Leonard himself says that he is not sentimental in relation to his past, and then for the next hour and a half the movie emphasizes all the worst sentimental elements of Leonard's songs. It's so damn PRECIOUS with endless close-ups over the singers' emotions. Cohen's interview is done in close-ups of the lo-fi video and that's how I wanted to see the medium or long view of his entire body! I did not care about the comments of the performers, especially those damned ego, Edge and Bono boys. None of the performers of this film made even one song as good as Leonard's music, and if you think about it and have any doubts, listen to them. This can be an acceptable special PBS, maybe for a one-time show. But I hesitate even before receiving this DVD. When the film finally shows Leonardo half-performance of the "Tower of Song", he is ruined by Bono, who performs the poem. Even the occasional good performances (Antony, the first Rufus number, Martha's The Traitor) are spoiled by the context of the rest of this turgid blab. Forget about it and go buy Leonardo's newest album if you want to pay homage to him.
