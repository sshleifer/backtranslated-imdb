Lame threads and a two-dimensional script made the characters look like cardboard cutouts. Needless to say, it made it difficult to feel empathy for any character, especially fianc√©; He looked and acted more like a cartoon. In conclusion, I think it can be said that it was on par with a drama typical of television. He uses almost every banal in the book. Tortured classical musician who wants to explode and play salsa. A free bride engaged in the personality of the "opponent of beans" she does not like. I will not exchange them, because otherwise it would be a spoiler, because I would betray the whole story. The dance was OK, but nothing special. I saw worse. 3 stars for good music. The team was really tight. I saw it on YouTube. Fortunately, I did not pay good money to see it in the theater. I'm still a bit shocked at how many great reviews have decorated this movie.
