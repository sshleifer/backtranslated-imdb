Usually, I do not think that Hollywood productions are suitable for filming, which is why I call them "movies". But this piece of elephant manure is not even suitable for a movie, hence quotes in the title. <br /> <br /> Where should I start? 1. If this is not the beginning of geriatric casting, it is certainly his epitome. Stefanie Powers is going to play someone LESS than half his age, she has to play the 18-year-old, and she is VERY HAPPY TWO !!!! <br /> <br /> 2. A terrible and stupid, thoughtless portrait of Paris and France, where we see stereotypical figures, such as: a sympathetic shop owner, a bizarre queen of models, a god fairy god ex-queen of models, etc. respect of the Code Da Vinci (which the reviewers have correctly described as a comedy). <br /> <br /> 3. It is ridiculous that there is no nudity in the movie about time and place where nudity was such a common place, especially if all attention is focused on it <br /> <br /> 4. Awful accents !!! <br /> <br /> 5. Elevator Nana Mouskouri !!! <br /> <br /> I can continue, but I think that's enough. And I was able to make these observations after watching this shit for half an hour, WHEN I surfed the Internet and talked to friends about mathematical equations ... I mean ... !!!!! <br /> <br /> I invite everyone to be added to my list. :): P: D
