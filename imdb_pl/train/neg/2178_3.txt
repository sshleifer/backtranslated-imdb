I really liked this movie, if Jason (Herb) Evers did not stop in constant experimenting with the experiment. Many early reviewers of The Seven Samurai accused Toshiro Mifune of abusing. However, as more and more critics watched the film, they saw it deliberately. Jason Evers is not of course Toshiro Mifune, and his abuse is exactly like that. <br /> <br /> Most of the actors in this classic B are rather good actors, without Evers and showgirls. If you watched this movie, you would notice that Evers screams in almost every line, that is, until he smokes and blows out the nose coldly. <br /> <br /> The special effects were equal to the course in film B like this one. In retrospect, there is nothing so fantastic or bad for this movie in my mind.
