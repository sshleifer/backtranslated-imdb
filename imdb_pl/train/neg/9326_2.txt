I and a group of friends rent terrible movies to laugh at them, I trust that this led to terribly spent money, but also great laughter. SICK. it's one of the better horror movies, but the fun movies we've rented. The conspiracy is overgrown, everyone takes your friends to the forest and they never come back, things are very old. The strangest part of the movie looks like a visit to a local butcher shop, with the exception of a bit more dirty and with blood on a dough that looks like meat. And if anyone ever feared this movie at any time, he should stick to Cartoon Network for the rest of his life, it's pathetic. A good aspect of the movie is that the two girls in it are quite hot, one better than the other and you see them both naked during the movie. Another good aspect is that this movie is sometimes so bad that you will laugh until you cry. I do not like to see horrible acts or rent these horrible films, I do not think this game is good, but seeing the effort that people put in it and still go out so badly, they are fun and worth borrowing. I would laugh at somebody's falls, I recommend him. <br /> <br /> If you rent / buy to laugh, I would give it 8.5.
