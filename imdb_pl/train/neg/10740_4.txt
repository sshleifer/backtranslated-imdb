This film begins with a promise; but, in my opinion, it begins to lose him when the hero kidnaps a good Samaritan who comes to his aid when his car breaks down. The fact that this unearthly stranger is starting to repair his car when it is far away makes the phone unlikely, but she is one of the few people in the country who can help him bring his family back to the right track. Casual beginner writers are warned against using them their stories. <br /> <br /> I found this movie at best. The direction of art could have been much better, as were the pictures. Acting was good, as was the singing of Eva van der Gucht.
