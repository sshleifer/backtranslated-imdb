Filmfour will have to do a lot better than this little movie snot if they want to get the right reputation for themselves. <br /> <br /> This movie takes place in Glasgow (although only a few secondary characters have something akin to a Scottish accent). The assumption that people do not live anywhere who meet in the same cafe in the early hours, because they have night classes, could have done a really funny, insightful, bizarre, iconic movie. Instead, we have a group of saddies and a conspiracy that has been made to pieces, that I am surprised that it has not been banned. X and Y are friends. X sleeps with Z. Y also sleeps with Z. Oh, think about it. <br /> <br /> Total waste of time. Painful dialogue - it sounded like something a group of 16-year-olds would write to the GCSE drama project. The female character was completely superfluous - just saved as a symbolic woman in the hope that women would be tempted to see her. <br /> <br /> If you're the type of boy who laughs about beer ads and maybe He usually wanders in packages screaming on Saturday evenings in unspecified city centers, and then you'll love this movie and consider it the "right sucker". Everyone else, run away, do not go away from this pathetic little mismatch. <br /> <br /> And one question when the group left the "boring" coastal town (by the way Saltcoats, though they changed their name on the film) to go back to Glasgow, WHY did they make it through Forton highway services at LANCASTER in England?
