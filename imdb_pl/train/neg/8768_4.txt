Now, please, do not start calling me names like "unpatriotic", "weirdo" and more. <br /> <br /> The very length of this movie (4 hours .. !!!) is its biggest mistake. No edition - it seems that J.P. Dutta fell in love with his project. Even Lagaan had 4 hours - but he was funny and also gave a message. <br /> <br /> It's based on real incidents and real people. Kudos to this, but were the repetitive war scenes really needed? In addition, the concentration constantly moves from one battalion / squadron to another and it was impossible to track them all. <br /> <br /> There were songs about loneliness, love and related matters between the skirmishes. There were crazy conversations. At the beginning, the violence was somewhat relieved, but later it became so monotonous that it was even possible to properly predict the nature of the upcoming conversation. <br /> <br /> Why did the soldiers walk as if they were lions in the jungle, fully unaware that the enemy lurks somewhere nearby? And when they were shot, it made sympathy, but it seemed that they were not too careful to be so sure of their safety. <br /> <br /> The music was melodious and the lyrics were full of soul, but they did not fit the movie. It's better to listen to them on the soundtrack than in the movie. <br /> <br /> Acting was a thrifty game: from experienced veterans such as Sanjay Dutt and Ajay Devgan, to relative novices such as Abhishek Bachchan and Akshaye Khanna, everyone acted like a pro. Manoj Bajpai and Ashutosh Rana deserve a special distinction for brightening the mood when it is necessary. <br /> <br /> Dialogues ranged from genius ("From Madhuri .. with love !!") to illogical / monotonous ("Pakistan se zyada musalman Hindusthan mein hain"). And the challenging madness consisting of all MC, BC, Cs and F-words was not really required. <br /> <br /> LOC Kargil tries to provide a proper tribute to the brave Indian soldiers, but he tries too hard and eventually fails. Indian soldiers certainly deserve better tribute.
