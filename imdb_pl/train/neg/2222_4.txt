Carlo Verdone once managed to combine a great comedy with intelligent and subtle social analysis and criticism. <br /> <br /> Then something happened and he became the next boring director "holier-than-you". <br /> <br /> Il Mio Miglior Nemico can be more or less summed up in one line "working class = nice and warm, while upper class = snob and cunning. But love wins in the end. " <br /> <br /> Such a trivial banality for such an intelligent director. <br /> <br /> There is not much to tell in the film. Each character is a walking stereotype: a self-proclaimed man who forgets his roots, but again becomes a "good", despised wife, a rebellious rich girl who falls in love with an honest but poor man ... barely average. <br /> <br /> Seriously disappointing in every respect.
