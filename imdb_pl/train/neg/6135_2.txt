America needs the best man to win the "game", so who are they hiring? Gymnast (Oh brother!) Played by Kurt Thomas, who has the necessary skills to win in a game involving a ninja, a village of madmen and Richard Norton, whom Kurt Thomas says "to keep the equipment in his trousers". (His exact words) I missed it in cinemas and this is a good reason, because I would probably be thrown out because of the laughter I cracked into at regular intervals. The first thing that came to my mind was how bad the ninja is if the gymnast can kick their ass. Kurt Thomas is about 5 feet 4 and it's hard to say, "The best man to work". As for Kurt Thomas's acting talent, well, if you can not say something nice ... You have to wonder how much cocaine was used to deliver the idea stupid. Only the decision to quit Tara Reid as a scientist leads to stupidity. For 18 years it was the title of the stupidest movie I've ever seen. I'm not saying that I did not think it was inappropriate, I laughed so much that I almost suffocated myself to death. Twice. It was not until the 1980s that a film with such a bad idea was made. Although for the recording it is the only movie in which the hero has such a weak character, he can not even draw a sword from the ground. This is the greatest action movie ever made and one of the most fun. <br /> <br /> * with 4- (Bad)
