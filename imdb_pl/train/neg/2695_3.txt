When I go to the movie store to rent a movie, I usually trust IMDb's views on the movie and so far I've never seen a movie rated 7.0 or higher on a page I did not like. <br /> <br /> Sidney Lumet, the legendary director of some of the best films of the twentieth century, really mistakenly stepped in here, committing one of the biggest mistakes a filmmaker can make: to fill the cast of a film completely unlike the characters, without real benefits. > <br /> I like movies with defective characters, but no matter how dark the personality is, we all have some light in us, we are all shades of gray with some darker or lighter ones than others. Mr. Lumet crossed this line, filling this film with completely unpleasant and almost masochistic black figures. <br /> <br /> Hank Ethan Hawke is a 30-whine, immature, irresponsible child-man divorced from a wife with a wife who hates him, and a daughter who thinks he is a loser who is very much . His indecisiveness and willingness for others to do a dirty job for him, because he is too cowardly to do this, leads directly to the disintegration of the plan of bank robbery and the killing of his mother. By the end of the movie, before he gets into the fight with his older brother, he's more pathetic than uplifting. Ethan Hawke plays his character well, but he does not have much to work because he is portrayed as someone with a shoe eternally stamped on his face and does not particularly care about being there. <br /> <br /> And for that matter, the wife of his character is equally angry. He verbally criticizes him for rent and money for caring for children in almost every picture he finds in, and then polishes his insanely self-defeated insults. Seriously, it's almost the whole character. Her behavior resembling a harpy borders on bad mood. <br /> <br /> Albert Finney plays Charles' father, and while Mr. Finney has been a great actor for many decades, he spends about 90% of the movie with the same mouth open half a grimace on his face as if he was suffering from the worst constipation attack in the world . For someone who has been an actor for as long as Mr. Finney, you think he would be more prone to emotion. Even if he does not show too much, his character is supposedly sad and full of anger. And when he suffocates Andy after the movie ends, it's like dr. Frankenstein, who created a monster that helped create from his own misery. <br /> <br /> Marisa Tomei does not have much in common with her character. He got stuck in an unhappy marriage with Andy and had an affair with his brother for some unfathomable reason. When Andy's world begins to get out of control, he logically jumps on the ship, but does not really make him less selfish or selfish than any other character in the movie, but probably the one who has at least the most common sense. br /> <br /> And finally, we come to Andy, always good Philip Seymour Hoffman, this is the only reason I rated this movie for 3 instead of 1. His performance of a heroin addict, embezzlement financial director "perfect crime "Robbing an insured parent's jewelry store is unpleasant. His descent from a calm planning master of a faulty scheme to an unstable, insane murderous maniac is credible and tragic. Hoffman's character becomes the main villain of the film, but it is difficult to oppose him, because the alternatives are emotionally neutered younger brother, and the father who admitted to poor early parenthood led to possible psychosis of his son and his mother's indirect, unintentional murder. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this movie is really worth seeing only thanks to the great performance of PSH and his family train. Just do not expect that there will be some characters worth cheering for, because there really is not.
