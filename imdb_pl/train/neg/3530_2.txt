When Ritchie first appeared on the film scene, his films were hailed as funny, witty, well-directed and original. If you can compare the noise that you generated with the first two attempts and the almost universal reluctance created by its last two outputs, consider - whether Ritchie was discovered? Is he really talented? Does it really have any original ideas? Or is he just a pretentious and selfish director who really wants to be Fincher, Tarantino and Leone, all in one colossal and unorganized heap? After watching Revolver, could you justify thinking if everything went wrong? What happened to his great sense of humor? Where did all these mixed and intricate ideas come from? Revolver strives to be wise, philosophical and concise, strives to be intelligent psychoanalysis, tries to be a complicated and complicated thriller. Ritchie makes an enormous effort to meet all these goals and invests great scenario fragments into existential considerations and numerous twists and turns. Ultimately, however, all that serves is to create a publicly very incoherent, unstructured and ultimately hostile movie. His plagiarism is so sinful and blatant that although Ritchie at least tries to give his own turn, he should be punished for even trying to pass it on as his own job. So what ultimately gets the audience is a horrible scenario interspersed with many pretentious artists and clumsy sets. <br /> <br /> A revolver is ultimately a non-original and bland film that stole countless motifs from masterpieces such as Fight Club, Usual Suspects and Pulp Fiction. He aims high, but inevitably shoots nastily. <br /> <br /> Revolver deserves a mistake, it's really a bad movie pretending to be a masterpiece from a would-be author. However, he falls flat on his farce face and simply fails in everything he wants and achieves.
