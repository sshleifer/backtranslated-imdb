The reason I saw it at the cinema was that it was a sneaky preview, otherwise I would never see this horrible teenage slass movie. I mean, have not we had it yet? Scream and Scary Movie at least did not take them seriously! The plot sucks, and acting is the worst I've ever seen. (Only Godzilla can compare, which is also the only movie that competes in the worst I've seen in the cinema with this one.) <br /> <br /> There are so many story lines in the story, and the girls are the same even now you are not, who was killed and who was not. (and you do not care.) The only thing I knew before was Denise and she was the most talented smaller actress I've ever seen in this bad excuse for a movie. <br /> <br /> Stay as far as possible from this movie. (2.10)
