** WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> If you manage to deal with an extremely unpleasant topic, this movie offers a lot of help scandalously besieging melodrama. Surprisingly, this movie has been copied and torn out several times over the years, although it is difficult to grasp any filmmakers inspired by this nightmarish drama. Not one of Hemingway's women can work here (although Mariel CHANGED for years), Anne Bancroft offers the only touch of class as a prosecutor, and Chris Sarandon is pathetic and involuntarily funny as a smarmy, angry guy from the song. <br /> <br /> Veteran director Lamont Johnson can not make a silk purse out of the ear of the dungeon of the script, which is full of defiant evil dialogues and bizarre situations. For example, the last sequence in which Margaux grabs his rifle and chases Sarandon down after his last shocking act, which is supposed to be exciting, but creates a hearty giggle. Add the notoriously penetrating and spatial music of Michel Polnareff and enjoy the real sense of guilt, even if after watching this movie you feel dirty and you need a hot shower. Do not say you have not been warned.
