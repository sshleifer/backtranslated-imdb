I saw on TV late at night. Yes, I hear what everyone is saying. It will probably be classified as one of those stereotypical series of television soaps. To be honest, the plot has something good about it, and you can nod: "Well, I did not expect it." But, as a film, it is not easy to see the element of redemption. Casting, acting, camera work, cars, costumes, set design, script, no, there is nothing to congratulate. Rated R ?? Oh, this scene. Did we need it? It's a movie you can watch and then forget that you even watched it. And what was the title?
