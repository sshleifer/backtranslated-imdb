Nu Image, UFOs and others produce films for the SCI FI channel, which has budgets of around $ 2 million. Some complex effects work, others offer recognizable casts, and others include both - for $ 2 million. <br /> <br /> Mr. Hines initially claimed that the film was budgeted at $ 20 million, but it is painfully obvious that it was probably produced for $ 750,000, if not significantly less. Few sets are used, many scenes are shot on a green screen, and most of the effects seem incomplete and amateur. <br /> <br /> Watching is painful. Not so much, because it is poorly directed, poorly made and badly conducted, but because many of us have been following the progress of this production for a long time and have high hopes for this film, despite its relatively modest budget. <br /> <br /> Those of us who believed in this film, when it was originally announced, joined the legions of those that PT Barnum spoke about.
