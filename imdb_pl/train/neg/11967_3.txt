Considering the risk of showing same-sex relationships before the end of the eighties, Personal Best could do better by playing the same relationship between Hemingway (Chris Cahill) and Donnelly (Tora Skinner) as more than the experimental phase of Cahill's life. br /> <br /> It seems to me that the creators of this film threw the same-sex relationship between two rather attractive women to attract viewers. Also take 90 seconds to uncover the crotch of several women jumping back over the high pitch pole. This random scene had a VERY small meaning for the film and it seemed that it was done only to interest the audience with this film. I suppose the producers tried to counteract the boring plot and even more boring scenery of the film (Athletics Contest in Oregon in 1980). <br /> <br /> This review may seem rough, but it's true. The exploitation of young Muriel Hemingway's body and same-sex relationships ruined all the merits that I would give to this film. <br /> <br /> Pepper Thompson
