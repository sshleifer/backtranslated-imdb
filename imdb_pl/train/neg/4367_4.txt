One of the real clinkers of Boris Karloff. Essentially, dying Karloff (who looks about 120 years older than him) is a scientist in need of cash to complete his experiments before he died. Moving from Morocco, where his funds are taken over by someone else, he goes to the south of France, where he works as a doctor, trying to scrape enough money to prove his theories. Desperate for money, he made a deal with the young rich wife of a dying cotton baron. He will finance it if he helps her poison her husband so she can take his money and continue to giglio (which I think he is married to). If you think that by watching the movie, you made a mistake, I had to read what others wrote to find out. Why? because this movie lost me in two minutes. I had no idea what was going on with his many characters and many converging plot lines. Little talk and much is said until I really did not care at the end of that time. It's a boring mess that's only interesting for Karloff's performance, which is sometimes quite strange. Honestly, this is the only time I saw him in the bizarre territory of Bela Lugosi. It's not every scene, but a few and I wonder how much they are having fun.
