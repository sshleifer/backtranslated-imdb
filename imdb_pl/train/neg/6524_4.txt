The Angry Red Planet (Quickie Review) <br /> <br /> Like the "Planet X Man", this is a bizarre science fiction tale drawn from an era in which fantasy and science fiction were still damned close to the same thing. This means that we have very funny special effects and crazy science-fiction pseudo-science. And yes, it's another "classic" in high-quality transmission with a clear image and sharp sound - by Midnite Movies. <br /> <br /> So the main reason for watching this movie? Oh, it's definitely all the time our space crew is on Mars. (What, did you think "Angry Red Planet" refers to Neptune?) Previously there is a rather poor space crew getting on a space ship, inside which they smoke and throw a sexist chauvinistic banter directed to the "weak woman" crew member. By today's standards, it would be a bit offensive if it was not so damn funny. But Mars is the real reason why we are watching this thing. The film is generally black and white, but Mars, well, Mars screams with blood red. He was filmed in this bizarre, red plastic, giving the angry red planet a fairly interesting appearance of the illuminated red. It's really an incredible sight - just like viewers from space (ha ha). The best is "ratbatspidercrab". Do you think it's a joke? That's what they call in the movie! It is a gigantic chimera (a small puppet) of a thing combining the features of rats, bats, spiders and crabs. It embraces all students and frightens our "heroic crew." There are other strange and poorly imagined aliens that can be seen, but this one takes a cake. Finally, after their shocking experience on Mars, the sexist crew gets on their "ship" and returns to any planet from which it came. <br /> <br /> This is not for everyone. Lovers of science fiction film and curiosity seekers, as well as some film lovers. Fans of the Mystery Science Theater 3000 will have this day (if they have never reached it in the program). <br /> <br /> 2/10 Modern rating, 6/10 Nostalgia score, 4/10 in general. <br /> <br /> (www.ResidentHazard.com)
