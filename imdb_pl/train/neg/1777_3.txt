If you are the type of cinema fan who likes original content and intelligent tension ... then look elsewhere, children, because sleepwalkers really suck. I'm usually more eloquent, but ... wow ... it was bad. I particularly like it when Charles offers a ride to Tanyi home, he refuses, and then he sees WALKING HOME. Where is his car? Anyway, I just can not see it, people. I really want to be more specific, but the words elude me. Cats jumping on people. The guy gets stabbed by corn. Cheesey sets the proverbial "wazoo". Just do not see it. Wait, I'm receiving it! See how the screenwriter Stephen King is a cameraman who owns the cemetery. It's pretty good. Even with the guest appearances of Mark Hamill and Ron Perlman, King gives the best performance of the film. But other than that ... wow ... BAD.
