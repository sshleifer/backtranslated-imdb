Oh, Italians! Assuming that movies about aristocrats with strange fetishes, castles sunk in a gothic atmosphere and relatives in the back, trying to get a drop, are inherently interesting for everyone! If you've seen one of these types, you've seen them all (the favorite MST3K "Screaming Skull" also matches the form) ... and "Evelyn's night is out of the grave" is formal, - numbers and boring as hell. Even the juicy Erika Blanc is wasted here. <br /> <br /> zero / 10 <br /> <br />
