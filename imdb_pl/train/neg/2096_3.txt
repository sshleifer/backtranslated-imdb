As a big fan of only the first two seasons of BSG and the independent function of BSG Razor I, I hoped that this version would restore the franchise to the original glory days. Usually, I have no problem with science fiction, which is mainly driven by dialogues, in contrast to the visual special effects bonanza. If the scenario is tight with some of the original ideas provided by good actors, you can create a deep movie with little CGI spending. This prequel does not have any of the above requirements. The world of virtual reality created by terrorist teenagers was both ridiculous and unbelievable. This scene has just been put in place to raise the Restricted release rating. Not that teenagers do not love the virtual reality of Mosh Pits filled with sex and violence and heavy dance music. It's about the same teenagers who have intellectual depth and reason, political and religious passion to create such futuristic software or become suicide bombers that embarrass me. These children certainly do not come from this planet. The film is played like a soap opera, and the last 10 minutes are a bit interesting. The scene in which Eric Stolz gave his cyborg a sincere belief by updating the student's software was fun, if not fun. But this old concept was much better presented and more credible in the brilliant, classic "Frankenstein" with Boris Karloff. Caprica pulls out his only interesting idea from an old Hollywood horror movie. There is no surprise! In general, this movie was bland and unoriginal and cheap, using the processed CGI Caprica from BSG. I doubt if I will be watching this cosmic soap when it will premiere on the Sci-Fi channel. Unless of course I do not suffer from insomnia of insomnia, at which time it will definitely be a medicine. zzzzzzzz
