David Mamet's film debut has been hailed by many as a true thinker film, a movie that makes you question everyone and everything. I last saw it for the first time and could not understand what should be so great about it. <br /> <br /> The film tells about a female psychologist Margaret, who is also the author of bestsellers. Margaret was disappointed in her profession and her inability to help anyone. He's trying to fix it by helping to regulate the gambler's debt of a shark patient named Mike (played by Joe Mantegna, who is the only reason for watching this movie). He discovers that Mike is in fact a professional man of trust when he almost falls victim to a fraud he pulls out immediately after meeting her. Intrigued, she returns to him and asks him to show her how the cheaters work (she plans to use it as the subject of a new psychological book). Then he falls on him and accompanies him during a long concert, that he and his associates founded. <br /> <br /> I do not want to go into details, but at the end of the movie, it turns out that the events of the whole movie were an elaborate horse Mike and his buddies to cheat Margaret with $ 80,000. <br /> <br /> Above all, the big turn towards the end was VERY predictable. Each scene in which the opponents functioned was very evident thanks to stage actors and strange verse readings. Not only that, but the audience (and the main character) know that they are dealing with cheaters, so is it really a great surprise when we find out that Margaret has been cheated? In addition, Margaret is apparently an intelligent psychologist who is an expert in reading people, but allows himself to be too deceived - and remember that he knows perfectly well that Mike is a crook. <br /> <br /> Secondly, we were led to the belief that Margaret had been cheated from the very beginning, but in order for her to work, she had to do a few things that the fraudsters could not foresee. First, she had to decide to help settle the patient's debt, which allowed her to meet with the fraudsters. If she did not do it, the whole opponent would fail. I just have to say that it is quite unreasonable to assume that the psychologist intends to take on the regulation of the patient's gambling debt. Not only this, but what are the chances that the opponents will be in the right place on the same night when they decided to appear? Have they appeared in this bar every evening, hoping he will come and see them? Another thing that must have happened, which could not have been foreseen, was that Margaret had to go back to see Mike again and ask him to teach her the tricks of his trade. What are the chances for this? And yet the whole con is based on this assumption. <br /> <br /> Another problem I had was the ending. Margaret learns that she has been deceived and decides to take revenge on Mike. Initially, Mamet believes that he intends to oppose fraud, but it ends, so the final ending is to shoot Mike in the baggage area at the airport. Somehow it seemed like an awkward and inept way to end the movie about cheaters doing business. Not only that, but she did not even get the money he stole. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the film leaves a feeling of emptiness and dissatisfaction. And if you, like me, have predicted that Margaret will be deceived, this revelation will be equally unsatisfactory for you.
