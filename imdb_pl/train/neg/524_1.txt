The "40-year-old virgin" exists in a world that I do not understand. A world where an electronics store employee can tell his boss to "jump out" and broadcast videos from his naked ass across the store and not get reprimanded. A world in which it is really funny to drive around drunkenly and crash cars of other people. A world in which the boss seems to be sexually abusing his subordinates. A world full of raging and insulting stereotypes of ethnic minorities. And the world without funny jokes! I am completely shocked by the seeming chorus of viewers who liked this movie. I thought that every scene is like a bad sketch Saturday Night Live - not very funny at first and stretched beyond all rational thought. The chest waxing scene lasted FOREVER. <br /> <br /> The heroes, except for Carell, were all alone. And romantic elements were completely invented, especially the scene in which Keener finds porn in Carell's apartment. It was just bad. <br /> <br /> And I found that the sequence of "Aquarius" is completely irritating and excessive. I hated the hated movie!
