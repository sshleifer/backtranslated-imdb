I realize that the American army was demoralized until 1971, but this movie was unbelievable. It was supposed to be a training camp, not a SS penal battalion in the novel by Sven Hassell. The writer must be a real enemy of the army. The psychic sergeant, who still beat nonsense, belonged to a prison cell, and a useless sergeant from Czarna GÃ³ra should also be released. These people were going abroad, the receiving units would certainly wonder where all the useless damaged recruits come from, and an investigation would take place. The scene that completely destroyed it was electric shock. Farrell, an alleged barrister's lawyer, would have a barrel instructor for the illegal order (torturing prisoners of war against the Geneva Convention), a real attack on a man, sexual assault and indecent behavior for an officer. Intead he just goes away. After this, the discipline inhibits to the level of a madhouse, and the movie becomes impossible to watch. I do not know how it ended, I went to bed.
