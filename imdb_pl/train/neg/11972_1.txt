The first ten minutes of "Just Looking" really dictates the direction in which most of this film is headed. Lenny (Ryan Merriman) is a 14-year-old boy living in New York in the 1950s. He has a burning desire for two people to have sex. Who are the best people he thinks about? Well, of course his own mother and stepfather! How nice. Unfortunately for Lenny, he is caught before he sees anything and is sent away for the summer to stay with his uncle and uncle's wife. <br /> <br /> Lenny's next plan is to see how his uncle and his wife have sex. However, the wife is pregnant and are not sleeping together. Then Lenny creates a new friend. He and his pal spend most of their free time with a few girls. They have a small club where they sit and talk about sex. The problem is ... it's not done in an innocent, charming way in the '50s. WHAT ARE NOT WEAKY, but I think that listening to these kids is about masturbation, blowjob and anal sex. This kind of austerity may work in a movie such as "Kids" (1995), but in this movie it seems to be simply perverted. <br /> <br /> Gretchen Mol is completely wasted as Hedy, a former bra model that becomes the object of Lenny's bodily desires. Jason Alexander must stay as far as possible from the director's chair. "For Better Or Worse" (1996) was awful and now it is. What a loss. 1/10
