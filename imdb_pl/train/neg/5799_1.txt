Yesterday I rented this movie mainly due to the nice art and summary on the back of the jacket. After putting it in the DVD player, I re-examined the cover of the jacket and although I removed the cover from the plastic browser, I STILL could not read any detailed information about the film. This movie is titled Evil on the Jacket and he had to find it by visiting the Faith Films website to find out what links to this movie are on the IMDb website. <br /> <br /> Filming and special effects made in the film looked pretty good ... THEN the actor reading the poems spoke. Oh, oh ... reading this actor sounded like some pimply high school student whose voice just changed his pitch and did not try to go beyond reading the line from the script. At first I thought I had a broken audio sync board, and then I had to suppose it was a foreign movie because I could not read the jacket ... English dubbing. If they cast the right person to copy the dialog, this movie CAN be decent. I gave him a chance for about 20 minutes before I threw him out, when I discovered that the bad line reader would not be killed, but would remain a permanent master device. Yes, it's so bad! The art of jacket covers and the art made in the film are great, so she gave one star, but minus 1 999 999 stars for a rotten window. I do not recommend this!
