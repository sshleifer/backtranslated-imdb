this video is for the Asian / Chinese market, especially for fans of Jay Chou, one of the biggest music stars in Asia. <br /> <br /> Jay Chou is a very talented author / singer. He is an average actor, although he has appeared in several large budget productions ("initial D", "Curse of the Golden Flower"). It is amazing that he won both gold prizes (Taiwan) and Hong Kong prizes for the "initial D". <br /> <br /> The supporting staff is very well chosen, which speaks for all of us in principle. The cast included many well-known film / television actors, singers and even sports commentators (Huang Jianxiang from China). However, they were not given enough time to show their talents. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake is that Chu has taken over both the director's and the writer's job. It has a reputation for producing shallow and brainless movies based on inconsistent scripts. With his poor director and lama history, the entire talented cast, fancy visual effects and production sounds were wasted. <br /> <br /> However, the scary movie successfully won over 10 million dollars, maybe even more in Asia, which made it one of the biggest box office successes in Asia. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that you can watch this movie only when you want to see how your money and talents are wasting or if you're just accompanying your children who are fans of Jaya Chou.
