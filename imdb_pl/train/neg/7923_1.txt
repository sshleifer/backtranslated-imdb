I am a big fan of Ted V Mikels, and the original "Corpse Grinders" is the main reason, but it's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Even the brilliant cast of the legendary Liz Renay ("Desperate Living") could not save this worthless piece of rubbish. This movie should be a lesson for all former, current and future filmmakers ... when you have a movie as successful as the original Corpse Grinders, you should probably give up sleeping dogs and you should definitely not try to revive it more than twenty years later (unless you have financial support to get a better sequel, such as Herschel Gordon Lewis, who did with "Blood Feast 2: All U can Eat"). Even if you decide to do this, you probably should sacrifice some more money than the original and for God's sake. ... NEVER shoot a video on video ... why filmmakers even try to do it, when everyone knows that quality will turn out to be hideous ... Personally, I have not seen one film made in this way, which would be even worth the powder to blow up go to hell ... if you can not afford to continue the movie, which is better than the original movie, it deals give the film rights to someone who can ... what did Ted V Mikels think (or smoke) when he wrote this god - a wful script? I mean "aliens" of dogs and cats from another planet? A cardboard box painted to look like a destructive machine capable of grinding human bodies ... bones and clothes and everything? If any of these actors, apart from Liz Renay, receive more than five dollars for their hideous performances, they are significantly overpaid! Avoid this video at all costs and view the original instead.
