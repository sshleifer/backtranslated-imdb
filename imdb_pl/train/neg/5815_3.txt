I really could not wait for this movie based on the announcement and press I received, but after watching it I was very disappointed. Slums is a completely uninteresting film mixed up with the kind of disturbing family reality of Todd Solondz, who is not Todd's joke. History stretches, and each scene is worse than the previous one. Maybe I missed the point, but if this movie is an example of growing up every girl, I'm happy that I'm a man.
