Even Timothy Hutton and David Duchovny could not save this dead fish from the movie. At the beginning, the script was written to create the movie B, but somehow Duchovny (looking for a star vehicle to get out of television) and Hutton (looking for "two" "blows two" he hoped he would define his career after "Ordinary People" will be tied to the image: Trashy lines, big bad tissues from the stage to the stage (Come on - who uses tissues after the 12th telecommunications class?), And the usual old evil actor drowns the film. Even Duchovny is not immune to malfunctioning the plague that this movie is. Only Timothy Hutton rises above the material, I have to admit that I feel Duchovny's pain when he reads the lines of the teacher, while I was laughing when I'm sure the director wanted me to get scared , nothing prepared me to shut down Duchonvey's voice line: "if you ever need a doctor, call 911." If only the studio called a 911, this dog from the movie would never have been created. Avoid at all costs. <br /> <br />
