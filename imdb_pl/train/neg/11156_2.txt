Dark Wolf Let's get to it: this is a hideous piece of rotting roadkill with a cow on its head. It's just a terrible movie. This is a movie about an urban werewolf in which you can find the worst acting and a story as weak as any gangster from the 80s. To make matters worse, poor Kane Hodder has been cheated by playing the giant werewolf bad. Kane f * cking Hodder. Someone is trying to ensure that Jason Voorhees is the pinnacle of his film career ... <br /> <br /> In any case, the film is also Playmate Jaime Bergman, who eventually becomes a werewolf. This is the shitty drama of a policeman with the worst looking Werewolf in the world. But he has moments of almost sudden nudity. But that's all. Want to know more? Okay, the werewolf is usually an ugly-looking black spot fastened around the screen. And when we're so privileged that we actually see the transformation sequence, we present something that resembles video in full motion from a video game created in the early stages of the Playstation. First Playstation. CG animation is really so primitive. Only good for horror fanatics who want to see small moments of nakedness surrounded by crazy visual vomit. 2/10 <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
