Stewart Moss plays the role of a scientist who travels with his wife, and one can get the impression that he was chosen for this role because of his ability to roll his eyes back ... imagine the interrogation. can you ... no, that's not all, thank you, come on! ". In any case, he is bitten by a bat, and then he turns into a bat and kills people, or ... he is not. Because no one else sees his strange changes, but he seems to think that he is changing because his ring pops up when his hands turn into claws, etc. On the basis of the film, in a sense, the film abstains from just crazy, or in fact, transforms into something almost to the very end. It has good locations and sometimes a decent atmosphere, but unfortunately none of them can make up for a bit of bad history and wonderfully bad activity. Fun in "so bad is a good" way, but more inclined towards bad. 4 out of 10.
