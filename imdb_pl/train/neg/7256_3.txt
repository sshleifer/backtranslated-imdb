I bought this movie on a blu-ray because it promised great visual effects and music. I was also a big fan of a similar film ... Barak. The film is very stylized for Barak, wide angles, very similar shots with cameras set to capture a long transition in every shot. Even some of the scenes were identical (street with traffic). While Baraka told a wonderful story, juxtaposing nature, the environment created by man, spirituality and horrors of the world in a fascinating way and great music, this movie simply jumped from the picture to the stage, without extensive history, average music, and then. ... POOF, this is the end! I thought there must be some mistake! World history? Half of the movie is Egypt and the landscape (looks like Arizona, but I did not bother checking). Seriously, people, it's terrible, to rent, if you have to, but do not buy. The filmmakers should be ashamed of revealing it.
