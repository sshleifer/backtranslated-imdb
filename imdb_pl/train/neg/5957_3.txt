Unimportant and boring (haha!) Horror of the 80s, like thirteen per dozen, but it can be considered funny if you watch it in the right state of mind. Special effects are shoddy, terrible acting, and the scenario seems to be losing some important paragraphs! "The Brain" takes place in a typically peaceful American town, where every teenager works in the same restaurant and where a cool child in high school drops cherry bombs to the toilet. It is here that the television guru named Dr Blake and his adorable brain-brain begin to search for mind control across the country. Under the banner of "independent thinkers," a huge cheesy brain sends waves through televisions and forces innocent spectators to kill! What is it great? Now Rebel Meadowvale must save the world! The funniest thing about the story is that it never explains where Dr. Blake comes from and his monstrous brain. There are obvious references to extraterrestrial life, but that's the point. Who needs background in such a movie, really? Unfortunately, there is not so much bloodshed, and the "bad" brain looks like an exaggerated marionette. The only more or less interesting element for lovers of horror is the look at the cast and crew that created this movie. Director Ed Hunt and writer Barry Pearson are the same people who created "Bloody Birthday" (my guilty pleasure) and "Plague". Both are much better films and wisely decided to give up the film industry. The most famous face in the cast is undoubtedly the great David Gale, whose fans of horror films will love forever for their role in Re-Animator. A girl named Christine Kossak provides a nudity factor, and she is of course a great talent? In her repertoire, she has exactly three films, of which TO is her "masterpiece". In her debut she was considered a "escaping model", and in "3 men and a child" her character is referred to as "one of Jack's girlfriends". I really wonder how she feels about her actress career?
