"Nightmare Weekend" Henry Sala is a rotten piece of Troma sediment. It is a youthful, scruffy and stupid horror with low-budget movies about teenagers spending the weekend at the residence. The professor's evil assistant lures the girls into a bizarre scheme for performing hideous experiments. Using a brain implant, he transforms his victims and their dates into zombies. "Nightmare Weekend" is a completely mushy piece of garbage, which contains a lot of nudity and cheesy gore, not to mention the funny musical result. Acting is frightening, and the script is completely inconsistent. Why such a piece of nonsense is widespread is beyond me. Avoid it like plagues.1 out of 10.
