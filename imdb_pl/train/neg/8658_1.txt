A large part of the scenes should be cut off. There are many scenes that should be cut off. For example, a scene in which hunters mention: "I have spiders on my dick", "I like a dick", playing on a mud scene or a bar scene where the snake charmer is the main task of dinocrocele hunters. <br /> <br /> What about other horribly inconsistent scenes with a woman, Diane, who wants to lose her virginity to a boy who walks like she wears three sizes too small. When they love each other, did not they realize that they are doing it next to a little boy who will soon run away and lose his head? Why did they do it in the living room? I mean, his head really turned away. What do you say to the beach scene very reminiscent of Steven Spielberg's Jaw scene at Grant Lake. All this strange scene could easily be renamed and exposed to comedy. <br /> <br /> Here in my local city cinemas have been advertising for months about Dinocroc and I'm glad I did not watch because later I found out that it was only displayed for 1 or 2 days before it was canceled. The film was BAD. I suspected that Dinocroc was not a good movie, looking at the preview. He has a Dinocroc leg that looks like a child in green pajamas and slippers with claws and goes up and down like a 2-year-old. It could easily be taken over by Baby Geniuses. <br /> <br /> If any student filming wants to know what not to do, it's a real classic basket. Like Diane's boyfriend, who walks, like in the advanced case of syphilis, makes you wonder what a poor woman can see with this guy who looks drunk before he drinks a beer. When this happens, who cares about Dinocroc? Panties looked more interesting than the entire Dinocroca movie. His behavior was so bad that it replaced Mr. Bean much better. MOVE OVER ROWAN ATKINSON, here's a man with a better comedy talent in science-fiction horror. Perhaps the worst casting in Hollywood history.
