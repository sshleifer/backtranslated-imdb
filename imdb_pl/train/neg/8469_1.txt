"Kids Like These" could have been a decent movie considering the subject. But instead, it became the average TV movie of the week, which is not very popular. The operation is outdated, the plot is predictable and the direction does not exist. To get a better movie on the same topic, try out the excellent "Le Huiti√®me Jour", a movie that really takes care of people with Down's syndrome. In "Kids Like These" they are used only as a pretext for tearful sentimentality. Pretty scary. 1/10
