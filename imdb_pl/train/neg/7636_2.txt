I wanted to believe this film so much after the only form of the mainstream comedy that this country recognizes is slapstick and stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Of course, it went completely different - let's be cool and nervous - and we left little to show on the other side. I bet One Small Seed went mad because of it. I know SL did it. <br /> <br /> None of the main characters have comedic chops to do it. Even Danny K had a better time. Actually, I'm serious. Every time they introduced a bit character, I thought: "Shit, this person should be a leader!". <br /> <br /> Independence does not mean that camera operation must be terrible. Black-and-white did nothing for this film - actually, in such a flat dialogue, he hurt it even more, boring boredom. Black and white was not sharp either. The composition was terrible. Using music was terrible. Strangely, after this movie I watched Little Miss Sunshine, and the composition on it was great - maybe that is why the gaps in this movie remain in my head. <br /> <br /> I think Corne (who was more fun than lead before he even said anything) spoke to this movie, not David - see it and understand. I bet the guys who organize Oppikoppi were terrified. You would think that nothing is happening there. I have the impression that it could have been filmed in someone's garden. I know regular guys who have much more fun, bizarre and more witty conversations than these "comics". The guy with whom he made the end was fine. <br /> <br /> Comedy Guess SA will remain in the Stone Age a bit longer. Nice job.
