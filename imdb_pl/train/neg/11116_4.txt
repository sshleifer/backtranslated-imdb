This woman, who works as a photographer for the photographer, returns home and takes a bath where she discovers the hole in the ceiling. So she learns that her neighbor is her photographer. This movie could have a great story, but then the plot exhausts all hope. The problem with this movie is that every ten seconds someone snorts heroin. If they took out scenes in which someone would sniff heroin, it would be a pretty good movie. Every time I thought a scene was going somewhere, someone was inhaling a white powder. It was really bad to have so many drugs in one movie. It attracted the attention of the main story and a great story about photographs. Lesbian things did not bother me. I was looking for a movie about art. I found a movie about drug use.
