The original movie (with the date of 19 ??) did not show any "monster", only SUGEROWED the terrifying "things". <br /> <br /> This version, however, shows every aspect of the "sick spirit", including unnecessary special effects. <br /> <br /> The "mystery" presented in the original movie was the most frightening part: you just did not know what caused the strange things that happened. Showing the face of an "old man", this gentleman completely disappeared. What's worse: special effects (crying faces of children) are funny. It's a stupid remake, too spectacular to be even as frightening as the original
