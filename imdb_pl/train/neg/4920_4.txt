Very clever, modern (retaining sensual fashion) reorganization of Dracula's story (although remaining with traditional customs) with quite an interesting, if not fully understood, story of the prince of darkness. I tried to look at it for the first time, I could only do it halfway before losing interest. It's good again (especially scenes with thieves, and then their encounters with Dracula), but for me it's less engaging when it hits New Orleans to focus on Van Helsing's daughter. A great place to set it up, but it never used its settings (despite picking a paradise in hell, where Dracula could grow). Produced by Wes Carven (they still throw this name out), but written / directed by Patrick Lussier. She artistically had her moments with a few spectacular visualizations, but some kinetic editions and cheap shocks do not help. The messy script gets very stupid. Lussier performs a polished work that remains rather glassy, ​​puts a lot of blood (makeup is adequately achieved) and many "Virgin" commercials. No, I do not mean virgins, it's a music company because it has a lot of pictures and there is also Helsing's daughter. Oh, it was not obvious planting. The soundtrack is a fun selection of rock melodies. Now the shows are all over the store, but there are a few familiar faces (Danny Masterson, Sean Patrick Thomas, Nathan Fillion, Shane West and Lochlyn Munro). Gerard Butler as Dracula just did not leave because there was not too much. It just got shined by the lucky ladies of the night; Jennifer Esposito, Colleen Fitzpatrick and Jeri Ryan as fiance of Dracula. People like Jonny Lee Millar and Justine Waddell are fine. Christopher Plummer wins a staggering round because Van Helsing and Omar Epps play his role.
