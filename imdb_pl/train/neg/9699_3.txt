Despite what many other people thought about the first film, I liked it a lot. This one however. How do you sum it up in one word?: This movie is (and the word is coming): CRAP! <br /> <br /> But let's look at it in part: Here's the plot: Finally, the old queen has been removed from her castle, but her successor: Snow White has other problems: The Court jester, her son's father, went astray as a super , Spliss, goes to the extreme to fight his gray hair and sell royal offspring for some blond and full hair. In desperation, Snow White is looking for help from Bubi (Otto Walkees), who must first find the other six pygmy companions, and then try to find the royal offspring or at least try to find the name Rumpelstiltskin. <br /> <br /> The whole story seems to be written at the weekend, where the writers were very drunk, but they were under pressure from the studio to write a script. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are good jokes. Even for fans of the first part, or for fans of other actors, it's really not worth buying a DVD. Believe me. <br /> <br /> The only thing that at least protects the film from total oblivion is the performances of some actors. That's why I gave 3/10 traffic. Unfortunately, the scenario is so bad that neither actor nor any of them can compensate for the bad story. <br /> <br /> For example, at some point they even go through our reality and unfortunately ... they are not doing anything funny being here. <br /> <br /> There are still many great actors in this movie: Otto Waalkes, Ralf Schmitz, Martin Schneider, Nina Hagen, Cosma Shiva Hagen (Particularly funny): RÃ¼diger Hoffmann as a mirror, Helge Schneider and many but unfortunately all of you comedians are not able to revive this really bad scenario. <br /> <br /> Maybe this is a treat for some hardcore fans, but for ordinary movie viewers or DVD now. The borrower or buyer is not worth the money. <br /> <br /> I even regret that I rented a movie.
