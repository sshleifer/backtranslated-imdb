A lot of stupid holes in the movie. First, we see him watching his master practicing kung fu and die during his practice. It's fine for me. And then at the end of the movie, we see how he uses the kung fu he learned by watching his master when he was a child. Is it even possible? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> This concert is only for fans of Jay Chou, and the film lacks depth in terms of character development, cinematographic styles and story development. <br /> <br /> Someone noticed that the captain of the basketball team (he forgot his name) and the idolized player Li Xiao look so much to each other, to the extent that one would think that they are the same person? Long hair, the boy's look in the sun, high and strong. They both looked like they were leaving a mass factory designed to release products that make teenage girls scream wildly in orgasm. It is not that these two actors have something valuable to contribute to the film as a whole for the film industry. <br /> <br /> The jokes were bad and not fun at all. The scene regarding the four masters of Jay Chou who came back to help him on the basketball court turned into a pointless story when they started fighting in the style of the Royal Rumble alba. Worse, when 4 champions won the fight, the crowd began to cheer and the match continued. Was it really WTF? moment. <br /> <br /> At the end of the show, when they win the match, all thanks to the great skills of kung fu Jaya Chou. How he got these kung fu skills is a mystery because the show somehow shows him gaining skills only by watching his master. <br /> <br /> And then his long-lost father leaves the carpentry to recognize Jay Chou as his long-lost son seemed a bit too quick to finish the movie. <br /> <br /> In short, it's Jay Chou-flick (instead of the usual "chick flick"). Watch this only when Jay Chou is your fan. If you're one of those whose tastes in movies are very much the same as those on the top 250 IMDb movie list of all time, this movie is not for you.
