A truly terrible Canadian-German co-production, always a great Rosanna Arquette plays an actress whose teenage daughter redefines the term "problem child" - a few weeks before the "action" that the child murdered her father, and mother took the offspring. Now she has moved to the Northwest United States to start over, but her child is still having a problem because she is devoted to her mother. Dedicated so much that it kills anyone who can be seen as a threat to their relationship. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately Mandy Schaeffer (as a daughter) murders more than people - delivers such a terrible performance that also wipes off the film, despite the inconsistent script, useless direction and scary music (check the saxophone when it shows its first time bikini bod) do not help; we should consider her sexy and frightening, but she fails in both cases. Almost completely infallible and not even bad enough to be funny (not to mention that Arquette and Schaeffer are not really convincing as mother and daughter), all condolences for Miss Arquette and Jurgen Prochnov, who are worth much more than that, and both (especially Rosanna) are the only reasonable reasons for anyone to sit in this farrago. <br /> <br /> One of the production companies is called Quality International Films - not from the three-hour "Love, Lies And Murder" (from Two Short Productions) was "you must be a joke".
