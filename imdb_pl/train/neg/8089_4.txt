I do not know what Donald Sutherland's style or vocal style is, but it always seems to be playing from behind a massive roll of soggy handkerchief. He's just ... I do not know, THICK? Somnambulistic? On medicines? Weird. <br /> <br /> I said that for the first time I saw the movement for the first time since its first release, and to be honest, I do not remember ending something similar. Bad ending, because nothing is binding. And what about your dead husband? Annoying child (and whether the child was named?)? The Scotland Yard and the military pursuers? I would like something to wrap everything and give a dramatic closure of all this, not just a large panoramic departure. <br /> <br /> And what does a woman sleep with a man she knows, just killed her husband? Even if she tried to dispel the Needle's suspicions to protect her child, she could always feel a headache. This last meeting made me feel too itchy and uncomfortable ...
