Gayniggers from Outer Space is a short foreign movie about black homosexual aliens who are exploring the galaxy until they encounter Earth. Being gay, their goal is to create a universe exclusively for men, in which all men are gay. Thus, when they discover women or "female creatures", they live on Earth, they are initially terrified; ultimately, they decide to eliminate all women on the planet and unleash the male population. <br /> <br /> An offensive title with a racist, homophobic and sexist plot, though probably designed as a satire, gives the film a certain shock value. However, there is little substance underneath. As another reviewer noted, there are a few jokes in addition to the names of the heroes (eg ArmInAss); I think I once laughed at one small gay joke. I think I quickly understood the meaning of the movie, the satire of bad science fiction, but then I had enough; I still wanted the movie to end (and this is a short movie!). Not brilliant or particularly well written.
