I sincerely believe that EVERYONE, given filming, will be subjected to this amazing defeat. Like "movies" by Edward Wood, Jr. in the '60s and' 70s, this movie is a great example of why real filmmakers make so many scenarios of rewriting energy, re-editing their films and re-creating special effects, and finally Look right. This film is also a decent argument for the pre-selection process of the studio. If Mr. Hines were forced to endure the sincere reactions of an impartial audience, perhaps he would cut 75% or walk / run / walk scenes and edit the film to more bearable 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Pupils of the film should perceive this film as an example of how dangerous their work "good enough" can really be. Every performance, every line of dialogue, every digital effect, every filter effect, and even every frame of the film expresses the danger of striving for ordinary mediocrity. A beginner filmmaker may, from time to time, be tempted to think: "At least I have achieved something SOMETHING" or "Only this completion will be an achievement in itself". This video will help them understand how much the movie may turn out. <br /> <br /> Critics can also take advantage of watching this movie before they finish their latest summer entertainment, "the worst movie ever made." <br /> <br /> Beginner writers can learn from this film how important remakes are and perhaps understand the need to rewrite. Beginner directors can also learn how important a good script is and a degree of respect for how difficult it is to write a script that makes the audience feel emotionally compelled to tell a story. Writers and directors who watch bad TV movies of the week and think that "I can do better than THIS" see the idea of ​​this movie, how difficult it is to get even mediocre results. <br /> <br /> I sincerely believe that this movie can be used as an educational tool for beginning filmmakers. Especially those who enter the unit in this present environment after Lucas and after Spielberg. There is a reason why filmmakers, like you, have been hailed because of their special effects. The war of worlds clearly shows that not everyone can do it. Some people can not even get close to him.
