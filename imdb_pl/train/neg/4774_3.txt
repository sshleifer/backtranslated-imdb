I am not sure if the filmmakers were behind the film Saw or 12 Angry Men (people combine facts to learn the truth). Whatever it was, it was badly done and it was not worth watching. <br /> <br /> I do not watch movies for blood and blood, but because this movie had nothing else to do, he should have shown the real murder more. Most of them were out of the camera, minimizing the horror we should feel after death. <br /> <br /> The fact that the policeman was among the victims also listened to me; unconsciously, he contributed to the innocent young man going to prison, taking the seated evidence (handed over to him by MJH) to the evidence room. (And would not MJH be a prosecutor, he would not have access to this evidence - to get them out and give away bad evidence - in any case, to not need the help of a cop?). Others, though often unaware that it was the particular person they hurt, they continued to play larger roles in their final fall. A weapon dealer should know that his weapon will be used for evil intentions. The insurance guy rejected the person who apparently was in need, etc. But the cop's crime seemed small compared to him because he did not know exactly what he was doing. The creators of the film could go a step further and make him the one who encouraged MJH to plant evidence, which would make him more guilty. And the shout of MJH that he (the policeman) made her mess, does not make any sense. <br /> <br /> It would be more intriguing if every person died in a way that gave the clue to why he was there and deserved to die. For example, the insurer might have rejected applications that pushed him down his throat, so he choked; the eastern woman could have picked her eyes because she was a false witness, etc. Yes, more brutal than the death of pistols, but more interesting. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was not witty, there were no twists and the ending was one of the worst (if not the worst) I've ever seen. The conclusion ended with the departure of three stars from my assessment. <br /> <br /> The actors did a decent job, especially considering the garbage lines and motivation they had to work with. <br /> <br /> Generally, wastage of time.
