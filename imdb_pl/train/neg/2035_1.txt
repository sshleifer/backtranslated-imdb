I've been learning about the Zodiac for four years. And I'm not saying that I know much more than anybody else ... in fact, most people who know Z, read and learn about Z, I'm the one who has the least knowledge ... But I know or at least think I know that most things would not happen ... From how he signed his name ... how he killed people ... I thought Godfather was the worst movie in history ... br /> <br /> Photos were by a five-year-old ... not saying that my films are better, but I'm not someone who makes films for a mass population ... <br /> <br /> Acting, which I thought for the most part, was really good, really ... the host did not speak so much in the camera or I forgot and I do not know because I stopped watching ... his voice scrolling where it is good ... <br /> <br /> But really spend four dollars and 70 cents for something else ... like a big pizza or something ... <br /> <br /> Until you teach I should write a review, Psycho Phil
