Well, I had to sit at the computer and save the review immediately after seeing the sludge pool. Why? Because I have to let you know how bad this movie is. It's unbelievably bad. To let you know how bad it is, I will offer this little detail about the movie. During scenes of chaos, which usually consists of people shooting or kicking zombies, they cross scenes from a video game. Yes, you heard me well. This movie really sucks. In fact, it makes me think that it costs only ten dollars today. And see the corn filled with shit in this way? There is no story you can talk about, and the film basically has nothing to offer except sporadic shots and really cheap killings. I am very disappointed in knowing that I watched him. OK, I'm stunned. It's so bad that I can not even find words. RATING: ZERO with *****.
