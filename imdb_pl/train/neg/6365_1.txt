Wow, I knew this movie would be bad, but not so bad. Pervert comments appear. <br /> <br /> Roddy Roddy Piper is a sick, sweet retired policeman (cliche!), helping everyone - smiling like a lobotomy patient after surgery and despairing over his dead son. His adopted son returns from the Special Ops Special Forces and because he "sees things" - he portrays him, clenching his teeth when someone mentions the past. It's time to clean up the streets from another guy who once knew Piper and his dead son (who killed an evil boy) and his adopted son. <br /> <br /> Oh, love interest is a pretty young lady who decides there is no reason for her to jump over the bones of a former army guy. This happens in about 2 minutes of the first scene. <br /> <br /> The action could save this movie, but it is even worse than plot and acting. All this was done before, everything was done much better (the best example is Ong-Bak). This is the worst movie I've ever seen - and I've seen Waterworld twice. <br /> <br /> Erm, the movie is called HONOR (Spelled Wrong for the Americans), and the slogan is "from the creator of Bloodsport and Kickboxer" - check out the other movies of director David Worths, and you will soon realize why they put these two films, even though they are over 10 years old. Classics like "Shark Attack 3: Megalodon" - it says it all. <br /> <br /> I'll give you 10 pounds if you do not go to this movie. <br /> <br /> PS - I apologize for unfamiliar character names, but something tells you.
