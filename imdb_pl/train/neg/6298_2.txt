The terrible plot (Amis at its worst), senseless and self-conscious "decadence", obvious tactics of shock and inconsistent acting make this film (like "Rancid Aluminum") embody everything that went wrong with the bold rebirth of the British film. At best, humor is inert, and the pretentiousness of the whole set (including some kind of "internet terrorist group" - ooh, as contemporary) really begins to break down. <br /> <br /> Final summary - half-baked attempt to be "nervous" that does not favor anyone. Still, I always see Katy Carmichael on the screen ... <br /> <br />
