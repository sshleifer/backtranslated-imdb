The plot is credible, but banal, i.e. The beautiful and neglected wife of a wealthy and powerful man has an affair with a psychotic handsome, and then tries to hide her when the psycho follows her and blackmail her. But what's growing out of here is amazingly illogical. Despite the resources that are available to an ordinary couple who have money and influence, our privileged hero and heroine seem to have at their disposal only one national, their lawyer and the local police (who claim they can not do anything) when they are struggling with tension and terror. They do not have private security personnel (only an elaborate security system they do not care about), domestic staff, ground staff, chauffers, etc. Even, apparently, funds to hire private round-the-clock nurses to care for the hero when suffering life-threatening injuries, leaving a man and wife alone and defenseless in their residence. Our heroine is portrayed as having a door handle, and our hero, the tycoon, behaves in the most unlikely and irrational way. Production is an insult to viewers who have wasted their time on this crap and crime for wasting the talents of veterans Oliva Hussey and Don Murray (what they thought?). And it is a pity Lifetime TV for insulting the intelligence of its recipients for this bland offer.
