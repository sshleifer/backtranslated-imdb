The bad movie does not offer anything new. Ordinary creaks and moans try to make up for the confusion, but a thin story. Operation is barely over pathetic. Why did Liam Neeson agree with this? Owen Wilson really plays in one of the worst performances in the recent horror story. Catherine Zeta Jones has a great time and little more, although Lili Tayor has done an extraordinary job. The special effects were quite unforgettable, and the house itself was breathtaking and was amazingly wonderful. However, they can not make makeup for a bad game and storyline that seems to be connected at the last minute. Do not worry.
