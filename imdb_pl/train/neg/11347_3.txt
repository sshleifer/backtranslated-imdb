Cult of the Cobra is now available on DVD in flawless print that fully captures all the benefits of the movie. Unfortunately, he does not say much. <br /> <br /> He has a competent staff of secondary rank who acquits himself as well as one would expect under the circumstances. It is effectively directed, entirely on the soundstages and settings standing in the back office of the studio. It looks OK, but it is heavily exaggerated and after 80 minutes it is still heavily padded. <br /> <br /> For example, a double cobra attack on the first of the GI was certainly one attack too much. <br /> <br /> Julia's case, which decided to marry Pete, not Tomek, is never nothing. Tom immediately falls in love with Lisa and there is never a reason to be jealous of Julia (or not). <br /> <br /> Julia's "feminine intuition" is introduced as if it was to lead to an important development conspiracy, but it is not. Similarly, Pete's investigation into cobra's cults and the suspicion that he is falling short on Tom for a moment has no purpose other than to fill the screen. <br /> <br /> These are just the symptoms underlying the problem. The film has a mysterious structure, but it is not. As soon as the curse is announced, we know exactly where the story is going, so the characters are meticulously discovered what we already know. <br /> <br /> The ending is particularly bad. Julia is only threatened by accident. Lisa has no reason to want to kill her - it happens that she is in the wrong place at the wrong time. When Tom appears just in time to save her, it is not even clear if she was at all threatened. Then he simply gets rid of the cobra the way any of the previous victims could do. <br /> <br /> It is such an insignificant little spasm of the story that I wondered how it was that the heck heads of study. Then it occurred to me. Someone said: "These Val Lewton movies were very successful in CPR, so why not do that?" <br /> <br /> Cobra's cult is clearly modeled on Cat People: a mysterious, distressed, shapeshifting woman falls in love with the hero, he is apparently freezing, killing people, arousing suspicions of a woman friend of the hero and dying at the end. But "modeled on" does not mean "as good" as the wide margin. He copies, but does not understand what copying is. <br /> <br /> Apparently he's trying to get Lewton's low, suggestive style, but this approach does not fit in with history. Lisa is not Irene. It has to be strange and mysterious, but there is no secret in it. We see her after the first attack in Asia, so immediately recognize her when she arrives in New York. She never doubts her purpose. There is also no ambiguity as to whether or not it will turn into a snake. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, during her nightly maraige we get not one but two attempts of "buses". Neither will they go away, because the director does not understand what makes the "bus" work, or in any case happens to the persecutor, not the person who is being watched. <br /> <br /> These faint echoes of Cat People Give Cult Cobra any small distinction, but he can only pay attention to the gaping gap between the original and the imitation. <br /> <br /> Plagiarism may be the harshest form of flattery, but I doubt if Lewton or Tourneur was particularly flattering when this summer little passerby left.
