Where is Michael Caine when you need him? I've seen most of the MST3K seasons, but this rare movie before the first season (episdoe K-20) is one of the worst films ever. Three "stars", Lee Majors, Chris Makepeace and Burgess Meredith, struggle with the worst cinematic party in history, delivering lines that had to be written by a secret working group in the style of Dick Cheney, made up of Exxon and GM lawyers trying to reduce funds transit tests and energy efficiency. It looks like it was filmed in almost total darkness, perhaps on Super 8. It makes Logan's Run look like a movie Sistine Chapel crossed with Shakespeare. I can not imagine watching it without the comments of Crowa and Servo, because you can not even observe it. Apparently, what you need in Hollywood is about 401 thousand. Pieces, which prevents actors from accepting such bad movies to pay for health care. Towards the end of the "right to pollute and conduct" theme, I expect to see the Charlton Heston scene in which he will give a speech "cold dead hands". Lee, I could forgive you in 1989, but in 1981?
