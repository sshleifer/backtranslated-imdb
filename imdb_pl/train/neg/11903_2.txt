Wenders was great at the Million $ Hotel. I do not know how he came up with this movie! The idea of ​​post-spel11 situation and the American Society's view is full of hope, which makes it 2 out of 10. But it's not a movie. Can the best be done by someone with a great idea (start from west to east). There are important things happening in the Middle East that are simply released on the MAC screen * with the fingers of a girl from America who is stupid (because she does not know the facts). they are not well formed. And the most important thing is that the idea that is given with religion is somehow fun to me. In the final scene, Lana says just be quiet and try to listen. And the background music says, "... I will pray." Things do not really concern religion, but it ends, as you will see the truth, if you just close your eyes and pray, the lights are already shining, just no one wants see it. ps: "My house is not a place, it's people. The only thing that gets 10 out of 10 is the sentence. (incidentally, as" someone "mentioned below, the youngest young American is not the best, they are just" poor "And" hopeless "who sign up for an army in need of good payouts that the government does not provide!)
