This film is not only badly written and directed, but it is simply unpalatable. A beautiful novel is terribly misrepresented in this film. Many changes have been made in the story, probably to improve the timeframe. But what results are simply misleading. Acting can not overcome a script that removes the characters' motives for their behavior. In addition, conversion to English does not work when everyone calls the Patriarch EsTEban as ESteban. Awful. Please, please, read a great novel, in Spanish, if possible. YOU DO NOT SEE THIS FILM. It will ruin what can be a great experience.
