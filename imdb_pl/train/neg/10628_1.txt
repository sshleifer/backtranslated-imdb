This so-called "document" tries to say that the US has faked a landing on the moon. A year on the right. <br /> <br /> Everyone who has actually studied this matter knows differently. <br /> <br /> First of all: there is definitely proof. When astronauts were on the moon, they brought MANY kilos of rock from the moon - for geological research. Those that have spread all over the world to the hundreds of laboratories that tested them. And they all came to the conclusion that they come from the same planet, not from the earth: because the internal isotopes of the basic elements are different from those found on Earth, but similar to those calculated on the moon. IT MEANS. conspiracy theorists never examine anything: they only take what suits their theory and ignore the rest. <br /> <br /> Another erroneous claim is that their wind was in the hangar, where they shot at the landing of the moon, THIS MEANS the flag is moving. There is a logical explanation: the astronaut moved it by hand, so he moved. And what proves this: well, if the theorists of the conspiracy even studied the footage, they would see that the flag NEVER moves after the astronaut allowed it. conspiracy theorists are bad scientists, they can not study or study the subject properly until they receive what they came for, so that they can lie and make profits (IE is the so-called "document"). <br /> <br /> The claim says that you could not film on the moon because all the shadows come from different places, because there are different sources of light, artificial lighting from the studio. Once again, conspiracy theorists are wrong (as usual), the same would happen in the desert in the earth at night, without sources of light. I doubt, however, that any conspiracy theorist would ever be outside the basement of his grandmothers for more than many days when the Star Treck convention takes place. <br /> <br /> Conspiracy theorists are denied, BIG TIME. They only see what they want to see. That's why all these lies seem important - that's a fact.
