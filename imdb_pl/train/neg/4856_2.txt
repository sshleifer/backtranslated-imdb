Throughout my life I can not understand the blind hype and devotion to this totally unbelievable movie ...... and I think I have the qualifications to say that ... I am a former soldier of special operations with 14 years of "lifestyle" ... the film was completely unreal and apparently written by someone who did very little research on life in the army, in battle or at the level of a team or platoon. <br /> <br /> Three guys from EOD worrying around Baghdad on their own ????? Get Real ... No chain of command ????? Get Real ... EOD cleaning buildings ??? Zdobądź Real .... EOD / Military Intelligence / Sniper qualified sergeant ???? Get Real ... Wait ... I shot and killed a bad guy, and then let the two guys take me without shooting another shot or injury in general ?? Get Real ... I'm competing against an Iraqi civilian while I'm armed only 9 miles, breaking into another civilian house, getting punished by my wife, and then returning to the camp on foot in Baghdad at night as much as scratch or confrontation ?? Get Real ... <br /> <br /> There is absolutely no obligation to comply with the military protocol and no resemblance to any military unit I have encountered. Completely unbelievable and disrespectful for men and women from the EOD who, in contrast to this poor film, are not wild adrenalin seeking yahoos, but extremely skilled professionals doing incredibly hard work.
