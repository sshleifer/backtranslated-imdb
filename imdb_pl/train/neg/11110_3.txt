I would like it to be known that I often do not rate movies under 5 years old. At first I was very excited about this movie. His many harbingers of television trailers for several months made me really want to see this movie. One night, when I saw that it was available on FearNet on Demand, I got some popcorn and sat down to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> The plot seemed quite intriguing - some guy kills unsuspecting people Metro. The photographer is obsessed with missing people. Where are they going? What is happening to them? One day the photographer sees the relationship between some of the pictures he has made and becomes obsessive about the butcher following him, yada yada. The movie drew you, even though the plot was very predictable. "Oh no, it's dark, look back," I say, quite bored with cheap chills. <br /> <br /> The plot, although predictable, was intriguing ... that is, to the end. "It was good until the end ... It was stupid then," says Jack_skellington_freke on the notice boards. And I fully agree. And here are the spoilers ... <br /> <br /> You see, I was hoping it was some crazy killer, some psychotic person obsessed with cannibalism. No. It was some secret society that kept creatures alive for centuries. Solicit. How original. How unrealistic. How boring. <br /> <br /> 3/10. Come on Lionsgate. You've had amazing movies, but it sank.
