Dear me. Where do I start? Dad is not close enough to be a girl's daddy. He dies on the camera in the first 5 minutes of the movie. The favorite shout in this movie is "Jesus Christ !!!". Zombies are agile, stupid and few. The motives are completely incomprehensible, and the narrative does not exist. People are "rushing" to the destination in jeeps driving at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The world seems to behave normally, but it should be the end days. Breasts appear because of the breast. Usually such an approach would provide some redemption, but the rest of the film did not really interest me in the breasts or the future of humanity. There is a dog without reason and a thin, orange blood that changes the stomach. The General and his slogan "Shut the fuck ** up!" Is the only function of exchange. As for the rest, I sincerely hope to hear that they have done a decent thing and killed themselves.
