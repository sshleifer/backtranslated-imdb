I do not know what this guy thought. The fact that this film was made independently makes it no less scary. You can be as much a believer as you want ... most of the movie is mindless nonsense. I feel that I was offended when I had to watch the first 40 minutes of it. And the same was not a small feat. Not only is it terrible, but the plot is never even close to development. In this story there are countless holes, to the extent that it is difficult to even call it history. I have never read this book, so I can not criticize it, but this is the first review I wrote here, and its goal is to save all viewers for an hour and a half. I do not remember when the last time I could not even finish watching the movie. This one really takes the cake.
