First of all, this movie reminded me of old movies that I had to watch at school in religion. This is not a good thing. Basically, it's just a polite and pretentious piece of dirt, just like the horrible Left Behind series. I am not offended by religious movies ... but I am offended when these religious films are simply extremely horrible. I would just like to say nice things about the Christian film, but it does not look like it will happen in the near future. I bet if you give a biblical thumper a decent budget, you will still be able to come up with nothing good. Just avoid this. Also, the fact that the American Family Association (basically the lack of reverend Wildmon) promotes this movie on its website is another reason to hate me. In fact, after seeing this, I came home and saw my copy of David Cronenberg's NC-17 "Crash." Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. Hahahahaha!
