I had the impression that after "Dipping" this one will not be better ... I was right. He must seek money for champagne and not care about the final product ... his voice is repeatedly called by a stranger who does not sound like him; the edition is - well - only an assessment above the amateur one. This is nothing more than a B or C film with enough money to hire several talented cinematographers and sound designer "OK". <br /> <br /> Like the previous poster, problems seem to appear in the post-production (... voice dubbing, etc.) It's a pity, because the plot is fine for the SG film. <br /> <br /> I will never rent another SG movie unless I send an email asking for forgiveness. <br /> <br /> Pity - I miss Kelly LeBrock ... <br /> <br /> - jimbo
