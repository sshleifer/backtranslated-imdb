Four Eyed Monsters follows the relationship of a shy, lonely cameraman and an equally detached artist who, living in Big Apple, develops an unbelievable affair with the help of an online dating service. This is not so unusual, but what is is their way of communication. Starting from the oral, they write notes and then communicate through the video. <br /> <br /> The film is based on the artist's own relationship (Arin Crumley and Susan Buice) who, apart from writing and directing, takes action as leading heroes. With the elements of avant-garde, anti-plot and docudrama, the film disperses in the wind with an undecided structure beautify nicely between narcissism and indulgence. <br /> <br /> As the film continues, the short separation and deterioration of their once intriguing form of communication is getting older when the couple faces the hardships of reality. Focusing solely on internal conflict or misfortunes of the relationship, the film struggles with stagnation, which is neither original nor captivating. This could be easily circumvented by adding a subplot thread and an external conflict and a third act that does not exist - just the assembly of a melodrama that leads nowhere. <br /> <br /> What even more annoys the descent of the film from the story into a reality that suddenly ends with an open and unsatisfactory ending. Everything would be fine, but there is no question and it makes no sense to discover or ponder. <br /> <br /> (By the way, the movie contains beautiful animation and a lively and moving soundtrack, one of the most interesting aspects of production.) <br /> <br /> But as always, watch the movie and decide for yourself.
