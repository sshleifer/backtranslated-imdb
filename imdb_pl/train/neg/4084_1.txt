Every now and then you hear radio DJs invite listeners to nominate films that the listener can not stand or have never seen at all times. This is a movie I think about ... days later. <br /> <br /> It has something to do with the art of Shakespeare. I'm not sure, but I think I jumped about 20 minutes in this movie ... I think I realized that my toenails do not get stuck, and they looked at me pleadingly to cut myself out. <br /> <br /> This movie seemed to me just boring and pretentious. <br /> <br /> Although this is the first movie that gave such a low score (which I actually tried to watch), I would not want to discourage you from other movies by English director Peter Greenaway. I remember thinking that his "Cook, Thief, His wife and her lover" was a really great British movie, although its content was sometimes boiling up - a brilliant movie, but I can understand why people do not want to see it. <br /> <br /> Another good movie by Greenaway was "Zed and two noughts". Again he had some content that moved the limits of good taste, but nevertheless it was intriguing. <br /> <br /> The second movie, which I usually think too late about such radio programs, is "Brazil". I never saw it all the time when I fell asleep! <br /> <br /> Unless you fancy important movies that are too stylized, strenuously walked and difficult to follow, then steer without Prosero books.
