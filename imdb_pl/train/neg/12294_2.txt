I watched this movie only for this setting. He was filmed in an old hotel where a friend has shares. The plot was predictable, the acting was mediorcre at best, the horrors were abominations, not real horrors. <br /> <br /> I do not remember much of the plot and I think it was because there was "Not much to remember. They did not even use the hotel at its greatest potential ... The beaches are fantastic and the hotel is located on a peninsula. At low tide you can go almost 1/4 a mile to the bay, which is really an amazing view when the wind howled for the first time in the morning or late at night. <br /> <br /> The best way to watch this movie is to use the remote control in your hand, so you can quickly scroll through the action (and I use this term loosely) and stop at the beauty of the surroundings!
