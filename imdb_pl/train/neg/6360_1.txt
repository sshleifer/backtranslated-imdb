Can I ask for a refund of $ 13.00? I'd rather watch "Hydroelectric power comes to North America." Again. It's a movie with one voice. The same voice that flows from each hero's lips, regardless of age and gender. To listen to that voice again, I would have to charge at least $ 150 an hour. And I do not take insurance. It was amazing to watch Will Ferrell turn to Woody. But I do not think that ingenious castings would be enough. Before you start making a movie, you have to wait until they have a story. Unless it's only for money. And if it is, why not just re-release the All-Rap version of "What's Tiger Lily?"
