I watched a lot of animated or animated films because I have a daughter who likes to watch TV. I started watching this movie to see if I would like my little one to watch it ... and not. At first I thought it was such a sweet movie as the Bambi movie, but all the time it was as if the ducky insinuation was homosexual. The information said they were making fun of him because he was not good at sport, but it was not. It seems to be a movie made for children who want to learn to be gay. It was also very sad, if daddy's daddy and everyone else. I do not know, I guess if you're gay, you'll like it, but I do not think I'll see it again with my little one.
