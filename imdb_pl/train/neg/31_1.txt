This is the biggest insult to TMNT in history. Fortunately, officially Venus does not exist in the TMNT canon. There will never be a female turtle, it took away the tragic story of 4 male unique mutants who will never have their own family. The biggest mistake was going through Power Rangers on TMNT with a terrible episode; the turtle's voices were BAD and all worked without character. They could do such a better job, better projects and animatronics, and WITHOUT WENUS. <br /> <br /> Do not worry about these people ... it's crappy stuff. the lip petal was slow and unnatural. they completely did not respect the shredder. The main baddie, some guy of the dragon lord, was banal. turtles looked banal with things hanging from their bodies, and what about this thing around Rapha's thighs? stupid, carved sculptures !? <br /> <br /> If they looked normal, they acted in a character and got rid of Venus, they got rid of stupid cartoon sounds for kids ... and they wrote better, it could be good.
