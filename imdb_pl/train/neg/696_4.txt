Eh, this is not a particularly good slasher flick. So, acting, effects, a decent, yet familiar and non-intrusive soundtrack. <br /> <br /> There are three deaths in the immediate vicinity of the beginning of the film, which create a fairly good scene in which everything seems to be going. There are also many characters who wander around without realizing what is happening or pursuing red herring; more time killing than people. There are other deaths, and the killer is a murderer with equal opportunities, who does not avoid any tool. The killer likes to set other people to kill innocent people. Identity is not revealed at the end, and the motif is quite thin and we do not really care. <br /> <br /> Apparently, the movie takes place around Christmas, but it is not a major factor. One scene is illuminated by Christmas lights, that's all. <br /> <br /> The film is rather dark with a muddy image most of the time, at least on the video cassette being watched. Some of the dialogues got lost in some of the initial scenes. The ending should be stronger than it was. We think that we are aware of what happened, although there is a chance that something else will happen.
