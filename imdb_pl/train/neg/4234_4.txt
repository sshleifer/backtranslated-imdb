These are not the best-made slasher movies of all time, but what it is is quite funny. The plot is bad, but the killings are not that bad. Honestly, if you do not follow the bands described in this movie, you will not find this movie as funny as those who do it. I knew someone who saw this movie and was very disappointed because of the poor quality of the movie, but you have to understand that it was created in your free time during the tour, between playing for children and drinking with friends behind the scenes. ..not to be taken seriously. It is a ubber cheese in the best punk release and over 100 murders, most of which are ultra-hot, it's a funny movie where you can watch friends, drink and play!
