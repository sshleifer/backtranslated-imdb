It's a bad movie. Not one of those funny bad guys. It's bad. Watching was painful. The direction was horrible, with lots of jumps, and the green and yellow hues used throughout the film make the characters look nauseated. Keira Knightly was not convincing as a hard chick and I can not believe that Lucy Liu and Mickey Rourke signed up for this criminal loss of celluloid. The script was horrible, and acting was like nails on the board. If you did not see him, no. There is nothing missing and you only waste two hours of your life watching this drivel. I've seen bad movies before and even enjoyed them because of their flaws. This one is just a waste of time.
