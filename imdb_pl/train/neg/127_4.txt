I rented I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW from my video shop because of all the controversy surrounding him when he first appeared in 1967. I also heard that he was originally captured by American customs, if he ever tried to enter the country, and therefore he was a fan of films considered "controversial" I really had to see it for myself. <br /> <br /> The plot focuses on a young Swedish drama student named Lena who wants to learn everything about life. In particular, he wants to focus attention on creating a document about what the average Swede was thinking about certain political issues, such as the Vietnam War and racial issues in the United States. Between the question of politicians and ordinary residents of Stockholm about their opinions on politics, she had sex with her drama teacher, classmates and married men. <br /> <br /> What killed me in connection with JAM CURIOUS-YELLOW 40 years ago was considered to be pornographic. Indeed, sex and nudity scenes are few, even then they are not like cheap porn. While my countrymen think that this is shocking, in reality sex and nudity are the main element in the Swedish cinema. Even Ingmar Bergman, probably their response to the good old boy John Ford, had sex scenes in his films. <br /> <br /> I praise the filmmakers for the fact that every sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just shocking people and making money for shows in pornographic theaters in America. I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a good movie for anyone who wants to study meat and potatoes (without words) of Swedish cinema. But really, this movie does not have much plot.
