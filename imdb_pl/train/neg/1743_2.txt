In contrast to this title, this film does not offer any spice, and therefore the audience is subjected to a tasteless dish. All Humor seems forced, theatrical, mechanical, staged, reminiscent of Pakistani art available on video, including even manners. Everyone is shouting, shouting and doing strange things for no reason. The assumption looks interesting because it is a simple Hollywood Hollywood Boeing, and John Abraham, who is so natural in almost all his films, is a complete nieporadnikiem. Kumar and Paresh Rawal, two experienced steelmen try to pick up the film, being natural, but in vain, at least the characters of three girls should be contrasted to bring some interesting elements, but unfortunately all here seem thoughtless, buxomed bimbettes (3Bs) who they say, behave and even shout in a similar way. The main hole in the story is what made the hero hold three girls in the same house, pretending they would never find out about each other? to do sex, what else? The same can be done in hundreds of other ways. That is why so many dramabazi for no reason is something that the audience can easily digest. ear great beginnings. For those who call it a situation comedy, I call it a pathetic taste. The sense of humor of such an audience going to the cinema is certainly broken and mad to such an extent that it combines with sadistic, strange and crazy type of humor, in which it's not the characters who laugh, but rather the same frustrations that look like senseless has it happened that in order to laugh, we have to endure such things?
