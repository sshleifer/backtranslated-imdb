...... in horror. All right, first of all, let's start with Kate. Her main goals include George Clooney, who looks good and last, but no less important. I must love her. She had about 3 amazingly good chances to finish this sicko, but ..... she escaped instead. I mean, she did not want Guy out for 10 minutes, and when she did, it was too late. I mean, the guy tried to rape her. I can not go into these movies, where the main character is a sad idiot. I mean, who honestly would have sympathy for a guy who ends everyone she met at night. The film continued. As a result, he lost all his credibility.
