This movie was disappointing. It was incomplete and boring. While Alec Baldwin tried to present himself as a Righteous and only a prosecutor (not to mention an executive producer), the film never showed defense attorneys or tried to challenge the audience with a real meaningful debate about how a country could be run on such a terrible path. <br /> <br /> Of course, no one wants to defend the Nazi viewpoint, but he was a POINT of the Nuremberg trails! Four hours just fighting the Nazis ... come on! It has already been done! <br /> <br /> I really think that Alec Baldwin should just stay with husband Kim Bassinger. <br /> <br /> Right after the end of the film, TNT showed the 1959 film "The Nuremberg Trail". This movie is FAR superior.
