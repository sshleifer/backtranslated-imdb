SWEET SIXTEEN (1983) ** / ***** 86 minutes Director Jim Sotos Cast Bo Hopkins, Susan Strasberg, Aleisa Shirley, Patrick Macnee, Dana Kimmell <br /> <br /> Fifteen-year-old girl Melissa is new to the desert city and soon people around her will begin to die. The detective needs to collect clues with his daughter Nancy Drew, who was played by the 13th graduate Dan Kimmell on Friday. Local Native Americans are the first suspects, because they seem to bother the prejudiced city residents. All these events led to the disclosure of the killer on the sixteenth birthday party of Melissa. <br /> <br /> The below average slasher is not very memorable. It has a television character, with no more points than its own title track, which plays several times throughout the text. Lines like "the killer will turn us into a coleslaw". They fit into the standard scenarios from the eighties. Marci calls Melissa a bad name, and then somehow they start a friendship. Apparently, Marci can see how difficult it is to fit in because Melissa knows how to wear makeup. This film would be difficult to do today when the main character is fifteen and the director puts in a lot of free close-ups. The social comment on the Indians was not developed enough to be taken seriously. I am too surprised by the high rating of this film. Both Sweet Sixteen and Ed Hunt's Bloody Birthday had the potential to use the honored birthday tradition at that time to create an intense slaughter sequence, but I feel unsuccessful. On the other hand, the release of little-known films on DVD gives hope that others will follow them.
