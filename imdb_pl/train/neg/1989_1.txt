I would like to give this film a zero, but it was not an option !! This movie sucks !!! Women can not act. I should have known he would suck when I saw Bobby Brown. No one in my home could believe that I did not change the channel after the first 15 minutes. the idea of ​​black women as gunslingers in the western days is ridiculous. it's not just a race, it's also sex. The combination of these two things is ridiculous. I'm sorry because some people in the movie are not bad actors / actresses, but the movie itself was awful. he was not credible as a movie. it can be "funny" for a group of people, but I'm not in this group. lol. and using a great line from a great, great movie ... "that's all I have to say about it."
