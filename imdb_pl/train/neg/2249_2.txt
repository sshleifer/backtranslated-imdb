It's a terrible movie catastrophe. From the beginning to the end it is filled with bad acting and even worse direction and editing. The only parts of the film that can be realized are several Streisand numbers, because the part of Kristofferson can not be watched or listened. The main problem of this movie is that we never see Kristofferson's character at its top, or the hero of Streisand fighting. The first should be seen as a decrease and the second increase. The final issue of Streisand _ could have been one of the biggest finals in the film if it was properly directed and assembled. One frame shot for the duration of the song was a terrible mistake. If the band, the audience and wide shots of the scene were shown, this number could be dynamic and interesting. This film had to be directed and edited by a film school in NYU. The only worse thing can be a miserable scenario. The final music number is the only interchangeable part of the movie, and even this is completely bothered by wrong technical decisions.
