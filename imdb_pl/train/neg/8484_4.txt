"The cast of a stage company is terrified when a bizarre killer known as" The Fiend "attacks them to death. A pair of reporters and their clumsy photographer decided to work out the story of "The Fiend" and find their goals. how do you think our trio of protagonists has a solved case, you throw another phrase that makes you wonder who the killer really is, "according to the DVD cover summary. <br /> <br /> Taking the "Hunchback from Notre Dame" to Hollywood, the lack of studio setup by producer Sam Katzman probably helps "A Face in the Fog" look interesting, especially towards the end (30's movement). The direction can be improved; for example, the camera angle on the battle scene is not helpful. The budget seems small. Under these circumstances, most silent / talkie casters perform it reliably. <br /> <br /> **** Face in the Mist (2/1/36) Robert F. Hill ~ Lloyd Hughes, June Collyer, Al St. john
