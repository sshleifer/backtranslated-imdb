I loved the original. It was great and will always be. Strange, but I could not wait to see the replay. Usually I am a bit against re-creating because there are too many of them, but somehow I was intrigued. At the beginning I liked it very much. Caine genius, as usual, and Jude Law, who managed to keep, is its owner. It was pretty clever, how it was modernized and worked. What keeps you from being really good is the last seven minutes. It goes completely away from the original, in fact it ceases to be clever and just becomes annoying. The end of the original was fantastic! So much tension grew and was incredibly clever! This? It grows not in suspense, but from frustration, because it seemed that they decided to make Caine a homosexual. It was if they tried to be very different. And then ... BANG! The law is dead. Roller credits. This movie is worth watching just for performances, but these last seven minutes really drag it down. What a pity....
