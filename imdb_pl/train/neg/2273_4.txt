This was not the main catastrophe I expected, but it is as positive as I can describe my film. I'm not sure what would have been funny in this movie, but I suppose it's all a matter of taste. Personally, I do not think it's amusing to watch the morons live their idiotic lives or make fools of themselves on television, but on the other hand, I'm not a fan of Jerry Springer's pitiful daytime talk show. Watching it did not bore me too much, but I also certainly did not like it. If you are in the mood to see a bad movie, but one that is not too painful to sit down, this is a good choice.
