How did it happen a hit? Dear God, I do not know where to start, why this film sucked too much. The film was predictable and there was no originality. The only thing I can admire is the action of some characters. The film was too bright, they should do something with lighting, for example, thanks to which the environment becomes darker. The make-up of some of the dead characters made this movie look like a 1970s horror movie. This is 2006! People are not afraid of other people who wear heavy makeup. Most horror scenes come from other Hollywood or Asian horror films. Total stripping! That's why I do not watch Tagalog movies. The only reason that so many people "screamed" when watching this movie is compatibility. How many times do we have to copy the scenes from The Ring and improvise that instead of the girl leaving the TV, now comes out of the window next to it? No matter how you put it together, YET IS TURNED OFF. If you want a good horror movie, watch the top 50 horror movies listed on this page.
