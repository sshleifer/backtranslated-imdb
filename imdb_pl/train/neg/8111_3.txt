Another great Costa-Gavras movie. This is a great presentation of the situation in Latin America and the USA in Latin American politics. The facts may be accurate or not, but the fact is that the US was deeply involved in the coups and support of Latin American dictatorships. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the spirit of the film follows the typical leftist / communist propaganda of the cold war era. Costa-Gavras is a well-known communist sympathizer, and his films are always biased. For example, it presents the actions of the United States as brutal and inhumane, representing the extremist actions of Tupamaros as something positive. <br /> <br /> As it turned out, it was a blessing for Uruguay and the rest of Latin America that the US would get involved with. Europe is full of poor prostitutes from Eastern Europe. I have never heard of poor girls from Uruguay or Chile, who are massively prostituted, as is the case in most Eastern European countries. The US fought a dirty war, and God bless us all, the monster of Soviet communism was defeated. It is a pity that the United States had to do what they did in Latin America (and elsewhere), but sometimes you have to play dirty. This is not the idealistic world, as they love Costa-Gavras and Matamoros. If Matamoros came to power in Uruguay, we would have another Ukraine in Latin America. <br /> <br /> In total, this film follows the corrupt and bankrupt leftist ideology of the times and tries to convey it as idealistic and morally correct.
