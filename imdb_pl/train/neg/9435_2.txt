I never heard of it before the owner of my local DVD rental company mentioned it; Being the horror of the 80s with the notorious distinction of being banned in the United Kingdom, I decided to check it out. The film turned out to be a boring, amateur and ugly-looking ride; sound recording is so weak that the dialogue is incomprehensible for half the time while acting gives a new meaning to the inept word! <br /> <br /> What's worse, the film follows a terribly tired formula of three teenage girls taking part in the accident and protected by a dysfunctional family living in a distant environment. Soon one of the girls went to seek help and never heard her again; another, still lying, is quickly removed (after forgetting most of the time). The heroine is the one that interacts with the three residents of the house most: the harridan of the bible-mother-mother (terrifyingly moving), her suppressed (and long-suffering) daughter, and her bizarre brother who sometimes appears on the scene drool over the sleeping female guests. <br /> <br /> They often resort to memories at the dinner table hating the mother's man (as a way to fill the grim, not to mention unoriginal, historical history) and which invariably turns into a sparring competition between mother and daughter, the film has one ace in the sleeve - the spin ends as unexpectedly as ingeniously, but does not do much to remove the bad taste left in the mouth by the movie (just as lameness of it all as a broken gore) or the inevitable feeling of wasting 80 minutes of my time ...
