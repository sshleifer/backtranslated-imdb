Worse than the rating that was given. It's a typical SciFi movie these days: bad for horrible acting, bad script and bad direction. From the initial scene in which DeMille buries his set to the end, this movie is awful. In the early stages, this movie has Moses (which was Charlton Heston in the movie DeMille), Pharoah (Yul Brynner) and Nefretiri (Anne Baxtor) with a view of the boy burying the box in the sand. The figures that were supposed to represent the three above-mentioned icons were terrible and must have been similar to the people they were supposed to be "supposedly" to be. The fact that it is a desert away from civilization is fun when someone is injured and everyone yells for an ambulance. The screenwriter obviously does not realize that there are no ambulances in the middle of the desert. I was very disappointed that Morena Baccarin decided to make a film of such low quality.
