I tried to like this program; I really did it. I even bought a pilot film, first on VHS and then on DVD. However, I could not enter this story because her two main characters: "David" (Bruce Willis) and "Maddie" (Cybill Shepherd) just seemed to be in love with each other. I admit that it was a clever dialogue at concerts, which was a key element in the success of the TV program and I appreciated a lot of this dialogue. <br /> <br /> Basically it was almost the same as old comedy movies from the 30's and 40's with male versus female. You have a lot of quarrels, accusations, screams and screams. Many people apparently love this kind of quarrel, but I can not stand it, so I've never got into Moonlighting fashion. <br /> <br /> Only Allyce Beasley as an unfortunate midfielder "Agnes" was funny. It is a pity that she had so little time to fly. Shepherd was kind to her eyes and I suppose that the women would say the same to Willis, but too many quarrels between them finally turned me off.
