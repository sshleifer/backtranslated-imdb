What reviewers and MST3K skipped is the best part (and only an unforgettable scene) of this awful movie: there is a very good shower rape scene committed by a bad guy (similar to Ben Gazzar) on Maria as mentioned, later killed by TJ's ineptitude). Perhaps rape is too strong a word, the "prison ritual of mating" may be more appropriate. The background for this opportunity, and yet a compulsory meeting is a gangster who hides "Ben Gazzar", introduces him to the girls spending time at his pool. The 30-ish blonde is overpowering him, but our villain must be struck by her because courtship is now turned on. His first move is to try to drown her until his mafia benefactor tells him to knock him out. Something like a high school girl you did not like, but you still wanted to have a carnal knowledge ... Let's just say she'll catch up with her in the cabin later.
