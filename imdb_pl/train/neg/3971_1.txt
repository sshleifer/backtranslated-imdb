Give me back my money! Give me back my life! Give me some credit. This movie was worthy. Useless and time-consuming. What a waste of energy and completely pointless. I understand the premise and the idea well, but leave us alone! Next time, give me money and let me spend it. A lost child, mothers' remorse, blame her husband! Clich√© yes ~! Take care of real life! Unfortunately, this movie was a total waste of my time, my money and my being. I'd rather cook eggs! There is no real explanation of why this happened. Prison? Why? Loss? obvious, but why? Acting deserves what I am doing here Oscar and photos. Am I doing it for a pay? How much did this movie do? Well, this stupid fool has rented a copy. Sufficiently said
