With an absolutely amazing cast and crew it can be a classic. Instead, it is a recurrent paraphrase of all conspiracy theories existing in 1979. On the murder of JFK transplanted, rather pointlessly, into a vaguely inconsistent story about the murder of fictitious President Kegan in 1960. Many excellent character actors are wasted because either they are not enough to do - for example, Sterling Hayden or Eli Wallach, or are asked to be rather embarrassed - John Huston. Jeff Bridges and Anthony Perkins are doing very well, though in different ways. <br /> <br /> Photography is great, but it does not justify one and a half hours of life or the purchase price of a DVD.
