a film that tries to be much smarter than its creators are able to produce. the film revolves around and changes through the "myriad stories" of the myriad in a desperate attempt to guess the audience guessing, the offset breaking the "storyline" with exciting scenes that they thought could help him. <br /> <br /> James Belushi is involved with this pseudo-intellectual trial and just a dream goes through the movie. the same applies to other "actors". the plot is quite stupid and tacky. whih in itelf is not such a crime, but at the end, huge turns of action become very tiring and boring. <br /> <br /> the film, however, arouses some interest in the middle. In total, it's worth a lazy watch on a really boring day, but do not worry if you miss it. <br /> <br /> rather poor 4!
