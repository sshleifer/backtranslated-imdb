A young man kills a young woman for a reason. The man's brother is imprisoned on the charge that he was a partner, but he soon escapes. After the escape, the seemingly innocent man kidnaps three victims, and soon spins his girlfriend on the plot. If that is not enough, the situation calms down quickly. <br /> <br /> This movie had some good aspects and many bad ones. His strongest aspect was the main actress Emily Haack. Putting aside the fact that she is naked in a large amount of this film, she presents herself as a decent actress and a very strong character. I see no reason why she could not use this experience and somehow turn it into a career. I was convinced that he was a ruthless person. <br /> <br /> Also the creators of this movie were very brave and did not pull out the blows. Graphic nudity (both male and female), coprophagia and extreme anal violence are not excluded. I like my horrors to move the boundaries a bit, and he completely ignored them, eagerly jumping towards Gomorrah. Maybe it was too much, but I think they have achieved what they were looking for. <br /> <br /> But now negative aspects. First of all, and the most noticeable, this movie is very low budget and the quality of the movie shows it. I can justify it - the plot was decent, playing well, and in some scenes the lower quality film made the film more disturbing (more realistic). So I will not scold them for having low-quality equipment. For what I will rebuke them is the use of bad choices in shots. For no reason, I can not be sure (apart from making a movie), there is a lot of footage from the cemetery. I really do not know why, and I really started napping at this point because it was so long and aimless. <br /> <br /> I also have a problem with the title. The idea was to fool people who thought that this movie had something to do with the classic "I Spit on Your Grave." Now there is a line that seems to suggest that the main character is the daughter of a woman from this other film. And the topics are very loose (the woman takes revenge on men). But there is no solid relationship, and the reason for choosing this title was because the video shop client thought he was getting a sequel. It was deceptive and dishonest. <br /> <br /> My last serious complaint is that this plot does not make sense. Not at all. The woman is killed at the beginning for no reason. A prison fiend finds time to kidnap people to torture them for no reason (because they hurt his girlfriend?). The same man goes from right to wrong without explanation. Similarly, a lead woman (Haack) turns a normal person into someone who is excessively cruel and sadistic, for no reason, and against people who were mostly insignificant to her (a neighbor offering drugs for bad sex, but in no way worth it torture yourself. <br /> <br /> Do not let this title deceive you, or claim that the movie is incredibly shocking. Yes, some of the scenes were shocking, but the vast majority of the movie is boring and makes it If you see it in a video store or in Netflix, just browse, or rent it, and we can sit back and relax for hours. You have been warned.
