Suffice it to say that - despite the strange funny panegyric for his "indecent" skills here - the director of this inept, hideous tosha has not made the movie since then. As for me, this is great news. <br /> <br /> Dead Babies has the whole bile of his creator, but lacks the wit and technical prowess that makes Martin Amis a readable novelist. > <br /> When will the British film industry wake up and realize that if he wants to regain the status he once had, he should stop producing such garbage and do something that real people want to watch? <br /> <br /> Avoid the plague.
