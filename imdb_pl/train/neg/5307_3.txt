What happened? "Doubt" had such a great potential to be a brilliant movie - but instead he hesitated a long straight line that made me want to stop watching. The only thing he filmed was the brilliance of Meryl Streep, who did not DOUBT deserve an Oscar nomination. Although it was not one of her best performances, she still gave us a solid and truthful character that has blossomed on the screen. <br /> <br /> However, even the glow of the screen legend could not save this movie down the hill. From the boring start, which had no power or impact - to a less than convincing conclusion, the film was really disappointing - especially since it provided so much potential thanks to its promotion and trailers. It was obvious that the director had trouble with the simplicity of the story and ended up with a boring movie that dragged on for too long, with too many conversations and insufficient stock. <br /> <br /> In addition, the second Oscar nominations were less than convincing. Although Philip Seymour Hoffman gave a decent performance, it was by no means an Oscar. (Especially that they completely skipped performances such as Will Smith in Seven Pounds). Amy Adams did not deserve the nomination. Watching Amy Adams was like watching a cardboard box - it was one-sided and simple. It would be more sensible to put her on Razzie, because I'm sure she would have gone victorious. Viola Davis spoke briefly, but truthfully, but the length of her performance made me ask if the academy really should have given her the nomination. <br /> <br /> In general, I think that doubt is one of the most disappointing movies from 2008. It was a mess in a movie with such potential and I do not recommend it. The only great light in the film is Meryl Streep, which gives you stunning, solid performance - he does not even do enough to save this movie. *** / 10.
