I just loved to watch him and have fun with his total anger. I saw this movie through the helpful sarcasm of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and I have a DVD. If you turn to the other side of the DVD, they'll show you a real movie, so I gave it a chance. Seriously, people are grilled cheese. <br /> <br /> Acting, special effects and plot in general are very cheesy and unrealistic. "Does not she need lungs," said Crow, noting how his head could still speak when there was no body, and Tom Servo just wistfully notices "No, she's got juice from her neck!" The ending is just classic and no one can touch this soundtrack with K-Porn! I loved the "fight of cats" between two strippers. This "Meow" after the fight or the stage was classic. So in a sense it was a funny movie. I think that for horror fans you will probably like it. To have fun, watch the MSTK3 version, you'll get great laughter. <br /> <br /> MST3K version: 10/10 The brain that will die: 1/10
