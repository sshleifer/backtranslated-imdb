As an South African insult, think that someone really paid for producing this nonsense! <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the director was one of the authors of the original Shaka Zulu mini, this "addition" to the series is terrifying! The original series was based on historical facts about a man who was a great strategist, leader and warrior. A man who played a big role in shaping the history of local tribes in South Africa. <br /> <br /> The plot of this film is nothing more than just washing, scraped off the bottom of the barrel by a writer who has not managed to impress from the mid-nineties. <br /> <br /> Omar Sharif and Henry Goals are good actors, what does David Hasselhoff do to save drowning slaves with their red buoy and whitened smile? <br /> <br /> I expected blond, busty women to appear out of nowhere and run across the screen in their tiny red bathing suits, for no apparent reason. This does not mean that it would be more bizarre than the fantastic storyline that probably came up with 10 mugs of beer at a fancy clothing event in which someone's cave costumes inspired the writer to return to the African theme for his next "hit."
