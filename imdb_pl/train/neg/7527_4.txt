In "Tower of Death" / "Game of Death 2" there are so many stupid moments that you really wonder if this is a trick. Sometimes it seemed to me that I was watching the Kung Pow sequel, not the Bruce Lee movie. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this movie has a lot to do with the "death game". If anything, it's more of a sequel / remake of "Enter the Dragon" containing many elements of the movie - especially the actual movie material. Bruce Lee's character Billy Lo (apparently) investigates the sudden death of his friend and encounters a piece of film that remained with the daughter of a man. When the body is stolen during the funeral (!), Billy is also killed and his defiant brother must avenge the death of both men. <br /> <br /> Tong Long plays brother Bobby Lo and there is really no kind of charisma to bring a movie. His fighting abilities, however, are very good. Bruce Lee apparently appears thanks to (no longer) removed material simply to earn a legacy. Saying that, in general, the material is properly edited better than in "Game of Death", but it does not stop the movie from getting messy. <br /> <br /> OK, so the battles are actually very funny (dare I say dizzy) and make the movie at least visible. But in this movie there are so many elements that really check your patience. First of all, there is an alleged villain who lives in his palatial estate ... is this a psychiatric institution? Seriously, the nutter eats raw venison, he drinks deer's blood, he wears a monkey on his shoulder and is the owner of peacocks and lions (?!). This attempt to make him look hard and intelligent makes you feel sorry for him - you half-expect someone to walk him back to his room. <br /> <br /> In fact, this middle part is terrible, and when the scene with the participation came a naked slut and a lion costume. I turned it off. However, I finished the movie and I'm glad I did it because the battle scene at the end (just like "GOD") was a reason to watch. Although the story is embarrassed, the action is very good and includes great choreography. <br /> <br /> But even the final disappoints if the assumption was anything to do. We were told that the "Tower of Death" is a pagoda that is upside down and underground. It sounded great, like a twist in Bruce Lee's original idea with different styles of fighting on each level. Could this be the "death game" that was originally planned? No! The film should be called "Generator Room of Death" because it's about the tower. Yes, there really were one or two "different" styles ... there were clear-cut foils, a stoop with leopard skin and a stupid monk. It seems that Enter the Dragon has never been made, and the plot is a poor imitation. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing once in fast fight scenes, but sometimes so stupid that it hurts. If it was intended, that's good. However, the thumbs behind playing this scene from the projector with "Enter The Dragon".
