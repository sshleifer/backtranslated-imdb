6/10 Acting, not great but good acting. <br /> <br /> 4/10 director, take stupid decisions in this film. <br /> <br /> 2/10 A writer, history does not make sense at all and has a huge number of disadvantages. <br /> <br /> 4/10 The overall result of this movie. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time on this movie, it is not worth it. I gave 4 for this movie and it can be too much. Characters are over exaggerated as they can never be in real life, and some quite inexplicable things happen "historically" and not in a good way. Due to the style in which the film was made, you will get bored after 30 minutes (too many special effects: slow movements and camera shake and fast forward). It is always good that the film uses music to make the story smooth, but there are too many songs in this song. In the first hour there are almost 50/50 dialogues and music
