I started watching this movie, expecting me to be a casually bearable horror movie ... and I was not far away. There are a lot of glimpses and they have rushed into nakedness, but the other half of the movie presents some ironic twists. Holy cow, they put some thoughts into history and did not fall into the predictable things that were expected at the beginning. And dare I say it, but some of the "free" nudes were not so free because they fit history and surroundings. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, it's still a bad movie overall, but like bad movies, it's much more intelligent than REALLY terrible traps like Mesa of Lost Women and Robot Monster.
