When I go to IMDb discs, I always have enough when I see the post "worst film". After watching this * movie * I think I will create my own post soon !! <br /> <br /> Initial titles: great, some lame change on the gas stove (yes, focus on the fire = explosions = great action movie !!) <br /> <br /> Actors: I think that Ice T he is a nice rapper, even a nice actor (sometimes, I insist, "sometimes"), but Steven Seagal, the policeman he plays, is ... beyond words. The rest of the cast is ... I do not know where the actors were hired, but jeez !! I bet my dog ​​would be a much better actor than them! <br /> <br />. Story: Hijacking.original is it ?? <br /> <br /> Action sequences: The first shot of the movie is an explosion. I told myself, well, good! At least there will be some nice pyrotechnics .... I was dead. The rest of the film is mostly filled with low-rent shots from Air Force ... <br /> <br /> Dialogues are fun, music is pure nonsense, the end is happy (I mean, I was happy at the end because the movie is koniecł !!!) <br /> <br /> My cousin, who watched the movie, was delighted (I am 22 years old, 42 years old ... well). he was close to taking the movie and burning it. Maybe next time I'll watch ... (who said it never ???)
