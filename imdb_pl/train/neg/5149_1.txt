This film tells about a female rape victim / comic from New York who decides to run away from this horrible big city and move to a dirty, neglected town, where he finds shelter in one wide trailer on the ground a lot in the middle 12 and nowhere. The city's residents are mentally ill and yet they invite crazy men to their trailer. The annoying thing is that he can do exactly what is appropriate to put himself in dangerous circumstances after dangerous circumstances. DB Sweeney's performance was at most high school. He is one of those cute young actors with a sweet smile. Unfortunately, the career was not kind, and mother nature was right. For the previous commentator stating that acting is "so real", well, I agree. Actually, it did not work. The two main characters are really pathetic, weak and unable to make mature, healthy decisions. In short, this movie sucks like no one else, lend it to laugh at it. A real crime scene? A cruel wood paneling in a trailer - it's enough to force me to murder. And finally, she is an artist / writer, so she could not afford a double trailer and something other than a sunny yellow Chevy Chevy for love of God!
