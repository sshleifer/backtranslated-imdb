I have enough movies that sound fun in a one-line summary, and then end up with what can be found at the bottom of the compost. <br /> <br /> Who knows: "Witchery" Maybe it sounded interesting in college, even with the "cast of a big name" (like Blair and Hasselhoff - a blink of an eye, poke) and the sparkling Hildegard Knef (I do not know, some woman ...). <br /> <br /> But the film simply falls apart faster than the paper-mache sculpture in a downpour. It seems that these unfortunate people are trapped in an island mansion on the east coast, and one of them (a woman, I think) is attacked by Satanic worship to carry a child of hell, while others are trapped in grotesque, winding ways. <br /> <br /> Okay, now you have a cross-section of threads from "The Exorcist", "Omen", "Ten Little Indians" and a few other smaller films in the devil-runners amok line. None of this is too much fun and you'll usually overdo it with the stage until it's over. <br /> <br /> No, not even Linda Blair and David Hasselhoff are important. They are simply to collect payment and do not seem too interested in giving them "everything". <br /> <br /> It looks like Hasselhoff would probably like to come back to the place with Pam Anderson (and who can blame him?) and Linda ... well, who knows; PETA celebrity benefit or pro-am a golf tour or whatever it is nowadays. <br /> <br /> And torture scenes! Ecchhhh. You will see how people close their mouths, hang in roaring logs, tie on trees during a violent thunderstorm, tear the necks from their necks, etc., Sheesh, and think that "The Sign of the Devil" was the most sadistic movie I saw .... br /> <br /> Do not worry. It is not worth your time. I can not believe that I told you just like me. If you watch it, check if you can count the plates. And yes, Blair is possessed, as if you did not see him descending on Main Street, and the band is marching behind her. <br /> <br /> No stars. "Witchery" - these witches will give you itching.
