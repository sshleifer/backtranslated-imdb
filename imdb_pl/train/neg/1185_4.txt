Another variation and improvisation about the famous and beloved story about children, La Bete (1975) aka The Beast is trying to imagine (very graphically, and what may seem offensive and disturbing, but in fact rather stupid and comical) what actually happened between the beauty of the beast? I am amused by many reviews and comments that seem to penetrate too deeply into this film. I would not even go so far as to say that it is a serious and dark exploration of topics such as sexual frustration, longing, fulfillment or satirical criticism of Catholic religion. I would not even call it a horror-erotic movie. It is more of a parody of all species that it touches or mentions, although it has several shocking moments in all departments that will surely remain in your memory. <br /> <br /> A long (too long) scene between an aristocratic young woman and apparently frightening, but the most ridiculous I have ever seen in a film with a truly impressive ... well anatomy, is set on Scarlatti's harpsichord music and is hysterical. Both my husband and I laughed loudly at the exaggerated details of the meeting. The moral of this scene is that beauty can overcome the monster. The question is - who is the target audience of the film? For an erotic picture, he is too talkative; for an artistic film - it has too many stunning scenes of pure madness and I would say a sudden ending. IMO, the creator of the film, did not mean a serious drama. Jako parodia domu sztuki / horroru / erotica is funny and certainly original. Have fun and try not to look deeply. This story of curious beauties and lustful beasts is certainly not recommended for watching with children. The opening scene, which can shock the unprepared viewer much more than the infamous scene of bestiality, can be successfully used on the On Discovery channel for a program such as "In the animal world - mating habits and horse rituals".
