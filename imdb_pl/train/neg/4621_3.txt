When I was looking for the film on high and low level, I found it when I least expected it, playing on the Sundance Channel very early in the morning. Why I was endlessly looking for a small vanity project that Chuck Barris did during the last declining years of the TV show, I have no idea. The film is simply horrible. The scripting part that concerns the week that is. Of course, the highlight of the film is to see real performers who were "too hot for television" or rejected for some reason. This part is still awful, but dingy, which was nice in its own way. Now that I've seen what I've been looking for, will I watch it in my lifetime? Definitely not !! Do yourself a favor and just watch MUCH better "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind" or find old copies of the actual program. The girlish act, in which he licked popsicles provocatively, was funny, but the need to see Jay P. Morgane flashed the audience, which most likely made me sterile. In retrospect, I'm very happy that it was a huge flop, because if it was a huge hit, it could be "The 1,98 $ Beauty Show Movie" and that my friends certainly brought the Apocalypse. > <br /> My class: D
