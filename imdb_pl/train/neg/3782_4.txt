Here's the good news. "Spirit" is the most visually amazing animated film in the current home cinema release. Graphics and effects are revolutionary and I recommend that you give the film a look thanks to the graphics itself. <br /> <br /> And now the bad news. I really mean when I say animation is the only thing that this movie aims at. You may remember that the "ghost" was badly upset by "Lilo and Stitch" last summer. The first person who claims that this is because Disney is more established and had better advertising, can write to me a four-page essay entitled "Why Lilo and Stitch's Script Did Stink". <br /> <br /> For all the amazing new animation technology displayed in "Ghost" the story is almost * amazingly boring. There is a lesson here and (needless to say) that it is not only about animated films. You can have the most stunning visual effects you've ever seen in mortal eyes, but if your story is boring and, more importantly, you do not care about your characters, it's bad film making. Simple. The animation is still stunning; I just can not wait to see what someone with more imagination is doing with it.
