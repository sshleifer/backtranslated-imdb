This movie is simply bad. It's not worth watching to laugh about it. The crazy professor is just annoying. Even suspending disbelief to let invisibility (which I do because of good bad movies) and allowing extremely stupid victims in horror, this movie asks for even more. If you're looking for a shower cabin scenery for women and accidental sexual encounters, get porn, if you're looking for a good movie, get something else. If you just want to waste time on annoying bad movie, rent it.
