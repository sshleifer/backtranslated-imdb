Yes, it was pure unbelievable patronizing babble. We know that the French often have a distorted vision of the US, puritanism and views on sex. As an American (Hoosier) who lives in France, I have many opportunities to observe these attitudes. And although some of these preconceived notions may be true, NOT ONE PART OF the Midwestern city presented in this film has worked realistically. A man who never had sex because he was told in high school 20 years earlier that his penis is too big? Where in the world would you find it? Jukebox in the bar where only bluegrass in vintage style is played? A city with maybe 16 people less than two hours from Chicago, but without an important gas station, no TVs in the house, no McDonald's, no children ... A population that knows its intimate details, but continually joins like one big family, who hates. Adult males plant kokoszki in a local cafe, have farms, but do not collect, kill a guy who they do not like in front of everyone, and it seems that they succeed, and all this with equal emotions? A liberated French woman who turns a 17-year-old virgin because of her generous generosity, too much carnal guy who walks away from the cornfield by the usual breeze from Illinois to help this little 17-year-old boy from the farm? SUPPORT! I am so amazed and amazed by the absurdity of this film that I do not express how ridiculous it is. Go to it to find out what to avoid. Wow, I hope I did not ruin it!
