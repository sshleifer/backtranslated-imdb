I am not one of those who think that King is a great writer, his books are great entertainment for a few hours and often have interesting premises, but in my opinion they break up quite quickly if you think about them seriously. br /> <br /> This film is a fairly accurate repetition of King's story. If you have read the book, there are no surprises, no changes, you do not change the scenes or characters. This is a movie created by King's fans for King's fans. <br /> <br /> For the rest of us, there is nothing terrible in this movie, it is the horror of a "gypsy curse", and his scam is the curse of something that many people want to become thinner. The last third has some serious structural problems, and the somewhat forced ending seems to break the rules of this species. <br /> <br /> There are worse ways to spend 90 minutes of your life, but you might as well read the book because there is nothing new ... <br /> <br />
