For the first few seasons I thought The Apprentice was a very entertaining and exciting show. The combination of reality TV and a 16-week job interview was innovative, and the producers of the series managed to keep the show right, not "there." <br /> <br /> The new season 6 is nothing more than a big joke and it has absolutely nothing to do with business - in general. In earlier seasons, they put more emphasis on business-related tasks - now it focuses mainly on the conference room where participants are expected to do EVERYTHING to keep them on the show (meaning lying, talking with rubbish, stabbing in the back, etc.) . A conference room can be fun to watch, but it's entertainment at the bottom - sometimes you're wondering if you're watching the repetition of the old episode of Jerry Springer. The tasks in the series are boring at best and are mainly the showcase of companies that are stupid enough to pay NBC for advertising. And what is the matter of about half of the competitors living in tents in season 6? It is simply stupid and has nothing to do with business in real life. <br /> <br /> I have absolutely no respect for any of the players this season, they all seem to me idiots. In the earlier seasons at least some of the players had a bit of honesty, now it looks like the players would kill their own mother to keep them on the show. It also seems that the huge ego of Donald Trump is getting bigger for every passing season and to be honest, I do not understand why anyone with common sense would like to work for him. His rationality in the boardroom does not make much sense, and sometimes he seems to just like to destroy people for what is worth it. <br /> <br /> R.I.P Student. Please, NBC, for God's sake, take the show as soon as possible. Watching is too cumbersome. Apprentice was once a great TV series, but now it's just a big fat joke.
