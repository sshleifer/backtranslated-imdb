As a fan of "Jane Eyre" I was excited about this movie. "In the end, I thought, someone will make this book a movie following the story written by the author. Wrong!!! If the casting director intended to throw "Jane", which was simple, he certainly succeeded. Certainly, he would find someone who could also act. Where was the tension between Jane and Rochester? Where was the terrible tension of the novel when laughter fell into the seemingly out of the blue sky? Where was the glow of a child who flirted and danced like her mother? Finally, why the plot changed at the end? One wonders if the scriptwriters actually read the book. What a disappointment
