It's the worst you can imagine. The novel by H. Rider Haggard is very funny and dramatic. The creators of this worthless movie do not follow it closely. Well, old novels are not sacred, and creating their free versions is fine for me if you have your own ideas. If everything can be done, change things and replace them with uninteresting and watered clich√©s, stick to the original. If they did, this movie would be at least twice as good even with worse actors and if it was filmed in a studio with cardboard huts. BUt has no imagination, only fatigue. This should only be bought or viewed by collectors of Victorian novels made in movies. <br /> <br /> Only a hint, not a spoiler, I think that those of you who have read the novel understand what happened and what you can expect if you decide to watch it on TV or - God forbid - to waste money on the purchase. Gagool the old witch from the book and some precursor Gollum has been transformed into a nice gala!
