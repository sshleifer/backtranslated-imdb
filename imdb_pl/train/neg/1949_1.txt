The animation looks like it has been made in 30 seconds and looks more like caricatures than characters. I am a fan of Scooby Doo since the release of the series in 1969. I did not think about Scooby Doo's animated films (I'm talking about a TV series, not full-length movies), but some of them were pretty cool and I like that most people found Scrappy Doo annoying, but this series is clean junk. As soon as I saw the animation and heard how the heroes (and I use this term loosely) say, I cringed. In addition, Mystery Inc., was a team, and without the whole team complimenting each other, it seems that after opening the box of chocolates someone has already eaten the best, and the only thing left is those that nobody wants. What's new Scooby Doo was better than this. If you want to have a Scooby Doo television series, include the elements that made the series last so long. The whole cast of characters and high-quality animation. They have to put it back under the rock where it came from.
