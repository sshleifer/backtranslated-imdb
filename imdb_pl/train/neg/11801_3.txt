As a big fan of the original movie, it's hard to watch this program. A flashy set of decorations and harshly lit sets cut each style from this remake. Mood never exists there. Instead, it has the appearance and character of many television movies from the seventies. Crenna is not a bad choice as Walter Neff, but his lively dressing room and flat "swank" do not match the mood of the original nor make him an interesting character. He's doing his best to make it work, but Samantha Egger is a really bad choice. The English accent and the appearance of California can not bring the candle to the velvet voice and sexiness of Barbara Stanwick. Lee J.Cobb is trying hard to create Barton Keyes, but even his performance is simply rough, no style. <br /> <br /> It feels like it's a TV movie, and it reminds me of what an amazing movie it is.
