This movie is one giant trunk. Paul Schrader is completely lost in his own bad script. And his directing is as much in a coma as possible, without actually being sleepwalking during this process. <br /> <br /> The worst, however, is Woody Harrelson, which I usually like when properly planted. A "walker" game, a homosexual in D.C. who plays a social companion of bored wives of the Washington elite. He could not have been more one-dimensional if he had been cut out of the magazine and was jumping in front of the camera on a stick. His "southern accent" is the "off the rack" version, which decrescendos from the beginning to the end of each line it delivers, as if the heat and humidity in the south still exhaust it from every ounce of energy it has. It is monotonous. But his is not the worst accent in the movie. His "boyfriend", played by Moritz Bleibtreau, tries to influence some clumsy East-East accent that can barely provide bad lines written for him. He can not roll r, even though in real life he is German and speaks several languages ​​- one of them is Italy! That's a good reason to quit someone else, right? <br /> <br /> From the story, through the script, through directing, to working with the camera, through the performances of the guides, this movie is bad from beginning to end. The only known moments in this film were three supporting actresses: Lily Tomlin, Lauren Bacall and Kristin Scott Thomas. Only three of them managed to go through this film with their dignity in time. In fact, all three are perfect, even though they are trapped in a really bad movie. Unfortunately, no one would ever be good enough to buy back this infinite series of defects. If you like these three actresses, watch them in something else. This movie is not worth your time.
