This incredibly bad movie, shown in Australia as "Hydrosphere", is so bad that you are hypnotized and you have to watch it to the end, only to see if it can get worse ... and it is! The plot is so predictable that it seems to be written by high school drama class, sets are pathetic, but marginally better than miniatures, and acting is wooden. <br /> <br /> The "muppet" baby appears to be stolen from the "Total Recall" support cabinet. There was not one original idea in the whole film. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is so bad that I laughed most of the way. <br /> <br /> Malcolm McDowell should shame his head. Of course he needed money!
