I admit that I did not give this film a chance. I decided early enough that it was not my kind of film. <br /> <br /> Most of them have a great cinematographic look. Scenes from the early 70s in Manhattan look very good, as well as the main actress. It is very sharp black and white, which can make the film stale and fresh. However, some of the other techniques that filmmakers use in this hellish perspective, shoot to hell. The separable edition is VERY late in the 1960s, somewhere between surrealism and a new wave. The story also seems to come from a very specific time, somewhere between free love idealism and artistic experiments. <br /> <br /> The film tracks a young girl in town when she is looking for a man whose anonymous phone she has sex with. When she meets other strange characters, reveals her quirks and reveals hers. It seems that the film is comedic, disrespectful, but it adds avant-garde. I would expect that if you like Andy Warhol's movies, you'd be very excited about the discovery of the phone book. <br /> <br /> Problems I had: at the end of the movie one character tells a chaotic anecdote that lasts over twelve minutes - brutal to sit down. There is also a very clear sequence of animations, which I considered thick and juvenile, which serves as the climax of the film. I laughed loudly four or five times and I liked the ending (without hideous animation). And when the movie switched to the color for the last phone-booth sequence at night, I really liked the way it looked even better. I ended up feeling like I could really like it if it was a bit different. But that's what filmmakers gave us. It is unclear, artistic and left of the shield, but none of these reasons is recommended alone. I did not consider him to be exceptional or creative, just like forced and pretentious.
