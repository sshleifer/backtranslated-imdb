this movie only gets a second star because I work in the center and I like to destroy it. the effects were quite good - I heard that it was the most expensive Korean movie ever made. being the most expensive and still absolutely horrible makes it a huge waste of money. I rented it, so I will not complain too much about what I paid, but it was a few hours that I would never come back. lots of plot roles. terrible operation on the entire board. I do not recommend giving up watching this movie, life is too short. if your friends want to watch it, run away. I can not stress enough how bad this movie was. <br /> <br /> Where the hell did the second dragon come from? why did not he show up before? how were the rocket launchers of dinosaurs 500 years ago?
