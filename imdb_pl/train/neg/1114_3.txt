Nowadays, this amazing movie was a disappointment. The actors seemed stiff and devoid of inspiration, as was dialogue. Westerns are not so common in Hollywood these days, but movies like "Silverado" prove that someone still knows how to make a good movie. Given this, it is difficult to imagine that anyone would ever spend any money on the release, let alone create such a weak movie as this one. If you love and are looking for a good western, look no further!
