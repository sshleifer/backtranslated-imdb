Forgive me for being clear, but some movies are good and some movies are bad. Of course, there are extremes in these two broad categories. Movies such as The Godfather, Saving Private Ryan and Star Wars easily enter a good category. At the other end of the spectrum there are films that simply do not deserve mention of the name. Sometimes, however, someone creates a really pathetic movie. A film that should be singled out as a show of how awful a movie can be. A movie that is more than bad. This movie is Maiden Voyage. <br /> <br /> In short, Maiden Voyage is the story of a luxury cruise ship that has been kidnapped by a gang of evil criminals who demand a ransom from an equally evil, plotter owner. Of course, the entire American hero is on board with a sculptured jaw and a carved chest that saves the day. <br /> <br /> This is a production that introduces new depths. Everything is wrong. Acting, the direction and the so-called conspiracy are extremely poor. In short, it is an insult to the intelligence of every unfortunate viewer. Even an American viewer would be irritated by his shortcomings. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's so bad. <br /> <br /> I will resist the temptation to create a list of things that have angered me about this movie. However, his stupid than stupid application should serve as a good example of what I mean. <br /> <br /> Imagine that you are a bad kidnapper and you are standing in an open lifeboat in the calm sea. You are in the company of a hero who is holding a ticking bomb. He said the hero throws a bomb and dives overboard. What would you do? I do not know about you, but I would throw the bomb as far as possible into the sea. Not this guy. He watches our hero fly away, and then tries to disarm the bomb with unfortunate (for him) results. Sufficiently said. Such a fall would be worth mentioning on the Darwin Awards website and can also be an apt application to the life of the production team.
