Spinal Tap was funny because if you knew a bit about heavy metal, you could see jokes everywhere. If you know something about pornography, this pretend document will leave you cold. Everything in it sounds false. <br /> <br /> Spinal Tap was funny because it took a familiar world and pushed it up. This film is definitely not funny, because it shows the image of pornography that has nothing to do with the real world. <br /> <br /> Acting here is equally horrible, but it would not matter if the idea of ​​the movie was good. But it is not.
