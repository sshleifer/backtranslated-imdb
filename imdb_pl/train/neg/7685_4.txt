Disturbing melodrama taken from William Gibson's story, produced by John Houseman and directed by Vincente Minnelli! Richard Widmark goes in an elegant, elegant village nervous center, where his loose wife fights with the self-proclaimed queen Lillian Gish. her husband and child. Facetious and muddled, set in an unbridled time and place, with a love story "David and Lisa" hidden in a plush swamp. Widmark and Bacall have good chemistry together, but this script gives them nothing to build. Exactly for an hour, most of the dialogues are about what to do with the curtains hanging in the library (this thread is not used as a symbol, but rather as a red herring in secret!). The picture is hoping to show the quarrels that different people meet when they work in the same profession and everyone thinks that their opinion is right, but unfortunately the detouring way in which Minnelli discovers this goulash is neither informative, nor enlightening, nor entertainment. ** with ****
