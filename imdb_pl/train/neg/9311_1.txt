The cover on the DVD and the album is amazing, you might think that they made a sweet taste film of twisted metal black, which is still a great idea, but the actors of this movie are the worst, and Ben's pearl performance in the pearl port, have better quality and better actors . I was going to buy a DVD, but luckily I rented it first, the plot and the script are terrible too, nothing seems to go together, so the movie really does not make sense. Poor attempts to scare you with flashback scenes are worse than those used in the 80's series, and eventually leave you willing to hit your head against the house wall.
