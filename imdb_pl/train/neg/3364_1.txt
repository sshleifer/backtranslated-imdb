So it starts with a beautiful old house in the country. You have a group of people who have been asked to come to this house and (which is not surprising) the guardians always close the gates at night for no apparent reason. In any case, people laugh, joke, etc. Dr. Dr tells them the horrible story of this woman and some children. They are afraid, they are starting to feel things. Oh no, the ghost of the girl is seen. A little more talk, then this great spirit comes, etc. This girl learns that this ghost killed small children and that he must free their souls, yes, blah. She, but no, she dies like her. And he goes to heaven, while this evil spirit goes to hell. Two people survive and run away from home. The script is horrible because the guy cuts his head, and Elanor (the one who dies, saving the children) says "no". Acting is wooden, the effects are nonsense, and the set is several free rooms used many times. Basically, if you like to laugh at badly made movies, watch it, but if you're looking for a scare, definitely miss this movie. I was very disappointed when I watched. A very big profession. My sister (who very easily becomes a saint) got bored in this movie, it's scary.
