- Bad Stuff: This movie is really crappy. Bad tricks on one side looked so false that I thought it was "The Twilight Zone". Retrospections are useless. One part of the movie, which believes that the discharge of anger on the window, will improve his life. I want to know the director of the casting and whether he was tall, because acting, even from adults, was terrible. The kissing scene in this movie was not good at all. This movie killed a book. The book was great. I do not recommend this movie very much. Even for educational purposes. <br /> <br /> - Good Stuff: I do not know what I can really say. There are several elements that make you go, but are quickly shot down by bad stunt work and action. <br /> <br /> - My verdict: do not watch.
