First of all, when I saw the trailer of Wendy Wu, I was definitely excited. Brenda Song, one of the hottest girls on the Disney Channel, would do martial arts, and I was fine with it ... until I saw the movie. The action was poorly constructed, the film could not be realized for anyone, the fights were unrealistic and drawn ... along with the plot. If you really think it's wannabe Buffy the Vampire Slayer, a girl who is a descendant of other warriors who were women, the girl wants to ignore her calling and wants to be the queen of returning home, the observer who earns her, to prepare for the great fight with some ancient evil. The idea was not so original, the movie is a waste of time.
