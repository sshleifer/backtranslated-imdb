This movie was the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It looks like there is no plot, but the time when you realize that it's far beyond the beginning of the movie, so you have to watch the closure a long time to recognize the director's total incompetence, or laziness playing in film a cane, and we do not believe in Willem Dafoe in this movie, he is a clone, because the real Dafoe, as we know from the apocalypse now "and" the boon dock saints ", would never agree to such a scenario. <br /> < br /> Duh, (Da) foe wrote this account closed with his twenty years minus a baby.This movie begins with the words of the two main characters, Dafoe and Colagrande, and then two screenwriters, Dafoe and Colagrande, and then director Colagrande. < br /> <br /> Bottomline (story): Widow meets a guy, a guy busts a widow, widow breaks the windshield of a guy who hit her. <br /> <br /> Title in the Netherlands; Black widow (another title, the same bzdury). <br /> <br /> DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM !!! It's a total waist of time !!!
