I really do not like it. The story is quite awful and unconvincing. I enjoyed the first 10 minutes, the bill was good. Then it was pretty scary. Tim does not fit the role, it turns out that he is happy with himself, and Pruitt taylor vince is completely unconvincing as a trumpeter. It's an idealistic film and as a musician, you feel slightly offended after watching it. There are no scenes from 1900. Practicing or playing with team-mates is completely indulgent. It's hard for me to build any relationship with this kind of character, maybe I'm watching a bad movie. If you do not have a real passion to live or feel what musicians around then, happily indulge in disbelief and watch this waffle.
