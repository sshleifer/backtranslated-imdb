In my lit. the class we just finished, Hatchet, and this movie is not like a book. (1) Brian never ate the worms in the book. (2) He did not know the pilot's name. (3) His mother betrayed his father in a station wagon, not in a forest where someone could see. (4) The man her mother cheats on does not have black hair, she has blonde hair. <br /> <br /> Now unrealistic parts of the movie: (1) The thirteen-year-old can not hit the window with one punch. <br /> <br /> And for the actor, the kid who played Brian was a terrible actor. <br /> <br /> I think, however, that the scenery was impressive, although I doubt that the director even read the book. <br /> <br /> This movie is good if you have not read the Ax, Gary Paulsen book, but if so, start a letter of complaint with the director.
