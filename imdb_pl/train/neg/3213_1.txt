Well, I can honestly say that for the first time I have experienced a movie in which there was literally no meat or potatoes. The whole movie felt like a salad without a main course. The plot was fallible and ridiculous, the characters were one-dimensional, realism came out of the window, and the animation was done by four-year-olds. Does it cover it? I've never been more embarrassed about my whole life. I have never read comics or seen other programs with this character, but from the look of other reviews I am not beyond my observation. <br /> <br /> At first the story moved too fast. For someone new in this form and situations, I needed more built-in reasons instead of finding a solution. I've seen other Anime (if you can call it Anime) that do great things with their characters because they spend a lot of time developing them. Nothing put on Lady Death. In a few short scenes, we see him training with Cremator and immediately becomes an aggressive beast from hell. It was difficult for me to swallow it, pondering the moment before she was introduced as that weak and weak woman controlled by her father. Suddenly, he plunges into hatred and can fight an existence that has existed for millions of years. It was absurd. Lady Death's presentation was at least poor. I felt like she was just an animated character, not a desperate woman's vengeance on the mind. It just does not work for me. It was nothing more than an exciting look for pre-school boys who wanted to look at the massive amounts of skin that suddenly grew on their breasts while training with the cremator. Oh, I felt sick just watching her. The same applies to the character of Kremator. Who was this random person? The explanation they gave was not enough, and instead I had more inconsistent babbling than actual development. It is a very sad day in hell when we give up the characters to show more violence and action, especially in the animated film. <br /> <br /> Then there was Lucifer himself. I will just say that I think I could fight the King of Hell and survive. He was weak, his voice was funny, and he just did not represent the image I had in my head. It was as if Disney was in control and wanted it to become a half-PC. He lacked the darkness and corrupt nature that Lucifer embodies. He was not the ruler of hell, but only a stranger who had a bigger place to live. Speaking of life or dying, how can you die again in hell? It was a concept that definitely needed more explanation. Most heroes were worried about death when they did not even consider the option that they were dead. That's how they got to hell. I think that this level of thinking has ruined the movie. I did not quite realize that your soul is still in a body in hell, but it can only be me? or maybe because there was NO DEVELOPMENT in this story. There was nothing built, only preparation. <br /> <br /> The battle sequences were hysterically bad. The animation in this movie was similar to the one from the early 90's. There was nothing impressive about how to draw this movie. Why are we, America, for animation? It's huge in Asia and it's sneaking up here for hardcore, because we're still making films like Lady Death that do not challenge or use any part of the imagination. We are cheap, and this movie shows it. <br /> <br /> In general the movie was bad. Animation combined with terrifying voice work was cheap. I had a head somewhere in the movie like in production for a long time, which is difficult to understand because I think I could make this movie on my credit card. Production was terrifying, as was history. Nothing has been developed, leaving huge holes in the story, which almost everyone fell into. The strength of the heroes was lacking and nothing was explained. I wasted my time on this and I would like to warn others that when Death comes, you will not be in my condition and I regret that you have wasted 80 minutes on this piece of rubbish. <br /> <br /> BLAH! <br /> <br /> Class: * with *****
