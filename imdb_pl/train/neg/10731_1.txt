The film is basically a story of a Russian prostitute returning to her hometown for a sister / friend's funeral. There are several other less-important topics that may be more interesting than those that have been done but have not been fully researched. The core of the film is a funeral, a wake, and then controversy about the future of the community of crons that dolls make and sell them to buy vodka, but now they miss the artist who introduced the dolls to the market. Apparently the movie is not edited. The journey of a prostitute from town to village is a terribly endless journey by train and a mud tramp. Maybe this is to impress us with the vastness of the Russian landscape. The village itself, as it is, is inhabited by a legion of widows and one man, the spouse of a dead girl. The continuation of the dolls' activities is problematic for everyone involved and eventually seems impossible. Most of the film is shot using a hand-held camera that can cause nausea. Another problem for Western viewers is that the subtitles do not contain songs and lamentations of crons. Do not go to this movie unless you are fluent in Russian.
