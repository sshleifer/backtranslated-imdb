Simply put: the movie is boring. Cliché on cliché is confirmed, and the plot never merges. It seems that the director was not sure whether to make a movie or document. The main thread is very thin (the CIA agent is supposed to kill the oil prince, he gets caught and then warns the prince (why?)) And that's why a few elements were added to make the film more interesting. The child dies, which results in the father's "natural" response: free advice to the person indirectly responsible for the death of his son. The lawyer has a drunken "friend" and keeps him nearby, why, no one knows. Some children become suicide terrorists and blow up a ship. <br /> <br /> In summary, this is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. I was neither entertained nor intellectually questioned. I did not laugh or cry, I did not gain understanding or was forced to learn more or take up the matter. For me it meant nothing, which is the worst in my eyes, what can be said about the film.
