Essentially a typical propaganda film for the last good war. But a few things hit me. First oral epithets were used. In two cases, the figure Scott sets one, once in the beginning, when during bombardment drops the bomb ("cholera") and once, when trying to move the bombardier in the pilot ("s *% t"). I could have been wrong about the second instance, but I repeated it several times and it seems to me so. The third case concerns the situation in which Anne Shirley wishes O'Brien to say farewell and good luck ("Give them hell") through the roar of engines. She must have thought she was too unhappy because she clearly says "damn it". I also noticed an interesting character who has moral problems with bombing, especially bombing civilians. Good-natured superior officer assures him that only military targets will be hit due to the precision of the bombing used. Considering what we know about LeMay's later strategy of tearing down Japanese cities into oblivion, this scene plays with a bit of irony. I remember McNamara LeMay quoting in The Fog of War, in the sense that if the US does not win the conflict, they will be considered a war criminal. The end is overgrown, according to the film. It reminded me a bit the end of White Heat (I do not compare movies, only the end!). Maybe it's because it blows up. Blasted really well !!!
