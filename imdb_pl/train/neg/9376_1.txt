I got sick while watching this movie. I grew up in Pippi and it was a real pleasure every time. when my wife came to Sweden, she looked at the old men and she really laughed. but this American version should be renamed and never shown again. It is terrible from beginning to end. How can they deal with it? Well, I think someone blames the ha ha translation ... but they are never close to Pippi. Let this movie never be watched again and never sent to the broadcast. Burn the movie and save the children. if you want to look at Pippi, look at the original movie and laugh. We love PIPPI INGER NILSSON, I'm sorry, Tami Erin, you'll never endure the role of Pippi. Oh, yeah ... when you read the spoilers, the explanation, the spoiling of the surprise and robbing the viewer of the tension and joy of the movie. "Well, I think the director is in favor of this ... you're looking at this movie at your own risk ... it's really a waste of time ...
