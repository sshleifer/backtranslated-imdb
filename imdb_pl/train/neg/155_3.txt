It's not as much a movie as a big TV budget for kids. As far as I know, the villain is a huge swarm of espresso beans in chocolate. This theory seems to be confirmed by the fact that the subtitles describe it as "Insomnia." When it was mentioned for the first time that the civilization was destroyed by insomnia, I thought: "Wow! Nihilistic film of martial arts! "But there is no happiness. Although you must consider it an experimental cinema, when the villain is strangled by the long white eyebrows of an old man. Zu Warriors senses exactly whether subtitles are on or off. This is not a good sign. I found some special effects somewhere between Ray Harryhausen and Xena: The Warrior Princess. Primitive.
