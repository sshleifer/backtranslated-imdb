The main reason for writing this review is that I found a "revision" of a great game and a 1972 movie, a horrible movie experience. If I can save someone from watching, I will do a good thing. <br /> <br /> This "new" version is full of talent and everything goes wrong. Kenneth Branagh OK, ugly, sterile, one note set. He films a film of every possible, distracting, focused angle. We see reflections of stainless steel actors, security monitors, headshots from 200 feet above them, close-ups of the eyes, chins and farther and farther. The script, by the Nobel laureate, introduces long episodes of unpleasant homosexual banter, which is faked by both parties ... I think that ?? Given that the character "turns", how should I know? The characters themselves, so richly drawn in the original, are stupid and unfriendly. Working time has been cut by an hour, which is either a real problem or the nicest thing a director has done for us. Actors successfully perform their tasks, but nothing they say or do is not reliable. Jude Law surpasses more than Caine, but as a recognized producer he must have had Branagh's blessing. <br /> <br /> In total, I discovered that this is an ugly look, an unconvincing shell of a former classic. Why was it done ??? The public payer has spent less than $ 4 million worldwide for this purpose! This is a vain job that fails at every turn.
