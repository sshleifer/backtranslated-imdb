Is there a more intolerant and more judgmental movement than the ecological movement? To the beginning young socialist joining a circus must seem intimidating when he joins a real circus. Although such people usually outsource Hollywood to their brain on these important issues, Hollywood's teachings often seem fragmented and confusing. Fortunately, Ed is here to teach neo-hippies in the art of envirojudgementalism. <br /> <br /> Here you will learn to wave your finger in the face of anyone without losing your smirk. You will learn how to reject logic and science with the powerful arguments of fear. You will learn how to stop any human activity that does not interest you, describing it as a gateway to planetary Armageddon. <br /> <br /> In addition to learning to lie with a simple face, you will also learn how to ignore the accusations that are reflected in your way, no matter how hypocrite you are. You will be able to use as much energy as Al Gore, while people will treat you as if you were Amish. <br /> <br /> In the second season it was even more useful, because we could visit other Hollywood gods, be the holy names, and control - i.e. the judge - their way of life. NOTE: This is the only moment when the natural environment can judge someone else because it allows the victim to buy all kinds of expensive and fashionable ecological toys so that they can wave their fingers in the face of other people. <br /> <br /> What did Ed prepare for us in the third season? Maybe he will teach us how to judge during sleep!
