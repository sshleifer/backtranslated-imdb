A Nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie. There is no escape. I love this series and think that Freddy is probably the best character in horror movies. But even being a fan I can not help but see that this movie is mediocre. <br /> <br /> There is not even an effort to build an interesting story and strong characters. They have already given up. They do not even try. They are, of course, production, counting on a few easier dollars. <br /> <br /> History does not attract your attention. It's so simple it's almost gone. <br /> <br /> Alice, surviving from Part 4 is now pregnant. Freddy returns through the child's dreams. At the beginning, we find out that in order to stop him, Alice must find his mother. And that's all. <br /> <br /> The story develops slowly because there is so little plot that after a few minutes of bad dialogues and terrible acts it becomes quite boring. In fact, this is the only terrible thing, acting, because death is not even a little chilly. <br /> <br /> The characters are so uninteresting that we did not care about them. <br /> <br /> The girls are as unattractive as possible. The whole cast reminded me of a bad amateur theater group. I've seen better actors in school performances. It's really embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Lisa Wilcox still manages to bring some class to it. She is beautiful, sexy and has talent. But the material simply did not let it shine. Detriment. <br /> <br /> Stephen Hopkins is not close to the great direction of Renny Harlin in Dream Master. He's trying a few ingenious shots at the end, but it's the tension that Harlin and Craven have created so well in their previous films, there's no place to find them. <br /> <br /> The Dream Child is another unimaginable continuation. It's a kind of movie that gives the horror name a bad name. <br /> <br /> The end of terrifying Freddy once. It's too sad to see him now. A clown who is not funny. Bad joke. Good bye, Freddy.
