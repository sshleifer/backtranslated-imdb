I love Henry James's books, and Washington Square was no exception. I was very excited about the new movie, based on a book with this title. Jennifer Jason Lee is an exceptional actress, and Ben Chaplin is good enough to play major roles. Albert Finney is inept and does not perform well. I wanted to shoot Maggie Smith ... or rather her stupid, insipid role. The real problem, and what is missing in this latest version is a good script, music and direction. <br /> <br /> I fell asleep in the theater watching this long, drawn out and extremely boring movie. There are more pauses in the dialog box than in Pinter Play. In the book, I felt a deep concern for Catherine Sloper and her life. The film had the opposite effect. I did not like the fact that my aunt had a sexual attraction to Morris. Eeeeeeeek. YUK. <br /> <br /> Watch out if you can not sleep, it's a clear nap. Do not watch it if you are depressed. After that you will need Zoloft. <br /> <br /> Sure, "The Heiress" was exceptional with the title titles Olivia Haviland and Montgomery Clift. The actor who played her father was in place as an uncontrollable, cold father ... he still regretted his deceased wife and hated Catherine for that. The film was not faithful to the book, but it is not this one either. <br /> <br /> This movie was a cash register. I have no doubt why.
