I knew this movie would not be amazing, but I thought I would give it a chance. I'm a fan of Luke Wilson, so I thought he had potential. Unfortunately, many of the film's dialogues were very fake and shoddy. I think that Aquafresh gave some money for film production because he seriously omitted some tips. There is a shot in which the Aquafresh sign protrudes on you that you can not miss it. Perhaps they should concentrate on writing and playing more than the number of times we can drop Aquafresh products in a movie without annoying people. The movie had its moments, but I'm glad I did not spend $ 9.50 to see it in the theater.
