This hodge-podge adapted from the novel by Gore Vidal (actually one of the great American writers) makes THE MAGIC CHRISTIAN and VALLEY OF DOLLS look like Fellini's works. Raquel Welch, with an amazing body (actually not very high) in the lead role (except KANSAS CITY BOMBER, when she was pretty good), playing the alter-ego of Rex Reed (a bad film critic, not critics), just for to be surrounded by drag queen (gorgeous chick) Mae West, horny John Houston, young and "na√Øve" Farrha Fawcett (before Lee Majors, what a shame), and other different creeping azoids, to pretend to fake the way, there is nothing to do it, except for the old movie clips connected with each other (eg Widmark in KISS OF DEATH, Lena Horne) ... JUST so that they can continue to bleed the life of everyone. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10. Best performance =? It's so bad, it's worth seeing them!
