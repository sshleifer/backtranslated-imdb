I am proud that I have seen all three Fast and Furious films. Of course, the storyline is a bit stupid and can be a bit cheesy, but I love car racing and all the beautiful cars and secret racing at midnight. And I will be happy to see the fourth. <br /> <br /> Want to know what the difference is between the three and Redline? Decent acting, a slightly thought out plot, even if they are potboilers, and finally the directors, who were all three made by very competent directors, all took movies in a different direction, equally exciting. The line looks like the producer chose a dozen women with whom he slept on the casting couch, and made them add-ons, and then picked up his trail from the Hollywood unemployment line. And the script. What Mystery Science Theater 3000 is bad. It's the '70s for a television movie evil. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie had some nice cars, but you really do not see that many in action, and the action is so weak that you can not get excited about chases, If cars do not excite you, why walk for a movie like that? <br /> <br /> I am in the audience with a group of teenagers and I can not stop laughing aloud. it was simply a failure. <br /> <br /> Rent F & F movies. Go to Nascar Race. Go to the kart track and race. Whatever you do, avoid Redline like bad cheese.
