One hour, eight minutes and twelve seconds for this move, and I decided it was pretty bad. It was just after Hopalong (Chris Lybbert) falls on a horse from a tree to join a good guy. I was quite surprised with the whole catch of Hopalong Cassidy / Great Bar 20, which did not translate into anything at all. Of course, the name Coppola in the subtitles can not do anything to guarantee success here, even with a few mentioned ones. <br /> <br /> If you reach the end of the movie, you'll probably end up asking yourself the same questions as me. What exactly was the hook with gloves? What is the rodeo scenario? Who was the Alien to represent? Why did they make this movie? <br /> <br /> I could probably continue, but my energy has been exhausted. Look, there's a western called "The Gunfighter" from 1950 with a guy named Gregory Peck as the title character. Watching it will make you feel as good as watching it makes you feel bad. This one I can recommend.
