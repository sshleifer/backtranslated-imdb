It is considered fashionable to highlight every social evil as a result of patriarchy and male domination, although moronic may be illogical "logical". However, in the story and topic of the film there is no gray area, and the woman who should be called the antagonist of the film is "the villain of this story". Under no circumstances can you justify what she did. Women's sexuality is just a buzz in this case and has nothing to do with reality. It's a betrayal of the final kind. The man finished by spending his resources and time on the prodigal upbringing of another man's offspring. On top of everything, the most pathetic arguments raised by the 3 "liberated" female characters at the culmination are pathetic. The sexual needs of women are not an excuse for adultery and they keep betraying their husband, and what is worse, there are no other children. In fact, his life was wasted. In some societies where justice still prevails, such situations result in the execution of the unjust.
