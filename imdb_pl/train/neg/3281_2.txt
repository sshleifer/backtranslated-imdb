I had a suspicion that the film would be bad. I am a fan of Duke from the very beginning. You have three years of TV series on DVD. Well, I was right. She took the family to see it. I really wanted to see the general's jump again, and some of the chase pitch scenes were good. In conclusion, the film was a stupid version of the television program. <br /> <br /> Jessica Simpson was pathetic. Although I can honestly say that the original Daisy costumes were equally revealing, the interpretation of Daisy by Jessica Simpson was simply horrible. Sorrel Booke and Denver Pyle also have to roll in graves. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money. If you're an old, tried-and-true Dukes fan like me and my three kids, you'll be very disappointed.
