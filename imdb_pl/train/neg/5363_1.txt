I did not think that this movie would be worth a bad script, bad acting except for Janine Turner, no fantasy, stupid plot, stupid husband and unfair divorce settings. If you've never seen this movie before, do not even worry about it being worth it. The only thing that was good was that Janine Turner did a good job. Terry's husband is a stuck smart lawyer who has won many cases and even killed murderers. He thinks he's so smart, but he's really just a crazy man. Her best friend is having an affair with her husband and cheating on her. Nice girl, huh. Yes, it's a real peach, no. She also does not have a day at the beach.
