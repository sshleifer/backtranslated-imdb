In my life, I've seen many great and awful movies. I'm not an expert on professional reviews, but I definitely have something to say about it. First of all, these actors are the worst I have seen ... Their game is so unreal that you even want to throw the DVD in the first 2 minutes. I think those actors were not interested in quality. <br /> <br /> The other horrible thing is these dialogues - they are very bad. Sometimes you feel uncomfortable when you hear them. It looks like your 14-year-old son can work better. I feel that this movie had a budget similar to the cost of my 14-year-old European car ... <br /> <br /> Please, if my message reaches you - save time and money.
