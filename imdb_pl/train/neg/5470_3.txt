Tromaville High has become an amoral wasteland of dirt due to the accidental release of toxic waste by a nearby nuclear power plant. <br /> <br /> An unrestrained chaos filled with absurd violence and stern behavior. Rather terrible, of course, the intended mess of the film, when the filmmakers cut the reins, allowing them to talent the undeveloped free-throw. The craft was far from Troma's list of targets for this bloody sleazefest. The honorary society are punks with amazing paintings on their faces and bizarre outfits. A German teacher who becomes a member by a "toxic kiss" has streaks on one side of the face that really gave me creep. The toxic monster that sent angry punks at the end is pretty cool. br /> <br /> They treat the kind of connoisseurs of cinema with all their heart.
