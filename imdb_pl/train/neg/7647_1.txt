Madison County Bridges is a better-made version of this story. I felt that the ending of this film was not treated with sensitivity as in the original English film. This movie is very Indian, if you are a very sensitive person who cries in the movie, when the hero dies in the end, you will love this movie. On the other hand, if you are a warrior in life and you think that crying is for wimps, not like ending. But overall, this pretty good subject is well prepared for Indian conditions. Taboo was good as a caring wife and mother. Everyone was working well.
