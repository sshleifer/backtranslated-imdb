The problem with THE CONTRACTER is summarized by the opening scene. The CIA wants an international terrorist to die, so contact the black abbot's killer, James Dial. Terrorist appears at the Old Bailey court in London, who asks why they want to run into a terrorist if he intends to spend the rest of his life in prison? In both cases it will be out of circulation. Did the CIA have no chance before he was arrested? If by chance you get a sentence of innocence, kill him. There is no logical reason to kill someone who intends to spend a life in prison with maximum safety. <br /> <br /> Because the premise determines history, the audience may choose to ignore the hole in the story, but the task itself spills fuel fire. Dial's friend is killed by a police bullet, and a taxi enters accidents, but Dial can escape. So the police were close enough to shoot someone, but too far to stop someone from a car accident? A movie of this type of plot plot. Later Dial finds a police inspector pointing to him with a gun, saying that "this airport is surrounded by armed copper," but Dial manages to escape without explanation. The whole film cheats the audience, based on things that have never been explained. This includes an important supportive character called Emily Day. Why does Dial help, even though she is a wanted fugitive? Your guess is as good as my <br /> <br /> This is a pretty bad thriller and should not be taken into account in the cast of "big names". Wesley Snipes qualified as a movie star, but he killed his career by appearing in increasingly inconsistent films. Charles Dance also appeared in large budget Hollywood productions, such as LAST ACTION HERO and ALIEN 3, but once again he is best known for appearing in the film straight on DVD, and playing as an episode. People like Lena Headey can become big players in the cinema, but they certainly will not be able to put THE CONTRACTER in their CV
