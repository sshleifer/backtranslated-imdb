Some people have underestimated this film because they question the credibility of Black people in the Old West, Asians in the Old West or women with weapons in the Old West. Get a grip and read a book. There were many Asians (Chinese), there were quite a few blacks (freedmen), and everyone outside the Gentile class had easy access to weapons; This is the second amendment you know. And as far as the use of modern language is concerned, none of those people from the West approached the used language in a nostalgic way, which was in line with the epoch presented. The Americans had different accents, used different inflections, talked at very different rates and used many words and phrases that would be unrecognizable today. Do not blame historical inaccuracy for simply not kicking. Be honest. Maybe you just do not feel comfortable with what you see.
