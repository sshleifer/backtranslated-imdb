Robin Williams gave a great performance at The Night Listener, as did other cast members. However, the film seems hasty and leaves too many loose ends to be considered "must see". I think the problem occurs because there is not a strong relationship between the interlocutor and the south of Gabriel (I had to spell it this way because IMDb wants to automatically correct the correct spelling for "Nobody"). The film lasts a little over 01:30, and in the first 15 minutes, or at least it seems, Noon begins searching for Pete Logande, a boy. <br /> <br /> This happens after talking to a mysterious interlocutor about 3 or 4 times. Conversations are not too deep, mainly based on how you are ... I am in the hospital ... why did you lead the boy ... etc. In the book the kid almost becomes a contraction and vice of the south versa, and the reader understands why he is looking for it when he finds out that the kid is disappearing and thinks he can be a mystification. <br /> <br /> In the film Noon is obsessed with finding Logande, the audience wonders why? Because there is not a strong bond between the south and the interlocutor, why bother? Who cares if the caller does not exist? <br /> <br /> I know there is a difference between the book and the movie, but these connections and this relationship were crucial for establishing on the screen, because it forms the basis for the rest of the movie. Because this is not happening, the movie is falling apart. <br /> <br /> This is surprising because of Maupin's other work, Tales of the City. When he was created in a mini-series, he worked beautifully.
