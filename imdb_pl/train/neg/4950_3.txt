I think it can sum up this show as well as anything else. Batman TAS can be the worst thing that can happen to comics on the basis of comic books, because everything that comes next will be compared with it and nothing has changed yet. It's just damn good. Was Batman better? "Yes, but it was not TAS." Is the justice league good? "It's not that bad, but it's not TAS." <br /> <br /> Batman is not TAS, but I will not oppose it. It would be unjust and besides it has many other problems with it. <br /> <br /> The concept of a younger, less experienced fight with Batman is great, and sometimes the art is very pretty. But for the rest of the time, art is worthless in America, and it reveals many flaws in the performance itself. It is chilled, written and designed like Americanime. If I wanted to watch Jackie Chan Adventures, I would watch Jackie Chan Adventures. Or I can hit my head at the wall any time and get the same effect. Joker is a murderous, mentally unstable clown in a suit that uses cunning, unpredictability and clever gadgets to fight Batman. When he is forced to fight with his hand, he will either run away to something cheap or be completely defeated. Do not be a dreadlock monkey who knows kung fu and can jump twenty feet into the air, accompanied by speed lines. If they wanted to do it with a villain, there were other, less important heroes that they could use or * gasp * could create a completely new one. And it's not that re-imagining is bad, do not get me wrong. TAS (I go there again) took Mr. Freeze from his standard black armed wizard and made him an unforgettable and morally complex figure. Of course, Freeze was not a classic villain at the time and they did an upgrade, but the point is. What Batman does is everything you like in Batman's comics and knowledge, and takes a large, stinky pile on them. Guess what? They ate the corn. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that this show can not oppose TAS, but stand on your own feet and still does not work for me. Plots are not good and they do not develop better. They were written for demographic children under the age of twelve. Should children be allowed to watch the program? Of course they should. This should not be a performance for adults with swearing, nudity and unjustified violence. But the sign of a really good program is that you can watch it at different levels of all ages. This performance longs for this sign. <br /> <br /> Is this performance TAS? No, of course not. The problem is that it is not even JLU.
