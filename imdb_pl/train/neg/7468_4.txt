Probably the only thing that brought me a movie to four is the fact that I love Peter Falk. One of the world's great performances of inept incompetence. . . yet it is one of the few anchors that prevents it from becoming a chaotic catastrophe. As Pops Romano, it provides a respectable blend of gangster charm and a simple man with Chris Kattan's maniacal stupidity. Respected performances are also offered by Richard Roundtree as the harried chief, Vinessa Shaw as a talented FBI agent reflecting his head from the glass ceiling and Fred Ward as adviser to Falk and Benedict Arnold. <br /> <br /> In fact, it has great possibilities and, in the hands of young Steve Martin or Chevy Chase, it could turn out to be a great comedy vehicle. Kattan, who seems to adore Ernest or Pee Wee Herman, just gives a mess. Unfortunately, Peter Berg and Chris Penn, who represent his different brothers, both differ significantly from their proven capabilities. <br /> <br /> There are some very funny scenes, but they are too few and separated too much boring. What I really miss is always attracted to Leslie Neilsen's films. There is no "second level" of the joke on the slapstick. There are no cultural references that only adults receive. . without double encouragement. . it's just stupid. <br /> <br /> And by the way, that's not all that I recommend it for your 9-year-old, because I hope they have a better taste and less fascination with some of their body parts and their functions.
