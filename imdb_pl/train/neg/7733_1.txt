What a disgrace! I checked it out, hoping it would be James Garner's undiscovered gem and how smelly it turned out! The production quality was good, but the plot was undeniably poor and I can honestly say that I am only a few hours older and much stupid. The movie really did not have the features of redemption and if this type of thing would appear, it would give Hallmark a bad reputation. For those of you who insist on knowing what's going on, there's nothing in it, and in this case it's not a good thing. We are observing an old woman who is one of the most stupid creatures ever to roam the earth, who is actually the wife of a true beloved who is probably the only living person who could endure her. He drags him through one mess after another, introduces him into one embarrassing situation after the other and is always proud of himself. Then the movie ends. What a relief! Do not take the time to watch it, so do yourself a favor and skip this one, you'll be glad you did, if you knew how bad it really is.
