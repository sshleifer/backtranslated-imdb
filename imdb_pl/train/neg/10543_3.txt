The only thing that The First Power really does have is that it gives Jeff Kober the chance to play one of his charming varieties of psychotic villains he has done so well over the last 25 years. Kober is a worthy successor to Lyle Bettger, who specialized in these parts in the fifties. <br /> <br /> But that's not enough, The First Power is a broken movie that Lou Diamond Phillips has wasted as a LAPD detective who has a specialty in catching serial killers. Kober is his latest hook, but Kober has weaker power and intend to join forces and make Lou's life unhappy for him. Even after Kober receives a gas chamber, his spirit returns in all kinds of costumes. <br /> <br /> Mykelti Williamson is at your fingertips as Lou's partner who encounters a horrible end with a demon-possessed horse and Tracy Griffith's psychic and Elizabeth Arlen as a nun with insight help Lou. Will he be able to deal with forces from outside? <br /> <br /> Before the movie ends, you do not care anymore. Lou was really trapped in a turkey. Maybe the devil told him to make this movie.
