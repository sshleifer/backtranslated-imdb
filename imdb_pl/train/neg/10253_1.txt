Christopher Lee is one of my favorite actors! I'm trying to see all his work. He was known for self-recording movies with his presence. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. This film suffers from a low budget, and its production values ​​are worrying. Please ... out of love for Christopher .... avoid this movie!
