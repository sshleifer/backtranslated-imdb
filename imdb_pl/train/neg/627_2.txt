Oh my dear. This movie ... It was awful. I am a HUGE fan of horror movies. In most cases, horrors that other people think are bad, I like. The actor who played Scarecrow was amazing, I will say it. But this plot was terrible. This did not make sense! At the beginning it was too much and an unnecessary (and repugnant) sex scene. I believe that the director tried to be "shocking" or something like that, but it just was terrible. To add to the pile of festering shit, which they called the plot, the actors (in addition to the "scarecrow") are terrible and I did not care so much about them that soon I forgot who is who. In conclusion, this movie made me sick. If you can still avoid watching this video, do it.
