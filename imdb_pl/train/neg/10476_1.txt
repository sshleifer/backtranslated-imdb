I am Christian. I have always been skeptical about films made by Christians. As a rule, these are "know-nothings" when it comes to film production. I admire TBN for trying to present God and Jesus in a positive and honest way on the screen. However, they did it hideously. Acting was awful and if someone is not familiar with the Bible in some way, he CAN NOT understand what the film tried to get. Not only was the film terribly made, but the people who created it had even some facts. However, in this "criticism" these facts are irrelevant and too deep to delve into. In short, the Omega Code is absolutely the worst movie I've ever seen, and I would not recommend it to anyone, except for the comic relief of everyday grind.
