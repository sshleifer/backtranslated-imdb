I was crazy that everyone did the movie. I was even more annoyed that I lost precious minutes of my life, still sitting to watch it. I could have a wax work and was more entertaining. At least Cherri makes me laugh before it hurts. At first I was a bit confused, but then I understood what was going on. At the time the movie was halfway and Yes, I'm a procrastinator, but I always want to see things to the end. So I stifled it, I watched it all. Actors are not only not as attractive as they are in Cruel Intentions, but they are simply not convincing. I saw my nephew cry more convincingly than the alleged desire shown on screen in this film. If you like bad movies with bad acting, watch this.
