My first exposure to Templarios and not good. I was excited that I found this title in the Anchor Bay Video offer, which brought us other iconic classics such as "Spider Baby". The print quality is excellent, but this alone can not hide the fact that the movie is deadly boring. There is an exciting starting sequence in which residents make terrible revenge on templars (and set it all in motion), but everything else in the film is slow, heavy and ultimately unfulfilled. Adding an insult to the damage: the movie was dubbed, not written, as promised on the video jacket.
