Seeing the first ten episodes, I must say that this show sucks. <br /> <br /> What worries me most is that the performance was shot in Canada. I know it's cheaper, but they should have filmed it in California so we could have scenes in the desert. It would be more in line with the movie. The first scene in which they are found outside in a different world is in the mountains, with lots of pinetrees, where it looks cold. This is not too Egyptian. What worked so well in the movie was that it felt like you were in ancient Egypt. Here, it feels like they are running around fighting aliens in a Canadian forest. And it is so bad that on other planets the fall is also coming. You can see the leaves on the ground in the forests that look like forests outside of Vancouver. This makes the performance even more incredible and silly. <br /> <br /> And then there is Richard Dean Anderson. He is not Kurt Russel. Sure, he does a decent job and tries to copy Russels' performance a bit, but it's not as cool as Russel. And not a good actor like Russel. And the way Russell played in O Neill was much more cynical. Andersons Oh, Neil is too soft. I liked the fact that the Russell version simply did not give a penny and had no problem detonating the bomb to the very end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Michael Shanks does a really good job as Jackson, taking over the role of James Spader. <br /> <br /> Teal'c is a really annoying figure. He is Jaffa. Not Jaffa. Only Jaffa. Aaaarrgh !! Former bodyguard of pathetic Ra, seen only in the pilot and one other episode. Teal'c talks and acts like a robot. I've seen better acting from Jean Claude Van Damme. <br /> <br /> And the fact that Teal'c and the character Ra and the people they wrote in the film can suddenly speak English, is also incredibly stupid. Aliens so frightening in the film was that they spoke in ancient language and were real monsters. <br /> <br /> When it comes to special effects, they're really good at the remote. But very rare effects in the real program are poorly made and look cheap. Especially the planet they visit with crystals. It is obvious that they walk around the sound stage with a poorly made background image. It's an insult to us that they've made it look so cheap. Especially when they could do it in front of a blue screen with a cgi background. <br /> <br /> The X files had better effects when they released their first episodes in 1993. It was 4 years before the start of SG-1. And they had no apparent budget for two million dollars for the episode that the SG-1 supposedly had. They had to spend all their money for catering. Because I do not see it on the screen. <br /> <br /> An incredibly boring and senseless performance that could be great if they made a show in Hollywood with a bigger budget and better writers and better characters.
