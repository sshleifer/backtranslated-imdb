Your attitude in Prom Night II will determine how much fun you will take from the movie. If you're looking for masterpieces of horror, look somewhere else. If you like camp movies that are fun to watch, you'll love it. Lisa Schrage has the time of her life playing at the highest level. Mary Lou and Wendy Loyd perfectly convey the rage of Schrage during her "possession". <br /> <br /> Not a classic cinema, but a great way to kill a few hours with a despicable ending. <br /> <br />
