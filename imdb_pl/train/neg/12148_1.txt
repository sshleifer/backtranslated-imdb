Honestly, who in God gave the film an 8.1 rating? I think that people who actually did or played in the film voted. Otherwise, this movie sucks! This film is nothing but an amateur film, or maybe a student. I am a cinema fanatic and have seen horrible films, but there was literally nothing repurchased. History and acting were the worst I have ever seen. Props, including the use of toy airsoft guns with terrible special effects, where as bad as everything else. I am for bad language in movies, but F-Bomb has been dropped roughly every third word and I think we can win the winner for the biggest use of F-Bomb in every EVERY movie. The film also seems to be filmed using low-cost video cameras, not a real movie. I would expect to receive rewards for an amateur film shown only on public access stations around the country, but it is not part of the DVD. <br /> <br /> Do not buy this movie. Do not rent this movie. I can only say that it was a terrible waste of a free coupon to rent a movie. This is a valuable time that you will NEVER regain. Unfortunately for me this time is lost, but it is not too late for you. If you decide to rent this movie, consider this warning.
