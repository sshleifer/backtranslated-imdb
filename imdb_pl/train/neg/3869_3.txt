This is the second time that I've been watching this movie for about 12 years. These comments come from someone who thinks Kane and Amberson are amazing, worthy movies. But the remainder of Welles's career is unfortunately wasted on material unworthy of his talent and too weak to withstand his film embroidering. And when he creates a potboiler such as Shanghai, the lack of something significant to hang his film tricks is simply sad. I could not tell you what he is investigating here. It's all the same upbringing as Welle's horrible Irish accent; which requires a lot of effort, but adds absolutely zero to the movie. Several Welles projects have become so extensive and baroque. Mr. Arkadin (choose version, any version) is a similar project. The material is irrelevant. It simply can not bear the weight of all this pasta. For a director dealing in a drama based on reality (like here), he never feels a stroke to tie his pride back to reality; or a coherent story. The murder system for renting is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Kudos to Welles, for the fact that Hayworth cut her hair and brought out this performance. The camera loves her. She is the most classic, most exclusive, sensual and thrilling femme fatale she ever made in the film. But her betrayal comes so late in the movie that it seems some desperate decision, so that the film has a genre to which it fits. The film can not be saved by the noir convention implemented in the last 60 seconds. <br /> <br /> When everything is said and done in L.F.S., all the turmoil are for this? to convince you that you have seen something thought out? to give Welles more to do? that you throw your eyes? Welles is not sensitive to the scale of the story or tells the story directly. One wonders what Shanghai has to say to anyone who is not a crippled billionaire, arranging a quadruple rental murder or a fanboy in love with film-like pride with no sense and content. <br /> <br /> Cursed, ridiculous, non-alien.
