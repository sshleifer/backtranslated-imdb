Gadar is really a stupid movie because it tells a fake story. It is too unrealistic and is a typical solar deola film that aims to break up Pakistan. trying to hide your own flaws will not work. And all the songs and music from the movie are bad. Most likely Sikhs will love this movie because they are wrong. I think only Amisha Patel was good in the movie. If I can give 0 out of 10, I would like to, but the lowest is 1. Save 3 hours of your life and do not watch this stupid boring movie.
