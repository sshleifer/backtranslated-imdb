This story of a sword and spell with a terrifyingly brutal and soulless "hero" defeating the evil king is worthless in almost every detail. Acting is frightening from leading to secondary. The defiant, grim joy with which the director shows the hero who spills blood is absolutely disgusting; he is not redeemed by any justice for his cause, because he is as bad as the people he fights with. Editing Z's movies is plentiful, including a scene in which the character "dies" because of a sword thrust that he clearly missed completely! <br /> <br /> The film is clearly based on the charms of women's lead, Barbi Benton and Lana Clarkson, who parades mostly nude throughout the film. As a 20-year-old man, I will not pretend that the female body on the screen does not attract me. But treating their characters is so degrading, and sex scenes so free and without joy that I could not enjoy even this aspect of the film. <br /> <br /> Most shoddy films from this era are at least a little redeemed by a light, brazen feeling (the sequel is better in this respect), but DEATHSTALKER seems to be taken seriously as a heroic fantasy. No way! Avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> Mark: 1/2 out of ****.
