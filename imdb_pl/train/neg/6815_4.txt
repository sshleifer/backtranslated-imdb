The eighth film by Jean Rollin, which I watched, is probably the strangest; an intriguing plot (as it is) seems initially too weak to sustain even its duration of 84 minutes, but somehow it tries to be extremely confusing! The would-be vampire (scantily dressed, as the title promises) is being held captive in a distant castle and emerging only to "feast" on the blood of willing victims (who are apparently members of the suicide club). unsure of where it all will lead him, the writer-director ultimately has a human villain? a properly perverse father of a hero with an empty face ?? absurdly revealed as a mutant (?!) from the future! Lazy pace and sleepy atmosphere (cultists wear hoods and animal masks to hide their characteristics from a protected girl) are, of course, typical of both the filmmaker (similarly the setting of the sea at the climax) and the "Euro-Kult" style, just like a bunch of wonderful beauty at the exhibition. Personally, the most pleasant thing in the whole visually attractive, but intellectually vain thing was watching Bernard Musson, a well-known actor (who appeared in the last six films of Luis Bunuel on the last day), appearing surprised from time to time!
