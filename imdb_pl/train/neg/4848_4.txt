I love a good war movie and I fall into the category "I was there, I did it". So I would like to think that my opinion is accurate (IMHO). After watching this movie on DVD, I can safely say that it was a pile of rubbish. I can not recommend this movie to you. <br /> <br /> It started with the fact that I was shouting at the TV, saying "you would not do it" etc. ... But I quickly realized that some work experience would be a hindrance, so I was a little chilly. But on the opening stage, when the wheel fell off, I had a nasty feeling that this movie would be a predictable misfire ... I was right. <br /> <br /> There was simply no logic in the EOD scenes. I only know that the military team had the most patient insurgents at the other end of the command line or a remote trigger. So much so that I scratched my head all the time. Then when you think you know where history is going, the guys from Humvee are leaving for the desert. One of the most valuable assets of the theater to be entertained by some would-be SAS contractors. <br /> <br /> The sniper scene was so funny. It just did not make sense and made me want to turn it off. Then, to drag him for so long, I really checked my patience. It started with the "Contact Law" and I quickly left the hill. If you had a British accent, you were shot, but if you were a member of the EOD team, suddenly you were a great shot and you saved the day. Then, just as you thought, it ended, it stretched into an inexplicably long period without adding anything to history. You just look and ask why it's not over yet? <br /> <br /> Then we had an alcohol scene in which they simply hit each other to laugh. It added nothing to the movie. <br /> <br /> When my life seemed very blunt, the main star came out of the wire to hunt someone. This is the most absurd scene I've ever seen. It denied all logic and the ability to write a good story ... it was meaningless and terrible. I still do not understand why they were wasting time. Then, to watch him running along the busy streets, returning to the camp, I laughed on the floor. Czysta komedia :) <br /> <br /> The sad fact is that this story is in the whole series without deciding what it wants to be. I thought it would be stupid, illogical scenes of EOD, but then they started acting on the tangents, trying to be something else. But it was as hard as it tried to bore me to death. I just wanted it to end. It was a messy compilation of stupid scenes mixed into a batch of stupid, senseless action scenes (ish). <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this. Perhaps my professional experience has violated pleasure, but even naive must be aware that it just does not make sense. The only stupid thing than this movie is the artificially high IMDb rating ... which must be the 24/7 work of a cash register team that seems to use this site as a way to convince everyone that it is good. I'm sorry, people ... it just is not! <br /> <br /> I do not recommend ... it just bores you.
