What the hell is in your minds? This movie sucks! With every minute I became more and more bored. I tried to watch the end, because I hope that something will happen in the end! But instead, I was amazed at how boring this end was ... What is the story of this goddamn "bogeyman"? Why is not he dying? He is a damn human being for God's sake! An ordinary boy who killed his stupid sister 15 years ago. Then what? His stay in a psychiatric hospital made him immortal? This film is fascinatingly stupid ... It must be stupid. I will sell it to some stupid guy who will understand this stupid movie.
