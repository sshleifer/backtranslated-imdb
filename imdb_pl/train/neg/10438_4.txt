the movie sucked, it was not fun, it was not exciting. they tried to do it so badly that it would be good, but it failed. and thinking that it's great to like this movie, next to the noise, that's the only reason why this movie is a success ... <br /> <br /> the fact that at the moment 50% voted for 10 out of 10 for this movie it seems to me quite disturbing, either the movie becomes crazy, or the voice is unrealistic, which may have many causes and should be addressed. anyway, it's less than the average movie that blossomed in your mouth. His success can only be described as a marketing miracle.
