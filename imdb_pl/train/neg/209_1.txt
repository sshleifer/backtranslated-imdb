I could never stand watching Happy Days after Chachi joined the cast, so I knew I was in trouble when the best scene in the movie included Scott Baio (skateboarding scene!). Jodie Foster in his first role of "adult" turns in his usual professional performance, but it does not justify this boring mess. Two hours from my life that I will never come back! No remarkable characters, incredible plot, dubious edition and terrifying photos, but the worst part is that I would not care less. The story of teenagers from California in the '70s, where children live an unhappy life, and all their parents are idiots. Do not waste time watching this ugly movie excuse.
