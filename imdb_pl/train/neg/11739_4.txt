Often a reliable Leonard Maltin says it is a "great affair" and that Sanders is "wonderful." Maltin must have confused the movie with something else. Sanders is snide and droll and gorgeous, as usual? you can imagine that he delivered a poem about adultery "Sometimes the chains of marriage are so heavy that they have to be worn by three", but boring, wooden and outdated describe this film more accurately. The plot itself, an autobiography with Sanders as a thieving jewel thief, Francois Eugene Vidocq, who becomes the head of the police, but can not resist the temptation of great jewels, is fun enough, but has the same kind of empty historic Hollywood treatment that plagued such epic epochs like * Marie Antoinette *, and certainly regrettable * Forever Amber * (which screams for a classic remake). Although in his defense Sanders tries hard to add some depth to his character, all this is in vain. I am a firm fan of Douglas Sirk, but this is 1946 and it is one of Sirk's earliest American efforts, devoid of many characteristic accents that would define his robust, breast-raising potboilers. Sirk has just softened his feet and made some unforgettable movies for the next few years until he won the gold thanks to * Magnificent Obsession * and hit him, bombarding us with such estrogenic fiestas as: * All That Heaven Allows *, * Written in Wind * and * Life Imitation *. But * Scandal in Paris * is not his best job? a relatively low budget with bad sets and ineffective costumes.
