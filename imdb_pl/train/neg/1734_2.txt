I am a big fan of old westerns and I do not believe that Hollywood is able to capture its former glory. But even Ronda Fleming and Stewart Granger can not help the movie of 1957, which carries almost all the trivial features of the westerns of the reformed gunner who was a good guy. a fallen but virtuous woman, bigoted burghers who have to ask the shooter for salvation, etc. I can not help but notice the names of the writer and the young "actor" who plays Granger's son. Is there any nepotism there? I've seen better acting in high school plays. Chill Wills plays the cartoon character of Chill Wills. Did I still get 1000 words?
