Do not get me wrong, I want the marijuana to be legalized just like the next guy. Now digress. However, writing was unrealistic. PTA's mother dealing with drugs, but unyielding that her drugs are handed over to the underage person. Give me a break. The satisfaction of the very nice character of Mary Louise Parkers was an insult to my intelligence. The characters were not nice at all. Basically, the story lines have disappeared. I understand his only television country. Hypocrisy was glaring. Mary Louise Parker is supposed to be a great mom and I have to believe in it .... WHY ???? I just got the impression that I was being preached by displays of stinking abundance. It's like saying that it's OK to cheat on your wife, but with someone about the status of a legal age. OK, not exactly the same, but I think people understand me. I think that saving things for children is wonderful on the campaign routes, but it does not keep water in the cable sitcom about the suburban mother as a local croupier.
