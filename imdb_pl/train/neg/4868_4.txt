At first, I thought it was about Eddie Murphy talking to stupid animals. I was right. Some call this movie back to Eddie Murphy! Who are these people? Jesus, if this is the best he can come up with, he can just stay away. What was the story? I was so annoyed with all the pathetic jokes I forgot about. I should have come out of it.
