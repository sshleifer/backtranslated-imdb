Here's another Diane Lane movie in which she cheats on her husband. Is this the only role he knows how to play? This time it is set in 1969 and betrays her husband with a blouse. I am not surprised because it is very predictable. Then her husband gets mad and throws milk. I would not be surprised if she slept with a milkman. I would not be surprised if she also slept with an ice man because it is a very boring movie. Then after throwing milk, I say sorry and see the blouse again. Duh. Then, when she does it with him, her son is stung by wasps. My mum always told me not to throw stones at the wasp nest. This mother of children did not have time to tell him, she was too busy with a man's blouse.
