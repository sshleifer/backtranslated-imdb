The Return is one of those movies for this niche group of people who like movies that bored and confused them at the same time. Sarah Michelle Gellar plays a lame business woman who does not kill vampires or become naked throughout the movie. I was willing to bear it, but I was not inclined to accept the worst edition ever combined with senseless retrospectives. In the end, it turns out that she crashes her car when she was young. Or maybe I'm wrong and it was just a flashback. There is no way to say in this film. Can you believe that the same guy who created the Army of Darkness has released this shit? A much better idea is to stay at home and watch the Army of Darkness on the Sci Fi channel. This movie had everything: whores, zombies and a guy with a chainsaw on his shoulder. Forgotten, he did not even have one of those things.
