I found this movie boring, monotonous and quite uninteresting in a hasty, shallow "optimistic" ending that did not fit the whole story. Following these characters through the weekend of horrible events, unfriendly attitudes and bad news is simply not my idea for a watchful, interesting movie and I was tired of his subject of "one note" and I could not wait for it to end - in fact I almost stopped in half. The whole film seemed pointless and wandered, and the characters were mostly depressing and unpleasant, although the acting was good. A small movie with small ambitions and a small appeal - sorry, but I just did not succeed and I love good, small movies! This one just did not go to waste, although I still looked at it with hope and confidence that it would be so. I was disappointed, especially after two local reviewers placed him on the list of the "10 best years". I definitely recommend watching "The House of Sand" - now it's a good, small movie!
