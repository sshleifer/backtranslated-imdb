This movie stinks. I do not think I've ever seen a film that would be as embarrassed. The plot was relatively interesting, but the dialogue was super flat, and the acting was bland. It could have been a good movie. I think it simply consisted of grotesque visualizations. I usually deal with graphic scenes and human taboos, but it seemed to me that Miike was shooting for the sake of shooting. Only one badly made movie. Watching this movie has nothing to do with entertainment, unless you are fascinated by the depletion of clear scenes of incest, pedophilia, necrophilia, rape, self-immolation, parental abuse and siblings, and the scattering of feces. I think I just sold the movie to many of you, but I meant it when I said it stinks. He managed to succeed in other movies, but I think it would be better if you were looking at someone who was moving.
