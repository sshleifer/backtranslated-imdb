If you liked "Blair z", you'll like this one. He has the same poor work with the camera and soundtrack, and has the same non-existent storylines and tense moments. <br /> <br /> He also has Tom Savini, so if you like Romero "Dawn of the dead" or Tarantino and Rodriguez "From Dusk Till Dawn" are waiting for you. He is an icon and a very good actor. <br /> <br /> No, seriously. This movie is by far the worst movie I've seen in a long time, and I've seen a lot of movies - including the bad ones. I can say that most horrors are fun in a way, but it was just a waste of time. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave this movie 2 instead of 1 were naked chicks and hot action with all the sharp plastic teeth ... No, I'm just kidding. I had to miss you before I hit the "Submit" form. <br /> <br /> Stay away, even if she has sexy girls with teeth on the cover!
