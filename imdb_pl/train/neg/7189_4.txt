What a disappointment! The 6.1 result here at IMDb has aroused some mild expectations, but oh, I was disappointed. The first thing that torments me is these fairies, stereotypical kids from universities. Yes, I know teenagers can be childish and so on, but why are they always portrayed as complete morons in movies? There was one hero who thought it was okay, but he / she (without revealing it here) was killed before the end. Other characters were poorly made, and even the supposed hero / heroine simply did not. On the plus side: the plot is quite good, and the productions price something more than this kind of cinema. Acting generally was not very good, Rutger Hauer stands out in a small role. But everything goes wrong with bland and bold characters. You just stop taking care of them after 10 minutes. 4/10 (and it is generous).
