This program stinks. Parents usually want their children to watch something good for them. It is usually educational, fun and bright. <br /> <br /> Is this educational? No. Doodlebops sing and that's all. They usually sing about themselves, they do not try to teach anything. <br /> <br /> Is it funny? No. Doodlebops instead say something that is not intended as a joke and they laugh at it. <br /> <br /> Is that clear? It's so bright, painful. As for the color, everything is very bright, so that's good. But NOTHING is never wrong in the world of Doodlebop. That's why they are always happy. a kid in trouble will fall into depression because he has never been exposed to sadness. <br /> <br /> The show is also extremely bad. Each syllable has the highest level of exaggeration and is very trivial. It's an exaggeration. <br /> <br /> It's entertainment for children, but after 2 years you will not want your children to see it. They will never know how to grow up.
