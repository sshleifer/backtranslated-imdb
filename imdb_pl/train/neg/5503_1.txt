I grew up watching the original television series in the sixties and one thing I can tell you right away is no comparison. This movie was completely ridiculous with the flying suit that lived. A Martian who took different shapes. Special effects that look like something that will create a small child. However, in the original characters were developed, and the viewers developed feelings for Tim and Uncle Martin. The only distinction in this film, yes, actually it was one, it happened when Ray Walston finally appeared at the end. He wore dark glasses and referred to life on this planet for 30 years as a kind of homage to the TV series. But even a real Uncle Martin could not save this turkey.
