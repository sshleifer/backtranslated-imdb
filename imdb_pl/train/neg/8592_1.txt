Making a film in the suburbs and the "real" Star Wars trilogy would even tax a great filmmaker ... Mr. Lucas is not the filmmaker. <br /> <br /> The presentation of a fall good man in the dark needs a good actor ... Mr. Christensen is not an actor. <br /> <br /> The first 60-80 minutes are overwhelmingly boring with just a few pockets of even more light saber battles, but there is no advantage because you already know which heroes will survive into the original Star Wars. <br /> <br /> Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) plays a very fleeting role here, and the best idea is the silence of Jar Jar Binks! <br /> <br /> There is no movie only with the chancellor involving the Jedi and has one great (long-lasting) sequence on the lava falls
