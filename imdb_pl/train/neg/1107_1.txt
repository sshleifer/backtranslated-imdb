I read the back of the box and talked about Mary Shelley, Percy Shelley and Lord Byron. I thought: "wonderful! It will be great! "I was so wrong. This story was screwed up. In fact, I still do not understand it. It seems to me that all the characters are drinking, smoking (opium?) And having sex. Not that these are not good movie features, but please! Where was the story? I forced myself to finish the movie and yes, at the end he got up, but then the movie was almost finished. Hire if you really want to. Just do not trust the back of the box.
