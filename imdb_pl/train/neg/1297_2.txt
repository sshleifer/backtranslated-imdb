Basically, I picked up this movie because I saw the brilliant remake of Zatoichi Kitano Takashi, and I was in the mood for another updated samurai tale in which Asano Tadanobu played. These two films are different from each other. Zatoichi added humor and depth to his characters and undermined the traditional film stereotypes of samurai. Gojoe emerges from a deep end in a different direction. <br /> <br /> First of all, I hate movies in which other characters inform the audience, what is the main character, instead of developing a character during the movie. "You can not decide whether you are a monk or a warrior," says almost every character in the presence of Benkei, but this inner confusion is barely visible in the form itself. Instead of character development, we have bloated, boring, bloody battle scenes. Asano's figure is undeveloped, and even he looks bored and does not know what he's doing there. I know it usually looks distant and cool, and that's part of Asano's appeal, but this movie does not serve him. <br /> <br /> Many camera movements are nauseating. There is a scene that lasts forever, in which the camera revolves around the main characters, until my wife and I felt like vomiting. The ending is ridiculous and rather anti-climatic. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that really good samurai films are not currently produced in Japan with this type of budget. Colors, decorations and costumes were great, but the rest is just a long waste of time. I'd rather see one of the versions of this kabuki myth.
