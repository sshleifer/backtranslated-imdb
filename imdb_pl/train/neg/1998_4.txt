My roommate got the soundtrack, Well, Nanette as dub on tape, and she started listening to it all the time. After finally giving me brainwashing, I found the songs irresistible, especially the famous ones, I want to be happy, but I can not be happy ... But from the thick soundtrack, I had no idea what kind of movie it was o. So one day I saw his copy in the video shop and I rented something that was supposed to be a long-lost version of the movie. I thought it would be amazing because the soundtrack is so cute. Unfortunately, most of the songs that I loved were not found anywhere in the movie that I saw. Now I have never seen the version of the 1930s musical, but this version was unfortunately disappointing, because there was very little singing and practically there was no dance, and besides, the sound was really bad and you could not really understand what people say a lot of time. Indeed, the only attractions of this film were the scandalous fashion of the 1940s. Nanette wears this crazy hat with two feathers that protrude like rabbit ears, and Kansas Kitty has this bizarre muff with feathers that he holds on his shoulder and then wrapped in this scarf. One dance sequence is also a bit strange with Nanette doing these weird ballet pictures with pin-up girl images superimposed on her. In fact, one of the brightest points in the film was the artist Guillespe, who dreams of being an excellent artist, but is currently doomed to draw girls with money for money. I like how Guillespe keeps her in the old school, and throws out Nanette, when his masterpiece, a work that was supposed to make a career, is being sold by Nanette for a poor $ 5,250. Does he not realize that this piece was his immortality? Stupid rabbit / girl with your rabbit ears on the hat. When will you learn? Why do not I just smoke with a pencil before people get the work from the ads?
