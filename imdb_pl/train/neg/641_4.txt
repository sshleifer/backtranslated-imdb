To my knowledge, Largo's winch was a famous Belgian comic book (never read) telling the playboy adventure, the kind of James Bond without spy life! So when I had to choose a movie for a five-year-old kid, I picked it up because the kid was already a huge fan of James Bond! <br /> <br /> But right after the opening credits, I have serious doubts: when the American films offer an amazing start, here, without action and a hot sex scene? Then the story becomes very complicated due to financial movements? I thought I lost my kid. <br /> <br /> But, oddly enough, he was caught by Largo and more than James Bond! <br /> <br /> Was this an excellent interpretation of Tom Sisley? Difficult relationship that Largo has with his father? A story with many boxes in which friends are bad guys, bad friends are friends? Exotic locations of Honk-Kong, Yougoslavia? <br /> <br /> I do not know, but he really cares about Largo ("Will she get up?) and we enjoyed our moment.
