I just came from watching this movie and decided to see what others think about it. I wonder if those people who give great reviews have seen the same movie! This is a potentially very good story but does not end up in the brand. The script is very weak - the story has so many holes that it could be a great fishing net. The characters were not well developed, and the plot jumps so much that I ask myself, "How did we get here?" At least half a dozen times during the film. <br /> <br /> There was a lack of chemistry between the cast members. This is probably related to Lindsay Lohan's pics during filming. It was quite clear that everyone came and did their job, but they did not commit themselves to their roles. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie that is worth seeing ... go for a walk, play a board game, take a nice, warm bath and save money for something that is worth it!
