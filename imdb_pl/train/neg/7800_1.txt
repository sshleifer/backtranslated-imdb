In addition to the low cost of dirt, this exercise with inability to make films was difficult to pass. It has a typical gore that you can expect from a zombie movie, but there is no atmosphere required to make it worth it. <br /> <br /> It is strange that this is an amateur German movie and version I saw English dubbing! The doubters seem to be American fans (penpals of the Germans?!) Who can not decide if they want to play it straight or turn into a comedy. One character (white German, of course) is dubbed by a black guy who talks with fat ebony! "Kno wahm sayin", Comrad?
