There is only one thing necessary to appreciate the Runner Indian thoroughly. Unzip pants. Look inside. Is there evidence of Y chromosome? Okay, you'll do. <br /> <br /> This movie has all the masculine requirements: blood, weapons, car chases, nice women, death, multiple tattoos, cigarettes, alcohol, violence, pyrotechnics - what have I missed? - oh yes, soldering lamps. <br /> <br /> As a woman, I seriously hope that Sean Penn will recognize this as "an effort when I was a child ...". Because he wrote and directed the thing, he is almost exclusively responsible. Unequal cast (as usual, Viggo Mortensen shows brilliantly how work should be done) tries to save Penn. Too late. Lines and activities are there. Even dedicated, qualified acting can not change that. <br /> <br /> I found this childish and stupid movie, as well as predictable. The dialogue staggers - Sandy Dennis has my respect, trying to breathe life into a wooden maternal monologue without maternal authenticity. Then he dies. After some time, the father of the heroes, played by Charles Bronson. Their absence is almost invisible. <br /> <br /> At certain intervals, pyrotechnics, etc., mentioned above, seem to enliven and scare the public, thinking of something important. <br /> <br /> If you're a man and you're under 25, you can love this movie. You plan to return to him at the age of 35. Do you think you will still like it? <br /> <br /> I do not think so.
