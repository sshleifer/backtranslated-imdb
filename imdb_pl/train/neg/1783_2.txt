There are no spoilers here ... Because there is no conspiracy that could spoil it. Madchen Amick is a living proof that the face can earn a living - it does not require talent. The only bright spot is some really good one-liners released very nicely by Alice Krige, but on the other hand, she is Alice Krige. Her delicate dreamy voice gives the only clue how seductively dangerous these strange creatures can be. She is incredibly terrifying in this incredible conspiracy. The way they made her accept this project remains a mystery. The authors of the scenario had to be treated when they sent this script. He has serious problems with continuity, superficial stereotypical characters, writing horror formulas and it just does not make sense at all. Creatures, although they have neat skills such as "dim", the question of where they come from and what they are, is never so much explored. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time on this one.
