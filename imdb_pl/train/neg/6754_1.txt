The only reason I'm trying to comment on this movie is to save all 97 minutes of your life and maybe your money. <br /> <br /> I bought it without borrowing for Â£ 3.00, it looked interesting, so I took a chance. <br /> <br /> Within minutes of switching on, I noticed that I had made a mistake. The whole cast should be kept away for the winter, and then cast on the nearest fireplace, where they could meet more of a kind. <br /> <br /> When it comes to Devin Hamilton (screenwriter and director), there should be a shot, but unfortunately it should be done before he made a trash. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie, if you see it in stores, run away. <br /> <br /> 1/10
