They show this in some networks. It's nonsense. Although it's not as bad as the B movies that show up on the Sci-fi network on Saturdays, but it's still a pretty big pile of nonsense. Acting is passable. The plot and writing are quite unusual, and the pace is completely free. Every minute of the film seems to be part of a movie in which they wrap things before the subtitles - not the top of the movie, the solution. Large cast parts also look old in the age range they play. The whole is predictable, boring and not worth watching. Save time. It is not even worth the time to watch it for free.
