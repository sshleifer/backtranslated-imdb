Recently, I have been subjected to both this film and "King Arthur", on DVDs chosen by others for the evening "entertainment" and together they have achieved only the growing conviction that the modern public is watching the film completely. he lacks discrimination and is content for as long as he "works". Both films were complete garbage. <br /> <br /> What happened to the development of the character? Whatever happened to meaningful dialogue? What happened to the action? And watching something that is vaguely supposed to be "historical", whatever happened to an attempt to grasp a certain accuracy, some realistic idea of ​​a "political map" of that time, even some delicate taste of the era, especially in its social attitude. Why does everyone have to display a set of values ​​in America in the 21st century? I have read on the discussion forums reservations that "little is known" about the dark ages. Not at all. Significant sums are known, with many learned scholarships in those days, but these jokers simply could not be asked to do any homework. <br /> <br /> I would just like to vote 0/10
