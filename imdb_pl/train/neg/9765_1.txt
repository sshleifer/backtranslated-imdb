We do not often give out "some", but if there ever was a movie that deserves such attention, it's "Gaz!" It's the indulgence of complacency that reaches the atmosphere of M * A * S * H ​​and falls completely flat on the face in test. <br /> <br /> I see why Corman - Malcolm Marmorstein and Elliott Gould tried to recreate Gould's immortal role in the original M * A * S * H ​​movie with a similar story (in the movie "Whiffs" - see here in IMDb, http://www.imdb.com / title / tt0073891 / for more information). <br /> <br /> Marmorstein and Gould approached the brass ring from "Whiffs" than Corman from "Gas!" but did not quite reach it. Not one of these films even approached the success of M * A * S * H. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with "Gaz!"? What is not? Nobody comes closer to acting at a higher level than middle school. Production values ​​stink. Someone else mentioned here about magically regenerating headlights in a car that is not fully focused on the details. Nothing works as it should be in this movie and nobody cares. <br /> <br /> "Gas!" actually put me to sleep. This is not a cure for insomnia, but really close. On the Cinematic Sleep Induction "Gas!" Scale is somewhere between "Last Year at Marienbad" and remake of George Clooney's "Solaris" (which was unusual in itself because it was more boring than the original Mosfilm, despite the apparent ignorance of this the idea of ​​keeping the audience's attention through a reasonable editing). br /> <br /> A sensible edition decimates "Gaz!" to about twenty minutes. The result would be pointless, but no more so than the original movie. <br /> <br /> Some movies are so bad that they have an irresistible quality that makes them worth watching. This is not one of them. Do not waste time. It is not even funny.
