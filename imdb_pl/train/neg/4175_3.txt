I think that the acting career of Michael Ironsides must end if he has to play in this kind of nonsense. Certainly it can be better than wasting time on this trash. <br /> <br /> This movie can be a lot better if it has a good budget, but it shows many times throughout the movie. There is one scene on the outpost that looks like her, in front of the train station, and I bet it was. <br /> <br /> There is one scene that made this movie 3, and it shows a spaceship landing and taking off at the lake, surrounded by forests. It was well done, but the rest of the movie, forget about it. <br /> <br /> There is another scene that looks like an engineering plant in which I'm betting and does not look like a cosmic outpost as the character says it is. <br /> <br /> This movie is stupid, it has a serious low budget, there is no point and God helps Michael Ironsides.
