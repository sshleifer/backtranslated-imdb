It is very rare that an episode from x files does not cause any excitement, or the episode contains something that is simply completely boring to watch. The detective and his ex-partner both die in unexplained circumstances. the presence of a little girl who was there when the deaths occurred. Mulder invented the theory that a policeman murdered by his colleagues came back to a reincarnated as a little girl and is a demanding vengeance. Now for a weird piece. The little girl has no connection and it seems that it is a random person chosen as reincarnation. I think it was a bit lazy writing of writers, and this episode is one of the worst in the history of x files!
