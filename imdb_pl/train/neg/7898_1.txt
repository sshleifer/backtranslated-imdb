When I saw this movie, I could not believe my eyes. Where were these funny creatures, muppets with garbage and big, pointed teeth, really meant to be frightening? Or where to have fun (I sincerely hope). If you are watching carefully, you can even see how the strings support them (better, dragging them on the screen). The whole thing was rather fun than frightening and I had a good time watching the movie because I was surprised by its general inability to have only one good part. This is one big joke from beginning to end and I think this movie belongs to a new category: so unbelievable that you will laugh from beginning to end. (I will not even try to comment on acting or all other things)
