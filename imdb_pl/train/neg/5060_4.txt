This movie is the perfect adaptation of English Flick Unfaithful. Ashmit plays the role of Richard Gere, Emran in the role of Olivier and Malikki as the perfect crook of Lane's wife. <br /> <br /> Even then, the movie has full traces of infidelity, though he could not catch up with the original. It was a cheap, soft porn from Bollywood lovers, where Mallika showed a lot more skin than anyone dared to show. Emran did more of these roles and was even called a serial killer. In the future, if Indian directors plan to rework an English film, they will have to investigate the feasibility of a conspiracy with Indian censors. Although the film bombed the box office, the actors received excessive recognition. In the future, directors should be a bit more cautious in re-casting an Oscar-nominated film. <br /> <br /> Everyone said it was not a family movie, so be careful when watching it at home with your family.
