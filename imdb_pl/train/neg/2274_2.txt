Well, I hate Hollywood, but I love cinema, so I have to watch those dirty movies in cinemas. And I was hoping Vanilla Sky would be good. I was hoping that they would keep the original "Open Your Eyes" exactly the same or they would make their own. Well, it happened to be a bit of both, and it got sucked in. <br /> <br /> It started well. I love Radiohead. I would like there to be more. But at the end we listen to Good Vibrations by The Beach Boys. Discuss a wide range of suction between. They had one or two good songs at the club and maybe a few others, but why oh, why they had to bounce off the GV during the climax. It was more annoying than confusing or glaring. Especially when he has NOTHING TO DO WITH A PLOT. At least give meaning to the songs. Kid A = basic. Whether. <br /> <br /> He also did a great job on the club scene. It was cool. Otherwise the movie was one big ball of arrogance. As if the recipients got a movie. Those who read it and the rest do not. It's so simple. The motivations got screwed up. I did not understand Diaz's motivation (have not they made a chicken soup before?) And several others. And I hate Kurt Russell. Stay overboard. Tom Cruise can not work (especially in this type of movie [eg Eyes Wide Shut]). And the elevator. I understand. In any case, they tried to refine the original with a shitty soundtrack to American rock and bad angles and good print quality and glossy processing, which would help if Crowe did not screw it up. <br /> <br /> 2/10 Big disappointment.
