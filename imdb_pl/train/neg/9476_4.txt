Pretty crazy criminal with all the black cast who is trying to figure out who murdered the trumpeter who was about to go to Hollywood to make Big out of it. Was that his wife? His girlfriend? His would-be girl? Her father? His footman? The newspaper guy? Who knows? Who cares? The effect is a bit disappointing, and the actors here really do not give me the mood to worry about it. Why snake poison as a weapon? Who knows? Who cares? The music is fine, but there is not much of it, and most of them are pretty "let's end up with this" It's not worth your time. There are better black and white films.
