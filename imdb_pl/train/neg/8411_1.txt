We were expecting something wonderful when we went to see this bomb. This is basically a Broadway game shot on film. Music is terrible. There is no one memorable song in the movie - did you hear any hits from this movie? No, because there are not any. Some music numbers have lasted so long that I got up to go to the toilet and get pop corn and it was still when I came back! If they sounded good, but they suck. The pace is slow, terrible character development. Lead was praised for singing, but it sounded like she was screaming every song - it was almost impossible. This film has no one to offer, but die-hard Broadway enthusiasts. This is undoubtedly the most famous movie I have seen in my entire life. A complete deck of time and money. There is nothing memorable in this movie, with the exception of Danny Glover, who was not sufficiently visible on the screen and whose character was not sufficiently developed. Rent a movie and you will agree - this movie was an expensive, produced, polished dog.
