I am very surprised to see such a high rating of this film, as well as some reviews that should be positive. I saw the movie and I was very disappointed. I did not like it at all. It was slow and he lacks entertainment. Even murder scenes are weak, with real close-ups of general stabs that do not look good at all. And the supposed big end of the turn is really not much, I saw it coming, and then the end seemed just trivial. This movie may not have much of a mention, but with a bit of it it's overrated. I do not recommend this movie.
