David Arquette is a young and naive alarm seller at home <br /> <br /> sold under the wings of Stanley Tucci. Arquette is a <br /> <br /> gold boy, winning a lot of sales in his first call - to widow Kate <br /> <br /> Capshaw and her stupid son Ryan Reynolds. Everything is happening <br /> <br /> good for Arquette, he appears in ads for the company <br /> <br /> and falls in love with Capshaw. <br /> <br /> Then Tucci and his right woman Mary McCormack let him in <br /> <br /> take a little secret - sometimes they break into their homes <br /> <br /> customers to scare them and get their neighbors buy from the company <br /> <br /> security systems. Arquette decides not to get involved in <br /> <br />, taking Capshaw to meet his family and going through life <br /> <br /> with a silly smile on his face. Then someone breaks into the home of Capshaw and murders her and her son. Arquette suspects Tucci and sets up a series of traps, resulting in his weapon boss when Tucci asks for his innocence. <br /> <br /> Based on the stage play, "The Alarmista" is not well open. Scenes <br /> <br />, in which Arquette takes Capshaw to meet his parents <br /> <br /> are badly played and completely do not match. They are also off the line <br /> <br /> with the character Capshaw plays when he gets drunk and tells the sexually explicit story to mother Arquette Michael Learned. <br /> <br /> Other <br /> <br /> than these scenes, Capshaw does not have much to do, but <br /> <br /> does a lot with what is not enough. <br /> <br /> Stanley Tucci, looking just like Terry O'Quinn, will live as the owner of the security company <br /> <br />. He is a creeper who does not really understand Arquette's moral disgust. However, when he changes into a <br /> <br /> screeching skomler after Arquette kidnaps him, he's funny. Mary <br /> <br /> It seems that McCormack was prepared for a bigger role, but <br /> <br /> mainly stands and agrees with Tucci. Ryan Reynolds <br /> <br /> is too old to play a stupid teenager, but he is funny, especially <br /> <br /> by telling his own clearly sexual story of Arquette. <br /> <br /> The script also lies from the romantic comedy to the dark comedy <br /> <br /> soon. Capshaw's meeting with her parents is completely devoid of motivation, <br /> <br /> with the exception of giving her a reason to leave the city, so that someone could break into her house. <br /> <br /> Capshaw and Reynolds are in the movie <br /> <br /> to give Arquette a reason to take revenge on Tucci. <br /> <br /> Arquette, who proved he is a good actor, is terrible here. <br /> <br /> is based on constipation that caused it to go through AT & T's ads and <br /> <br /> and is not strong enough to build a weak movie around. Actually, Reynolds could have been a better <br /> <br /> choice in the role. <br /> <br /> Dunsky's direction is good, nothing will win an Oscar soon. <br /> <br /> The bright, jazz result of Christophe Beck is reminiscent of the movie type noir, to which <br /> <br /> the film tries, and is really catchy. <br /> <br /> Despite the advantages, Arquette's defeat as lead and script <br /> <br /> schizophrenic quality is embedding the film. I do not recommend this. <br /> <br /> This is rated (R) for physical violence, violence on weapons, some blood, <br /> <br /> strong vulgarisms, short nudity of women, sexual content, strong sexual <br /> < br /> references and situations for adults.
