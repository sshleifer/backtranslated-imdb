A boring, predictable horror with numbers at least has quite good special effects and plenty of (mindless) chaos and gore to please (mindless) fans of the genre. Mainly it's about giant rats chompowanie on a set of characters, which we do not care about the iota - if it's your business, tune in. (* 1/2)
