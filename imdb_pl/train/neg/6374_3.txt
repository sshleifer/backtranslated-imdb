This movie was initially a bit misleading. I usually like Gina Phillips, but the one I have to say was a bad choice, as in Ring Around the Rosie, which is also not a good movie. Jeepers Creepers was much better. In any case, Faye Dunaway was good. It completely scared me, and at the end it was crazy. It was about Jennifer Cassi (Phillips), who comes to the funeral of her twin sisters. She stays at home with her sister and her grandmother (Dunaway) lives with her aunt named Emma. Mary Ellen (Dunaway) sacrifices her relationship to stay alive and can not die as long as she wants to live. Even if Jennifer tries to kill her, she tries to kill her. Ravens have a strange role in this. When relations go to sleep, the Ravens eat organs there, so they can not fall asleep. But they do. Essentially, everything is crazy and Mary Ellen will never die, and her relationship will be buried, but not dead, they must suffer forever, so Mary Ellen can stay alive. Yes, I hope it will help. If not, I'm sorry. I love you.
