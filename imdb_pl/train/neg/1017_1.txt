Dear God. That was awful. It's bad, then it was. This movie does not make any sense at all. It works on the whole map and has no idea what it says at all. The music seemed to be like Batman. The fact that "Edison" is not a real city, takes away. Ever since I've lived in Vancouver, watching this movie and acknowledging all of these places has made it unbearable. Why did not they make it a real city? The only decent letter was "Timman", in which John Heard did a fantastic job. He was the only actor who played his role in a realistic way, not at the top and campus. It was a shame that John Heard is playing such a great evil guy with a lot of time on the screen, and the movie is a dud. Detriment. I hope someone will see this, or at least give credit to John Heard where credit is due, and hire him again as the main evil guy who should be. on the list A.
