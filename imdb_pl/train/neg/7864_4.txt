The Hills Have Eyes II is what you can expect and nothing more. Of course, it will not be an Oscar-nominated film, it's just pure entertainment, which you can just get lost for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> The plot is essentially about a group of National Guard trainees who are fighting against the notorious mutated hills on their last day of training in the desert. They are the only ones fighting in the whole film, which contains a lot of violence (which is basically the whole movie), because blood and guts are flying all the time, and another scene of graphic rape, which makes no sense to shock the audience. <br /> <br /> I would give Hills Have Eyes II 4 out of 10 for pure entertainment and that's it. Although, even as the film continued, I looked at my watch, which began to drag, because he was still trying to shock the audience with a graphical gore and sporadic jump scene to make sure the audience was awake. The Hills Have Eyes II is just decent entertainment, something that can kill time if you're bored and nothing more. <br /> <br /> 4/10
