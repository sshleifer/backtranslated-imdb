Watching this lady in Ermine I wondered what Betty Grable was doing in a project that seemed to be directed to Marlene Dietrich. Someone from 20th Century Fox could decide that one sex symbol is as good as another. Darryl F. Zanuck should have known better. <br /> <br /> Betty plays the nineteenth-century Italian countess, whose domain was attacked by a branch of Hungarian husbands, captained by Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. Her spooky ancestor, whose portrait hangs in the palace hall along with the rest of her distinctive family tree, can not see the similarities in Dougu now and other invaders some 300 years ago, which she handled when the armies failed. <br /> <br /> In addition, the present Betty was married to Cesar Romero and the invasion came at the most inopportune moment before everything ends. This will give everyone a bad attitude. I guarantee. <br /> <br /> A fresh, healthy whole American Betty is NOT an actress who is seductive and mysterious. Marlene Dietrich could have put it, but Betty falls more than yesterday's presidential candidate. She and Fairbanks do not have chemistry at all, although Doug is as charming as ever, and someone I can see in everyone. <br /> <br /> Frederick Hollander and Leo Robin wrote the music for this movie, and This Is The Moment got an Oscar nomination for the best song. This chance for the praise of the Oscar in Lady In Ermine went to Buttons And Bows. <br /> <br /> Ernest Lubitsch died in the middle of the film, and Otto Preminger finished the Lady In Ermine. I can not believe that Lubitsch meant Grable. You will not see if you see this lady in weasel.
