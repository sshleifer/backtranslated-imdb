Do not bother about wasting money on this movie. Do not even go in the car and think that you can see this movie if others do not speak to you. If you must see the movie this weekend, please visit Batman again. <br /> <br /> The script was awful. Perfectly written from a random horror format. Considering: a place in tight spaces, a madman with various weapons, an interesting man who manages to discover all the tips that honest police officers can not collect, and an innocent and overly interesting, but beautiful and strong woman with whom many in the audience with pleasure he will call his girlfriend. Mix together, add a very poorly made gore, and what the hell, let's put some weirdos out there for a little "spin" to the story. <br /> <br /> Acting was terrible, and the figures were unbelievable - Borat was more credible than this one. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler *** and can anyone tell me how a slaughter vest can ricochet away from a person after being shot, without even making the person who was shot ?? I'm in the army. We need this kind of thing for ourselves. <br /> <br /> 1 in 10, and put it in decimal numbers that rounded up to give it the lowest possible score.
