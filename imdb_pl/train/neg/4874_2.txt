It is a pity that neither the animals nor Eddie Murphy had anything to say. this movie is simply bland. <br /> <br /> Film for children? Well, if you try to make them doze, maybe. It's only 90 minutes of some depressingly bad animations of animal lips, which is not fun. And lip synchronization makes old Godzilla movies look great in comparison. In the meantime, Eddie "Pluto Nash" Murphy drones with a suppressed, careless delivery that is painful. Apparently trying to modify his old manic personality, but for what? In short, all the magic and wonder of the original 1967 version are lost in this re-imagining or whatever it is. The city wants to intimidate some forest creatures and blame them for bad things. Not really. And Pluto Nash can psycho-babble with them. Things combine with a few outdated jokes to a boring, boring conclusion without any surprises. <br /> <br /> Rent a movie from '67. Or some old cartoons with a Yogi bear.
