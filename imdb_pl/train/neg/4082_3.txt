This movie was just painful to watch ... not in a dramatic way that makes you feel emotional to well-developed characters in dramatic situations (yes, actually I did the last sentence when I was walking together), but in one absolutely boring way for over two hours. Now you can all think that I'm just an ignorant who has no respect for Shakespeare or "artistic filming" ... well, you would be wrong in both cases. I love the works of Shakespeare, especially the tragedies of Romeo and Juliet, Julius Caesar, Macbeth and Hamlet, and also watched many "artistic" films such as the surrealist and well-done Eraserhead and 8 1/2 Fellini. .. but it was just over two hours of Shakespeare's confusion in translation, too many nudity (I can understand artistic nudity in SOME scenes ... but not in every other shot of the movie !!! THIS WAS POINTLESS AND SERVED NOTHING FOR HISTORY !!!) or just an overeager movie. I had high expectations for this film because it was considered "very artistic" and was an adaptation of Shakespeare's Storm ... but it was just an extreme suspension. I gave the film three ONLY because of the presence of actor Sir John Gielguda (which far exceeded all the missing names in this film) and the combination of cinematography / stage design, because it made many scenes look like images in motion ... However, much of this movie would be better as a JUST scrolling text image below. A real disappointment ... maybe if Zeffirelli got the director's chair, it would be much better. But the opinion of one of the viewers, many others can enjoy it more than I do. With that in mind, if you can not find it in nearby video stores (currently not on DVD), do not try to get too far to find it ... it really is not worth it.
