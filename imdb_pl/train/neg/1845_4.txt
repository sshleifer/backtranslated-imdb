Losing Control is another offer in the genre of erotic thrillers, which can be considered as pulp fiction in the film world. Usually they cover a detour to a murderous intertwined intertwined with heavy overpowering. This is not a complaint, especially when they are made by stunningly beautiful women who invariably inhabit this imaginary world. <br /> <br /> Kim Ward (Kira Reed) suffers from a writer's attack. By chance (or maybe?) She meets a man (Doug Jeffery), who engages her in increasingly risky sexual encounters. The man refuses to disclose any information about himself, but Kim firmly refuses to stop the romance. Her agent, Alexa (Anneliza Scott), thinks she will do wonders in the sale of books. Like most films of this type, the solution is coming to an end, but some things do not add up. I've seen enough of these kinds of movies to think, do not change there - but I like them. They are so undemanding. <br /> <br /> The cast performances are different. Doug Jeffery carries a film as a psycho / sociopath whom you do not want to exceed. Kira Reed looks good but does not convince as a woman in danger. Clay Greenbush as PI did not convince too. <br /> <br /> Finally, a note about the reviewed DVD. Both the cover and the drive indicate R-rating and working time of 93 minutes, but the working time is shorter than 86 minutes. Probably explains why sex scenes seem to be shortened and why Jennifer Ludlow's performance is shortened just as it starts. 4 stars.
