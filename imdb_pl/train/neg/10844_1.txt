Unfortunately, this is not "the best British movie gore from the hellraiser", although the DVD cover confirms that prompted me to buy. It is, however, a tribute to many great old horrors, especially films from the stable Amicus. <br /> <br /> Cradle ... is shot on a mini DV, although we all know that it has more TV impression than a movie, you can do a lot better. Each scene, set and shot looks as if it was illuminated in exactly the same way (standard key, fill, back configuration), which only increases the cheap appearance of the finished element. The content of gore is, to be honest, funny. From the initial shots, in which we can see the clearly torn head of a foam man, to cheap cheap hammers, the effects of creatures and terrible cg, there was nothing that made me. <br /> <br /> Acting is disgusting, from a detective almost in a coma to a dwarf brummy, by Dani Filth, the least convincing evil horror guy I've ever seen. Each of the bases is more formalized than the previous one, and the sets become worse and worse with the course of the film. Look out for "Mental Asylum" - a Georgian semi-detached house with a bad cg sign outside and the most bizarre (and not in good shape) padded cell I saw. <br /> <br /> It took me four attempts to reach the end of the film without wandering my attention (no, running) at every opportunity. At some point, when the movie was running, I found myself in the dust. <br /> <br /> However, this is one of Emily Booth's last known breast performances, which I think is one (um, two) things that aim at it. When it's over, everything is down. <br /> <br /> I've heard people say good things about Alex Chandon and I'd like to believe them, but based on this evidence I'm not likely to. If you want a decent homage to Amicus, avoid this and go to the special Christmas League of Gentlemen. <br /> <br /> You're currently fighting Blair Witch 2: Book of Shadows for the title of the worst movie I've ever seen.
