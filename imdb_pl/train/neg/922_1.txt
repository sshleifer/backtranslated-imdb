This movie is exactly what you get when you really drag your skills, it's like someone who just passed the driving test, and then threw them into the Formula 1 Grand Prix (I can not add the US Grand Prix, because everyone can withdraw) because of suspicious tires and you can just win), this movie falls so far. Now do not worry about it, I love B-Movies, about half of my collection is made of B-Movies, but I do not think there are enough letters in the alphabet to describe how bad the movie is. > <br /> The first story (on B-Movie) is not so bad, it has the potential to create the B-Movie brand, it did not talk about Friday's potential of 13, but potentially, however. But what really lets the movie go, it's acting, in less than a second I believe in something, it's like watching QVC except that the QVC presenters tend to get a bigger tan. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I would like to say that I have seen worse films, but I can not.
