The film lacks style, I mean the original style. everything looks copied, including action, first performances in the film, songs, delivery of dialogs, etc. Yes, the pigeons were original, as at the beginning a car with the UP **** number is shown and a few seconds later it starts to fall from the hill with the number MH ****. This was one of many film accidents :) Is there anything good in the movie? yes, for kareena fans, if they are, Kareena in a bikini. For fans of akshay, his dialogues and stunts. This is it. nothing more. So watch it at your own risk and do not blame the director or the actors. The director is crazy and actors, I regret them.
