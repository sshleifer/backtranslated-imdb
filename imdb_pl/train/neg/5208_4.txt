This mini series, also based on the book by Alex Haley, like the "Queen", tried to use similar formulas, that is building a long history that followed the life of the family for many years. While in "Queen" the result was master, here in Mama Flora lack of inspiration. First of all, maybe in the book itself, and certainly in this television production. Too many are being introduced with too much haste for years, so that the developing saga is shallow, superficial, not as authentic as in the "Queen". A full assessment of the set design in the earlier parts of the film, which was prepared with great care, but as the film progressed it seemed to turn into a kind of Dallasian-forsythic mixture distasteful in the last three-three-hour length. I counted on more; but apparently Haley was less inspired by the story than his almost biographical "Queen", and Peter Werner III does not fit John Erman. Worth recommending only to those who have an appetite for these long stories about growing generations.
