I would like to say that unlike many people who did not like this movie and could not understand it, I was able to understand what it is. A very incoherent attempt to plot. <br /> <br /> I do not like throwing the word, but in this case it fits very well. The director first presents the material in an extremely "arrogant" manner and, what is worse, extremely inconsistent. It is inconsistent that it presents the material in a messy manner, making us think that the director was too drunk to remember which scenes come first and arrogant in that after 2 hours they expect us, the viewer, to end this. <br /> <br /> I respect the surreal cinema for what it is. (creating a story about something more than a real world that does not involve real life). But there is nothing surreal in the story of ordinary modern times and the modern surroundings of the earth, which is not able to engage the public but also simply repressed a series of events that are barely related. The most accurate way to describe the experience of watching this movie is to watch history; perhaps even GOOD history based on the book, but frustrated by the fact that the camera did not capture the necessary moments and did not tie any means of cohesion. <br /> <br /> Let's compare stylistic cinema. Compare "Seoul contre contous" Gaspar Noe with this. He gave us a coherent, extremely engaging and deeply intellectual story. This film does not offer an intellectual study, and although it is very stylistic in its fragmentary presentation, the director ultimately gave up the essential art of telling a good story, and all that remains to us is a mess of events that are barely associated with each other. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is possible to understand the meaning .... to the point. But, as I said earlier, the viewer will reach the stage where he simply says "Who cares." It looks like watching a gray, mundane story of a man walking to the supermarket and buying food items in an unset order. Even in the case of murders, it is completely uninteresting and uninteresting. Too many people these days will give high marks for something they can not understand or simply understand from fear of looking stupid, and in every respect THIS movie, so that the viewer looks stupid. <br /> <br /> If you have too much time on your hands, then watch this video, taking into account what I said about it. It is a story based on a book that could be presented in a MUCH more efficiently and this is my main justification.
