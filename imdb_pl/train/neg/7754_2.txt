Spoilers will be in this. The film could be better if they had just another script, director and CGI provider. Not so good? The movie has a man who runs his own amusement park ... err ... a zoo on a desert island, where people can see dinosaurs ... err ... Sabretooths and is called Jurra ... oops ... Primal Park. I do not mind rip-offs, because there are no original ideas for this type of movie, but this one just hits you in the face, R e p e l l. There is even the thing "shaded head of creation." Sabretooths who are not plaice according to Mr. Primal Park (only ancient killing cats) are rather junkies, but the crown achievement is the one that I call "Sloggy". Because after getting rid of one big cat, the hero relaxes a little, because there is only one left. Go to the strange nutritional guy who says: No, we did three, and the third is a monster that pulls up in the front. Great, great. A group of college students are also on the island to hunt scavengers, test them to get to their clans or sort (It was always thought that he needed a short nickname). Of those who live, only one has completed his task, so I have a kick. Oh, yes, the obligatory clique "A bad capitalist must die" is valid in one, but in two! The death of Mr. Primal Park is the funniest thing you see in one of these movies, as jars with the teeth of the Sabretooth statue (courtesy of Sloggy), it shrinks a few sizes and pierces a man's throat. If I could leave so easily. I like "Sabretooth" better than this spin-off.
