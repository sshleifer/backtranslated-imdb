Good dudes from Webster's Dictionary define Logophobia as "fear of words." I can just be Logophobic. Since no combination of words frightens me more than at the beginning of the movie, the subtitles contain the words "Produced, Written and Directed by:" followed by a single name. Think about it. There are carpenters, electricians and plumbers, but there are so few players. Even the most experienced directors, such as Speilberg and Scorsese, rarely take control of their films. But I was there, all in my theater chair, in popcorn in my hand, and just before the Order, when I was hit like a fastball by Nolan Ryan, were the words "Made, written and directed by Brian Helgeland". Whoa! <br /> <br /> As a film lover, I knew Brian Helgeland. As a writer, his filmography in the last 10 years would be similar to the price of a dotcom company in 1998. There were so many theater disagreements (Killers, Postman, Conspiracy Theory) because they were critical and rewarded successes (LA Confidential, Mystic River). They seemed to be alternating? one good, one bad, so knowing that his last movie, BloodWork was one of the most wasted efforts in Clint Eastwood's career, I took a breath and hoped for the best. In retrospect, I should not have exhaled. <br/> <br /> Order of Heath Ledger (The Tale of Helgeland), as Alex Bernier, a priest in the order known as the Carolingians, who is called to Rome when a fellow priest is killed in the circumstances in which the Bishop believes that He is curious. Meeting with his father Thomas (also the Order and Mark Addy, played by Still Standings), they decided to put together the puzzle left after the priest's untimely death. <br /> <br /> Complicating matters are a sub plot with Mary Sinclair (played by Shannyn Sossamon) who escaped from the institution that was the result of her attempts to kill Alex during an exorcism. Alex has feelings for Mary and, for some reason, without public knowledge, they travel to Rome together. <br /> <br /> Nary slept well, and Alex confronts William Eden (Benno FÃ¼rmann), who claims to be a centuries-old eater of sins. As we say, the eater of sins is those who eat the sins of a dying person when the Church does not do what allows us to enter Heaven. William, how lucky he is, is tired of the healing life and expects Alex to take over his role and free him from his earthly duties. Alex is reluctant, but after the death of his new Mara love, Alex resorts to the Slayers' Sins ritual to save her and the transformation is over. Alex then looks for answers to his many questions, while Father Thomas reveals the Vatican's conspiracy to hand over power to his investigative colleague. <br /> <br /> The Order is not a scary movie, but it is terribly boring. There were funny special effects and no connection with any of the heroes. Even in the most dramatic scene of Alex, who enters the dying Mara, he is pale and insipid and leaves no emotional response to the difficult situation of the couple. Everyone seems to be saying so quietly and emotionally that flat film lines and fragrant salts could be served to stop me from trying to catch a short nap in the middle of the movie. <br /> <br /> So, Mr. Helgeland, I am begging you not to try again. Share your vision with others and let the more experienced help guide you in directions that are not so narrow and selfish. Until then there is nothing emanating, which indicates that you are capable of something more than failure. Two stars. <br /> <br />
