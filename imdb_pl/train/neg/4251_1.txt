1 out of 10. <br /> <br /> It's the kind of movie you can not believe you've wasted 2 hours of your life when you see the role of credits. I really think I could make a better vampire movie ... and I do not know anything. The only thing that not only sucks (more difficult than a vampire) is Jason Scott Lee .... his character is at least a bit cool, he has some secret and he's kicking a small ass.
