Tough, sexy women, a lot of curses and the most unconvincing monster that rises from the depths of a polluted lake. You would think "Monster" would be funny ... but it really is not. However, Tony Eisley and John Carradine are playing in it, and in my book it is worth watching at least once. In an interview with Fangoria in 1987, Eisley recalled that Herbert Strock directed most of the film, but somehow Kenneth Hartford - who directed only the material with his children Andrea and Glenn (playing Andrei and Glenn in a particularly ingenious phrase) - he received a full loan. Considering how terrible the final result was, Strock was probably glad he was not recognized! "Monster" has the appearance and style of a television film from the mid to late seventies, so I like to leave it in the background every now and then. As entertainment, it falls flat on the face, but as a reminder of another era and a disappearing type of filming, it is very effective. Only the car chase is missing.
