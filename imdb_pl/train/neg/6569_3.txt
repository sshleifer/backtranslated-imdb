Max had a V-8, Trace (the last and only hero of the Fire Wheel) has a jet engine in the back of the car, allowing him to have unintentional humorous expressions when the rocket moves in the middle of the wasteland. Be amazed how Mad Max 2 (also known as The Road Warrior) is crafted and combined back as a new movie, though filmed in a bad fashion with evil actors and poor stunt work. <br /> <br /> Why is WoF set to a post-apocalyptic wasteland? Simple, The Road Warrior! In fact, all the questions can be answered: this was the case in Road Warrior! With the exception of the mutant actors from the original movie The Time Machine from the 1960s, which appears in the episode because it gives the audience a certain non-drive action to chew for a few minutes. <br /> <br /> In the typical 80's all cars driven by bad guys who are collisions or slightly pushed, explode in a huge explosion. Inevitably all car chases will take place near convenient cliffs, and cars will inevitably fall off of them. Along with the movie from the 80's, wild ride is common crazy misogyny in this style of cheap movies. I usually waited for a rocket-propelled Trace car to accelerate and fire, so that there would be another shot that would crush his face as if it were going to be hard, which would break up more when it looks constipated. A badly directed action combined with bad acting makes this movie a real burden. The unintentional value of humor even manages to dress in thin. <br /> <br /> Rats: Bruno Mattei's nights of terror are better. And it says a lot in itself! In this respect, 2020 Texas Gladiators is a cinematic masterpiece compared to Wheels of Fire. A weak knocked down road warrior who does not have enough cheese factor to make the movie watchable. <br /> <br />
