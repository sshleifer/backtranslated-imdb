There are a few bugs in this movie - the character of Brenda Song is one of them. I do not believe that the girl is a bad actor - honestly not. I believe she has weak lines. She just has to be "that vain, rich girl" and although it's fun on the TV shows she plays in, she can not even laugh at me. <br /> <br /> Or really, I should have known what to expect when I sat down to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie was not so scary ... at first. Wendy's response to Shen was completely natural. I mean, how would you feel if a man, claiming to be a reincarnated monk, chased you, ordering you to wear a medallion and insisted that you had to fight "big evil" and save the world? Which brings me to a different point. I know that this film is entirely a fiction, but it still has a beginning in Chinese culture. It seems that all the "warriors" in the Wendy family were women. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I doubt that the monks would just be okay with it. Sure, maybe they could have worked it out, but they did not have any explanation. In this way, they contributed to many tacky attempts to empower women by Hollywood and the media. <br /> <br /> It does not matter, let's continue. <br /> <br /> Wendy's character becomes more unbearable as the film continues. Yes, she is a teenager, and it is close to returning home - that is, who wants to fight evil when returning home? The problem is that when the "evil" begins to manifest, Wendy does not seem as terrified as she should be. She is very careless - even for someone like her. He still does not care about his training. I will use this conversation as an example, Shen: "If you do not win this battle, evil will take control and everything that is good will disappear." Wendy: "Whoa, talk about pressure. Well ... let's talk about something else. " Yes, Wendy. Let's also go dancing when you should train properly. Of course, Shen allows, but his character has an excuse. It's better that he works with her than he does, and he does not train at all and tells them to kill him. <br /> <br /> Oh, what I'm talking about. Shen also told Wendy that he was destined to die for her in battle, just like her great-grandmother (I assume this part). <br /> <br /> This makes Wendy's actions unforgivable. br /> <br /> As he wrote the script, returning to Wendy and this "great battle" are exactly the same day. Do you know what Wendy is doing? Do you even have to guess? Yes, it ends in battle, because when he tries to go home, the monks (who Shen imprisoned in the body of their trainer and teachers because "she felt strangely fighting the old man") inform her that Shen went alone to battle, so he goes save. <br /> <br /> Initially we see a decent fight, which is really fun. In the end, the great evil comes out of Wendy's body, which is a rival to return home, and creates a real embodiment of himself from the broken pieces of the bodies of ancient warriors. <br /> <br /> Do not ask. <br /> <br /> In any case, Wendy is "panicked." Then Shen goes and protects her from this guy - forgive me for forgetting his long Chinese name - and manages to kill him. <br /> <br /> Wendy catches Shen when his long descent from the thrust is uncomfortably high air. <br /> <br /> Screams the title of the mentioned article. <br /> <br /> Now ... it was bad enough that Wendy became powerful, much too fast. No, I will not let it be justified because it was her "destiny" and she had "power in herself." <br /> <br /> Since when did she learn to heal? No, the worst ... since when she could resurrect people? So Shen is brought up from the dead. Then Wendy and he are fighting a guy. <br /> <br /> Losing easily. The worst part is that they are jumping together and kicking him at the same time, and he is banished forever. Then the monks recommend Wendy to her dedication. <br /> <br /> Two things, # 1: Does not the writer and director know that the battle requires a bit more "finesse"? # 2: What sacrifice? The fact that she did not go home? Because the girl did not break or even bleed. I mean, come now, this movie was TV PG, I wanted to see how someone was hurt. <br /> <br /> Ah-hah ... moving on. <br /> <br /> I know it sounds like I should have a movie based on my comments. Part of the criticism, however, must be breaking something. Do not necessarily try to look for bad ones, but if you are there, you pay attention to it. This movie has a lot of bad things, but something funny happens when you never expect something to be too great in the first place. <br /> <br /> So, I think everything was fine. Not that I would not say that it was not right, would not stop anyone from watching.
