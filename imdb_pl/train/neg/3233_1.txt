Come on, people, you can not be serious, another case of tobacco snuff, when you do not! It is not even frightening, nor is it terrifying or depraved - it is simply a terrible amateur video work, created for the next party, so that the girls will lie down. <br /> <br /> The blood is incredibly bad, even the eye - the price is far from being puked, but only made me want to take the camera and hit those guys in the head. The girl just lies there with a rubber face, not moving at all. It would be more fun to use a real doll instead. <br /> <br /> One season "I am a star, take me away from here!" is more frightening than this one. Do not waste time or money.
