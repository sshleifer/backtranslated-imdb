Run away from this movie. Even according to the standards of film B this movie is horrible. It is also crafty in its subject. The main theme is that people who reject society and do not respect anything are cool and adorable. People who treat others with respect are losers. Guncrazy is a movie that speaks to civilians much better than this movie, see it instead. <br /> <br /> No normal kid would do what Trent did. The soldiers are not acting like in this movie, etc. Seeing this movie, you realize why writers are using the banality of the "whore with the heart of gold". The pass is a completely unpleasant whore who, yes, had a terrible life. However, he is such a terrible person that the audience can not identify with her. <br /> <br /> There is usually one thing that you can recommend a movie for, in this case, there is no such thing. It's such a funny movie that offends a person who is trying to identify with the main characters. Acting is appropriate for film standards B, and the direction does not present anything new or interesting.
