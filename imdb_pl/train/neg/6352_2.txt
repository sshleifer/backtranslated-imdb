I have always been a huge fan of Woody Allen and I will always be for most of what he has done in the past, but only a blind lover could ignore how boring, senseless, pretentious and above all horrendially played this movie. Empty psychic masturbation based on inconsistent grounds. And what a disastrous idea to artificially recreate the alleged 'Allen-actor clone' that introduces Will Farrell's lips and gestures to what Allen would do to Farrell if he was 30 years younger. The result was obviously ridiculous. And not to mention dialogues ... what was supposed to be philosophical reflections turned into an involuntary mockery of intellectual considerations, unaware of its comic effect. So sad...
