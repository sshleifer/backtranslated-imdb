Geez! This is one of those movies that you previously reviewed, but you did not do it. I mean, you did not make it nonsense, but somehow it occurred to you. <br /> <br /> Honestly and briefly; is one of the worst, boring and stupid troublemakers ever made. I can not say anything good about this piece of shit, because there are barely decent sequences that could be made by professional filmmakers. <br /> <br /> Death scenes are horrible, bloodless, stupid. The plot is somehow good, considering that she has copied "Popcorn" since 1991. <br /> <br /> To make it worse, it's not a movie that's so bad it's good. It's just bad. <br /> <br /> Molly Ringwald tried to do everything in her power, but that was not enough.
