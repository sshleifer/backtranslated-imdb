I had many hopes regarding this film, so I watched it with many expectations; mainly because of Kamal Hassan. He is an amazing actor who left his mark on the sands of time forever. But this movie turned out to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. After watching this movie, brutality and violence in the tenure and orange mechanics look much better. <br /> <br /> The protagonist, Raghavan, is a very daring policeman. Who is assigned to the investigation of brutal serial murders. Raghavan effectively finds the link in this case and is close to solving the murders and placing psycho assassins, two psychologically disturbed, but brilliant medical students, behind bars, but they run away and again fall into the killing rage. Finally, Raghavan kills them both after saving many innocent lives. <br /> <br /> These two psycho killers are those who will stop the audience from going to theaters. Murders and sexual assaults and rape are shown very clearly, without which the film could survive. <br /> <br /> Even imagining that teenagers and children will watch this movie in the theater and the kind of painting that will paint in their minds, are certainly not pretty. The director, Gautham, should realize that he also has some obligations to society and its audience. I certainly never go to movies that look like Gautham's name on the production list.
