This is a low-budget parody of the espionage genre. To help shape your expectations, you should know that: (1) Acting is extremely heavy. The stars have a great time delivering their lines to excessive eye movement, frequent hand gestures and off-key stimulation. (2) The script deliberately has no continuity and credibility. Often the lines are violently disturbing and humorous because they have no meaning for the previous plot elements. (3) Shots are often bound in balanced angles, which makes it a pleasure to exaggerate the genre. (4) Pop-eyed Jeff Goldblum provides complex and classically preposterous dialogues in a sarcastic manner. <br /> <br /> The film has guiding intelligence, deliberately starting from the plot of the plot stolen from B's films The Thirties: a secret code with a structure that contradicts the explanations of Carl Sagan. The acting game at the highest level is mainly used for comic effects in the first 90 minutes. In the early run, Ned's son, Fay Grim, is told so often that he will leave you can not help but giggle when you regret the boy. A nicely arranged fall from Parker Posey's bed also helps to set a humorous tone at the beginning of the movie. <br /> <br /> Slow stimulation of the film does not reinforce comedy elements or drama elements that later appear. The influence of the film as a drama is significantly weakened by the early comedy. What's more, it is difficult to be overly involved in the characters and their fate, when the early fragments of the film are so sarcastic. The musical score is deliberately hard to cast, and I decided that this (and unbalanced camera angles) is more annoying than humorous. <br /> <br /> An extraordinary game, an unbelievable and almost incomprehensible plots plot / counter-inspiration, and a slow pace will be shared by many viewers. The film is much too long in 158 minutes. <br /> <br /> Having said that, fans who are open to the sarcasm of the film may want to watch it again ... using closed captions to best capture the intelligent ridiculousness of the dialog. The film was too slow for me, and the sarcasm seemed heavier than light. But comedy can appeal to your tastes. The film is worth seeing for those who like independent films, fans of director Hal Harley or fans of Parker Posey (who has the most time for the camera).
