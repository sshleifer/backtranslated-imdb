- Includes mining spoilers - <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of decent Indian horror films like The Hamiltons, The Boys Love Mandy Lane and Cabin Fever; unfortunately I felt that Five Across the Eyes does not belong to this category. From the beginning to the end, the film is harassed by amateur acting resonating from a very bad script, God only knows why the writer (s) thought about a dialogue like "No, do not go out there; you: if she catches you, she'll kill you, and if she kills you, you're dead "is about the quality of the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie shows very little character development and to be honest I could not care less about what pain and torture they were given because they are just a group of ditsy college girls who show almost no salvific features ". All they do is crying and wailing in the whole film and whether the girls are crying; when they talk, the topics are completely random: on dating boys or on how one of the girls' fathers was recently cremated (the right items when you are chased by psychotic murderers). <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is also a boring exposition of music with techno music during the initial and final subtitles (although hearing the credit music knowing that the end is approaching, it seems to be the sky). <br /> <br /> Working with the camera is frightening and sometimes it makes the movie unobtainable. I'm guessing that due to the small or no budget, the director limited himself to one digital camera that is in the girl's car almost in the whole movie. I think it was an effort to keep the audience as close as possible to the action: to feel and experience what the girls are going through. But because of the very shaky camera, grainy image and too close action it can be difficult to say what happens during the action scenes and is simply chaotic. One thing is to create a subjective film, but another action on the screen, which the audience can not decipher because of poor cinematography. <br /> <br /> I understand that Five Across the Eyes is a low budget indie film, but that does not justify very poor quality. This movie has no advantages: bad acting, bad script writing, cheesy camera and no history. In the light of all this, I decided to give the film one of 10, because it disappointed me a lot; wanting the meteor to hit the ground, bringing me a sweet relief. It's 94 minutes for stupid college girls who cry, argue, run aimlessly, and lead random inconvenient conversations. However, how many times do you see girls emptying their hands and throwing nonsense on the windshield of the chasing car.
