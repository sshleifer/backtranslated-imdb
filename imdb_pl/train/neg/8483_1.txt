I usually write only reviews of movies that I really hate or really like. And, as you probably know from the number of stars above, I did not like it. So far, I'm assuming you've read about the story, and maybe you've even seen the movie, so I'll skip the summary. Let's break it, the pros and cons: <br /> <br /> Cons: the concept: The assumption was interesting. It was interesting to use the Chaos theory as a topic. However, this has not been done so well. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to me that the Chaos theory was somehow misrepresented. The event, which took place in the film, seemed a more coincidental thought than anything else. I think that the Butterfly effect was represented by the whole "God (s) causes Tsunami to restore the statue". The presentation, however, is very sloppy. Some call it intelligent, but it seems to be another action movie. <br /> <br /> Plot: Is it just me, or does it seem that Kamal just threw it together to give him an excuse to play ten roles? The plot is extremely sophisticated; Govind still lost the vial many times in obscure cases (his friend just mixes the vial with the package he sent to India, the crazy old man just throws the vial into the idol, half of the cast just happens unexpectedly I meet in the same hospital, and the case of idol just got mixed up with the one that belonged to the famous singer.) CGI: Oh God, CGI. It was even worse than the special effects in Jaws 3 and those sucked. I could immediately tell which parts were animated. Even my ten-year-old cousin knows that underwater cars do not look like this. <br /> <br /> Stunts: Yes, now that the action scenes in Tamil movies are not realistic, but the stunts in this movie were horrible and actually distracted me from history. up: I must admit that they did a better job than expected. I thought Kamal would be playing with people with similar skin tones, so two fake white guys and fake Japanese Aikido caught me on guard. However, it was still quite bad, I could easily tell which of them are wearing masks. <br /> <br /> Songs: Music distracted and was out of date in many cases. <br /> <br /> Asin: Her character was probably the most annoying in the movie. She was loud, ditsy and obsessed with this idol. Actually, I wanted her to die. <br /> <br /> Strange holes and Fridge Logic: Let me understand this: the lab monkey was clever enough to go through a locked door, but not smart enough to tell the difference between a chocolate bar and a vial with a deadly virus. And then, a former CIA agent who left the vial, goes to India. Instead of immediately following him, he marries the dancer on the pole first. The famous singer from Punjab with cancer is sent to a small city hospital in the third world, when he can easily afford the best available medical help. What's more, it is shot in the throat with a bullet. You'd think he would be killed, but instead the magic bullet cleared his tumor. You read it well, BULLET knocked out the tumor. <br /> <br /> Pros ... Naidu character: Probably the only nice part of the movie was his comedy.
