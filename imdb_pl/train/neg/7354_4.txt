As a complete Hammer I was afraid of the time when I would have to raise the courage to watch this film and the one who follows it, Holiday on the Buses. I saw the movie One the Buses and considered him one of the worst films I've ever seen. It was full of this horrible comedy that plagued British television screens in the early 1970s. <br /> <br /> I am ashamed to tell you that there really were parts of the movie that made me laugh. I do not know if it's because I knew the heroes and enjoyed some of the situations, knowing how they would react. I found Blakey particularly funny, although I could not swear that at no time during the trilogy he would say his password: "I'll bring you Butler." <br /> <br /> After watching Holiday on the Buses, these thin movies start to be jokes compared to the early Hammer trilogy, Dick Barton, in which the second movie is the best (though it's probably the only way you can compare them) . <br /> <br /> only people who want to watch this movie are probably fans of the TV series who will no doubt enjoy this movie, and young people like me. For setists, I would say that this movie is not so bad and I can certainly think of worse Hammer comedies.
