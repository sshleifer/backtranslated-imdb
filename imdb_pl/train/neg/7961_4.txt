Five years after the original Creepshow, another horrible horror sequel was written by George A. Romero and Stephen King: Creepshow 2. This time there are only three stories instead of five. None of the three stories is really original or distinguished. The first story is a basic, formal story about a wooden Indian statue that seeks revenge on the killers of its owners. The effects are really cool in this story, but it's too familiar to be convincing enough. George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamour play older store owners. The second story of "The Raft" is the story of Stephen King. That's about four teenagers who unknowingly spend the day on a wooden pallet in the middle of an isolated lake. Soon, the children shout for their lives, because a watery drop does it for no apparent reason. However, instead of being tense, children are burdened with bad dialogue and conservative behavior, which prevents us from really taking care of what is happening next. There is also unintentional humor in this segment. The third and final story is "The Hitch-hiker", which is actually a tread adapted for Creepshow 2. The original story of Lucille Fletcher was shot in 1953 as a noir movie. Then he was adapted to the famous episode Twilight Zone with Inger Stevens. "The Hitch-hiker" works best with these three offers, but also is not without problems. Lois Chiles plays a cheating spouse who ends up hitchhiking, or at least thinks so. We do not know, however, whether to sympathize with her or condemn her. As in many stories of this type, characters exist only to tell stories of their twists and turns. The story of the story about thugs seems a bit out of place. Tom Savini appears as a "creeper" in this part. The good thing is that there were no more sequels. * 1/2 of 4 stars.
