I will not waste a lot of time because, as far as I am concerned, it is not a movie at first, just careless mish-mash borrowed material and an embarrassingly amateurish new material made solely for the purpose of pasting the whole mess and calling it the continuation of the "Boogeyman". Literally 80% of the film was stolen by its much better predecessor, "The Boogeyman," a film that apparently did not bother the laughter, because they could not even get the original name of the heroine Suzanna Love (Lacy) well. To add insults to injury, the killer is invisible in the original footage and visible in the new footage, apparently think their audience is just as stupid as they are. 0 out of 10 and I would like the IMDb evaluation system to go so low, the most soulless and blatant attempt to break the money people have even seen.
