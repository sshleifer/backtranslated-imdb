Do you remember a good, animated batman from the 90's? The one that people praised? The one that all people of all ages could appreciate? The one who showed Batman as a real detective instead of Hulk in a bat costume? The one who had criminals that you can relate to? The one who had villains with real motives? <br /> <br /> Well, Warner Bros. no. Hence this thrill. <br /> <br /> Honestly, do these people know anything about Batman? Have they even seen a Batman comic book before? Do they know that Batman is supposed to be a "detective"? Submitting 2 hints does not make you a detective! It makes you a little intelligent monkey! <br /> <br /> This is the basic layout of the episode: <br /> <br /> Penguin steals something. "Opening credits". Batman finds dead gifts where he is. Batman goes there and gets in trouble. Commercial. Batman finds an obvious / stupid way out of it. The penguin is running away. The penguin is doing something obvious again. Batman follows him. They make kung fu (by the way, everyone, and I mean EVERY known kung fu for some reason). Penguin punch Batman. he is knocked out. he goes to arkham. (Note: this is usually another black character of each episode) <br /> <br /> As you probably noticed, Batman is not a great detective. "Joker left this piece of cotton candy on the ground, maybe he's in the old amusement park"! Yes, maybe he was there 6 times. <br /> <br /> I have already mentioned it, but EVERYONE KNOWS KUNG-FU! EVEN PENWIN! What do they think? (probably because it comes from the people who created the animated series Jackie Chan) <br /> <br /> What really annoys is the fact that the series is just an action. No cunning. No. If Batman needs thinking, he will use technology and then he will do a little kung-fu. <br /> <br /> But hey, let's not forget about villains. Afterall, what would Batman be without his mischievous gallery? <br /> <br /> First of all, I have to say kudos for originality. I do not think other Batman media imagine a joker and a daunting monkey, a puzzle like emo and poison ivy as a minor (which is misleading when she thinks about it, is her sexuality not supposed to be her main strength?) <Br / > <br /> What's even more absurd is that every character is now a two-dimensional, stereotypical cheater. <br /> <br /> EG <br /> <br /> Killer Croc wants to flood Gotham without a reason. <br /> <br /> Man-Bat is a mad scientist who is obsessed with bats for some unexplained reason. <br /> <br /> The penguin just wants to steal everything. For no reason. <br /> <br /> noting the pattern here? <br /> <br /> But the most offensive must be Mr Freeze. <br /> <br /> Do you remember the Emmy Award winning episode of "Heart of Ice" from Batman: The Animated Series? The one who gave Mr. Freeze motives for his crimes? An episode that was so good that it was used in comics over its original story (crazy scientist)? The one who made him a victim with a goal? Hell, even Batman and Robin admitted that using it as Mr Freezes, it comes from this P.O.S. movie. <br /> <br /> Well, this series says "F # ck that" and makes Mr Freeze a jewel robber before his accident, only having wealth in his head, then he gets frozen and gives him the power to everything was cold. Then he continues to steal gems for no reason, saying the lines sh! T such as "Have an ice day". <br /> <br /> Maybe they looked at Batman and Robin after all. <br /> <br /> But hey, look at the bright side. This series makes you feel nothing to villains, which means that you are a good person. Good for you.
