Being a film lover, I will usually look at every movie that goes through my volleyball, which, as I say, sometimes does more harm than good for my brain. While surfing the canal last night, Sleepaway Camp II happened to cut paths with me. Of course, I wanted to check it out, as I heard about the Sleepaway Camp series, but I've never seen one of them (from shame, I know). I will notice that since I have not seen the original, my criticism probably should not be taken too seriously, because perhaps what I consider to be wrong is entirely intended by my own franchise project. I assume that the Sleepaway Camp franchise is in itself a joke. Hell, even the name comes from a deliberate joke. Summer camp? It's fun. I can appreciate this film for just wanting to put something to a pure camp value, but it's as far as I can. Acting in this film made the cast of the original Friday of the 13th look like thespians performing the interpretation of Macbeth. Campy requires bad action, but give it a rest. Pamela Springsteen as an evil murderer from the lack of contact with reality better killed my interest than killed the entire cast. As for the comedy, I giggled several times, but there were not many of them. <br /> <br /> Finally SAC II is quite boring and I really wanted to sleep in the camp. Deaths are so clearly staged and false that you barely appreciate them. If you're looking for a movie comedy with a good camp, I recommend Club Dread. If your channel is surfing you, check and see what else is included.
