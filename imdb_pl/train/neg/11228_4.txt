The main disadvantage of the film is its not very inspiring scenario. He walks back and forth between the vignettes of Bettie's stories and re-creation of Klaw's short films. While Klaw's re-creation is well done, there is no need to play them completely. Richards, though not an amazing actress, does a decently good job. Sometimes he has a remarkable resemblance to Bettie. It is also worth paying attention to faithful attention to detail. Well made costumes and clothes, just like some of the established directions. Sets are usually rare and they feel the stage, but they feel the era. Sometimes it is surprisingly well-lit, and the color palette is clearly thought out to give it a vivid, retro look.
