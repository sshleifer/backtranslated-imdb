This movie was terrible. Throughout the movie I was surprised and did not see any sense. I had to go to this page and read the review to finally understand what is going on. This movie is not worth watching at all. Not only is he sick and disgusting, he's totally stupid! Do not watch unless you're one of those who enjoy watching bad movies. If this film questions Japanese society and its values ​​and roles, then this is a country that I would not like to visit or bother with knowledge. This is a completely sick movie !!!!!!!! I did not like it because it did not make sense. My boyfriend and I were sitting there waiting if it was going to be a horror movie because it was just mentioned. It was a total disappointment.
