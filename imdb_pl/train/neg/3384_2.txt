If you were to judge on the basis of the film itself, the commission that gave the stage musical "A Chorus Line" Pulitzer Prize, and the Broadway audience that kept the war horse for 15 years, were all on heavy drugs, because one particular feeling of this movie is definitely NO is. <br /> <br /> What anyone who believed that Richard Attenborough was the right choice for this material completely misleads me, but he makes a musical that is almost exclusively about movement, just sits on the screen like a clay block. <br /> <br /> Not content with the original score in the way it was originally written, someone decided that what the movie really needs is a brand new song that will give the film a bit of a zip. In this way, we are attacked by an Oscar-nominated (!) "Surprise, Surprise". Well, surprise, the song stinks, just like a movie. <br /> <br /> Class: D
