Chan Wook Park is nothing interesting. I AM A CYBORGE, BUT OK OK is full of fun little technical complexities with ingenious ideas mixed up between them. Trying to follow in the footsteps of Marc Caro and Jeunet (THE CITY OF LOST CHILDREN, DELICATE), the Park embarks on a fanciful, light tale that is a radical departure from the usual morbid tariff. Hardly anybody should be guilty for their ambitions or vision, it is really unexpected to see how the whole Park effort sums up so little. <br /> <br /> I AM A CYBOR, BUT OK OK seems to be surprisingly subtract from each other, and the end result will be a fraction of the sum of its parts. The assumption is promising, the gags are abundant and full of humor, but all this fails to create a meaningful relationship with the audience. The characters are cute and weird, and the cast is enthusiastic, but try as I could, I could not bring myself to take care of any. The park was a bit concerned, but despite this he managed to present some of the director's unique flames and after impressive filmography, he was easily forgiven. None of the self-confidence that ordered the JOINT SAFETY AREA or SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE is visible here. I AM A CYBOR, BUT OK OK left me so completely uninvolved that I caught myself instinctively, quickly from time to time (more regularly as the film progresses). I gave LADA 5/10, and therefore this measure probably deserves more than 3. For the sake of the old time, I will be generous: 4/10
