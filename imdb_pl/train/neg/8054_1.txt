Oh, wow, what a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> The production was so cheap and nasty ... Remember the shot from "The Natural", where lightning hits the tree (leaving a shiny stump) that Roy Hobbs makes a bat with ?? Well, the producers of this movie used the same scene to precede the scene in which the branch of the tree hit the house. <br /> <br /> I wonder if they paid for using the material from The Natural, or simply hoped that no one who watched the movie would pick it up? <br /> <br /> Then at the end, where they tried to escape by truck. Such excessive operation in the cabin. <br /> <br /> A really bad movie, a really bad movie.
