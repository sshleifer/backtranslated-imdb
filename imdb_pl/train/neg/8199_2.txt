I am glad that I did not spend money on cinema :-). It is nothing more than a compilation of elements from several other classic titles, such as The Thing, Final Fantasy, The Abyss, etc. Framed in a rather boring and senseless scenario. I really can not find out what the purpose of this movie was - there is absolutely nothing new in the story, which is additionally meaningless. What's more, there is nothing to watch - FXs look like they were taken from a second-hand, generally you've seen them all in other movies. But it's definitely a good lullaby.
