In 1985, I caught this thing (I can not even call it a movie) on the cable. I was in college and I was with a high school friend whose hormones are going crazy. I realized early that it was hopeless. Stupid scenario (a group of old guys employing young boys to show them how to score points in women), bad acting (with one exception) and pathetic jokes. The abundant nakedness of women made my friend happy for a moment - but even he was bored after 30 minutes. Remember - it was a BOY BOY! It was back before the nakedness was so easy to get over the Internet and so on. We looked in the hope of something interesting or funny, but it never happened. The funniest thing was the original advertising campaign, in which the studio admitted that this movie is bullshit! (One poster had a fictitious review that said, "This is the best movie I've seen this afternoon!"). Only Grant Cramer at the forefront showed talent and began his career in the industry. No budget and boring t & a. Skip it.
