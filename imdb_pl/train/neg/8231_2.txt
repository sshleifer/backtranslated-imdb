MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ... BUT DOUBTS CAN BE LIKELY! <br /> <br /> Five crosswise eyes can be summed up in one word .... Amateur. This movie tries to distinguish from most films with a "Blair Witch" movie ... it does not work ... it just looks and looks like someone had a cheap video camera, a van and decided to make a movie. This story has no explanation, the hero has no real motivation (and looks like a lesbian dressed in a suit in comparison with five girls) and there is no violence to talk about ... only the sounds of shouting and crunching. The whole film takes place in a van, which means that worthy scenery is out of the question. Five girls really do well with what has been given to them, but in total it turns out that they are awful actresses ... although with the material it is difficult to judge whether they really can .... spend the whole movie screaming, squealing and whimpering .... so much that it's hard to see what's been said for half the time, and the cameras are so bad that it's hard to say who said it. This movie presents itself as a brutal movie about torture, but in reality it's only five girls in a van screaming in terror ... it literally sums up the whole movie ..... then we end up after what seems like 5 hours of continuous screaming, and all five girls are still alive ... one without a finger. The only thumbs up (get it ... finger .... LOL) are for the poor actresses who have tried and probably lost their voices (and their pride) after making this awful movie. Do not judge this after the poster .... you will be very disappointed.
