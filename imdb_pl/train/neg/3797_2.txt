It's been years since Alex Rain (played by Olivier Gruner in the first movie) came across a terrifying story that was about replacing people with machines, but since then a war has emerged between cyborgs and people, and we have lost, now the kind of superwoman who is Olivier Gruner's daughter (she also inherited only half of her minimal acting abilities), which I think is the minimal connection to the first film, but when superwoman arises, she hides in 1980, while the future bounty hunter hunts her this confusing science fiction movie. Nemesis has become a cult hit, so I can see why people liked it, even though I was not a fan of the movie. Nemesis very ambitiously tried to come up with different ideas, develop a beautiful appearance and provide plenty of action, almost succeeded. Nemesis 2 does not even have such an ambition, it's a cheap split The Terminator with a muscular woman who is so weak in acting abilities that he makes Olivier Gruner appear thespian champion, and the action sequences lack an explosive range that was the main point selling the original. I admit that I was not a fan of the original, but I deserved a better continuation than this. The original also contained a good cast, like Tim Thomerson, Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa, Thom Mathews, Brion James, Thomas Jane and Jackie Earle Haley, who has no one, this time it's just a boring movie with a pretentious atmosphere. In fact, after I saw it, I was inspired by the addition of a half-star to the original. <br /> <br /> * with 4- (Bad)
