I really wanted to like this movie more than I did. That's because I love crazy foreign comedies - especially the weird ones that surprise you completely. However, although this often surprised me, they were almost never pleasant surprises. It reminded me of South Park, because almost EVERY social norm was violated, until the only ones left to move were too sick to be funny. For example, after investigating adultery, drug abuse (almost every type - from the pot, heroin, speed to sniffing the glue), prostitution, S & M, suicide, murder, etc., the film reached a funny (?) Theme pedophilia. Mum encouraged one son (who looked about 12 years old) to sleep with neighboring men. In fact, at some point in the movie, the boy gives the dentist instead of paying for dental work! Funny?! You have to be joking. This movie just goes too far and delves into the "black hole of comedy." What should they joke about the next tumors or rectum?
