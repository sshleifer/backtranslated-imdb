This movie is badly conceived, badly made and badly written. <br /> <br /> Jon Heder is terribly irritating and can not escape the same Napoleon routine. Obsession with self and ignorance. <br /> <br /> In addition, Diane Keaton plays her mother, overly obsessed with her mother who cares too much, and yet not enough for her children's lives (see <br /> <br /> Anna Faris, though generally I like her, playing this idiot idiot. <br /> <br /> Jeff Daniels is livable, but nothing special. <br /> <br /> Skip this movie if you want to keep your soul.
