as always, it is an inaccurate picture of the homeless. Television told many lies about the panhandlers in the early 90s and made everyone look bad, and claimed that we all made over $ 100 a day when $ 20-40 a day was much closer to reality. when someone was driving, where I kept a signed job offer, and offered me a job, I actually went and took a job if I was physically fit. and if I were offered $ 100,000 id damned for sure I had been invested in a prep prepaid for at least 2 years and kept the majority in the bank and still left me $ 10-2000 in NL $ 1-2 cash games and $ 2-5 in casinos. Usually I always win and I can win decent if I only had a bankroll. instead, I win about $ 1000 a month, everything always plays with a minimum purchase, because I do not want to risk losing it all. I was just a homeless person because I did not want to risk spending all my money and breaking, sometimes I had over $ 1000-2000 in a sock when I was sleeping outside. whoever would like to talk to me from the seventies of yahoo messenger. I admit I was different than most homeless because I never smoked or used drugs. I'm not homeless anymore, I'm now in a government house for $ 177 a month and I get SSI and spend most of my time winning online poker. Diversified mother and sunflower worked hard to get SSI for me. I am glad that my days of hiding under the stage at the convention center of the casino at night are sleeping, worrying about being caught by security, are finally over. if this TV crew chose me, it passed them much earlier. it is a pity that they do not choose who they choose.
