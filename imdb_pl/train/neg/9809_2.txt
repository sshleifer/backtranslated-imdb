Some wonder why there were no more Murphy's films after that. Is it because this movie has completely collapsed. Disney was not the right studio to run this movie. MAYBE Touchstone (well, they're Disney property, but they'll be more grown up). The film is too childish because a series of books is not. Throwing is bad for the character. Heroes do not even behave like in books. And why was Tucker changed into a guy? She's a girl in fucking books! Was it done to make the film appealing to the boys? Hell. Where was Pewter, a gray cat? One of the funniest characters in the book is absent from this filth. Rita Mae Brown is a good writer, but letting Disney spoil her work was bad. An animated feature film, perhaps in a movie with Don Bluth's graphics, would fit into Mrs. Murphy's better movie. Generally, I give it to 2, because at least Disney has produced a movie from an underrated series of books. But I would like them to do better. Anyway, I still have my books to entertain me.
