Despite the excellent work of supporting actors and the intelligent script of Alan Plater, this film suffers from a fatal flaw - lack of charm of the central character / actor. One of the characters describes the character of Richard E Grant as "a groaning little turd" and, unfortunately, sums it up perfectly. There is nothing about him or his performance to be credible that his girlfriend and publisher / friend of a higher class will spend so much time and emotional effort on him. He is rude, arrogant, selfish, self-destructive and totally annoying. This role required an actor who would make you love him, even if he is a prank - for example, Ewan McGregor. <br /> <br /> All witty satires in the class system, etc. Have been wasted this irritating and completely unacceptable performance. All I wanted to do was shake him and tell him to defeat him.
