it's definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I gave up watching him after an hour and I regretted that very hour. acting is terrible and there is almost no conspiracy. I'm guessing that someone came up with a strange shape of an animal and started telling it. borrowing ideas from films such as Resident Evil and Aliens does not lead to a movie like them. If this is the best Korean movie, I would prefer not to even see the trailer of a Korean movie ... <br /> <br /> By the way, these films are a good reason to think that not necessarily high rating means that the film is promising . I think that every Korean who has internet for online games rated this movie at 8, although he has no idea what's going on.
