Watching this movie was the biggest waste of time and 2 bucks to rent in my life. If nothing disastrous happens before death, it will be the greatest regret in my life. Whoever even thought about the film or financed it, deserves a kick between his legs, because that's when they thought about the film. It's about an overweight guy who is a hopeless romantic, and writes pretentious nonsense, which they try to speak as poetry. He joins his love friend while traveling to the coast. Where do girls meet and stuff. Only a fat guy does not have a girlfriend. The flashes of my skin do not irritate me, I take them at face value. But this film tries to be more than just a movement of the skin. It's about Fat who is looking for love in some girl, but then he meets another girl in a bikini silicone who likes his poetry. He finds his talent for volleyball, which gets money for his family and impresses ladies, but he still has his own woman. Dialogue is terrible even for the movie C. It supports a lot of black stereotypes, there is no character development, it is a glorified porn movie, without any porn. Never watch this movie.
