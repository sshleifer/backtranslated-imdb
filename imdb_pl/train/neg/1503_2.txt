this is amazing! Fidani (who was also a spiritualist) was one of the cheapest directors around the world. This movie stole the original title of Leone's "Duck you sucker!" but tell the boring story of Agent Pinkerton against the assassin "Testa di Ferro" (an incredible stuntman Gordon Mitchell). Everything is poor and crazy in this pelicula shot in the expensive landscapes of Lazio. History is both evil and crazy at the same time. Fidani was not able and able at the same time. Something like crazy insanity has happened in history (like the discussion in the sheriff's house and demeanor of Butch Cassidy's!?!?!?!?!? Yes, really Butch Cassidy, who is portrayed as an idiot). Terribles nuit americaine, absurd compositions, illogical plot, bad acting and fugace the appearance of one of the most award-winning presenters in the history of Italian television Renzo Arbore. Ah, of course: Klaus Kinski. Yes, it's great and scary, but I'm sure it was only for money and for playing with iron horses) 2 out of 10, but ... DO NOT MISS!
