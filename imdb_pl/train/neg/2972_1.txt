My teacher recorded it and showed us in Child Care to show how teen pregnancy affects people. This just showed how teenage pregnancy affects a child's jockey who is not properly educated about how sex works, and a grumpy, unloved girl who throws a fruit when she is angry and can not say she was with the wrong man, even if he wore a sign that he is like that. I would not be surprised if the child's father had about eight girlfriends in the first issue of the script. Stacy's mother (a child carrier) is a riot. She does not realize that her daughter is four years old and seems to be unshakeable when people spy on her window in the dining room. The name of Bobby's best friend (father) is Dewey and is an obvious rip off of Sean Penn in Fast Times in Ridgemont High. This movie is horrible, simply because none of the characters is credible. Thank God he is only intended for television, which limits the chances of seeing him through society.
