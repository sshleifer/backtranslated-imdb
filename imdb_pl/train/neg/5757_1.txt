The film was watched while Nicolson was on the screen. However, I had to fight the passing of boredom when the film depended on whether Meryl Streep carried scenes without Jack; she was as sick as she could. The relationship between the characters was nothing special; these figures were presented earlier - and much better. I felt like in a scenario based on real life in the absolute worst sense: 90% of everyday life is boring and it is not worth writing about or watching. Why Ephron felt that her life and relationships with Carl Bernstein are interesting enough to write about, he escapes. Perhaps she wrote it as a therapy - for many writers putting an episode of their life on paper is cleansing. Okay: but why anyone in Hollywood felt that this story is worth filming remains a mystery to me.
