** 1/2 for this farce of Diane Keaton. <br /> <br /> Someone should say to Mrs. Keaton, enough about her philosophy and the hats of Annie Hall. <br /> <br /> This move is too much like Keaton's Daughter, Sarah, dies in a traffic accident while her boyfriend is going through. <br /> <br /> Keaton, who initially failed to call by phone because she was in the bag with her friend and pulled out the phone plug, regrets the new way of mourners. <br /> <br /> Returns to the summer place where all Sara's friends are staying. He cleans the house, sleeps for two days, and then begins to reveal things that are better not to reveal. It looks like sweet Sarah was sleeping with her girlfriend and the guy who eventually married the other. Besides, thanks to this guy, she had an abortion. We are all subjected to this guilt now. <br /> <br /> The only hope is to find an elusive journal that Sara kept. He also hopes that the boy, Adam, who is a playwright, will not include everything in a different art. <br /> <br /> When the log is found, it was written in Japanese. Sarah had a doctorate in that language. This is not such a great news for mom, when a fragment of the Japanese daily is translated by a chef in a Japanese restaurant. <br /> <br /> Naturally, everything seems very good at last. <br /> <br /> The title of this shmaltz comes from the Wizard of Oz. Each time Mom and Sara talked, they would both speak out, giving in to Dorothy. <br /> <br /> As if that was not enough, in the midst of this bizarre extravagance of grief, Keaton tells Adam not to be the next Woody Allen in his film "Interiors", in which he tried to imitate Ingmar Bergman. Mrs. Keaton is also trying drugs with the group. Come on, people, can we realistically believe that someone in his common sense could mourn like that? <br /> <br /> Honest to the average best sums up this movie.
