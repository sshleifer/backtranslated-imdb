Although I see the potential benefits of this movie in this film, I certainly thought that the painfully long nature in the way the stage structure was played was too big to ask the majority of viewers. Huge holes in the scenario, such as the never-explained comment "your father died today", it is even harder to understand the meaning of these characters. <br /> <br /> This was the first place in Cannes in 2001, which is shocking. Perhaps the French were hungry for a noir movie this year and were desperate looking for something as sadistic as this movie. I understood the long scenes as a device that kept the viewer as uncomfortable as possible, but in combination with the inability to connect with the protagonist it was too far away and kept me away from the story. <br /> <br /> This movie is only for the most devoted fan of the noir movie and the one who does not expect satisfaction from watching the movie after it's finished. I loved movies like "Trainspotting" or "Requiem for a Dream" - which were much more disturbing, but at least they gave the viewer something like editing and stimulation. In order to watch the slow and painful scene of silence after this scene, the teachers became so unnecessary that I found it boring - and I really wanted to like this film every step of the way.
