the box cover makes this movie look really good, do not be fooled. the university splatter appeared in 1984, which was the last good year for horror, but this movie sucks. the characters are so annoying. only the teacher is cool. there is no plot in this movie, who the hell would ever produce this film waste? <br /> <br /> before you spoilers <br /> <br /> the teacher dies in this and it was a woman, we all know that we must have a woman who survives, if you intend to break the rules, do it in good horror, do not do this waste
