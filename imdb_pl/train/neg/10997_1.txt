Above all ..... <br /> <br /> What the hell? Why in the world they are trying to sell low-budget shit on television late at night with the promise of disturbing, insulting, sick debris that no normal human with a soul could see. <br /> <br /> What's so funny about a wounded dog, grandmother dropping his head ... a guy who breaks his hand to pieces and two girls go to the bathroom? What the hell is this world that people think comedy is so sick. Anyone who considers this material amusing should not even be allowed to walk on the ground. <br /> <br /> But from what I've heard, it's not even offensive ... so ... they promise comedy through demented piles of sick trash ... and they can not even do it.
