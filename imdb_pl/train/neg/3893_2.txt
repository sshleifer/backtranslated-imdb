I thought that the main character, astronaut with a bad course (in his case, his skin, hair, muscles, etc.) could always get more movies after he was reduced to a puddle. All he needs to do is get a job as Blob. The premise of this film is quite poor. The astronaut is exposed to sunspot radiation (I think so), so it starts to act like an ice cream cone on a hot day. This is not only a puzzle, but apparently it must kill people and consume their body so that it can maintain some cellular integrity. What? Have you ever noticed that any radiation accident or experiment will ever happen, the person immediately turns into a killing machine? Why is it like that? <br /> <br /> Astronaut plunges into the night from a "secret object" (which has no protection), dropping parts of himself as he goes. Apparently, he has enough memory to go to the launcher, perhaps because he wanted to return to space. <br /> <br /> In this way, the part of the movie, which is almost a filler, begins with a doctor wandering around with a Geiger counter, trying to find a melting man by the buzzing that he's secreting. He kills a stupid, fisherman-like fisherman, scares a little girl in Frankenstein's monster film and ends a crazy old couple (punishing them karmically for stealing some lemons). Then there is a short scene in which he beats his former general and a very long scene in which he kills a young monster and chases his girlfriend. One would think that after cutting off his arm and escaping the scene will change. But no ... we are treated for about ten minutes when a woman curled up in the corner is panting and screaming in terror, even though the monster has disappeared. All I could think of was the director's girl, whoever? <br /> <br /> The end of the movie is still lamer than the rest. The melting man turns into a pile of a goat, and then ... nothing. this is it! This is the end of the movie. Well, at least that meant there was no room for the sequel.
