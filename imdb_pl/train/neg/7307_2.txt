It's probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Events in it are completely random and have no meaning. The fact that there is a sequel is so nauseating that I can go down with the case of a cabin fever (I AM THIS SORRY). I describe it as a splash in the newspaper, because it seems that these are different parts of things mixed together. For example, Kevin, a karate kid who loves pancakes, is just quirky in himself, then there is a policeman who is a bit strange and perverted, then a drug addict, and then he is attacking an accidental guy who clearly needs help. Suddenly, the main character has sex with his friend because he says something stupid about the plane. then at the end some good old family racism, and then a rabbit acting on Kevin. In fact, it's pretty wicked that they can use racism as a joke in this movie. There's no reason anyone would enjoy this movie unless you love Eli Roth, even if I did not like the movie. Hatred is a strong word, but seeing that this is the only word I can use will have to do it. BOYCOTT CABIN FEVER 2 !!!!!
