I passed this title 15 or 20 times in Blockbuster, looking for something decent to watch. All I can say is that everyone was half-decent in the movie the night I decided to rent it. <br /> <br /> I will be suited for that jump better than "Dracula 3000", but in fact it is quite easy to say, because they did not have it kaparna Van Dien. Other things that were missing in the spades are: an interesting cast, interesting story, good dialogue and originality, but I suppose you can not have everything. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS AHEAD *** The crew mismatch vampire hunters (one of which was a vampire ... go to the figure) with a mining colony flew to the mining colony, trying to wipe out all vampires who could find. The crew consists of: conceited, ne'er-do-well the captain (who dies early), his books, yet inexperienced first officer, said vampire vampire hunter (no typos), and would-be cowboy REALLY, REALLY Butch commando Asian, female "Tough" ... sounds almost like the cast for "The Real World" MTV. When the captain dies in violent confrontation with the crowd bloodsuckers (and as it turns out, lovers of the finer parts of the human anatomy), his first partner, takes over ... blah, blah, blah ... .. we all hate it, blah, blah, blah .. I could continue, but as I said, this is the same story used in about one hundred other "movies" of the genre. <br /> <br /> The effect was cheese and why Michael Ironside was in this movie outside of me. Vampire vampire hunter (still not a typo) was quite hot, but of course, if you wait until you reveal more than just her neck, look elsewhere. <br /> <br /> I can not say it was the worst movie I have seen since I rented "Starship Troopers 2", but wait until it appears on the Sci-Fi channel.
