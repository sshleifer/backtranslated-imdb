Where to start? <br /> <br /> # 1 Amitabha's son, played by Akshaye Khanna, is 30 years old. <br /> <br /> Amitabh has been in jail for over 33 years ... on <br /> <br /> A) Telepathically he gave the sperm home? <br /> <br /> B) He asked a nice Pakistani guard to send him for him? <br /> <br /> C) They allow for marital visits in secret Pakistani Prisons. <br /> <br /> D) All the above <br /> <br /> E) The producers had a bit too much bhang w <br / > <br /> when they approved the script? <br /> <br /> # 2) Amrita Rao (Yummm!) wants Khanny - he is yummy, yummy, pride ... and apparently wants her - who would not want to, right ?! ... But when her dad is kidnapped and then killed (I almost do not think it's a "spoiler" because you would have to be dead and blind to not see it in the movie) is quite dispassionate with this disaster and tip (metaphorically) his hat, he leaves her behind to save his father, not to mention her loss, and he says (paraphrasing) "If God wills, we will meet again" ... Basically, "I will get my work done, sorry for your loss - CYA! Buh Bye! "- callus outside even Hollywood standards with low living standards ... <br /> <br /> # 3) There are so many holes in this terrible waste of time called the movie that you can ride all jeeps, camels trucks and all the extra things this. Pass - a really, complete and total waste of time - Oh! There is a great dance sequence (yes, only one - as in a dance sequence - regardless of quality) great belly dance - but NOT worth watching only for this purpose. <br /> <br /> Rent Veer-Zaara or Lakshya (will Hrithik Roshan ever take acting lessons?) for better Indo-Pak conflict movies ... In fact Veer-Zaara is pretty damn good - 7.5 / 8 I would say !
