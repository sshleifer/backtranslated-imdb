I like movies from the end of the day. I like B movies. I was hoping that I would like this film. <br /> <br /> I could ignore the weak effects, often horrible music, embarrassing lines. I could have ignored the unexplained events, and the fact that the film is constantly based on deus ex machina is justified, considering the subject matter. I could ignore the fact that people fighting hunger and trying to achieve peace in the world are bad people. None of these things kill the movie. What kills the movie is simple and boring. In fact, nothing happens; almost all the scenes in the movie are aimed at pushing the filmmakers' morality to viewers, at the expense of a truly coherent story or any tension. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a fun movie B, look somewhere else. This movie is just boring.
