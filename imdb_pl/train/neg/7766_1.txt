<br /> <br /> As with the other episodes of this TV series, which tells about many adventures of the maritime legend, Horatio Hornblower's super human infallibility destroys any chance of tension. <br /> <br /> When little Wesley Crusher ruined many seasons of the NEXT GENERATION, Horatio Hornblower invariably saves every situation. Every wise solution inevitably comes only from the mouth of Horatio Hornblower. Incredibly better, Hornblower's main problem in this series of films seems to be to tolerate many of the incapacitating errors above and below the chain of command. The ideal being makes story telling boring. Our supervisor is our hero so that even those who try to help him are not able to do something correctly, unless Hornblower is to direct and control all their movement. <br /> <br /> What is the point of telling a story to a person who can not do wrong and will win many times each time? What is the point in watching such a story?
