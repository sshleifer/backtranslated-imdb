normally I am not the type who is afraid of horror movies, but this movie is an exception. a bit like this movie came to mind !!! it is a very simple film, but at the same time extremely effective, has a great atmosphere, and this leads to shocking moments, the girl's father coming down from the hill is a real distinguishing feature. Another was a family photo, which I did not expect and jumped out of place !!! I recommend everyone to see this movie, with the lights on, it will stay with you for a long time !!!!!
