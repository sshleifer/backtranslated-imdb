I wanted to like this movie, really. He has a few good actors, but he's finally falling. He tries to be too funny in some places (daughters over zealous attempts at cooking), in other achievements (scene in which they clean someone's yard, so he agrees to join the band) and has a few scenes that are interesting, just filler ( all working scenes). And I did not consider the villian to be intimidating or worthy of hatred, so much so that I thought they were childishly annoying. <br /> <br /> I met people like you in the movie while playing church ball. I will say that the judge is in place, but in the end I did not care too much about the characters or their search for glory in the church. Maybe because all of them were so one-dimensional, which I could not have had such a serious impression, if the film was more fun or seemed to flow a little more generally. <br /> <br /> Kurt Hale and entertainment Halestorm have made some good movies, but this is not one of them.
