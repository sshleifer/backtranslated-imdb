I was disgusted with this movie. No, not because of the graphic scenes of sex, because it ruined the painting of Artemisia Gentileschi. This film does not have much truth about her and her art. It shows one artistic work she has done (Judith Beheading Holofernese), but shows that she was recorded as a testimony in the rape process when she did not paint her first Judith for a year after the trial. <br /> <br /> I do not know if you understood it from the movie, probably not, Tassi was not a noble hero. He lifted Artemisia. It was not love, it was rape. He did not claim to accept false charges of rape to stop her suffering from being tortured. According to the rape records, he claimed that he never knew Artemisia (aka had sex), while she constantly repeats: "That's true". <br /> <br /> I encourage all of you to go out and find real Artemisia and see what it really is all about. Do not base all your knowledge on this fictional movie. I encourage you to do some research, Artemisia really has an interesting story behind you and amazing works of art. <br /> <br /> Do not watch the movie, but learn the true story of Artemisia.
