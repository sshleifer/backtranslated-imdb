It is unfortunate that someone has decided on the best horrors of all time in my book. This bad copy steals a lot of material from the first three films, and even copies the way people die and what will happen to key characters in the future, and basically tries to push three movies into one and fail. It is not even possible to create a good terrifying atmosphere (except for the strange exception, in which impressive choral music brings back the memories of old films). <br /> <br /> The only thing we can be grateful for is that there is no Omen V.
