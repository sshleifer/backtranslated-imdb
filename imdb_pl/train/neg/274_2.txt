It seems that there is little space in the middle where it is about Watch On the Rhine. One of them likes it very much, applauding his honesty, his liberal point of view and good acting, or he hates his obvious propaganda, mediocre dialogue, cardboard characters and general bias. I really like the last category and found a film and game - in reference to European refugees in Washington during the war - a crushing boredom, worth mainly for actors, and even then only sporadically. This author Lillian Hellman was irrelevant to the angels. Her plays were written for people who share her point of view, and rarely explored ideas that were no longer in the possession of the author and audience, except to indicate how terrible the "other side" is. Even when I'm one hundred percent consistent with what he has to say - like in the Rhine - I still can not stand the way he says it. Her characters are unrealistic, and while her ear for dialogue shows some way in which people speak, there is no real glamor or originality. She really did not have anything new to say. I completely agree with the delayed dismantling of Hellman's reputation by Mary McCarthy a few years ago. For those who think that the theater is dead or in the extreme and longs for old goods, I invite you to watch Watch On the Rhine, just as bad in its own way as Angels In America, which only shows that the theater had one foot in the grave sixty years ago.
