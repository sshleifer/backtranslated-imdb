The Class is a comedy series that presents a group of 27 year old classmates. <br /> <br /> I like the idea of ​​the show. That is why it saddens me that the class is not funny, although it has obvious potential. It's not enough cork, just dorky. (Haha.) This is due to the slow pace and the lack of funny punch lines. Also, some actors have difficulty synchronizing. <br /> <br /> The most ingenious characters are the twins Kat and Lina Warbler (Lizzy Caplan and Heather Goldenhersh), but even they seem to be a bit too square for the show's sake. On the other hand, the characters that I think are the most uninteresting are the main hero Ethan and Duncan and Nicole once. <br /> <br /> I am concerned that the only Aaronic character is Aaron being chosen for his accent (though by a disrespectful figure, but in any case).
