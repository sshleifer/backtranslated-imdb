I do not know much about Tobe Hooper or where he gets his name in the title, but maybe he should not bother. As another commentator mentioned, there is not enough horror or erotica to attract fans of any genre. The plot is incoherent, the Sade sequences are free, and most of the actors are so-so. Englund did everything in his power, with poor material, and Zoe Trilling has a really great bottom, but none of them is enough to move this movie. This is a tape. Degree: F
