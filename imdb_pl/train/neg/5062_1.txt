This movie is bizarre. Better, it's "weird" strange. I could give you a story summary or an analysis of self-confidence, but I would consider it a waste of your time. All you need to know about this film are two young sisters, one incestuous relationship, a murder, post-mortem mutilation and one truly disturbing infatuation. At the end of the movie, you feel that you must take a shower to wash away dirt, but not in a good way like "Pulp Fiction" or "Fight Club". It's like being a teenager (or a high school student who I'm a teenager myself) and he just did something to you. A: I regret that you did not do it, and B: I hope that the Good Lord of Heaven and Earth, that your parents will never know. And nobody likes it. My advice is that instead of defiling your mind and watching a fragment of mindless cinema dirt, just waste your time on something less monstrous and watch "Kazaam" (yes, I would rather see "Kazaam" than "Murderous Maids" read what want).
