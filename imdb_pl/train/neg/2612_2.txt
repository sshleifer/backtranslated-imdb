The only reason I saw 101 Dalmatians was the nomination for the original song and costume design for the Oscars. I must admit that I was less than impressed by this film. In this continuation of Cruella DeVil (by the way, Glen Close is doing very well with this role) she is dismissed from the hospital because of her good behavior. He likes all kinds of animals and closes all his fur. From that moment, we wait only until it has a crisis. Soon he does and tries to create the best coat of the fashion world, of course for himself and from beautiful Dalmatian fur. In addition to Glen Close, I thought all casts were stupid, but funny to the child's eye. It's fair enough because, I think, the target market is children under 12 years old. Quite good entertainment for children and families, but it did not do much for me. * except *****
