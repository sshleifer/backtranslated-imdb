Operation is awful. This film makes Fast and Furious look like an Academy Award-winning movie. They throw some tits and ass there to try to interest you in spite of VERY weak and far-reaching history. There is a reason why people on the Internet do not even download this movie. This film sank like an iron turd. Do not waste time on borrowing or even downloading. This movie is and will always be PERMA-TURD. I am now more dumb for watching this. In fact, this title should be called "PERMA-TURD" from now on. Calling this movie is a parody and insult. repulsive, hideous, terrible, horrible, bestial, cruel, disgusting, unpleasant, disgusting, terrible, eerie, threatening, fairy, scary, scary, spooky, grim, terrifying, horrible, hideous, terrifying, terrible, disgusting, bad gloomy, mean , nasty, disgusting, offensive, repellent, repulsive, repulsive, scandalous, terrifying, shameful, shocking, sickie, scary, scary, impious, impious, unkind
