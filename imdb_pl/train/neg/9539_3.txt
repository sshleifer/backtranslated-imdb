A group of kids created a theater in which an all-night horror movie marathon takes place. However, when the night goes on, there is someone among them who kills them one by one. Who is it ... and why? I saw it in the theater in 1991. I could not wait - but boy! It did not work at all. The premise is good, they have a very attractive young cast and a few professionals like Dee Wallace Stone on board ... but it does not work. The story ceases to make sense in the middle (it may be due to some huge editing before the release of the movie), the killings are relatively bloodless (as it has a rating of R is outside of me), and unmasking the killer at the end was boring and stupid. <br /> <br /> It's really a pity - this movie had potential. Thanks to a better script, it could have been a great horror movie. As it looks, it is mostly forgotten, and the cast itself seems embarrassed (I heard that Stone will not talk about it). I give him 3 and only for the cast.
