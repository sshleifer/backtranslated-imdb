There were many films based on the same topic. a single pretty girl needs a handsome boy to impress ex, pays him, and then (guess what?) falls in love with him, is a bit of clumsiness, and then the government, before everyone can catch up before a happy ending ...... it was done many times. <br /> <br /> I mean, I knew that before watching. But still, I could not wait. In good hands, with a good cast and a clear script, it can still be a nice way to work a few hours. <br /> <br /> that was none of those. <br /> <br /> it was tragic. <br /> <br /> Female lead that lacked charm or wit, which completely did not ignite even the smallest spark in me. I really did not care if she "got her man" or remained lonely and unhappy. <br /> <br /> A man who after a few endless words of wisdom, I wanted to kill. To remove this satisfied look. I had no idea that leading the life of a male whore was the path to the omniscient omniscient enlightenment. <br /> <br /> A totally unrealistic movie full of unreal characters. none of them had a job, everyone had more money than reason, a bridegroom who, after marriage, continues to go after he found out that his fianc√©e was sleeping with his best friend ... plus "I would miss you, even if we had I never met "!!!!! I could go on, but I just realized that I'm losing even more time on this slag ..... I could talk about introducing characters just to have a very cheap laugh from the name" woody " "But it was really just a remotely humorous thing that happened in the movie.
