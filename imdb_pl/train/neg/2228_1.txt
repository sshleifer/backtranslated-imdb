This movie is weak, the cover talks about the heaviest gang from East LA and it really is Santa Ana, James Cahill behaves like a wardrobe queen, destroying all the hard guys in the difficult Chlo gang. It's fake, boring, senseless and difficult, I tried to get my money back from the video store that was so bad. He was also at the end of homo-erotic, far from what the video-box says. James Cahill should appear in Gay Porn. James is in every scene, he can not act to save his life. The movie features Eva Longoria, who is hot, but James can not even score her goal !!!!!!!!! I felt that sometimes I watched Gay Porn and I was turned off for the entire movie. James apparently wants to be with men, but rather succumb to his gay wishes, beating gang members over and over again. His martial arts skills are minimal at best. Some real gang members took him and his poor skills and played him new.
