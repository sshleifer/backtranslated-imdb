This is another typical unbelievable and insensitive piece of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Kurt Russell, like Snake Pliskin in a suit, convinces me that he was a better 2nd baseman. Ray Liotta as a psychotic policeman is completely predictable and absurd. Madeline Stowe is her usual cardboard egg-maker and does little to be a convincing victim. <br /> <br /> Every scene in this persiflage is absolutely predictable until the end, when Kurt tears Ray with a vase or something, knocks him down and out. Kurt and Madeline perform the obligatory coverage of the film, and EVERYONE - except Russell and Stowe, KNOWS Liotta will return to normal and will threaten the pair again. <br /> <br /> He, of course, and Russell is drilling it 10 times his 9 mm, which was absolutely unnecessary. This film could very well end up in a bludgeoning scene --- EXCEPTIONALLY Hollywood because of unnecessary violence, and the more they can add or "reinforce", the more they are bumping.
