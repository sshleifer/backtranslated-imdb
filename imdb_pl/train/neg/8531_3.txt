In this forgotten little thing, a 40-man Norma Shearer plays a fluttering, girlish social party in Monte Carlo, caught in a quarrel between George Sanders and Robert Taylor. It would be tempting to blame the film's defeat for the blunt, talkative script or director George Cukor, who never seems interested in reviving an overall comic movie. Mostly, however, it is the fault of Shearer herself, who desperately wanted to play "young" parts, provided she managed to escape. Unintentionally, this is her "cart lover" bizarre monument to the vanity of an aging woman.
