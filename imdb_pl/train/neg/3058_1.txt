When I was a kid in the '70s, the local theater had children's mornings every Saturday and Sunday afternoon (do everyone remember those?). They showed this thing a year after Christmas. Me and a few friends went to see him. I was expecting a nice Santa Claus movie. What I got was terribly dubbed (you can say) and a really scary movie. <br /> <br /> Something about Santa Claus and Merlin the Magician (do not ask me what the two of you do in the same movie) fight, Satan (some joker in the costume of a stupid devil with horns!). The paintings crouched in my chair. I always thought Santa was terrible, so it did not help. The Satan guy did not help. But I was REALLY afraid of wooden deer, which pulled Santa's sleigh. When he made them and the horrifying sound they made and movements - I remember nightmares about these things! All these years I still remember when I left this theater more than a little concerned about what I saw. My friends were a little afraid of that too. I just saw an ad on TV and all those nightmares came back with a bang. It's a terrifying, disturbing little Christmas movie that probably scares the pants of every little child who sees them. Avoid this - unless you really want to punish your children. It gets 1.
