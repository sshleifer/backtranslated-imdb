Original Claymation Rudolph: Pretty good. Original cartoon Frosty: I need some work, but it can be worse. But Frosty and Rudolph together on the fourth of July? Come on! Give me a break!!! It was one movie that should not have been made. It was bad. This was not particularly about holidays, except on July 4. This made it particularly bad because Frosty and Rudolph are usually associated with the holiday season. And any movie can be ruined by too much singing. Frequent songs made the film look much longer than it actually was. The film tried to connect two famous characters Chirstmastime with a traditional American holiday (which seems to "limit" to America), too many senseless songs and a bad story. Score? A bad movie that can not be watched at any time of the year. I would suggest that you quit this movie, even if you like Frosty and Rudolph.
