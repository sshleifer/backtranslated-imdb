Although I can not deny that his films are often entertaining, I have always personally thought that Martin Scorsese is a bit overrated in his abilities. His brilliant style in many movies seems to scream, "Look at me, am I not an ingenious director?" His best movie I've seen is the one with the least amount of supplements, the superlative "Raging Bull". <br /> <br /> It seems that in this remake it was as usual. The dense footage for transferring to the scenery from the 1950s was so bland that it did not dissipate in itself. Melodramatic close-ups combined with the imitation of sub-pairs of the classic score "Psycho" more often evoke smiles of derision than a sense of atmospheric terror. The score of "Psycho" was brilliantly annoying, this "tribute" sounds simply terrifying and irritating. Even the cast, which can sometimes be decent, provides histrionic performances that simply shout "caricature"; a remarkable exception is that it is an intelligent return of Lewis as a sensitive teenage daughter of the Bowden family. <br /> <br /> The worst offender here is surprisingly De Niro. Sure, it looks dangerous enough, but as soon as it opens its mouth, the aura simply drains away. Now I'm not an expert on American accents, and I'm from nearby Manchester in England and everything, but I'm sure he could have come up with a more convincing Southern Drawl than that? Being a talented physical actor, he almost overcomes this fatal flaw, but not completely. It was disturbing to me, as a fan of De Niro, regretting that he is not on the screen, and not delighted with his performance. <br /> <br /> (MOÅ»LIWE SPOILERY.) <br /> <br /> The End - The highest style of the whole film extends to an absurdly exaggerated finale. When will Scorsese know that underestimating the situation can sometimes trigger tension as effectively as give the viewer a visual and audible bombardment? I also thought that he was too respectable to resort to the cheap "killer, not dead" trick that less talented people can use. <br /> <br /> In total, a completely funny "thriller". Scorsese and De Niro did MUCH better cooperation.
