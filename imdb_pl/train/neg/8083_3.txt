This disaster, denied by Richard C. Sarafian, stopped the Japanese theaters before it reached the States and immediately went to the video, where it was not seen again until Turner's networks needed something other than infomercials to fill their 3-6 morning intervals tape at the bottom of the container. The name Smithee is to be used when the studio destroys the film so much that the director no longer wants to give his name to him. But I'm afraid that the Sarafian can not completely blame studying for it. Actors, mainly new graduates of "Overacting 101", deliver one corn line after another. The plot is complicated. The special effects are impressive. Parts that are not funny are simply boring. The script or book must have been good - why would Palance, Matheson, Boyle or Heston agree to appear in this ass? But something went terribly wrong from the side to the screen. Summary: Avoid. Even bad enough to be so bad - that's good.
