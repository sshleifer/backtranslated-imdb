Slackers is another movie for teenagers, which is not worth watching. Dave (Devon Sawa), Sam (Jason Segel) and Jeff (Michael C. Maronna) are going to graduate from Holden University with honors in lies, scams and intrigue. The three roommates have been proud of the last four years of study, and now, during the final exams, these great men on campus are to be defeated by the most unlikely guy at school. The plot is very stupid and there is no reason to watch it, unless you want to cut off your brain for a while. Slackers is just a predictable teen movie that really adds nothing new to the genre. The comedy in Slackers is either a hit or a lack, but the movie does not have a real, real moment. It's really a collection of gags, and some are quite fun. Although for any joke that works, at least eight others do not. The script is full of jokes from the penis and breasts that some high school students and students can use. Even if they do, they probably will not remember this movie after a while, because it's not a very memorable comedy. Jason Schwartzman plays bizarre Ethan and after appearing in good comedies, he bows down quite low. Jaime King and Devon Sawa are other major stars, but they do rather poor work in this film. The director is Dewey Nicks and this is his first film, so you can not blame him too much. The most fun character was probably Laura Prepon, she is not in the film. The film is very short, it only lasts 86 minutes, but it can be too long for some people who do not like this type of humor. Slackers is not the worst movie of 2002, but it is certainly below average. Compared with other movies in this genre, it's much better, such as Not Another Teen Movie, American Pie and its sequels, Scary Movie 1 and 2 etc. So, unless you've seen most of them and are looking for something new then Slackers can fit to this bill, but it's better if you just look at something else. Rating 4.3 / 10 below the average comedy for teens, which is worth ignoring.
