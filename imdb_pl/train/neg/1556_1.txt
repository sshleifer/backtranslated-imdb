In this movie, I was China. I choose the pseudonym Sheeba Alahani, because then I modeled in Italy and could not correctly pronounce my real name, so I chose Sheeb, and then I added Alahani, because it was similar to Alohalani. <br /> <br /> I've never played (and it shows) before, but filming was so much fun. Each morning they gave me "acting lessons" (which of course was not useful). They called my voice (thank God). <br /> <br /> David and Peter were great on the set, full of good humor and jokes. This film was never to be taken seriously, it was a tax deduction according to internal information. <br /> <br /> I give him 1 because I have a sense of humor, but 10 for the fun I 'played' in it.
