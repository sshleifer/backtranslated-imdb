As someone else has mentioned, it starts with a bizarre prologue about a little blond girl killing a cat. Then the main story: the photographer (Gaffari) and the writer (Shepard) meet by accident and set off to the mountains. First, they spend the night at the inn, where a somewhat deaf host is sung by Gaffari, with an increasing irritation from the audience. In the mountains, they look for shelter and are invited by a polite old lady who seems too hospitable to strangers (Hansel and Gretel, whoever?). t. Now I like Eurohorror, and it would be better if only Artigot (writer and director) tried to logically tell stories. Background (Pyrenees?) Provides an excellent and intriguing location for mysterious and occult events. Green peaks could easily obscure the supernatural forces and those who prove them. Photography is nice. I would like the whole thing to make sense. You can watch this movie on archive.org.
