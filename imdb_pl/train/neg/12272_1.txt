Simply put, this is the worst movie from "Police Academy: Mission in Moscow" (if you liked this movie, you'll probably like this movie). <br /> <br /> What did they think? Some ideas should remain only an idea. The mere fact that this idea could be filmed should be a crime. <br /> <br /> I heard that it was so bad. One word ... EVERYTHING. <br /> <br /> Rental cost: $ 4.50 Time to watch: 89 minutes <br /> <br /> I want to get a refund for both!
