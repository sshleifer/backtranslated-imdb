This is a really bad movie, with bad acting and a very boring pace Lorenzo Lamas is really cool! All characters are just annoying (except for the Lamas) and there is absolutely nobody to root them out or care about it, and the action is very boring. The film gives us three criminals who were supposed to find threatening and disturbing, when in reality they are boring, funny and just a handful of cretins, which I wanted to close!, And also looks very cheap and amateur! Lorenzo Lamas has a lot of charisma, but he can not save this piece and believe that the opening was really cool, just like the ending, however the center is incredibly boring and prompted me to press the fast scroll button! Plus This window is especially fun! There's a nice bar scene that I liked very much, but when Lamas goes to the dock, it all falls apart, plus the scene where the villains torture Jennifer's family and kill them would be disturbing to me when it's really funny! It's a really bad movie, with bad acting and a very boring pace, Lorenzo Lamas is really cool! However, this is not enough, it is not recommended. The direction is very bad. George Erschbamer is doing a very bad job here, with an average camera, bland location and maintaining the movie at a boring pace. Acting is very bad (except for Lamas). Lorenzo Lamas is amazing here and although he is not obliged to act, he is pretty cool when he is watching and he has a really cool character, and he has a lot of charisma, but even he can not save it, and he had no chemistry with cast! (Lamas rules!). Josie Bell is awful here, and though she looks decent, she is not very convincing and there is no chemistry with the Lamas. Cheryl Jeans is hot, but there is not much to do but he screams and is afraid. Fine. Robert Scott is AMAZING annoying as the main villain, and he was not dangerous at all, he was ridiculous like the others. The rest of the cast is bad. Overall, avoid it! Avoid !, even if you like Lamas (like me). * from 5
