ATTENTION TO ALL DIRECTORS: Long is not necessarily good. This movie is unbelievably long. However, not good. Scenes have been developed in a way, way, way, way, too long. Sexual scenes were unnecessary and often too long. A movie edited to 2 hours and 10 minutes would be special, but unfortunately it has become so boring long that I can give it only 2 out of 10. It is well below average. <br /> <br /> Some other problems also exist in this marathon. <br /> <br /> 1) Ralph Fiennes plays the entire family tree. The guy who played the great-grandfather does not remind him, but grandfather, father and son (who gives us unnecessary voice) are all Ralph Fiennes with different facial hair and the same basic personality with a bull. It seems that no one notices that each of these children looks like the last clone, even though the photos are snapped at every step. This one is small, but if the movie did not last 3 weeks, it would not be so annoying. <br /> <br /> 2) The fact that no messages from Germany have even been whispered for the longest time The gathering and sending back of Jews is ridiculous. A word would reach them, and the thought of an escape attempt would probably be discussed. An uncle in France would certainly send a warning to try to force them to leave. <br /> <br /> 3) The love stories in this movie are completely wrong. You spend eternally telling us this, and the development of the relationship between the main characters is extremely short. Suddenly ... people are in love and almost immediately ... married. Then I have children. Then we pull things out for six centuries and forget about developing relationships. It would not get stuck again in a two-hour movie, but with time spent nothing was given to us. <br /> <br /> 4) The ending was just bad. I do not want to ruin it, but you will not like it either ... unless you're a sadist. <br /> <br /> The director / writer should be tortured when he has to view this bloated garbage weekly basis, I mean the endless loop, oops, this is the same. <br /> <br /> I wonder if Robert Redford did something for this film, I mean that Istvan Szabo must model his directing career after him. A long filmed movie that completely ruins every substance in the film. A brief description of the "Horse Whisperer" and the sun. <br /> <br /> The sun, the perfect title. If you start watching when the sun shines, it will be fine after dark when you leave.
