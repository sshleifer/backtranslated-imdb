A group of Fox TV managers are sitting at the table in the conference room, wondering what to put on order. <br /> <br /> "What about targeting something like 24 or The West Wing?" says one of them, but everyone agrees that it would be too expensive, and cheap TVs are less likely to hurt the station if it will happen. <br /> <br /> "What about a meeting of great comedic writers and making a good TV series?" offers another and is released on the spot. "You do not know that good writers cost a lot of money!" The big main barking. "That's why we created reality TV." <br /> <br /> "We could do another crime drama ..." suggests a man in a colorless suit. "I'm listening ..." the boss replies, suddenly interested. "People like CSI, so let's make one more copy," adds Blandman. <br /> <br /> "But there are too many CSI clones, what can we do to stand out?" the naive younger one asks and is immediately released. 'Stand out! If we do, people will be confused! Give them more of what they already like! big main screams. <br /> <br /> "Just add more violence and make it really scary, we're finally foxes", another suit suggests a heartfelt "now you have it" answer from the big boss. "We could make them a Deviant Crime Unit," he adds, clearly on the list. <br /> <br /> "Jove, he has it!" the big boss laughs: "and the victims can be beautiful and defenseless women who wear very little on the screen." "Well, it will definitely distract people from average actors and weak scenarios," emphasizes Blandman. <br /> <br /> "Then it's fixed, we just need a name," announces the big boss. "Can we call it sexual violence?" <br /> <br /> "Too literal or maybe Killer Instinct? it transmits violence, but sounds a bit like Basic Instinct, which had a lot of sex. " <br /> <br /> "Puuurfect", the main boss answers, and then everyone pats each other on the back and resigns from arrested development.
