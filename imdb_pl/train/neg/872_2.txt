First of all, I expected that "Caged Heat" would be in line with "Ilsa, The Wicked Warden". Boy, I was wrong! In any case, this movie is not used in the 1970s, "chix in chains" or "women in prison." Of course, the plot consists of a group of women in prison, who wear street clothes (quite comical), but nothing happens. <br /> <br /> There is no strong rivalry, no one tries to seduce the headman or the doctor to try to escape, and prisoners do not leave the house. There are 2 scenes with showers, which I suspect are simply recycled material, but no fights are exploding / nobody is seduced here - or in any other case! In addition to the lack of plot, unconvincing, unpleasant and flat characters, several prisoners who manage to escape, return to prison to "free" their inmates! !! <br /> <br /> PUH-LEASE, the movie should just end with the escapes of the escapees at sunset ... in contrast to the fact that this mess continues! <br /> <br /> I feel cheated.
