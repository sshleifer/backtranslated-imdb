Today, Bea Arthur died, so I traveled on the IMDb website and somehow ended up performing in the "Gloria" program. "All In The Family" was a great show for the first four or five years and I bet I've watched every episode more than once. I swear, however, that I did NOT know that there is a program called "Gloria". Maybe it's a good thing. Maybe it means that I had a life as a young adult, and I did not watch TV. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it's pathetic that the "All In The Family" franchise has deteriorated so much that it gave birth to a show I've never heard of - and which is rated very poorly by previous reviewers. <br /> <br /> I rated the program as one of two reasons - the system did not allow me to register a vote without voting and writers and television directors should be condemned for starting a program that has no interest in being in the air and destroying the memory of one of the largest programs in the history of television. <br /> <br /> Shalom, ZWrite
