As many agree, Origin is a beautiful artistic anime. Music, graphics and the created world are wonderful and really surpass most other contemporary animated works. However, if you are looking for something more than this, I suggest you look elsewhere. Beauty ceases to appear, and when it really comes down to the story and the characters, there is nothing special. The action is slow and minimal, and people are sometimes prolific, sometimes banal and do not act realistically. Not to mention the story holes here and the holes in the story ... To conclude, oh my God, I've never seen an anime as beautiful as this one; and oh my God, it's like ... people - people do not behave this way. It took GIANT step in graphics and music in the anime, but it took a few steps back to the times of bad characteristics and unfortunately, there is not even such an action to reward ...
