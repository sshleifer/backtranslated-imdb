For those who would like to see this movie? I would say: go! Without a narrative it can be a very good movie / document. But music, narration and some of the implemented feature lines make it very difficult to see a skeptic like me. Following several animals, their life in a few seasons gives the impression that it is animal soap that we observe. But the melodramatic point of view just does not bother me, and in addition if the predator finally catches up with the capture (one other exception), the camera enlarges or skips another scene. I ask myself why this happens if they are to show reality, why cut scenes from a melodramatic fairy tale? I think that the moral is important for the mass of the crowd, because after all: destroying this beautiful planet would be a waste.
