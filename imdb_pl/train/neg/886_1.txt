A few years ago, the same people who created Paris, J'TAIME., Which were imperfect, but very pleasant (my score was 7), created this piece of trash about New York. <br /> <br /> In Paris, I Love You (J'taime) created a feeling for Paris and was created in many parts of beautiful Paris. <br /> <br /> In this movie I did not recognize New York, I did not feel that I was in the city of my birth. <br /> <br /> New York has 5 districts, I have not seen any scenes in Bronx or Queens, There is one scene in Brooklyn, (Brighton Beach), I have seen no scenes in Times Square or Greenwich Village / No scenes in beautiful hotels or theaters. He has a large cast, most of the performers were not even stereotypes, they were caricatures of the lowest genre. <br /> <br /> Few humorous moments are sexual or offensive to many great New Yorkers whom we all know and love .. <br /> <br /> Several films nominated for the "razzie" awards were much better. <br /> <br /> Ratings: * (out of 4) 20 points (out of 100) IMDb 1 (out of 10) <br /> <br /> I think that in my opinion the title should be <br /> <br / > NEW YORK, I hate you.
