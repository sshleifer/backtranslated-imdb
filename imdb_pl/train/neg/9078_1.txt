Would not it be great if Not Another Teen Movie put a stop to all this stupid, pointless, I get more sex than you, teenagers? In a perfect world like this. But this one is even worse. This one is not humiliating for the stars, it's humiliating for the distributor. All jokes are actually students who reveal things that people probably are not interested in, but are "fun." Devon Sawa, who was good at Final Destination, is just boring in this movie. You wonder if it is deliberately wrong. Degree: F
