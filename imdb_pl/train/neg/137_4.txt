It is obvious why the creators of Scary Movie easily falsified these "teenagers" films. They are so unbelievably formal. And if Valentine was released about a year earlier, I'm sure they would also fake the movie - if they found any original material to distinguish it from the Shouts, I know what you've done in recent years, and Urban Legends. <br /> <br /> Valentine offers nothing new in this genre except the better ending than usual, which of course leaves a lot of room for an inevitable continuation. As usual, a masked psychotic killer persecutes a group of beautiful young women, killing the main character's friends one by one in a typical style. Plenty of T & A on the display, lack of character development, bad acting and too extensive bloodshed. <br /> <br /> I can not stand this kind of movie because they turn off as "who did it? "The thing is, they are not, because the motive reveals itself only when the killer exposes himself and tells the main heroine whose friends have now been murdered. Usually something that was never clear at all during the movie (eg the fishing partner of the uncle's mother of the main character kicked his friend's father's dog). All those who have remained alive throughout the movie are "suspects", but they are more "red-eye" than suspects. As we all know at the moment, the main character manages an unlikely escape and kills the unprotected psycho killer after revealing the motif. <br /> <br /> Valentine followed the formula almost to the letter. *************** SPOILER !!!!!! (mini spoiler after all) *************** In Valentine, the motif was not revealed, but more, left to think about, considering that the film did not end with a typically teen slash way. The problem is only partially resolved, and the target of the main assassin may, but does not have to be fulfilled, thanks to the survival of bloodshed and the killing of almost everyone. Will the killer want more, or do the demons really win? <br /> <br /> It still did not make Valentine a good movie. too much. For anyone who thinks about making another film according to these rules, please do not. Originality is so important and it is difficult to see the originality of this genre.
