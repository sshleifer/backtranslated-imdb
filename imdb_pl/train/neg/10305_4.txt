As an engineer, I have to admit that the first season of this program has started very promising. Most of the applied mathematics were quite probable, and the accounts presented between the brothers Eppes and father gave the show an interesting advantage. <br /> <br /> However, after the first season, the show began to humiliate, strongly. Most of the mathematics and technology used in solving crimes is now a complete gibberish and very funny for all people involved in science and technology. <br /> <br /> The involvement of the actors is still fine and I can imagine honest in every episode there is still a lot of money, but in the end it degraded to a very unpleasant dish, which is a mix of the class C action thriller and a show of policemen in CSI style. <br /> <br /> If you watch this, you will only go to the first season and probably the second part. Then I would not waste time. Sam showed up in the middle of the third season. <br /> <br /> Season 1 - 8 stars Season 2 - 5 stars Season 3 - 3 stars <br /> <br /> Let's summarize that up to 4 stars. Ever since Charlie knows his maths anymore, I do not bother with the correctness of my mathematics.
