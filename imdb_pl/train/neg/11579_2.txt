I must admit that I do not remember much about heroes and history, although I'm not sure if he was such, I was very irritated by this movie, that I had some difficulty concentrating on it. How can you call the movie "Keys to Tulsa" and then shoot it in Texas? The flat desert country around Arlington (I think it was the location) in no way resembles the green hills surrounding Tulsa, and the celebrity in Tulsa would have a much nicer neighborhood to live on. Of course, no one in the movie DO HAD Tulsa, otherwise they would understand how nothing in the film resembled anything. Has anyone at least seen Rumblefish or The Outsiders? I know it sounds picky, but I can not help it. I watched it because I love James Spader and I usually think that Eric Stotz is interesting. But even these two intriguing actors could not revive this meandering and vile tale of the involved people, NOT IN TULSE !! I'm sorry, but filming in Oklahoma can not be more expensive. What if "To Live and Die in LA" was shot in Toronto? Would it suck? So he does it.
