Only for die-hard fans of Judy Garland. There are two (2) numbers that are really good - one in which he makes a number with an older cleaner (you've all seen photos), and a pretty good number at the very end. There are several scenes in which the lines are fun. But in fact the script is so bad, and the movie is so outdated that it's hard not to fall into this horror. But it's worth to rent a movie at 2.50 - just get ready to scroll forward.
