Richard Dreyfuss is indeed in this film, but in a small part. He is NOT a "possessed" filmmaker - he is a group manager / accountant. Even the box describes the movie inaccurately. In the commercial there are no erotic scenes with Sondra Locke, unless you use the term "erotic" quite loosely. I would not think about watching a movie without Richard Dreyfuss in the lead role. Perhaps, however, I realized that the famous hymn of the 1960s "Suzanne Leonard Cohen" was an artistic influence. In addition to the short recitation of poems from the end of Ulysses by James Joyce and an interesting visual reference to the end of Ingmar Bergman's "Seventh Seal", I found it a weak attempt to combine symbolic elements and moods recorded in the films "Last Year in Marianbad" and "Un Chien Andalou. " If you like the idea of ​​an eccentric artistic group, there are many great films, from "Hi, Hi, Brazil" to "Cecil B. Demented".
