When childhood memory tells you that it was a scary movie; Touch it and go and see if you should repeat it. In any case, I remembered the horrifying scene with a homeless and cool villain played by Jeff Kober. <br /> <br /> "The First Power" is not a very good movie, what a sad thing to say. It is a full cop film and very bad scenario with holes through which a truck can pass (along with countless comfortable "twists" that help guide the story). Lou Diamond Phillips is a self-confident bad asshole who sends Baddie Kober's serial killer into the gas chamber just to find out that he was a servant of Satan himself and now has the power of resurrection with the power of having every weak thinking person he has comes. In the mix, a poorly realized psychic who helps in the case. <br /> <br /> Ah, it's rubbish. But pleasant as such, especially if you have good memories. I was scared as a child and this homeless scene is still quite good. As for any logic here; forget about it, almost every scenario is thrown in for good and you're done with the Steven Segal and the 70's demon flick. And who on earth thought it was a good idea to cast Lou Diamond Phillips at the forefront? Needless to say, he is not convincing at all, but tries his best and never had a problem with a guy who seems to have many reviewers. As for Tracy Griffith as a psyche, the less she said, the better. But Kober is pretty good as a killer; I've always liked this actor. <br /> <br /> The "first power" may be what the doctor ordered after a hard day's work and it is necessary to "turn off the brain". Beer will most likely improve the viewing experience and I will definitely have plenty of it the next time I shoot this movie. In total; it's not a good movie, but a bit guilty of pleasure for nostalgic fans who were easily afraid as children. "See you, buddy, boy!"
