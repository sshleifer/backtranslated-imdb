Humphrey Bogart apparently did not want to be in this movie and be forced to play a part of Mexico, otherwise he would be suspended. Believe me, he made the wrong choice! Presumably, after the success of "Dodge City", Warners tried to establish cooperation with Errol Flynn and his usual list of friends such as Alan Hale, Guinn (Big Boy) Williams, Frank Mc Hugh and always present John Litel, but they made a huge mistake in trying to present Miriam Hopkins as a love interest to Flynn against Randolph Scott, and as a singer, to really do a bad thing, because she proved one thing and she can not sing. The story was not so bad, but with God, who was also clearly wrong, it turned out to be a poor West, which was too long and its budget was low, but in fairness the color would not help.
