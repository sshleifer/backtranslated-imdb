It is a bit strange that the story, which is placed in the part of Oslo, where a very high percentage of residents come from Asia, is NOT EVEN ONE ASIAN OR AFRICAN, even as an additional person. This fact probably describes the general relationship of the Norwegian race. - But. <br /> <br /> NO SPOILERS - ONLY SHORT INTRODUCTION DESCRIPTION: <br /> <br /> Kumpel presents four young people living in an apartment in Oslo. The hero is two young men who fail to manage their lives in any serious way, and one can say that the film could be hesitant and avoid responsibility - a kind of fear of growing up. The narrative plays on typical teenage dreams and fantasies as well as lifestyle patterns. Quite a clich√©. Although the story is a bit funny, acting is good and as a "young man" you can identify with situations of "crazy" characters and complicated romances, I do not consider this story or heroes to be reliable. For polishing and lack of depth. In this movie, all the classical pleasures of the audience were used to create a funny movie that has the same intellectual depth as "Friends" (yes, on television). <br /> <br /> Has the Norwegian film finally found its identity? satisfied in a well-known American style. <br /> <br /> What about watching Lukas Moodysson's Tillsammans (Together).
