I see a lot of movies. I saw the original game years ago and I liked it. Computers in which there is still a "big secret" for most of us and the movie was convincing in its own way. <br /> <br /> This, however, looks like a low-budget Wednesday evening. Total nonsense, from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> The plot is so weak that you will not believe it until you see the movie (which I do not recommend first). I can not point to one actor who actually did a good job in this movie. But hey, thanks to this script I would be surprised if EVERYONE could do their job well. Many stereotypical scenes. It looks like CGI has been removed from the '86 version. <br /> <br /> Bah, no, I'm in a bad mood writing about it. DO NOT watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Life is short to waste them on watching bad movies.
