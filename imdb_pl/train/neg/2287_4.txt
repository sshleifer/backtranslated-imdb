I only saw Gretchen Mol in two other movies (Girl 6, Donnie Brasco) and I do not really remember her, but she did a great job as a naive girl who posed for photos because she made people happy. <br /> <br /> She really did not think what she was doing was wrong, even when she left the company and found her religion again. <br /> <br /> The photos she made were certainly domesticated according to today's standards, and it's funny that men with cameras are excited and politicians are picturing the evil of pornography. David Strathairn (Good Night and Good Luck) played a great role here. <br /> <br /> Mary Harron (American Psycho) wrote and directed an outstanding biography of the most famous pinup girl in history.
