I swore to myself a long time ago that I will NEVER look at a movie in which EVER EVER was a regular cast member of "Saturday Night Live". I did not rent "Corky Romano", but through my steadfast manners I was forced to watch him for half an hour. Then my good manners failed. Stupid, not funny. Tedious, not fun. Wrong, not good. That's all I can say about this movie.
