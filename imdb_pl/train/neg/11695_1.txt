To call a movie like "Thinner" is to call the Earth Round or Pauly Shore not talented. No news, but how they got was what people want to know. <br /> <br /> When it comes to this movie .... The book was good, even if it was a small derivative of other stories with "watch out for what you want". Burke plays an overweight lawyer who kills a Gypsy's daughter and is cursed by her father (Constantine from TV "Room 222") for a few pounds a day. <br /> <br /> As I said, it starts well, but why engage a mobster (Mantegna)? Why shoot with automatic weapons so much? Why change it into something so strongly dependent on FX? I thought it would be much more effective if it focused more on the subtle consequences of slimming madness, disease, death, gypsy traditions and the like. <br /> <br /> But no, it should not be. Remember, it's Stephen King we're talking about. <br /> <br /> And the end ... almost the same as the book, but a bit too talkative. In fact, the whole movie speaks too much, feeling that it must explain every turn to us. Not that I expected "The Dead Zone", but I could do without another "Pet Sematary", thanks anyway. <br /> <br /> One star, at least trying to do a decent make-up job. However, part of the movie remained ... say it to me ... "Thinner".
