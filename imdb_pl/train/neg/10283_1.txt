I hate to sound like an "old man", but to be honest I have not seen too many movies that I liked after 1960 ... in general, the movies seem to be getting worse (although I really liked Scott Baio) "The Bread, My Sweet ", with the exception of the sex scene" de rigeur ", which added NIC values ​​to the movie THAT). This movie makes the mother, a girl from the Las Vegas choir, seem unable to survive independently, although it is clearly over fifty (although it suggests he is 40). I did not buy it. I am 57 years old and, like all women I know at the age of 50 and 40, more than able to live independently (as I did since graduating from high school at age 13, I was legally emancipated and embarked on my own journey.) <Br / > <br /> The daughter is not credible in her role at work ... she gets promotion, which she does not deserve (great opportunity) and drops this ball, but when another employee appears on the record and is ready to release, the screenwriters shot her down as an "opportunist" when she was just doing what any career-oriented person would do - using the wide open chance created by the lack of self-discipline of her co-worker, a girl who apparently does not understand the concept of honoring her promises (in this case for her boss) . <br /> <br /> Daughter reluctantly "allows" her mother to stay with her temporarily, but then treats her mother (a woman who gave her life and raised her to "adulthood") like a pariah. Apparently, the "writers" of such guts do not understand that it is NOT a "common thing" for PARENTS who behave like children and are then treated as children by their children. This is just a social "baloney" that Hollywood is trying to push our throats, as if we, their audience, were stupid, that we wanted to play with their creative proposals. <br /> <br /> This is a sad movie with a stupid ending. If a young male restaurateur was a real, not a two-dimensional "television hero", he would stay with MOTHER who was not much older than him and quite attractive. But in the end he "falls" on his daughter, a shallow, rather uninteresting girl who has this youth of youth, but in an ordinary, bland way. (The "opportunistic" young woman who worked with it, nothing physically was more attractive.) <br /> <br /> There was no credible reason for the audience presented why the restaurateur preferred his daughter (who was tense, selfish, self-centered b who treated his mother with an incredible lack of respect) towards the mother - a woman who was kind, quick-tempered, full of humor and had the joy of life, which her daughter could not even understand. Of course, the mother had her faults ... she reacted to her husband's death, drinking in stupor for a year or two later, which would cause a gap between her and her slender daughter. <br /> <br /> Regardless of how the characters were or have not been developed, this is a baloney movie and a waste of valuable viewing time, unless you LIKE baloney. (Where is the mustard?)
