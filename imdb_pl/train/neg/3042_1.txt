I can write 1000 words about this movie, but one word can be enough: bizarre. Hubby and I did not laugh so stupidly at this really awful movie. We looked at each other with the best "What ...?" Expressions. It is not possible to properly describe this video. Dead tomatoes were fun, but it's just sick. What kind of mind produces such images and then places them in the movie so that others can see them? What kind of mind does the innocent children cover in this strange, strange film and then pack them as if they were suitable for children? Parents, whatever you do, if your child still believes in Santa Claus, do not let him see this movie. Preteens can watch this - probably from "What ...?" Expressions on their faces. If you decide to make this movie to others, you may want to give it to the eggnog. <br /> <br /> It's probably probably the worst movie ever made.
