Some things require clarification. The image of Mark Ferris is not Mark Ferris, who played in this film. I know this because he was my father. Delete this photo. The writer was also Mark Ferris, at least one of them. I tried to find a copy or a way to watch the movie again. Years have passed and if someone can show me the direction of obtaining a copy, it would be great. The film was not so bad, and the attempt to compare it to today's world of Star Wars and other technologically advanced science-fiction movies is futile. If you look at it, just enjoy the gloom and humor. Free yourself from being a movie snob and enjoy less creative and innovative videos.
