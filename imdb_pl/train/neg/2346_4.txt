I saw this movie for the first time in the TCM "Essentials" series. The eye of the stereotype of the seer has never been more apropos. This viewer saw little value in it. I was surprised by the infinite attraction that Lucy (Lauren Bacall) possessed. It is true that Mrs. Bacall was a beautiful woman, but in this film her character is more murky than attractive. I think people like Mitch Wayne and Kyle Hadley would be more likely to ignore Lucy than they would fall into her immediate infatuation. In defense of Bacalla this film was made during the last illness of Humphrey Bogart, and the burden of his deteriorating health could have influenced its results. Of course, part of this vanity on the part of Lucy was to contrast her with the bizarre Marylee, played on the hand and outside by Dorothy Malone. The scene in which she engages in a wildly sensual dance, while her father barely climbs the stairs to a fatal heart attack, is the best scene in the movie. Malone's spectacle outshines the rest, although Jasper Hadley's fatigue by the disappointing behavior of his two children was brilliantly portrayed by Robert Keith. Generally, however, I must say that I am not a fan of melodrama. Comic characters' behavior makes the story too unbelievable for my tastes.
