This is what the title should look like. <br /> <br /> This film combines weapons, explosives and mindless killing to make one flap of an action movie. Let me point out a series of questions: give a type answer. <br /> <br /> What's happening in the movie? People are dying. <br /> <br /> Is that correct? Yes. <br /> <br /> What is the story about? What thread? <br /> <br /> What is the meaning of the movie? The only solution is killing. <br /> <br /> What are the characters? Extremely defective and contradictory to your own personality. <br /> <br /> Is there anything good about this movie? Yes. I'm sure that they used some nice Panavision cameras during filming. <br /> <br /> If you like continuous killing and greed, watch the movie. If you happen to be repulsed by such a low standard "entertainment" then "Made Men" is not for you. <br /> <br /> In summary, the story stinks, the characters are not worth their time, the story is completely resilient and nothing fits together. <br /> <br /> This proves one thing: the actors, directors and whoever helped in making this movie are definitely not "Made."
