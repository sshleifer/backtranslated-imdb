Pretty average scifi movie. The plot was more or less obvious from the very beginning. Although the acting was quite good, writing seemed very old-fashioned, using ideas taken from many films. <br /> <br /> The basic story: Scientists working on a space research platform save a warrior from hitting the red dwarf that orbited. There are stasis capsules on board, which are accidentally broken at this point. After 2 or 3 minutes of waking a man in a capsule, you realize that he is a complete madman. Something that completely escapes the 3-man crew of the research ship ... <br /> <br /> Then becomes a rip off any other movie involving a psychotic madman terrorizing innocent victims, generally I think Speed ​​2 was a better exploration of a topic that I did not consider a good movie too. <br /> <br /> This is not a good movie, take Aliens and watch it again. <br /> <br />
