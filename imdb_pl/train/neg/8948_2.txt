"Ninteen Eighty-Four" is a film about a futuristic society in which the government controls everything and nobody can be trusted. It's a very dark movie that will not make you feel good with yourself. It's about the romance that takes place in this society, about the betrayal of lovers and about the fact that human nature is self-centered. The film has some very good ideas and is good at presenting this society with dark tones in colors (contrasting with happiness and bright colors in a dream) and a general sense of loneliness through objects, people and places. However, despite the cunning of this film in the film, the film was very slow and it seemed that it did not come up with an idea. He seemed to spend too much time on cleverness instead of telling a story.
