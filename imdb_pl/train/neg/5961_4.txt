It was all over with 88 slasherami, so the time has come for the shoddy releases of these older films. The Brain is well done, the script reminded me of the Videodrome, but then in a trashy way, as was said before. Acting can go through this. But it's the effects that make you laugh, the so-called brain is really a turkey, and blood is never shown. The opening sequence is what makes this movie worth watching, the hallucinations are really nicely done and reminded me of Nightmare on Elm Street, remember that the phone is coming alive ... Some of how you watch this movie while waiting what happens next. It is visible to all freaks, because there is no blood in it and, as has been said, there is no blood, but there is nudity for perverts. I've seen movies worse than this, I regret they did not do it more bloody ...
