It is true that some fans of Peter Sellers' work may be disappointed with this last venture. But certainly every fan of the Sellers will find delight in all their films, simply because of the huge talent of the man. and The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu is certainly no exception. Unfortunately, it would turn out that it was the last movie of the Sellers (it was even released after his death), but it is still nice to see how he managed to retain his irreplaceable talent until his untimely death. And not only do we get one Seller, but we get to it because the Sellers play not only the title role, but also his nemesis, equally bizarre Nayland Smith, a detective hunting a crazy 168-year-old Fu. The story is as bizarre as we follow Fu's outrageous antics to make his eternal elixir, as well as Nayland and his team of collaborators trying to prevent him. As with all Major Sellers' films, the film is guaranteed impeccable performance, as well as many celebrity colleagues - David Tomlinson, Sid Caesar, John Le Mesurier, Clive Dunn and Helen Mirren. little. It is also nice to see how Pink Panther is the steadfast Burt Kwook (Cato) enjoying the episode with the Sellers - although they play the same role, but they are still nice. The story is really quite funny, as are many involved characters who classify it as a film heavily influenced by Goon. And although he never reaches the height of Goon's comedy, there are lots of funny jokes that seem to show the right direction. The film was not commercially successful after the first release due to the mourning of the whole world after the death of the Sellers (the film was released less than 3 weeks later) and there is always such a sad thought in the depths of his mind when he watches that it is the Seller's last film. This is not a great movie - it is often slow, too absurd, and sometimes the jokes are not there - but they are still nice - if only to get another best result from Peter Sellers.
