Now I can see clearly why Robin Hood fell quickly. The first episode is probably the worst that the BBC ever issued. Opening scenes were as intense, meaningful and intelligent as the fight of two monkeys, Robin Hood was not character, and the sword fight was just ridiculous. The worst part of the episode was Robin Hood snogging cows clothed in makeup at the beginning of the episode - how many people wore an eyeliner in the 12th century? No one. The series could have been drastically improved since then, but this first episode quickly lifted the hopes of people and is in fact a stack of cr * p. The great hero of England was disgraced. <br /> <br /> "Do you tolerate this?" Certainly not, unless the BBC starts to understand what a wise investment is. 3/10
