Oh, man, it's amazing how someone can say that global warming is science, well, this elitist nonsense now replaces the science of eugenics! Al Gore is trying to make this problem complicated, although you only need common sense to see that it's all a big scam of a man with his own program to make money! <br /> <br /> How did scientists estimate the historical temperature of this planet? Estimating the activity of sunspots. Has anyone ever asked if this method is accurate? No, not even Gore! So how the hell would it be accurate to predict the future temperature with sunspot activity if it was so accurate in the past? According to the activity of sunspots, today's temperature is perfectly consistent with what it should be. How does the temperature in the entire universe increase (relatively) equal on Earth? Do our SUVs increase Jupiter's temperature? <br /> <br /> Use common sense! You do not have to be a rocket scientist to find out that it can only be HOAX. Please, examine it myself. What will Al Gore and his elite friends like Rothschild (the banking family that organized the live event) gain from it? The new global bank will be based on carbon credits, that is, tax on everything that causes CO2 to be omitted, and it is easier to avoid these taxes if people are enticed to think that it is saving the world when it's only about money, centralized control and greater power of elite bankers. Al Gore even has a company selling carbon credits! Is it not noble to pay coal loans voluntarily to save the world, especially if it goes to your own business? <br /> <br /> I do not want you to believe me blindly, please, do your own research and use your own sanity, and I'm sure you will come to the right conclusion!
