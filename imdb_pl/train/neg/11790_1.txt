Deep SH .. is more similar! The eel is simply drawn in the film. Think "The Amazing Mr. Limpet" meets with "Lewiatan". Very tacky. <br /> <br /> No character development or relationship. The so-called "romantic" scenes are very banal and predictable. An interesting idea, but a bad script and special effects LOUSY make it absolutely unavoidable!
