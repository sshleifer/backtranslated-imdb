I never heard about it before it appeared on cable TV. This is very typical for science fiction from the late 1950s: sober, depressing and not much paranoid! Despite the equally typical inclusion of a romantic couple, the film is largely in the documentary style - which can be a cheap way to leave a large part of narrative exposure and an excuse to put as much film as humanly possible for what is undoubtedly an extremely low budget ! Although this is not in itself uninteresting (later the angle of the apocalypse-renegade projectile was used, with much greater confidence, both for DR. STRANGELOVE [1964] and FAIL-SAFE [1964]) and fortunately short, the film approach to his subject comes with a lot of unintentional laughter - especially in scenes related to the imminent delivery and gang of unconscious juvenile delinquents!
