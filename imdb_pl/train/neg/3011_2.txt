I was very excited to see this movie, expecting a visual tour about the relationship of artistic beauty and nature, containing types of wisdom, such as "Rivers and Tides". However, I did not receive it. Instead, I get a little inspiring film about how the human industry is bad for nature. Which is definitely quite an unconventional claim. <br /> <br /> The photographer seems to contradict the aesthetic values ​​of his paintings and the alleged "ethical" duty he has towards workers sometimes populating images, on the outskirts. And to be honest, the images were generally not that impressive. And according to this "artistic" scale is the basis of what makes something beautiful. <br /> <br /> Stupid movie in every respect. For people who would like to feel better about their environmental awareness ... but not for anyone who would like to think about the complexity of the surrounding problems.
