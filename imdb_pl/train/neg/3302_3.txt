Swedish action movies have evolved in the past few years into something that imitates American hard-action films such as "Heat" but with a low budget. This movie complies with the recommendations of "Noll Tolerans" and "Livvakterna". However, it is obvious that they are trying too hard to create a cool and difficult movie. <br /> <br /> History has already been seen before, dialogue is artificial and acting very weak, especially from the main actress. The film attempts to paint a picture of boiled military robbers with no remorse and a female researcher who completely lost her with the problems of the past, but at the same time behaves completely rationally. This does not work very well. <br /> <br /> The style of photos in a bluish shade does not seem fresh, and in this picture is not even good. Only a few scenes look really good. In addition, the sound is rather strange and sounds like many actual dialogues were recorded later. <br /> <br /> The main feature of this movie is Stefan Sauk, although he does not make a convincing portrait of the SWAT team leader, he has some really fun lines. Also, the music is quite good.
