Nothing can prepare you for another bad bimbo tour! This time it brings you the inevitable Fred Olen Ray! When it comes to operating movies, this one will not click! As science fiction, this is unoriginal! All we see is an ugly female android dressed in a bikini to destroy the Earth, and showing everything that can hardly be resisted! Give me a break to start !!! If this type of entertainment is your thing, why not vacuum the old magical bathing suits from the attic into a change ?! It would be much better if it did not set the sleaze at a very high level, but it still would not make it great. I would like to point out another film entitled THE ASSAULT (1996) by Jim Wynorski, which resembles ALIENATOR's identity. It shows why the first-person "femme fatale" action movies do not translate well into America. I'm sorry, guys!
