I must say that I hated this movie. I do not like to say that because Gerard Butler is in it. About half an hour of boring conversation, I apologize to everyone who really cares about the story, I began to quickly send Gerry's scenes. I really do not know the end, I was bored with it. If Gerry is not there, I probably did one of two things: I fell asleep or turned him off, but Gerry is the bright light of this movie, like most of her earlier films. If you're a fan of Gerry, do not worry, it's as charming and precious as ever, but if you really want to watch the story, good luck because you'll need it, either it or a lot of coffee or soda, so you do not sleep! <br /> <br /> 4/10 ... and that's only because the casting director felt that he had put Gerry in this movie, though they had no idea how to spell his name!
