Ugh! Where to start ... first of all, Campbell Scott's continued anxiety is after a while a real surprise (a very brief moment) when he internalizes his growing anguish, curiosity and anger. Only we do not care! These characters presented by the scriptwriter and director are completely unacceptable, this is the key. They did not give us anything that would make us care for whether they are adulterers and whether they are still in love with each other. When Scott silently tells his wife: "I can kill you" in front of three daughters at the table, after the shock of his egotistical bad time is over, I almost regret he did not - and then did the same with the satisfied wisecracking apparition of Denis Leary before it is pulled out of the looney bin. A total waste of time and perhaps - perhaps only - resources.
