I really liked this program, a long time ago. That is, until I realized all the flaws. It's so unrealistic. I know it's fiction, but it's not even the smallest. Because. ** Spoilers in front of people ... ** Should we really believe that a kid like Yugi would come from the pharaoh of ancient Egypt? Come on! He is the biggest sucker on the Earth's surface. And what about the pharaoh's hair (a.k.a. Atem and / or Yami)? Recently I checked that the pharaohs were shaved (except for a small hair at the top of their head) and wore fancy hats. <br /> <br /> And should we be convinced that a bad, rich boy, a genius, named Seto Kaiba, can legally run a successful business, and at the same time have time to go to a tacky little school such as "Domino" High "? Puh-Leeza! First of all, he would have to be legally an adult to run a business. And that would not make him much of a boyish genius, because he would be the only adult in his class. And secondly, why would he attend a school like "Domino High" when his business clearly brought him success so he could attend an elaborate snobbish academy? Plus, side stories with his younger brother are so disgusting and bad. Every time you turn around, this kid was kidnapped by the bandits. * yawning * Nothing new, nothing new. <br /> <br /> Joey is a poor kid who lives with a homeless father. He says Joey earns all the money to attend his school because his father is an alcoholic, but you've never seen Joey do something reminiscent of work. He does not even mention work. And his sister Serenity is a complete moron. Why would she choose a snob like Duke (who dressed his brother in a dog costume and publicly humiliated him on television) for a nice guy like Tristan? Is she really that unconscious? Different characters throughout the performance, possessed by demonic forces, stolen by demonic forces and falling victim to mental illness. (Oh, it's safe for kids, NO.) Tea is a typical type of girl in the neighborhood whose sole purpose is to be a Yugi girl / Yami. And although she has some nice points for her, she just does not have enough time to shine as the main character. <br /> <br /> Animation is simply awful. All characters look sick and anorexic. Perspectives are horrible (especially when they are close-ups of someone's hand), and the colors look good, but not stellar. <br /> <br /> But the worst hole in the series was that Yami says his Millennium Puzzles can send souls back to their bodies. If that was the case, why did not he save Yugi's grandfather when Pegasus stole his soul and saved himself the trouble of recovering him? <br /> <br /> It is actually commercial for yourself. The only plus of this is "Yu-Gi-Oh: The Abridged Series" by LittleKuriboh. <br /> <br /> Please. Do something more valuable. I like to watch the Abridged version. <br /> <br /> 1/10
