I watched the movie and I was scared, saying at least that the movie did not communicate with me as an audience. Language would embarrass street loafers. <br /> <br /> Plot; the father, forcing any son to marry, seems to be strained. <br /> <br /> Grandma's idea, who asks his big kid for the corruption of the enemy, will only attract poor attention. <br /> <br /> ... and I've been waiting for the whole movie to laugh, and laugh that I've wasted 3 hours on my stupidity to convince myself that the movie is not even worth the first look. <br /> <br /> I hope it will save you time!
