This performance was ridiculously bad. Writing sucked, dialogue sucked. The guy who played Craig could not get out of the paper bag. Being on a Thursday evening, it was definitely great to watch with some beers. Cool music, bad acting, bad writing, all together for my entertainment. <br /> <br /> It was a drama / unintentional comedy. I do not care what happened to any character, they were all boring and stupid. The first five episodes were the worst, because they could not reveal who the victim was, they had to write a dialog box around him that was terrible. I mean, praise at the funeral was ridiculous. Actually, all the scenes that took place in the present were completely horrible. <br /> <br /> So, let's review. Everything that is happening in the present time is useless. The retrospective scenes, Craig's only writing, dialogue and action were drawn. Music ruled, however.
