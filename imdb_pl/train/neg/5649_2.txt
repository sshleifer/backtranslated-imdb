I do not think it was so bad in the program in the right conditions. I tolerated the first season. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is a program about lawyers who are not lawyers. Let God not go to law school based on these programs, which I heard about when I watched several interviews with the show. It just choked me a bit. <br /> <br /> Besides, Spader and Shatner, who are supposed to be the stars of the show, are the most annoying. Although it may be a compliment in some situations, it certainly is not here. Their constant harassment of women in the series is initially fun. But because that's what they are doing literally all the time, I realized that it's just as deep as it will happen. An attempt to intertwine with serious, dramatic and even tearful moments in the middle of this ridicule from a real show can not compensate for the progressive loss of interest that I am experiencing when trying to enjoy the show. <br /> <br /> The extravagant and unjustified "public service announcements" of Alan Shore, in which he expresses his opinions, do not impress. Denny Crane is just annoying. I was embarrassed for him and for screenwriters on Crane's speech series in colonial dress. <br /> <br /> I give two stars, because there are moments in which I thought that the series's attempts to cope with some of today's problems was done with concern. <br /> <br /> I think the authors of the show realized that sexual harassment of Denny and Alan was exaggerated, even for those who invited them from the beginning. The point is that I do not care if the sexual harassment treatment in the show is well done, but I just felt that the writer insulted me with artificial sexual snorting throughout the show in the hope that my libido would stop me coming back for more. I am no longer a teenager and I think that this concert is promising if its purpose was not to satisfy the lowest common denominator to get ratings. <br /> <br /> Of course, I write this after I realized that it really will not be much better than this. It is a pity, because it is one of those programs that I would like to love.
