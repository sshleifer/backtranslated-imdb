If the scale was negative, I would be happier. Seeing Sushmity Sen was nice, and Nisha Kothari has a bright future, but the producer and director have ruined the joy of this story. The choice of angles, the choice of lighting and everything that distracted from trying to memorize history. Oh, if these songs and dances did not make you tear off your head first. The film could be made twice for 1.25 hours and was quite good, a bit like "Seven samurai", but the director and writer did not go in that direction, even if the "locals" finally find their spine and want to help. This film ends in failure on many levels: editing, writing, photo angles, style, lighting, scenario - name every aspect of the film - was BAD - probably the food from the catering company was bad too. I have never seen Indian films (Bollywood) in 6 years, I've seen something so badly done.
