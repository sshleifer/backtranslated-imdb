I would give this film zero to ten, but I will give it two. The first reason is that Shah Rukh Khan appears in the film, which is not the reason. The last point is that Rani appears in this movie and makes a smirk with Kamal. I Love Rani very much and I have the respect that she is a great actress. That's why I did not like the movie kissing Kamal, but it's not a big deal. Anyway, enough scenes from the bedroom, which made the movie noticeable, lets you talk about the film properly. Whether it's good or bad, I think it's a complete movie that yawned me. I am a fantastic critic, you can see my other over 250 reviews by clicking on my name, I have great taste. The movie is not funny, it's one thing, and if it's going to be a hard slam in the cinema, why is there no morale in this movie. This is a biased movie that is not a real story and it stinks. Watching Kamal kiss those actresses makes me sick.
