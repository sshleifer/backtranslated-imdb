What a disappointment! I hated the mummy, but it was even worse! It was very tiring and unbelievable, and at some point I always sighed and yawned. I can not believe that people really liked this movie. The role of Nicholas Cage was not very convincing. The whole film was like a great tour of America's most sought after buildings. The endless stream of tips and combinations was not very convincing either. I stopped paying attention for about 30 minutes. What was supposed to be a happy night became a total disappointment. What a drag ... I guess I just saw too many movies to enjoy the national treasure.
