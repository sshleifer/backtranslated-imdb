I saw the film in its entirety in the sixties and seventies, yes, it is terrible and can be the progenitor of the series of "Faces of Death" popular in the 80's and 90's. Considering the state of so-called "driver education", this should be required for everyone to prepare for driving lessons. When you see a violent death in all its monstrosity and terror, certainly (if you have any sensitivity at all) you will see the real perspective of the duties required for safe driving, which one moment can do carelessness or inattention. I worked at Bell Telephone in the '70s and' 80s and at one point I was assigned to run a security class. I found this movie in the company's library, I showed it at the session, many people got sick physically and had to leave the room! Unbelievably, most of them said later: "I never knew that a car accident could be so terrible!" This film, and another, "RED ASPHALT", is certainly the reality in the most graphical form. I will never forget it, it's a pity that I could not find a copy when my children attended the "driver's school" in high school!
