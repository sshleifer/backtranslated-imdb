Before watching the show, I heard that it was great and very interesting in terms of aesthetics. What a scam, the scripts are so stupid that I'm pretty sure that the authors are sons and grandchildren of the Scoobidoo writers. And what about SFX and colors, they are so extreme that it is painful to watch, the colors are not saturated, they are saturated, just as the scripts are overwritten and the show is overrated. This performance is like a bad cake in which the child would put only sugar and butter, thinking that because these ingredients are the best, they are enough. Unfortunately, for this concert, the only two components of this series are, in the end, emptiness and total lack of credibility.
