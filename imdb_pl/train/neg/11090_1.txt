This movie looks like it was created for television. For years I've been waiting for a movie about Ruby Carter, because I loved watching him in an old MSG, and watching this movie was very disappointing. I have a lot of respect for Mr. Washington, but he was terrible and boring. There is nothing good to say about this movie, except that I liked the song.
