I'm surprised everyone (even critics) seems to think it's a good movie. It was the most stereotypical thriller I've ever seen. We have a "bad guy" who wants to force a "good guy" (or a girl in this case) to do something or face the consequences. The "good girl" in this movie must use his skills and skills to defeat the "evil guy" and save the day and his loved ones. Using charisma, courage and even luck to save the day. <br /> <br /> Where to start? Well, a young woman named Lisa Reisert meets a young man named Jackson Rippner (pretty name) at the airport. One coincidence leads to the next and soon it seems that fate brings these two people together. Sharing drinks, sitting side by side, seemingly getting along in every way ... Is there anything more in this strangeness? Can these two be designed for themselves? Does "fate" have a reason for their strange and accidental meeting? <br /> <br /> Well, as it turns out, unfortunately. Jackson needs Lisa to help him kill the Internal Security Director, moving him from one room to another so that his people can attack him. Oh, if she does not do it, her father is dead. Although we never know the exact reasons why and who really is behind this madness, Jackson explains how it will happen and why Lisa's help lies in him. his evil plans with her wisdom and thus drive him into the neck, make him stumble over chairs and hit him with a hockey stick. Oh, and before he leads him in a wild pursuit through the airport in Miami, where he is handed over after 911 and steals a car, which is later used to escape a man who was ordered to kill her father. <br /> <br /> Yes, right. <br /> <br /> Above all, it's strange that a man like Jackson who can get a high-tech weapon needs the help of a hotel manager. Could not he just drop bombs into the building? Would not that make him safer for him and his team, bypassing third parties? And why do characters such as Jackson explain everything they do to someone they threaten? Is not it easier for them to be stopped by the same people? <br /> <br /> The actors did what they could, taking into account the film they received. Racheal McAdams and Cillian Murphy are still the actors to pay attention to. In addition, I think that Jayma Mays (who played "sympathetic" Cynthia) will be someone we see more. It is a pity that everyone got stuck with it. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
