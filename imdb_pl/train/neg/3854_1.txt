Julia Stiles is a talented young actress who, thanks to the leadership of a reputable agent, has great potential. Of course, the person who introduced her into this travesty is not someone who cares about her career. I was sitting in the theater surrounded by teenagers who left the crowds to find a different movie, to think about who thought this movie would appeal to everyone. It was poorly written, the casting director could only put one or two minutes of effort into the characters, and the director obviously did not care.
