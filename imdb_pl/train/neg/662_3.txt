and rent a GOOD horror movie. It is as if the writer had never seen a horror before and did not realize that every piece he wrote was stereotyped and trite, and he was parodied to perfection in films such as "Scream" and "Scary Movie". <br /> <br /> Between the terrifying beats is the most BANAL and BORING dialogue ever written. Stupid "we are going to the ball". I wanted to tear my ears away. Honestly, "The Hills" has a better dialog. <br /> <br /> There really was no need to create this movie. The leading lady is uninteresting, and I kept thinking, "She? Really? Is the guy obsessed with her? Really? "<br /> <br /> All characters act stupidly, including the police. (Cover the place in teams of 2! Front and back! Not one sleeping cop sitting in the car with the window down, just waiting for his throat to slash.) <br /> <br /> The serial killer simply swans murdering everyone you want without the slightest problem. No resistance from the victims (or door). Nobody has any protection or the slightest idea how to fight (or pass the lock of a hotel room door). People are like sheep with mental retardation. <br /> <br /> By the way, if you're a fan of gore, you'll be disappointed too. All killing is kept off the screen and is - ahem - tastefully done. (So ​​boo hoo for you!) <br /> <br /> None of the killings is the least interesting. Most of the time, they happen when we learn about it. <br /> <br /> The only missing stereotype was a cat that always appears in this kind of movie. "Oh, honey! You scared me! I thought you were a killer - AIIEEEE! "<br /> <br /> And then at the end, when the killer has time to die - let's say it is the easiest and most obvious choice. Snore. <br /> <br /> The audience always mocked and returned to the screen. It was too stupid to believe and it was not terrifying enough. Do not encourage this kind of lazy filming. <br /> <br /> (And by the way - there is no coronation of the king of the ball or the queen, no tiara, no bucket of blood.) <br> <br /> So save money and rent "Carrie" or "Friday the 13th "or" Halloween "or" Scream "or" Scary Movie "(any of them) to get a good fear of the original twists.
