I will start with good points. The film was only 86 minutes long and some were so bad that it was fun. Now for low points. My first warning sign came with the actual "warning" on the film. When it began, the following "warning" appeared: "The movie you will see contains graphic and disturbing images. Because, contrary to popular belief, killing is neither pleasant, nor beautiful, nor romantic. " I should have saved 86 minutes and then turn it off. The first words of the film were: "I'm in a glue factory." It was some guy talking on the phone and referring to the nursing home as a glue factory. I do not know why. The basis of the film is that some kid is obsessed with the Zodiac Assassin and begins to imitate him. The budget of the film was at least 50 bucks and they had to use the cheapest cameras they could find. Acting was worse than reading from the script. It looks like that. The script was awful, and the big "turn of the action" was that the guy who wrote the biography of Zodiac Killer was actually Zodiac Killer. Of course, they tried to subtly show it, but within the first 10 minutes it became completely obvious. Without the more painful details of the plot, here are some awful movie events. They try to make the Zodiac Assassin compare to the "one army" because the soldiers are really murderers. Then they tried to try Satanic Worship, showing several guys in black hoods at the meeting. A great "computer hacker" was able to get the address of this kid when someone gave him the child's name and phone number. For some reason, he had to break into the FBI to get someone. I'm not sure why he just did not look for him in the phone book or use whitepages.com. There was also a random allusion to September 11 for no reason. I also learned that no matter where you get shot, the blood will come out of your mouth in a few seconds. <br /> <br /> So if you like really bad acting, scripts below par, bad camera action and obvious thread, you'll love Zodiac Killer!
