She was catapulted from 13 to 30, with magical dust, courtesy of 13-year-old Matt, but none of this is done, except for an unexplained device. New York, especially Central Park, but also any other part of the place included in the movie, seems hopeful and easily bearable, and besides Lucy there is no villain in Jenny's adult life, and even Lucy is not filled as monstrous, only as nasty 13- he was 17 years more devious. Chris, a former Jenny's longing boy, is now a sober taxi driver and you've seen enough movies to know that Matt will play the lead role in Jenny's future. You do not know what may interrupt it before it is finally achieved, although I am here to whisper in my ear, so to speak, that the device is not unique. In fact, this is not just a variation on the theme of "Big" Tom Hanks, though it is nowhere near as good, but it is also a version closely related to the book of this subset of Cinderella's history.
