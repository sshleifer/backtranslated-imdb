For those who are looking for the continuation of the great South African miniseries of the 1980s, this is not it. Nor is it a historical drama. It is a rather grim little fantasy that has nothing to do with historical Shaka, but only uses his name to give a certain character to Sinclair's idiotic story of an African superhero who is a combination of Jesus, Lincoln, Superman and Nelson Mandela. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, there are some laughter-loud moments, like when Shaka breaks the cross to which he is chained and kicks some serious butt of a slave. You know how Jesus would do it if he was not such a wimp. <br /> <br /> It's true, I only saw the 98-minute version, but I can not imagine that twice as much of this shit would be better. <br /> <br /> And what is Mungo's name ?!
