This movement is slow, crushing, cold, dark and without conspiracy or hope. The result is a tried and true European formula that they love to subsidize, which has never been seen, but which critics regard as "an important point". <br /> <br /> The movie is valuable, if not more than showing a huge difference in thinking between Americans and Europeans about employment. In this film, men continue to cherish their wounds from years ago and feel that it is the government's duty to provide them with work. While in the US we know that we have to go out and create value for someone. <br /> <br /> Spain has never looked so backward!
