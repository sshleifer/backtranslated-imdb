Ed Wood is overshadowed and becomes Orson Wells. This movie is fantastic. Vampire witches who fight in terribly choreographic scenes and dialogues that can break the ribs of laughter. Plan 9 From OUterSpace does not stand a chance. Described by the writer and psyche of Stephen Armourae at the Vampire Forum as a masterpiece - it comes from England and is sarcastic. <br /> <br /> He has Stephanie Beaton, and the producers know what will save them from bankruptcy, repeatedly using them. Although it leaves me cold because it looks more like an undead than all Devil breeders. And Eileen Daly is just a lower rate for Elvira. The whole thing is badly done. <br /> <br /> But watch out for the script
