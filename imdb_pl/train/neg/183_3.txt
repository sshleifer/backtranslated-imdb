It is a western action. James Steart leads a star cast in the picturesque north-west coast, which is shot in great splendor. The scenery and costumes are great. There is action and adventure. Stewart plays a well-off cattleman who threatens the government in old Nothwest. <br /> <br /> The main drawback is the stereotypical cynic that Hollywood has always become a hero. Even when the movie was made, the cynic was a stereotypical hero, and the one who depicts Stewart has really few favors of savers. He is kind to his two partners, and this gives him an additional dimension of credibility and sympathy. <br /> <br /> However, it is so careless for everyone else, it's hard to really care for him or accept him. He is very similar to the one-dimensional spaghetti of western heroes (not so bad). <br /> <br /> However, smaller characters are quite pleasant. Walter Brennan, Royal Dano, Harry Morgan and others make it worth watching.
