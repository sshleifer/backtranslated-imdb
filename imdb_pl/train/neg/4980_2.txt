I just read the review defending this video because it had a low budget, now my approach to things. <br /> <br /> CGI monsters were well animated, but they were implemented in the worst possible way. The battle scenes were not even a fight, it was just one shot of the actor, and then one shot of the monster with very large interaction. When the monster began to interact, it looked just like in a pro paint shop. In my opinion, if you have a low budget, you should use models and dolls. They may not look so fancy, but at least they interact, just look at Peter Jackson's early films. <br /> <br /> When it comes to acting, Beowulf did the descent job, but the rest of the cast either did not try, or forgot where. <br /> <br /> The script seemed confused to me. In an instant they will speak as if it was a modern day, and the next will be the Shakespeare drama club. I am not saying that everything should be "yes" and "that it is", but you need to find a coherent balance so that the lines sound as if they were from the same person. <br /> <br /> I noticed one part at the beginning, when Beowulf quoted an old testament that would have been found had he not spent the rest of the films talking about gods and signs. <br /> <br /> In short, this film is very slightly polished turd, but still a bend.
