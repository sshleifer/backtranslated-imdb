Sure, if you ask a mother who is the most beautiful child in the world, she will tell you that her son is the most wonderful child in the world. She is right, at least in her own world. <br /> <br /> The movie producers were Biggie's mother and his good friend Puffy. Oh, do I have to say more? I will divide it into those who do not want to do simple deduction. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was fake. Maybe you just put some MTV biggie movies on and you called it a movie. <br /> <br /> Beautiful Angela Bassett played Biggie's mother. Real in life looks like a dog. <br /> <br /> I'm just wondering why he called himself a little boy. Big body Small dick? Big lips Small sound? Big thick small eyes? Disclaimer: I am a color person. So, keep your racist attention to yourself.
