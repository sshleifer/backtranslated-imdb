I recently visited Manufactured Landscapes at the Seattle International Film Festival. The film appealed to me because I am both well-known and a fan of Burtynsky's work. Although I think that the film is doing well, I could not help feeling that it was created as a complete reflection on the subject of photography and the later popular book by Burtynsky. Of course, one of the reasons is the wide use of still images with zooming and taking photos. Although this is a good effect when it is used economically, I felt that 75% of the film is just photos from Burtynsky's book (which I already have). It's probably an exaggeration, but I felt that way. If you are the owner of a book or you know his work, you can better skip this book.
