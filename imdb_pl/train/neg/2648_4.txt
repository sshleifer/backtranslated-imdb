I just finished reading a book about the work of Anita Loos, and the photo in the TCM MacDonald magazine in her angel costume looked great (impressive wings), so I thought I would watch this movie. I've never heard of a movie before, so I did not have any assumptions in advance. I thought it started to be sweet, because Eddy as a playboy and MacDonald as a secretary he does not know. The scene in which he appears at the ball dressed up in his simple angel costume with a reluctant halo and wings that will not remain, was really endearing. I was even with a movie when Eddy goes to sleep and imagines her as a real angel. But after a while he began to fall apart for me. Eddy "sleeps" throughout the rest of the movie, so it's all a dream. Whatever happens from this moment does not matter because he just dreams. The rest were less feature and purposeless. I had to make myself stick to it. And the last number where MacDonald goes from the music number to the music number in some crazy hallucination was just weird. <br /> <br /> Did Eddy "wake up" sooner and the original story dragged on, or maybe he really married an angel, I think it would be much more interesting. I wanted to see more of her real character. <br /> <br /> There were not enough musical numbers to call it a musical. The first few songs were good, but the number of jitterbug√≥w MacDonald performs was like nails on the board. Completely wrong for her operatic voice. Still, Eddy and MacDonald can still shine, showing what real stars are.
