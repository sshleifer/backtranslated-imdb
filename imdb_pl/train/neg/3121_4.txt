This film is poor in garbage. It has a terrible taste and is impenetrable in the script, although supposedly based on real events - which adds nothing, but makes it more disappointing. The direction is not well made because the scenes and dialogue are out of place. I'm not sure what Robin Williams saw in this character or history. At the beginning, Williams is not convincing as a homosexual in breaking the relationship, nor is the relationship interesting. What's worse, his character is forced by the ugly pedophile story, which is the basis and there is no place as a fictional device. You have an older Rory Culkin tasteless, which sounds "d_ck_smker" - in a good way - which is annoying and then laughing at Williams. Finally, you have Sandra Oh as Angel's advisor and at the end of the explanation for the whole fiasco. Toni Collete's character is simply annoying, and her sixth sensual sense is getting worse. Very lost.
