I bought this movie because it was Shah rukh khans Debut. And I liked how he would do it. I must say that he is perfect in his role. Divya Bharathi is great in this film. Well.Alok nath was good at his role. Amrish and Mohnish also did a good job. Dalip was also good at his small role. Actors shine in the average movie. The direction is average. Editing is poor. History is boring. He tells us about Ravi a famous pop songwriter. He has many fans. One of them is Kaajal. Ravi and Kaajal fall in love and get married. Ravi is killed by his cousins. Kaajal becomes a widow. Ravis cousins. He goes to Bombay. He comes across Raja. He falls in love with him and marries. Ravi returns. History is predictable. The climax is predictable. The first half is bored. recorded by actors and music. The other half is playing. Music is catchy with nice songs. Pictures look outdated The first half, but it looks unimaginable. The pictograms of the songs are boring, except for "Sochenge Tumhe Pyar" and one rainy song. The costumes are outdated. Any way to see it only for actors and music Rating-4/10
