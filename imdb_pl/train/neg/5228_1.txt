I saw this movie that night. I can not even express how much this movie sucks. A letter, a working voice, even a claymation. Horrible, horrible, terrible. It's like watching C-Span 24 hours for comedy. It just does not work. It literally falls flat in every possible place. <br /> <br /> Also the animation of the film is of very poor quality. I know it is a movie created by one person, but to think that he could do nonsense about 97 minutes, maybe he could at least make a funny 1 second. cake for the worst movie of all time. Yikes. It really was that bad. If you're looking for a movie that will make you laugh, avoid this abomination. My advice: do not even buy or look for it. Your brain will be from you.
