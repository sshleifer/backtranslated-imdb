Performing in an unknown cast that will probably remain that way, this "movie" is another cheap movie that amazes me how it was released. I do not have a problem with horror, especially with lying cinoises, in fact they are my favorite. But when they finish THIS BAD, it really takes the monkey and no wonder that the species has such a difficult period. History is as banal and imaginative as possible with a group of people in a house in the forest cut and hacked by this zombie / ghost. This is not the story that sucks the most, its horrible game and dialouge, home directing quality and terrible soundtrack. Not to mention funny effects and unbelievably lazy movie making - these morons are outside in the bright daylight, and we are supposed to believe that it's night? What the hell was the director thinking about the movement? What, he only had one day to shoot all this? He was afraid of the dark? (It's fun to see a policeman walking in pure daylight with a torch acting like his black color) <br /> <br /> I think the positive side for actors looks like people who work in a local supermarket so at least they could get away from the movie, never noticing it. I'm sure one of the "teenagers" is playing bingo at a local pub - but she is 40-45 years old. <br /> <br /> In any case, good for laughter, but just another loss of film and time.
