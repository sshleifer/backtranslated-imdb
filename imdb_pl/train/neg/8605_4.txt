This is a slightly interesting gore fest of the late 80's, which has nasty snails with the taste of human blood. If you can avoid the ridiculousness of the whole thing, you can enjoy it a little. Acting is awful, and the plot is just to keep the film together between bloody snail attacks, but the movie is not a total waste of time. The special effects are quite good and the gore is well done. It reminded me of Blob's remake, probably because of the slimness of it all. In general, you can certainly do worse with an hour and a half, but I would not suggest watching this movie unless you have a strong stomach and you're in that kind of thing.
