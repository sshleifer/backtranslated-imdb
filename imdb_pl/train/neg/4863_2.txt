Why, oh, why the blockbusters simply do not stick to their point of sale? Everyone in the cinema, young and old, were there to see talking animals and joking, and when they did, we were all happy ... And then, as in Lost In Space, there were two deadly blows - conspiracy and fondness. Who really cared about what happened to the tiger, did Eddie Murphy make up for his daughter? Not me, that's for sure.
