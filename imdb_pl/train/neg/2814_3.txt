First watched 26.06.2001 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Tobe Hooper): A scary but sadistic (which makes sense) portrait of the relative of the Marquis De Sade, performing the same sadistic activities and enjoying the fact that his predecessor did. This movie Tobe Hooper really does not differ much from his similar in the style of Freddy Krueger movies with the same star (Freddy himself - Robert Englund) playing a double role (Marquis De Sade and his relative). It also seems that he really wants to be a Christian, but eventually he loses it to my worries, but leaves an inconsistent feeling in the film. It could be much worse if excesses were taken into account in sex and violence, but they try to keep it to a minimum, despite disgusting scenes. My last thought is why Hooper would like to make this movie. Of course, it took some time to become widespread, and then it must be advertised terribly, and Hooper's name in the title hopes to earn some money on his name and his gore. It is obvious that it did not work.
