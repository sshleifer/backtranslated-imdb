Trite, stereotypical dialogues and drafting (the same things we've seen in fantasy movies from the 1980s), hokey music and characters from painting on the numbers offend everyone, but the most die-hard fans. > <br /> What saves this film from buying rubbish is the beautiful Bakshi work ball, rotoscopy and the fact that Frank Frazetta taught animators how to draw like him. This is Frazett ... moving. Violence is spectacular, and the direction of art and animation do not resemble any other film about swords and sorcery from this period. <br /> <br /> I like to watch it with the sound off, playing the soundtrack for the first Conan movie.
