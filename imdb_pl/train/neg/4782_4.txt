1st viewed on 24/12/2009? 4 in 10 (Dir-Robert Ellis Miller): Emotional Christmas fluff that is not detailed enough to explain how the real story happened in this fact-based incident of a man who is wrongly imprisoned trying to get a job to get his family she made Christmas happen for them. Three children from the family escaped from home on a trip to Washington to enlist in the then US president Herbert Hoover. This journey includes several side stories, such as their positive encounter with the hobo and puppeteer, which makes the story reminiscent of the Disney movie "animals on the run" and does not fit here. At the end, no details were given on how the president helped the family, and in my opinion this is another starting point for the film. The film ultimately brings tears, but it takes too much time to get to it. The film should not be an original TV movie (according to IMDb), but has obvious fading that makes it look like this? so I'm not sure if their information is accurate. In summary, it is a simple movie (which could be more complex) with a happy story reminiscent of Christmas, but thoughtlessly played and devoid of content.
