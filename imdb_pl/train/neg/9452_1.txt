I could not wait to see it during production. It turned out, however, that this is the biggest profession. Far from the capricious world of Dr. Seuss. It was vulgar and unpalatable, I do not think Dr. Seuss would approve. As Grinch stole Christmas he was much better. I understand that they contained subtle jokes for adults, but my children were not caught yet. While The Cat in the Hat was shouting vulgarity, they caught a lot more than I wanted. Growing up with Dr. Seouss It really bothered me to see how this timeless classic was destroyed on the big screen. Let's see what they're doing to Horton. I hope this will do a bit of justice to Dr. Seuss.
