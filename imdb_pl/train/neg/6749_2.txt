This mess is so bad that it does not even qualify as a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Talbie Debbie Rochon is completely wasted in this film. It is not even a villain. The rest of the actors look like porn lovers, and the conspiracy is so bad that I will not even mention it. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and go to the end credits to hear the upcoming TwoMarl band performing "Better Than Sex" is a full disco song from the 80's. Nice song about Gambleing & Sex. More funny than "Bleed". Put it this way when someone has the equipment to copy movies, but decides to just record the song at the end of the movie, you really have a "BAD" movie.
