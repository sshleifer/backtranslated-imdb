The fact that this poor excuse for an amateur hourly exhibition was announced at Sundance is a perfect example of what is wrong with most independent filmmakers these days. <br /> <br /> First, there is something like the art of cinematography. Just lifting the 16 mm camera and directing it to someone who has a line is not a real movie. <br /> <br /> I think we have to consider ourselves lucky, that the director did not take the camera from someone ... <br /> <br /> Secondly, indie movies should concern real people. There is nothing real in this film. None of the characters is even human. <br /> <br /> They consider themselves the creations of the imagination of a writer who tries to impress his colleagues by showing them how "cool and nervous" they are. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but it's not good writing or good direction. <br /> <br /> We are left with the husk of a bad movie that somehow hit the Sundance. It's hard to believe that it was one of the best films sent in ... <br /> <br /> In any case, it made me lose respect for the Sundance brand.
