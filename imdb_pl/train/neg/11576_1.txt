I saw it at the famous UCSB reel festival and was * shocked * that it won the gold reel award. I was not the only one, given that the audience had mixed reactions to this song. I thought there were many other better films out there, but then I found out that the judges were deeply rooted in film theory and other nonsense. While the pictures and editing are on par with many other short films, the story is nothing more than a mere student song. It seems that "serious" student films must contain one of these categories: sex, intrapersonal struggle and possible suicide - Nick and Kate tease and embrace all three. Please, be more original! <br /> <br /> Oh, and this may be the opinion of my outsider, but the guy from montecito sounds a bit false. Is anyone like that?
