I do not know who to blame, timid writers or the unconscious director. It seemed to be one of those movies in which the stars (Angie, Charlie, Denise, Rosanna and Jon) were paid so much that there was not enough to really make a movie. It could have been very funny, but on every stage there was a curtain of shyness and even cowardice. If he got R, anyway, why the omnipresent bubble scene was recorded with a 70-year-old woman, not Angie Harmon? Why is Sheen Sleepwalk through potentially hot relationships WITH TWO MOST BEAUTIFUL AND SEXY ACTS IN THE WORLD? If only they were looking for laughter, why not take on Whoopi Goldberg and Judy Tenuta? It was so predictable that I was surprised that the director was not five years old. What a loss, not only for viewers, but also for actors.
