... but I also saw better. <br /> <br /> The story here is predictable - a film crew trying to shoot a horror movie in a place where murders took place. Three guesses what's going on. This is not a total bomb - the cast is quite good with professionals John Ireland, Faith Domergue and John Carradine, who give the best results. It is quite well made - for a low-budget film. Just do not expect nudity, swearing, blood OR gore (the film has a very mild PG rating). I have never been completely bored - I feel good during a quiet night. I saw it on video - it was a terrible print - very dark, and some scenes were invisible. Even so, I did not hate it and it has a nice ending that surprised me - basically nothing happens so far so it will catch you. Worth seeing, but only if you're a complete horror movie.
