A typical action movie of the formula: a good policeman entangles himself in a mess of crooked cops and Japanese gangsters. <br /> <br /> A good result has decent performances, a few fleeting moments that cause giggles and a few fair actions - plus the chance to watch the great Danielle Harris - who takes full advantage of his eternal slicing as a rebellious teenage daughter. <br /> <br /> ** with ****.
