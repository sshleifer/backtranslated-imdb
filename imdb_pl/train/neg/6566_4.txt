I watched this movie after the trouble of downloading it through rapidshare. And I must say that it did not deserve it. <br /> <br /> Parinda was so excited that I really could not wait to see her. <br /> <br /> Parinda is one of those movies that does not meet the standards set by other good Indian film makers, despite the great story. It was even more pathetic to know that the story itself was not original, it was loosely based on the classic "On the Waterfront". <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor was annoying, especially when he came from America. There was a lack of quality many times, except for a few intermediate scenes. <br /> <br /> Give this script to each of them - Ram Gopal Verma, Deepa Mehta, Mahesh Bhatt, Sudhir Mishra, and I'm 100 years old They will definitely make an amazing movie out of it. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying that Parinda was angry. It was not enough.
