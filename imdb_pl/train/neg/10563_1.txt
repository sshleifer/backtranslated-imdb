Time spent watching this movie wasted some time. I do not like science fiction. I do not reject any species as such, because a good job can be done in any genre. This film, however, is not a good job. I can not blame the visual effects (if they are not related to foreign makeup) and the special effects are impressive. The story was not BADA outside, for a comic book of trekking. But the visualizations of fx were, of course, where all the interests / attention / money of the creators went. The direction changed from drowsy and confused (it was not at all certain who exactly what he was doing and with whom and to whom at least one key moment). Acting was really very bad. There were no grounds for most of the lines read, in addition to the hints: "It was in this way on the site and the director told me that I should be szalony / smutny / scared / anything. Okay, so it was a SF series pilot. Since when is this the pretext for correcting the cheesy in areas that should be considered crucial for a dramatic medium, I am surprised that the pilot sold the series, or are the money in the hands of techners?
