There's something frustrating about watching a movie like 'Murder By Numers', because somewhere in the middle of the Hollywood formula is a good movie trying to jump out. However, before these loans are returned, it is not possible to save them. The whole thing is largely astounded by the "policeman's side" of this story, where Sandra Bullock and the detective from the homicide department of Ben Chaplin are confused with an awkward sexual affair, which is becoming more and more trivial, the longer the film lasts. Although Bullock is strong in his role, it is not enough to save a vague scenario and lazy pace. Ben Chaplin's talents are wasted in a forgotten role (he did much better earlier in the underrated "Birthday Girl"), and also Chris Penn, who has such a thankless role that you regret a talent like him. In any case, the plot does not play a role in this film at all. The two teenage killers played by Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt are the only real reasons to see this movie. Their talent and chemistry work quite well and they play quite well together. It is a pity they were not in a much better film. Barb Schroeder is here too safe for such an experienced filmmaker. Bottom Line: is worth the rent if you're a fan of the genre, but everyone else will live a fulfilled life without ever seeing it, except maybe on a network channel with convenient commercial breaks.
