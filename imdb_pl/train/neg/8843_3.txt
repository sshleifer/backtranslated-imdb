This movie is really scary. Unfortunately, not for reasons why filmmakers would have hoped. <br /> <br /> There is also a serial killer, but he is not terrifying either. It's just the typical dark character of the comic, the intersection of Hannibal Lecter and Freddie Kruger, although there is nothing particularly fresh about it. Incidentally, can even the worst and most criminal offenders be detained in a stressful position, on their feet, with their hands outstretched 24 hours a day, week by week? I suppose that in the world that Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay gave us, everything is possible. <br /> <br /> No, what's really scary in this movie is the main character, Danny. This unattractive young man, assisted and subordinated to the truth by some ridiculously loose security arrangements and the doctor completely inattentive to the professional ethics or confidentiality of patients, wanders into the hospital room occupied by what can be described as a highly vulnerable and vulnerable young woman and on the basis of nothing (her chronic sleep precludes the possibility of giving something like informed consent) she imagines that she has a special relationship with her. <br /> <br /> Apparently in a few days he arrogated the right to abduct her, believing (completely false, as we discovered) that he is better able to care for her than anyone else, and within a few minutes of returning to his apartment she molests her sexually (again because of her sleepiness) completely incapable of giving her consent or resistance. <br /> <br /> Our suspicions, why it feels like this connection, are confirmed quite quickly. Of course, he is more or less incapable of making mature adult friendships, let alone sexual relations, so instead he returns to the basically infantile woman who, due to her constant sleep, has a mental age corresponding to the experienced experience for only a few years. The scene in which he discovers ice cream is particularly frightening, and the timidly knowing look he gives him, when he purrs, that he will have to clean it, evokes a special thrill of terror. But again, I'm afraid, not the thrill of terror the creators counted for, but a much simpler spasm of revulsion. We all see clearly here what is at the end of our forks - this is the perfect dream of a pedophile about innocence, sexual compatibility and total dependence. Horrible, terrible, horrible. <br /> <br /> What else do we have in this muffled mash? Twisted landscapes of dreams are not as good as del Toro. The mandatory argument "You have to go to the police", in which the main character always has reason to not do it, although it is the only reasonable way of acting. The sequence of the machine, very praised in the comments here, though completely and completely pointless ("Does not fulfill any function!", How Sigourney Weaver protested in Galaxy Quest) and looked at me the way Disgusting Doctor Phibes broke into one of the Piives derivatives. <br /> <br /> Jeffrey Combs is doing everything in his power, so a star and a few more, because you have to keep lower rankings for movies that are even worse than this, and it's generally well shot and competently done.
