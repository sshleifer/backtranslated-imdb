I have not read the novel by Shirley Jackson, which I have been thinking about for some time. I'm sure it must be more frightening than this movie. I remember when I jumped once when I watched him one day, although I do not remember the scene. <br /> <br /> The special effects are great and I watched them on DVD, but I'm sure that in the theater it was an amazing view. After the first few special effects I was waiting for the development of history. <br /> <br /> I thought that this movie must be loosely based on a classic novel, so there should be a good story, but it was not. I was pushed to the stage when I looked at the wonderful character of Catherine Zeta-Jones throughout the movie, mainly because there was nothing more to watch. Lili Talor was such a sucking character. I did not like her one thing, something about crying people. Besides, the guy in this movie reminded me of the cartoon Dudley DoRight with his voice and face. I could not refer to the character at all. Quigon, ahem Liam Neeson did an admirable job trying to get through this movie with some kind of acting. <br /> <br /> Half to three-quarters of the way I die to see the camp on Friday 13 or Shout the Queenish movie! At least there is some kind of entertainment. If there is no story there, at least it is filled with bloody deaths or attractive women. It had nothing. <br /> <br />
