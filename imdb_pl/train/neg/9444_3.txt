There is only one thing I will say about the cat in a hat ... as a children's film and a good comedy movie that sucks ... I lost the orientation of how many terrible jokes in the movie that not only sucked, but were indistinctly accurate children. By the way, the way the cat in the hat spoke was annoying ... about the story I totally forgot about. Who cares, sucked. I'm not sure why Mike Myers joined the band, but I think the writers were trying to make it sound like Austin's power without talking about swinger, and it did a great deal - but what was annoying. I do not see - it belongs to the bottom 100 .............................. jokes are so uninteresting that it's fun
