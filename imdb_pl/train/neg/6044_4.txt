A well-knit entry in the genre of serial killers, which unfortunately plunges in his own pretentiousness, is really satisfying. Willem Dafoe is excellent as a New York detective who is trying to track down what seems to be a follower using the same renaissance killing techniques used in a series of murders that he resolved many years earlier. Scott Speedman is a younger partner of Dafoe and has quite a good chemistry (at least for a while). Other characters appear to conveniently connect two issues. Clea Duval is a friend of an earlier victim, and Peter Stormare is some kind of art broker / mentor for Dafoe ... it is a bit difficult to do, although Stormare is never boring. The ending of the film is particularly disappointing. Look at Deborah Harry as less than the upcoming neighbor Dafoe.
