I understand that this movie is intended for children and as a parent I have sat in many films that are not particularly interesting to me, but from a constructive point of view I can appreciate the way in which they are perceived by my children. Parents should be encouraged to take part in their children's activities and monitor the quality of entertainment they see, so there should be something that appeals to adult audiences at a certain level, even in children's films. Disney has always understood this, which is why it is so difficult to understand how it is possible that such a complete piece of dreka will bear their name. <br /> <br /> Technically, sound editing is awful, and all dialogues sound more than well-known and unnatural. Personally, I hate it, but it was doubly terrible, considering that the window itself seemed to have been written by a 12-year-old in a school project. Acting reminded me of school art and none of the actors had any emotions in their voices. Fortunately, it was a very short movie. <br /> <br /> Now, before I go out like a video geek measuring a movie for children with an adult bat, one thing that can save even the worst movie for children is positive news. It is far from me to determine how a message must be delivered as long as the message is correct. Let's go through this video to see what messages are being passed: <br /> <br /> If you get lost, do not worry, you'll inevitably find your way home. <br /> <br /> Approach wild animals without fear. <br /> <br /> You can win any contest just because you "know" you. <br /> <br /> and my favorite, last message left in the movie: <br /> <br /> It's okay to disobey the authorities and do what you think is right.
