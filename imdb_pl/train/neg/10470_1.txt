What else to say? <br /> <br /> I have read all the reviews here and most of them are in place. . However, one person even went so far as to call this movie evil and that Satan tainted him (or something similar). Evil?! Wow, what a shock. . I mean, TBN essentially made this movie. Open your eyes, please. <br /> <br /> In any case, it was the lowest class of propaganda nonsense that has appeared for years. <br /> <br /> The most frightening thing about Omega Code is how much money they spent to do it. If this movie can be done, there are no restrictions, so we have no choice but to prepare for "Yentl 2" and "Ernest loses Omega Codes". <br /> <br /> For those of you who are in biblical stories, the new Dogma movie will be picked up where the Omega Code never began.
