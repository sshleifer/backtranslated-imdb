this movie, I will not call it a "film", basically did not concern anything and acted mainly for the popular acts of that time. yes, the war was in full swing (the word game was intended), and this movie gave the soldiers and our viewers a feast. <br /> <br /> but let's have something with a little substance. <br /> <br /> I loved seeing young Buddy Rich on the drums. the music was good all the time. <br /> <br /> but one episode after another is rapidly aging. <br /> <br /> I did not even recognize Zero Mostel! so if you're one of the "biggest generation" they say, you'll love this ... <br /> <br /> movie.
