Bonfires of the Vanities is a floppy film. I do not remember any film that would try so incredibly outrageous, provocative and important, but it has so consistently failed. It's like a comic who does not laugh but can not leave the stage. The harder the film is, the louder the laughter is. The desperation shown by the film is so glaring that it almost arouses pity for everyone involved. <br /> <br /> The movie achieves the status of loud laughter only twice. In Geraldo Rivera's eyes, he plays an unbearable, arrogant and amoral television journalist - which is funny only because he does not seem to realize that he plays alone. Another scene to laugh at is the last "big moment" of the film, in which the judge played by Morgan Freeman gives a sanctimonious lecture on what morality is ("what your mother taught you!"). The pomposity of the moment insults to the point that it is absurd. <br /> <br /> However, you have to admit that it is a noble effort. He has a good, though poorly populated, group of actors who try to create characters from thin cardboard boxes. The film looks professional, and the small cinematic swirls that director Brian DePalma adores are visible if not particularly effective. But the film, which apparently wants to be a commentary on contemporary morality and ethics, never appears above the level of cartoons. Satire needs style. Farce requires energy. Even sitcom takes time. But the best bonfires you can get are desperation. After all, you do not want to laugh, you just want to turn around.
