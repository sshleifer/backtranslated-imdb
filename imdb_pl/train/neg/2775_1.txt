It was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. Not really. I am not joking. Apart from all "based on real stories / historical references", there is no excuse for doing so wrong. It's a shame because, as others wrote, sets and costumes were great. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was typical "Asian-style" music, although I could not find out where the "modern" love song appeared when Fernando lay in bed thinking of Maria. I do not know who wrote and sang this beautiful song, but it was as if Norah Jones had suddenly been transported to 1500. <br /> <br /> The blood of Hershey syrup in Phycho was more realistic than the ketchup spurting battle scenes Kwik-n- EZ. <br /> <br /> But acting. Oh, so painfully sad. The lines are delivered like a bad juniors game. If Gary Stretch put on a 4H potato costume for a potato, he could be more credible. At the end it sounded more like a Little Italy street congestion. Sometimes I expected him to shout "Adrian!" Or even "Do you want me a piece?!". <br /> <br /> Favorite line: When the queen speaks to her lover (after he lunges on the floor) "I have a child". He answers: "Child?" I expected him to say "No, asshole, leg in the chair!
