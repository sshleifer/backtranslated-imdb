Not as bad as some seem to be, though obviously pathetic in comparison to the original. In my opinion, Amitabh was great as the villain Babban Singh - try not to compare Gabbara to the original, because apparently they did not intend to get the same effect. However, apart from a few mediocre scenes, the rest of the movie is flawed. Character development was weak, and the development of this story was hopeless, with many gaps and missing information that I would not know if I had not read the back cover of the DVD. The worst part of the movie were the support roles of Nisha Kothari, especially the new guy named Prashant Raj. Nisha is just annoying from the moment her lips open. Regarding Prashant Raj - seriously, who is this guy? where is he from and why was he present at the film studio for anything other than giving drinks? His acting skills are zero and he has the same tone, providing dialogues and faithful expression in every scene, whether in action, comedy or even when someone just died. Ajay Devgan was mediocre, at least his expression changed, which is more than I can say for his companion error. Overall, the Aag RGV is worth seeing for the solid performance of Amitabh, as well as the very sexy Urmilla Matondkar in a special look.
