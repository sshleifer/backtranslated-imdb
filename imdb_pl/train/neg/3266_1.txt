When Ben (Red Foxx) discovers that his wife Beatrice (Pearl Bailey) has escaped with her brother, goes to her son Norman (Michael Warren) to unload his story for woe - only to discover that Norman has a secret lover: effeminate Garson (Dennis Dugan.) Needless to say, Ben does not treat it well and there are many complications - including Ben's attempt to make Norman a homosexual, repairing him a whore (Tammy Dobson.) Unfortunately this video description sounds much more fun than the movie itself. <br /> <br /> Originally written for the theater by Ron Clark and Sam Bobrick, NORMAN ... WAS IT YOU? she was an absolute disaster on the New York scene. To give this art its meaning, I saw it in the 1970s as a theater production of the community - and although no one would accuse it of being anything other than a shallow farce, the cast played so wide and so carefree it turned out to be quite fun. It is a pity that the cast of this movie did not do the same. <br /> <br /> This is a horribly made movie. Red Foxx, one of the most fun comics of the twentieth century, is as funny as yesterday's laundry, Michael Warren (who later appeared in the HILL STREET BLUES series for a much better effect) competes with Foxx to see who can give the worst result, and Pearl Bailey is not far behind; In truth, only Dennis Duggan, Tammy Dobson and the Wayland Flowers have a spark - and unfortunately this is only compared to the rest of the cast. <br /> <br /> The film is not only badly made, it looks bad. According to film knowledge, it was the first big screen that was filmed on the videotape and then transferred to celluloid for project purposes - and believe me, it shows. The film has the appearance of a bad series from the 70s up to the painted line of horizon seen through the windows of Norman and Garson's flat. <br /> <br /> Some movies are so bad that they become funny, but NORMAN ... IS THIS? He is not one of them. I can summarize my reaction to this film in two words: I miss him. Do not buy it, do not rent it, do not touch it with a ten-foot pole. Return slowly and run like hell. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
