The last film by John Weissmuller as "The King of the Jungle", after 16 years as TARZAN AND THE MERMAIDS, will definitely disappoint everyone, except the most die-hard fans. At the age of 44, he was an Olympian, one of the most active Hollywood partiers, long past a slim athlete of his youth and looked tired (although he was in a slightly better condition than in his previous entry, TARZAN AND HUNTRESS). <br /> <br /> Weissmuller was not only too old for his role; Johnny Sheffield, the quintessential "boy", grew up to male age (he was a 17-year-old who was attached), so he was written from the script under the pretext of being "in school". Brenda Joyce, at the age of 35, appeared in her fourth of five films as "Jane" (she ensured the transition when Lex Barker became the new Tarzan, in 1949 TARZAN'S MAGIC FOUNTAIN) and was still as sexy as ever. <Br /> <br /> Produced by Sol Lesser, in RKO, in a small budget, cast and crew used cheaper workforce, filming in Mexico. While the location gave definitely Latin air in the allegedly darkest Africa, veteran director Robert Florey intensively used the country, including diving in the cliff and the Aztec temple in history. <br /> <br /> When a young girl from the island (Tyrone Future Bride Power, Linda Christian) is saved in the jungle by Tarzan, she learns that the local high priest (George Zucco, one of the most persistent villains of the filmdom) practically enslaved the local population , threatening revenge on the living "God" if they do not follow his order. The girl was chosen to become the "God's" bride, so she escaped. Faster than you can say "Is this a silly conspiracy or WHAT?", The girl is kidnapped by the priest's followers and returns to the island, and Tarzan, then Jane, the colorful Spanish character "Benjy" (sweetly played by John Laurenz, who sings a few melodies) and the government commissioner intends to take care of the Deity and his priest (poor Cheeta is left behind). After a series of discoveries ("God" is just a cheat in the Aztec mask, working with the priest while milking the pearl-rich islands), a bit of daring action and comical relief and songs Benjya, everything arrives to A happy ending was expected. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, TARZAN AND THE MERMAIDS contains music by the genius composer Dimitri Tiomkina and is much better than one would expect from the movie "B"! <br /> <br /> While the film would provide a less successful Weissmuller's time in Tarzan's loincloth (he would immediately play Jungle Jim, a more pronounced version of Ape Man, in khakis), the talent involved raised the overall product at least a little over the total mess what could it be. <br /> <br /> Tarzan was going to change and become more sexy ...
