Too many minor graph lines without a basic one. Too many hot buttons are being pushed for no reason, they managed to push this boring movie that says nothing, with every element of the drama that is there: death, divorce, financial problems, parenting problems, suicide, psychological problems, drug abuse, adoption, rejected love, problems with traveling, sex, misunderstandings of generations, robberies, legal issues, weapons, medical ethics, "deep real love"? You'd think it would be an interesting movie, but hell not? all these events are secondary to something original that is not there. Boring. Not to mention that the "super-deep" (and very long) lecture for a child at the end of the movie is total nonsense. Detriment. <br /> <br /> Oh, I forgot to mention: all the actors are quite good. That's what stopped me from being turned off. Bad talents were wasted. The film is also well filmed: light, movement etc. Each episode - everything is in place. Only meaning is missing.
