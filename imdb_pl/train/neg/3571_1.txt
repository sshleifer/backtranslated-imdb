Super sexy actress from the movie B has another role as the future star "Goodfellas", the girl Ray Liotty in the box office. Marion's game has only one dialogue line, actually one WORD of dialogue. She yells "Joe!" As Ray's character breaks the poor Pia Zadora with a plastic garden hose sprinkler. This movie is so bad that sometimes it becomes funny, funny. The guys from Mystery Science Theater 3000 will love it! Check out the hysterical scene at the end, where Pia has a nervous breakdown and all the cheesy editions and effects that they are making to show how much Pia is crazy. Pia plays in this aspiring Hollywood screenwriter. Pia Zadora as a screenwriter? Yes, sure. Pia can barely speak, let alone write! Pia is completely and absolutely unsuccessful in this stupid role. But who cares? The real star is hot and fresh Glory Annen in her role in the opinion of this cat! Rock on Glory!
