This movie is so much a rip off of masterpacks and it's the only thing that makes a movie worth watching. Acting is terrible, action scenes are accelerated, the scenario is almost painful and the budget does not exist. <br /> <br /> If you think this movie is good, you have not seen a real horror movie, skip it and get a copy of the movie demons.
