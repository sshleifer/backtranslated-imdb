This is the case of a group of people thinking that they are so clever that they have a story that suits their time. Do you remember the comprehensive political conspiracies caught on camera in the years leading up to Watergate and a little later? Most of the films trying to make money on such powerful TV movies to keep the mind from "conspiracy," have in fact been caught in their own approach to the navel. <br /> <br /> I've never been a fan of The Conversation, which I consider as obsolete as other conspiracies from the conspiracy, but Coppola was faithful to his main character, and Hackman was quite an interesting actor to watch. I mean that these underground films are drowning mainly in the noir heroes pool. Many questions remain unanswered, a lot of disinformation ... Well, at least it requires Bergman to build a movie about such non-visual bases. <br /> <br /> The next man is a perfect example of his time: one political soup served with an idealistic character and a terrifying conspiracy clenching the network around him. No part is interesting in itself, and the whole is not better. In fact, it can be said how bad it will be from the first sequences of damaging "murderers" without any plot. Directing pedestrians at the worst possible moment because most of the movie is one pompous accumulation of scenes revolving around violence naively introduced to the eyes of the viewer.
