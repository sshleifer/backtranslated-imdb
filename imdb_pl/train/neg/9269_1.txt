Ever since I saw parts 1 to 3, I can honestly say that they NEVER should do part 4. Everything from cheapness, and I mean bad result to really bad behavior, I dare watch anyone and do not get bored with their minds. <br /> <br /> I mean, parts 1 to 3 have a strong climate on Damion's story, but without it, it's not the same. Probably by the end of the third part I was a bit tired of a continuous story, but it was a good closure at the end of the third. Again there was no reason why it would be part 4. Even if they could do MUCH better than sh * t, I had to sit, lol. I will never see an hour and a half of my life again.
