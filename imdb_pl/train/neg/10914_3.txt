Is not it hilarious when the average schmo leading a pathetic life suddenly happens to something scandalously magical, turning his life upside down and causing him to learn some valuable lessons along the way? This formula never gets old, right? It's such a sure way to make a classic movie! Just look at the main hits, such as Liar Liar and Big! ... It must have been Rob Schneider's thinking line when he finished the semi-successful Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo and followed him with The Animal. Ever since I traced the story with sarcasm, let me color it more: Schneider plays a lost policeman who suddenly takes part in a tragic accident, but is saved by surgery ... by a crazy veterinarian who loads him with animal parts, causing him to whistle like a horse in bad times, running like a cheetah, etc. This movie is a bit more sympathetic than other Schneider movies (such as another lame of the same story), but almost feels like they want the audience to hate him by casting a reality TV star as a romantic host (Colleen Haskell from "Survivor") and inserting the Norm MacDonald cameo. My favorite scene ... it just does not exist. I'm sorry - nothing extraordinarily good apart from the value of production. I just want to end this review, saying that small references to other movies in the movie may be okay, but when it comes to lines delivered in exactly the same way ("You can do it!"), There is a word for it - "milking." Actually, here's another word - "cheap".
