A prerequisite for such a film is total ignorance of Nietzche's creativity and personality, psychoanalytic techniques and Vienna's history. Take a well-known genius you have not read, describe him as mad, turn on crazy doctors to heal him, some pretty-looking women, play the part played by an actor with huge mustaches, let every character talk with the strongest accent, show funny dreams, turn on the next a prestigious character who has nothing to do with the first (Freud), mention a few words used in the works of genius, overdo everything you can, especially with music, and you're done. Audience, please stay away.
