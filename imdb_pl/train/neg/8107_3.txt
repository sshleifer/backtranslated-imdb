This movie is quite boring. There are fragments of the naked body thrown in a lame attempt to wake up the viewer, but it fails. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the film is Lena Olin - she performs the masterful work of the character, but Day-Lewis garbles most of her lines. <br /> <br /> Kaufman apparently had no idea how to film it. Inequalities in bouncing between home / marital problems and political crises are poorly matched. Attitudes of the characters change without explanation. Badly chaotic.
