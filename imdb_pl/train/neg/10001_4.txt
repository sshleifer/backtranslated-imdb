This film lacked something I could not come across at the beginning: the charisma of the main actress. This inevitably led to the lack of chemistry when she shared the screen with her leading man. Even romantic scenes turned out to be only actors in the game. It would be very good if the director misjudged what he needed from the actors. I just do not know. <br /> <br /> But could it be a scenario? Who was the chef in love with? He seemed more in love with his culinary skills and restaurants, and ultimately in himself and his youthful feats than in anyone else. He never convinced me that he is in love with the princess. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed with this movie. But do not forget that he was nominated for an Oscar, so judge for yourself.
