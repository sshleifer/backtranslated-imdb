This is the best way to describe this movie, which focuses on a young couple who moves to a home visited by the first wife of a husband who died in mysterious circumstances. It sounds good and good, but what takes place is an hour of pure boredom. In fact, one of the funny things in this movie is a warning at the beginning of the movie, which promises to anyone who dies of fear, a free coffin. Trust me, no one ever took them on this offer, unless somebody is scared of plastic skulls, peacocks, weird gardeners and felled doors. And the music is the worst, it consists of a constant tuba music that sounds like it was played by a sixth grader. And you will discover a terrible secret that is so obvious that you really have to wonder what the people in this movie thought. Someone dies while running and hits the head, and the police are never called in to investigate. Yes, in the end it is a slow pace (which is really bad considering that the movie is just over an hour), a boring little story that an average person can easily come up with. Apparently none of the characters in this movie was an average person.
