A friend once told me that an independent film in an artistic home runs in the cinema, when after the film is closed, viewers are so angry that they precede the bursting of cinema seats. Of course, my imagination ran away, trying to conjure up the contents of such work. Well, now my imagination can be stopped. <br /> <br /> I am a longtime fan of Andrey Tarkovky and a great admirer of his work. I came across a lot of people who thought that Tarkowski's films were slow and inert. Opinions that are, I consider untrue with respect to the great works of the late director, which arise with meaning, beautiful compositions and complex philosophical questions. Hearing how Aleksandr Sokurow called the heir of Tarkowski, I was excited about the experience of his films. <br /> <br /> With the exception of running outdoors through fields (Stalker), this movie is not related to anything that Tarkovsky has Got. It seems that it does not matter, even on a completely careless level. It is supposedly "wonderfully raw" pictures deprived of any compositional craft. There is no balance, no proportion, and the exposure meter seems to run out of batteries in the freezing snow. The main character is so inept and indecisive that you wonder if his father could have been alive if he had decided earlier. <br /> <br /> I am also against advances and plots that are progressing in many non-linear ways. But there is not even a story here. You must definitely go to watch this movie with a shaved head, if someone comes out of it without anything that will gain and lose nothing, because plucking hair will be the only possible response to the tempo that can make the Tarkosky time sculpture look like Jerry Bruckheimer made Charlie Chaplin's movie. <br /> <br /> I do not rule out that it may be one of the smelly Sokurow (Solaris Tarkowski), but to the conclusion that he is one of the heirs of Tarkowski based on this film - I would call Paris Hilton the successor of Aristotle. Come on, do not be afraid to say that. No large amount of impressive words will magically lead this celluloid body to life. I am not saying that I fully understand Russian culture and probably do not have Russian values, but I immediately took up Tarkowski's work as something magical, a treasure and gift for viewers. <br /> <br /> If it did not have Sokurov's name on it, and it was said on the air, Saturday Night Live, I'm almost certain that no one would read all the great analysis in this wet macaroon.
