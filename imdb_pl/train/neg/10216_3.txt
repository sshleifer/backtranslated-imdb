DANGER THAN FICTION has made me so angry that I signed up for IMDb to write this review. STRANGER THAN FICTION is a surprisingly complex, touching and thought-provoking movie until the very end. Once you hang up a lot of logic errors (why Will Ferrell did not hear Emma Thompson's voice 10 years ago when she started writing her book? - The phone rang. The phone rang again - how could she not know that he's calling?). The film challenges thoughts about mortality, fate and sacrifice. <br /> <br /> A brief history of literary topics provided by Dustin Hoffman should be of particular interest to former English masters. And Maggie Gyllenhaal is always a pleasure, even if Will Ferrell might as well be an ax-killer, an inept soul. Her quick trust in him is a powerful big leap of faith. <br /> <br /> Ah, but the end. Until the very end, I would give 9 out of 10 stars to the movie. The film as a metaphor of a life journey, as a tribute to the concept of "real writing", as a reminder that great literature is either a comedy or a tragedy, but not both, it is unique. The whole film leads the viewer to understand and accept the fate of Will Ferrell. And no matter how appealing a character can be, we know exactly why we will accept the ending. The last act takes place, the screen turns white, the loans are spinning. A deep and powerful end of an almost perfect movie. An end that would be discussed for weeks. <br /> <br /> NOT !!!!!!!!!! No credits. Say it is not. Let's just say that Hollywood did not get attached to the next 10 minutes of nonsense, which completely undermined the integrity and heart of the film. Dustin Hoffman was right, saying: "This is no longer a masterpiece; all right". Appropriate review of the movie. There was not even OK outside of me. I was so offended that I betrayed "writing the truth" about the decision to make a movie that I actually fell into angry tears, explaining it on the way home from the movie. I do not often cry. I did not care about most movies, but I'm still mad at it. <br /> <br /> My questions to Zack Helm, the writer, are: did the original movie end when the screen became white? And were you forced by the miserable film powers to pin an infidel end to the core of the film? Or have you caught this dark ending? I read that you are brilliant. I hope your first screenplay ended the movie for the first time. <br /> <br /> I know that Zack Helm will never see this review and I have not been able to find a contact who could ask him. But, please, movie viewers, or only I feel this way in relation to STRANGER THAN FICTION? One good thing came from me, seeing this movie: I admire LOST IN TRANSLATION twice now.
