The genre of suspense movies really takes diving in this. IMPLAUSABILITY is a big problem. I realize that you must create difficult situations that would create tension and a tense sense of what will happen later, but this movie was so predictable and simply unbelievable. I believe that the more I watch this kind of film, the more I constantly tell actors to move them away from danger. Continuously making bad decisions is limited to being a simple fool. If he took the time to make it more realistic, I might like it a bit. Having said that, it would be better to stay away from it.
