Are you talking to me? (1987) is a pretty bad movie with the participation of some guy I've never seen before or since I was acting as a neighborhood guy trying to become an actor. He has heavy ions for the taxi driver because he tries to use this bird to make him big. When he learns the hard facts of life, he does what everyone does, he changes his image! At night, he goes from a good guy to a surfing guy. His friend can not believe in the change (but he gets points from Faith Ford and gets a nice concert). Can this young punk keep his street credibility while making him great? <br /> <br /> This is a real lame movie that tries too hard to turn on too many things at once. An interesting idea that crumbles due to bad executions. Who knows, maybe someone will take the ball and run away, because this time the creators of the film buried the ball. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time on this movie. Unless you want to see hot Faith Ford and young Bubba from Forest Gump. <br /> <br /> xx
