An empty point is a good movie worth lending at half price or if nothing else is in good shape, you do not have to think about it. Explosions are required, and we have actresses and pretty women. Nice cast with Donald Sutherland, John Lithgow, and lovely Tia Carrere. This cast plus a light touch makes it not a great movie, but it's fun ... on a scale of one to ten .. 4
