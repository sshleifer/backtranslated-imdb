Anyone who has seen Tammuz's Child Eaters knows that he is a director who can do better. Let's hope it was not a case of too many hands in the pot (whoever?) The signs are one-dimensional and used, but the scenery is great and beautifully presented by the North Pacific. <br /> <br /> Pictures are great. Pictures taken almost completely outside they are clear and beautiful, you can almost feel the wind blowing through the leaves. <br /> <br /> Technically, this movie is just as sound as it appears - it just lacks heart.
