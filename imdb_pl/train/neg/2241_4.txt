I remember that I enjoyed it a few years ago, but wondering why once again. It seems to me that it always looks good, and the girls do rather well, but the men tend to let go. Why oh, why in so many English movies about sex we must have such inept males next to beautiful girls? What's more, it starts quite predictably, like a sexual farce similar to Confessions movies, but about one third of the way (while we start to enjoy the presence of the charming Me Me Lai) the movie asks us to take it seriously. Not only that, but the central rock club and cannabis sequences are very forced and just look stiff. In short, it is neither innocuously stupid nor as seriously intelligent as it seems. Perhaps Richard O'Sullivan, as such a central figure, helped, but I consider it one of his worst performances. It's just worth it for ladies.
