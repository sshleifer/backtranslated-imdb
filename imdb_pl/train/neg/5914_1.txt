This movie is really boring. He was banned in the Chinese cinema and I understand why. Not because it is critical of the communist regime, but because the film is of such low quality. I would never pay to watch this. I love Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou, and I'm disappointed that a bad movie could come from China. It seems that he completely ignores the audience, and the director seems to have made a film for himself. Shots of a person standing there who does nothing for a minute are fun and there are plenty of them. Cinematography and video quality are incredibly bad. I watched this movie on the web and it looks like people really like this movie. The only explanation I have on this subject is that some film lovers think that if the film is not in English, it is automatically good. I see no reason why people would like it. it's not a movie about art, it's a waste of celluloid. (If they actually filmed it on a movie they did not)
