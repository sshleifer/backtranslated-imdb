This film was not programmed in Italian cinemas, I saw it in a manifestation called "fantafestival". I find it horrible, because some scenes seem to be chaotic and dark, and the use of fluorescent colors is ridiculous and there is no suspicion in the film. The music is completely devoid of history and I have no words to describe the visual effects. If you look at the first scene, the movie seems to be interesting, but a few minutes later it becomes busy. The story is interesting, but development needs a full review.
