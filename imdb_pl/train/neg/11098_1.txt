Like most people, I was intrigued when I heard the concept of the film, especially the aspect of "the filmmaker was attacked", which seems to emphasize this case, and the image on the cover of filmmakers is being hunted down by an angry mob. <br /> <br /> Then, to watch the movie and discover, oh, what they mean, "the filmmakers were attacked", some children threw stones at the sign, and many people loudly complained and said: "Someone should beat those two children. Picture on the cover, how was it? Total fabrication. Which is probably related to the subject of the film, lying and manipulation, to satisfy vain, stupid children with more money and time, and then feel. <br /> <br /> I have no idea what a wonderful truth a viewer should take away from this movie. It's like Michael Moore's "Roger & Me," but if "Roger & Me" was Moore mocking the people of Flint. It is completely misdirected and completely ridiculous. Wow! Can you believe that people who suffered under the yoke of communism would be really excited if there were markets full of food? What tugs! And not so much, "Look at the effects of capitalism and Western media blah blah blah," because not only that their fake market had comparable prices to competitors, as many people in the film say the prices were ridiculously low, someone mentions that they should have known they were false, if they charged for the duck. This proves nothing but poor people, go to a store that has low prices, applauding the guys, a way to stick it to people downstairs. <br /> <br /> A way to stupid jokes on older people. You should be very proud. What about the next movie that you make a documentary about Iraq and show how people will be really excited about the house with no bullet holes in the walls, then say "HAHA! THIS IS NOT HOME! PERFORMED BY THE MEDIA! ". <br /> <br /> Morgan "Please Like Me" Spurlock unleashed this wet fart movie and it's no wonder that Spurlock as the prince of the documentary world "One Hit Wonder" seems to be upsetting some stupid sounding concept to remain an important in a world that does not really need it. <br /> <br /> Avoid the scourge.
