OK .... I have only three words - tacky, tacky and CHEESY! The only advantage of this movie is Dean Cain. Besides - it's CHEESEBALL SUPREME !!!! <br /> <br /> The film has a promise - the underground laboratory creates a real dragon breathing fire live - basically gives us more "Jurassic Park" "Reign of Fire" ... There are some great options, but they they just do not work ... Special effects are decent - even if you know that the dragon is CGI, it does not look terrible LOOK like CGI .... <br /> <br /> I do not blame Dean Cain (although he is one of the producers) I blame Phillip Roth - the director and writer more. His job is to make this movie ... and unfortunately he failed.
