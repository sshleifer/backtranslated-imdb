My first clue about how bad it will happen when the movie case talked about the people who brought us the Blair Witch project, which was a masterpiece compared to this piece of rubbish. Acting was based on a sixth-century kaleidoscope production in Oklahoma, and the plot, as it was, is predictable, boring and ridiculous. 85% of the script is four letter words and countless variations on them. Mother F seems to be the favorite "writer" because it is constantly used. Writing this script in a certain dive last 10 minutes. Thank God I hired him and I could jump over most of them forward. Do not waste time or money on it.
