This film . . . I do not know. Why do not they take such a tireless form as Pippi Longstocking and throw exceptionally charming Tami Erin, I will never know. Why did they spend money on the direction of art and some not so bad special effects, and then they did not bother with correct editing, I will never find out. Why sets and costumes are sometimes in a period of time, and sometimes strange, why they ordered such a bad song, why the script does not make any sense (even on the stupid, childish level of the film). . . . What did they think ?? Nothing about this movie is as it should be. Each single part is dubbed (and always weak), each sound effect is slightly incorrect, each edition is in the wrong place, each performance is somehow bad. Despite all the problems, he manages to create the right atmosphere, but NEVER captures the magic that is the work of Astrid Lindgren.
