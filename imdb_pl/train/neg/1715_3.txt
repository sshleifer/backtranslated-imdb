Although it contains facts that are not widely reported, this is not true. They took many liberties in moving events, excluding people and using sets that do not meet the facts of their lives in the 1930s. There were more than just Bonnie, Clyde and W.D. in the gangs. and these people had so much to do with facts like these. Buck and Blanche went to convince Clyde to go straight ahead sooner than during one shootout, and he actually returned to crime. Some events that were presented in daylight took place at night. Bonnie's wound was much more serious and never healed. It was so bad that it must have been worn by someone until it healed, and even then it stiffened, so it stiffened. Clyde also walked limp because he cut off a big toe in prison. I know I'm picky and it was a TV movie, but even without these actual mistakes in this "TRUE" story, the film moves too fast from event to event and appears as a few separate snapshots of their lives instead of being a coherent flowing story. <br /> <br /> I would recommend reading a book or watching a documentary if you want to get closer to the truth.
