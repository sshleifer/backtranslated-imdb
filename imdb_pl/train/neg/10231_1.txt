To be honest, I'm rather upset that on the basis of the dazzling reviews attributed to Steven Smith, I wasted almost two hours on his debut offering. Were all written by his buddies? The action takes place together, the music is irritating and used, the scenario is simply tragic, and the actors (with the exception of the gardener) at best average. I believe that we should support the efforts of the young filmmaker, but saying that he is brilliant when he is not, he will certainly encourage him to commit the same mistakes again, i.e. Continue writing his own scenarios and using the same actors for another venture. Yes, it's his first movie, low budget, etc. - I understand, but it is also available to members of the public to buy it and it is not up to scratch.
