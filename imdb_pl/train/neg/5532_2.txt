Revolt of the Zombies is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's quite far off the list. When the expedition is sent to Cambodia to discover the zombie-making trick after World War I, one member decides to use this knowledge for his own evil ambitions. And he manages it, at least at the beginning. The love triangle complicates the story. <br /> <br /> It was a really boring movie, with terrible acting, which made it difficult to determine who is a zombie and who is not. The dialogue was a bit better and the plot was unbelievable (not part of the zombie, but parts related to "romance"). And although I am not a student or expert in the field of cinematography, working with a camera did not seem to help the film too much. <br /> <br /> Although I've seen some movies that are worse, it's unlikely. someone. It's bad and NOT so bad it's good.
