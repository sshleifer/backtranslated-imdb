I do not have much to say about this movie. <br /> <br /> It was a horrible movie ... I can not even tell you what made me decide to watch it. He had so few redeeming qualities that I do not even know where to start. <br /> <br /> The plot has gone from unbelievable to almost absurd. My whole body was tense throughout the entire length of the movie, because I could not wait for this awful thing to end. At the end of the movie, I felt I was relieved. <br /> <br /> The editing was poor, the acting was below normal and the plot was poor. Francoise Robinson was cast as a native American, even though she does not even remember anyone from the heritage of Native Americans. <br /> <br /> If the movie is so idiotic, it should be ridiculously stupid - at least. There was no. It was simply pathetic.
