When we live, when someone like Joe Swan - whatever the hell, he is considered a good filmmaker ... or even a filmmaker! Where are the new film producers with the brain and talent ?? We need them badly, and hell with mumblecore! <br /> <br /> This movie is about nothing, just like the characters in the movie mean nothing. This is a terrible, so-called Gen Y, full of bored idiots, some of whom claim to be filmmakers without bothering to find out about the ship before shooting. Well, Orson Welles was a filmmaker. John Huston was a filmmaker. Fellini was a filmmaker. Dreyer was a filmmaker, etc. Current films such as these show how stupid young, so-called "filmmakers" can be when they believe that they come out without a script, without direction, without thought, without a legal "camera" (everything is terribly dubbed DV ), no art of editing, nothing, means "rebellious" or "advanced" film making. No, it's called ignorance and laziness, or just pure masturbation of the cinema (and it's really a hit, so be ready). <br /> <br /> Look at the early films of every great "indie" filmmaker: Linklatter, Morris, Allen, Lynch, Hartley, Jarmusch, Jost, Lee and Herzog ... none of them did anything as boring and pointless as That, and yet Swan - whatever it is, he still goes to SXSW every year and hailed as a brave new talent. That's shit! I can not imagine that someone would like it, and everything else, what a so-called filmmaker did (everything I saw), is just as bad (newer things clearly appealed to a more popular audience, one of those calling for sitcoms). Avoid unless you are a friend or a family member of those involved ... secondly, if you are a family member or a friend, you will probably be ashamed if you see a family member or friend in such embarrassing situations. . <br /> <br /> Total rubbish. This is not art. This is the opposite of this.
