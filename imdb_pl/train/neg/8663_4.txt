Just when you thought that returning to the water is safe ... <br /> <br /> Another computer croc mutant on the grave for people for lunch, released by another of these objects, leading crazy science. Gereco Biotech is fooling around with growth hormone research, accidentally releasing a crocodile that is growing at an ever-increasing rate. <br /> <br /> The cast of the movie B adds fun to this series of mills "genetic error movie monster". Costas Mandylor summons Mick Dundee, Australian accent, hat, big ass sucker, acts as a croc specialist employed by director Gereco Joanna Pacula (... wasted in the stereotypical role of a corrupt administrative director who denies all involvement in a giant beast free innocent people) . Charles Napier is a local sheriff whose city is in danger, and Jane Longenecker is his hot daughter who works in an animal shelter. Matthew Borlenghi, the star of the soap opera, is interested in Longenecker's love, a local artist who saves sculptures (his brother is a croc victim). Of course, this skill will be very useful when our heroes create a created crocodile trap, hoping to poison it with carbon monoxide. <br /> <br /> The croc itself is never as convincing as it is raging through a reserve looking for food, special effects of a low quality variety. When it comes to Roger Corman's production of renegade-dinosaur-monsters, I stick to Carnosaura. The monster here is basically a crocodile standing on its hind legs, often straightened as it pursues potential victims. I felt that Mandylor and the filmmakers were faking Crocodile Dundee with their crocodile hunter, and this imitation could be fun when the monster himself failed. Borlenghi and Longenecker actually have quite a good chemistry on the screen. As expected, Pacula takes her humor in a fun way (... gulp).
