Even the most ardent fan of fans can not please the movie (I'm one of them) puppets just do not get any material for work. It's really a shame because it's the only full-length movie that the nomads have done with Curly, and this one effort is painfully uncomfortable when it could have great potential. Terrible music numbers do not help either. The shortcut they made with the same title has more laughter.
