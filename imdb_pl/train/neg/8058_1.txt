After watching Eliza Dushku hot in a pretty good corner, I decided to choose this film instead of Return of the Living Dead of all movies. I have not seen it yet, but given that it is one of the most-valued horrors in history, I can say that I made the wrong choice. It simply does not recommend this movie and I am talking about a supposedly better killer cut. He did not even have a youthful sex appeal for mediocre poor movies such as "I know what you did last summer" or "Valentine or Urban Legend". It just did not make sense, it did not have the excitement, it had very little interesting acting or captivating writing. The release date was most likely repeatedly postponed for about a year, and the reason is obvious. The whole film appears in the form of several senseless scenes, thrown together accidentally, into a meaningless effect. If you want to see Dushku, turn into the wrong corner instead. I would like to see a film with her and a super-hot Elisabeth Harnois - but I do not think that even this would make the film visible. Casey Affleck, so promising at Good Will Hunting, is awful here - he seems to lack intelligence and courage. That's enough for that.
