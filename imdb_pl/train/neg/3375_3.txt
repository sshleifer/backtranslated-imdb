Hi everyone, if you saw "Singing in the Rain", remember the scene of Gene Kelly dancing in the rain. You also remember the dance number of Donald O'Connor "Make 'em Laugh". If you saw "Royal Wedding", you remember Fred Astaire dancing on the ceiling. If you saw "Jailhouse Rock", you even remember the title dance number in the choreography of the King himself. <br /> <br /> This is missing here. There could be a few hit dance numbers in this presentation. The nearest was "Chuck McGowan's" I Can Do That. " the fact that you have talented people on stage together is not a great dance movie. Richard Attenborough owed this failure. He directed the camera to the stage and thought it would be a good thing. <br /> <br /> Screaming at people involved in Broadway production is not entertainment. Michael Douglas would be equally poorly manned if he was in Western comedy. It's okay when he's in the Michael Douglas movie, where we see him shouting at someone we'd like to shout at. It does not work here. <br /> <br /> The cast was good, except for Michael, of course. A good movie could be made even with songs that were in stage production, but someone should think about how to film it. <br /> <br /> The next time they do one of them I hope they will call me. <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
