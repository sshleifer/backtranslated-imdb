Imagine, say, say 12-1 in the morning - your home, bored, not tired. This scenario took place around, say, 4 years ago. I turned on the TV and skipped a few channels and found that this movie is on. OH MY WORD is the worst movie I've ever seen! Escaping a car that can not be stopped (because the brakes have been cut or something like that) in a can on the highway - what will happen ?! This movie was so bad that it was really funny - I think that stunt cost about $ 2, there was one case when a small child is pulled out of the car by a helicopter - in order to excite the viewer - a conveniently placed bridge approaches the front ... THIS IS THE BEST BAD COLLECTION FOR EVERY FILM - shows that the child narrowly lacks a bridge, but looks so bad - you can almost see the brand of mannequin they used - a totally low budget classic! But I do not remember the end of the movie, but I bet it was GREAT <br /> <br /> I doubt they will ever show this movie again, so I'm glad I could see this piece of rubbish!
