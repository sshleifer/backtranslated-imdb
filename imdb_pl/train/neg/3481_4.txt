May contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> I say this, but anyone who is smart enough to read this can guess that every story starts from the beginning. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie that I liked. I did not hate it for some movies that offend your intelligence, but it all seemed too predictable when he came back to the required happy ending. There were fun pieces along the way, but few were original. At least it was not about the gutter. <br /> <br /> Christina Applegate looks fresh and Ben Affleck is working hard. Their scenes together are in reality the only option of redemption. Everyone else is a cut-out from cardboard, in a surprising way, James Gandolfini, who had to do it as a favor for someone. <br /> <br /> In total, it is harmless, but not inspirational 90 minutes.
