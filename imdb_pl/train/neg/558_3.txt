It's been about 14 years since Sharon Stone has given viewers a crossover that has turned the minds of many people. And now, God knows why, he's in the game again. "Basic Instinct 2" is a continuation of the hit erotic "Basic Instinct" with sexy Stone and defenseless Michael Douglas. However, fans of the original may not even come close to this, because "Instinct 2" is a painful movie creation because the mediocre director Michael Caton-Jones kills the legacy of the first movie. <br /> <br /> The story begins when the car explodes at the very beginning. Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone, trying to look sexy) is a suspect and seems to be involved in a murder. Psychiatrist (terrible David Morrisey) is tasked to examine her, but eventually falls into an intimate game of seduction. <br /> <br /> And that is, without further explanation, the basic force that stirs this "Instinct" Nothing is explained and we have to sit down in a crude, erotic C-class movie. Sharon Stone plays in her first role in which it is usually turned off. Partly because of amateur writing, careless direction and frighteningly low chemistry. The film is full of vulgar dialogues and even greater sexuality (menage, the trois scene has been cut off so that it will not be assessed NC-17) than the first entry in the series. "Instinct" is an irresistible torture. <br /> <br /> On top of everything, everything that made the original movie guilty is not in any movie. Operation here is really bad. Sharon Stone has some advantages, but here she becomes very unbearable. David Morrisey plays the worst part of his life and seems to never create more than two expressions in the movie - confused and excited. "Instinct 2" is a horrible way to continue the original series, which played very well in the erotic thriller. Paul Verhoeven, how I miss you .... <br /> <br /> "Basic Instinct 2" never sounded like a good movie, but it really is not. Some movies should never disappear from paper, and this is the feeling that comes up after watching this. It is much easier to understand why Douglas and David Cronenberg have dropped out and why Sharon Stone expected a huge payment for it ......----- 3/10
