The basic theme of cinema since the beginning of its existence is a genre of seductive women, whose tricks and means attract vulnerable men not only in arms, but also in tragic circumstances that will usually pose a threat to male victims, together with the uncertainty whether or not the temptress will be forced to take medicine, and here Susan Lucci appears as a siren, although her pedigree cutters mainly from the soap opera are insufficient to make her performance credible. Isabelle (Lucci), the unstable wife of capitalist Stewart Collins (John O'Hurley), starts an affair just for fun with the yacht dealer Richard Davis (Philip Casnoff), simply bagatelle for her, but a serious heart for Richard, apparently hypnotized by his lover when he uses his enthusiasm, engaging him in a risky conspiracy that will turn into a scheme of murderous intentions. When Davis becomes convinced that insidious Isabelle is a victim of the physical violence given by her husband, she desperately tries to free her from what she considers a marital trap to be able to marry her alone and believes that the only clear solution to his fate will be in the basic essay about hiring a professional killer who will get rid of the allegedly brutal Stewart. Following the attack of the Nazis on Collins, a pair of police detectives, performed by Joe Grifasi and Dean McDermott, becomes more and more interested in Isabelle's possible involvement in the crime, while the reality begins to arouse delight with Richard, who may have to pay the price in exchange for inamorata maneuvers . Lucci and Kasnoff are properly cast as a real pair of conspirators, each of which gives a reading that makes him boring, not a charming set of doves, but O'Hurley and McDermott offer strong returns in a movie that suffers from a broken scenario and non-invasive elements of direction and project. Released on DVD by Fremantle, this largely glare-free romance depicting a seductive man uses the highest visual and audio quality, and although there are no additional features, the above-average quality of production increases the efforts of the operator Robert Primes and composer Stephen Edwards.
