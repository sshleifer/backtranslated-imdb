Also known in a different form than "House of Exorcism", this sloppy <br /> <br /> film is treated so seriously that it kills all the entertainment value <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> An additional plot is about the European tourist Elke Sommer who has <br /> <br /> a chance to meet with Telly Savalas, who looks like a devil <br /> <br /> seen in the fresco in the square . Sommer przejeżdża do <br /> <br /> a mysterious house in the country where Savalas is a <br /> <br /> perfumery. There she is confused with a long dead woman and the real soap opera begins. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> the husband of the blind matriarch of the house had an affair with a dead woman who was the fiancée of the matriarch's son. The couple who gave Sommer a ride? <br /> <br /> Well, the woman gives the chauffeur "riding in the back seat <br /> <br /> lessons" and the husband knows and does not care. Eventually, most of the cast is killed, Sommer is drugged and raped, <br /> <br /> escapes, and the viewer is brought to a climax on empty <br /> <br /> airplane ... which had to resemble empty theaters to <br /> <br /> grało się w. <br /> <br /> An alternative version of this, "House of Exorcism", has scenes <br /> <br /> added to engage the priest. <br /> <br /> A copy of this VHS, from Elite Entertainment, is crystal clear and <br /> <br /> in the mailbox. After the end credits are "add-ons"; deleted seks <br /> <br /> and gore scenes. <br /> <br /> The direction of Mario Bavy is fast and furious, but his script is <br /> <br /> horrible. There are half-baked ideas, abandoned threads and <br /> <br /> great amenities that do nothing more than drive something <br /> <br /> in a certain direction forward. You have a life like mannequins for funeral practices, the blind matriarch does not behave like the blind <br /> <br /> and Savalas gets the same lollipops he had in the "Kojak" (who /> <br /> haunts you, honey?). <br /> <br /> It looks like the project had two names stars, then quickly wrote the <br /> <br /> script, something that happens in Hollywood in the daily event <br /> <br / > now. Savalas looks completely lost, stopping the lines <br /> <br /> and regretting that his character did not die in "The Dirty <br /> <br /> Tuzin". Sommer runs, screams and pains a lot, but <br /> <br /> her character is empty, I use the term "character" loosely. <br /> <br /> The only thing we know about her is her name. <br /> <br /> This is a really strange movie, and your reaction may depend on <br /> <br /> how much you are in Eurohorror and Kojak. I can not recommend <br /> <br /> "Lisa i diabeł." <br /> <br /> This is unrated and contains all the supplements at the end of the VHS <br /> <br /> copy, contains strong physical violence, sexual violence, strong <br /> <br /> gore, strong nudity of women, male nudity, sexual content and situations <br /> <br /> for adults
