I've seen this movie twice and I have to say that I liked it every time. It's fast and fun, but it's definitely stunned. Having said that he deserves to be destroyed because of screwing up what could have been a good consequence of the original original. For those who have seen the horrible "Zombie Creeping Flesh", it is obvious that these films can be largely guilty of Bruno Mattei, and what is praiseworthy belongs to Fulci. This is not idle Fulci's skepticism, directors' styles are strongly contrasted and you can say who directed, especially in the case of Mattei. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on the virus outbreak (strangely referred to as "top secret" by the scientist, this mystery is apparently more remarkable than its potentially apocalyptic impact on humanity) somewhere in Southeast Asia. The virus evokes zombie - like behaviors in people affected by the disease, and the virus spreads rapidly on seemingly arbitrary terrain. Our heroes unknowingly wander into the danger zone and must fight for life against the hordes of infected Asians. <br /> <br /> The movie seems to be halfway between being a giant of zombies and the exit and exit of an action adventure, and this confusion is apparently captured by the zombies themselves. They do not seem to have a set of features common to everyone. Some of them are a mere soulless version of shuffling, so well rendered in the original and probably in this case, the Fulci creation. The second main group consists of those who are infected with the virus lost their sense of self, but they suffered wild aggression and the desire to get a black belt in ninjitsu: Indecisively leaping uncertainly whether to continue grinding their upper round bottom technique or engage with the brothers in what looks like mass tickling on their unfortunate victims. Martial arts skills are not their only talents, they are well versed in guerrilla tactics, they hide on rafters and under bales of hay, and sometimes they inexplicably fall out of nowhere but the heavens themselves. This is definitely Mattei's work. <br /> <br /> There is a third, more talkative, zombie. This type seems to be ironic, "I am really thirsty ... FOR YOUR BLOOD." A funny turn at the end, in which the DJ turns into a zombie, but continues to proclaim gibbering about the fate of humanity, serves only to strengthen the WTF factor and destroy all hope of a serious solution. <br /> <br /> Then there is the infamous zombie head, which slowly floats in the air, a jocular, skeletal smile appears on your face, as if to say "yes, we know how bad it looks." <br /> <br /> All characters are completely one-dimensional, as you would expect. But it's a pseudo-comic dialogue and dubbing that really prevents us from treating them hard. Having said that the first soldier who died, displays an impressive brave display against the unstoppable zombie threat. This is the first and probably the only time we've come across a real agro zombie, and one of the few effective scenes in the movie. <br /> <br /> The guy who played the lead scientist has a heart but no talent, using breaks in his lines completely by accident, so he ends up sounding like a confused asthmatic. Researchers on the screen are trying to find an antidote, they are completely unconvincing - now we can combine these two molecules! <br /> <br /> However, there are a few moments that are really effective. In the early stage, the heroine discovers an abandoned garage. After entering the room, we stand before the foggy view of a changing figure in a corner and winding mass on the floor, shot in an atmospheric diffused light. Silence is interrupted by the appearance of a quick zombie with a machete that destroys everything that happens in its alarming desperation to have it. His pure aggressiveness is one of the few moments of real horror in the film. The subject before and after handed over by the hotel, where the events from the earliest stage of the explosion take place, and later as a shelter for our heroes, is imbued with a dense, humid atmosphere. There is a scene in which one of the soldiers approaches carefully to the boarded-up room, which clearly houses the hordes of the undead, and this is quite strained. Things get more dramatic when they get into a hotel without knowing what's lurking upstairs. But this is scruffy and is not as effective as it could be. <br /> <br /> In total, I would say that this movie can simply deserve the name of the royal corruption of a potentially effective tropical zombie festival, not just a bad movie. If there is nothing else, he has a lot of unintentional laughter, which I expect from almost everything Italian and bloody from the eighties.
