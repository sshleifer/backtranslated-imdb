This is a terrible story. The film lasts about an hour before we begin to have an idea of ​​what it is supposed to be; the characters often mumble; activities often seem to have no connection with each other; no one seems to be disturbed by who actually murdered the girl; a pair of ghostly children are swimming in waters that seem threatening, but nothing happens; The Irishman is struck in the face by one of his buddies for no apparent reason ... continuing would be as boring as the movie itself. The only semi-entertainment element is landscape photography; but anyone can point the camera at the Australian province and get unforgettable shots. Overall - gloomy, incoherent, pretentious - and even annoying for wasting so much time of the viewer.
