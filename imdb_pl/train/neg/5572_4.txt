Another colorful excuse for men in rubber suits to struggle with each other. This time travelers from the future will come in 1992 and recruit several people to return with them until 1944. And prevent the rise of Godzilla, thus saving future Japan from destruction. But after completing this task, the time travelers turn out to be a group of double attackers whose own creation goes into a frenzy, and without Godzilla, to stop it? Eek! It all sounds very stupid and it probably is, but the story is surprisingly decent, and the final battle looks pretty good too. Unfortunately, the other visual effects are rather garbage than garbage, and the film turns out to be as boring as its predecessors. Look out for Spielberg's shaky joke.
