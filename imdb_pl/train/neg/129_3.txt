I Am Curious are actually two films in one - half is the sexual experimental side of Lena, and the other half is her political curiosity / socialism. Regardless of the intentions of the director, both do not merge. The director should stick to Lena's romantic side and make a separate film for politics. There is a bizarre mix of political / war rallies, Dr. King, serious political interviews, flapping breasts and pubic hair. The film is more like a fictitious document than a movie. In addition to interesting sex scenes, you'll be bored watching this movie. Unlike many other reviewers, I think that nude / sexual scenes are exaggerated with what it is. If you want to see real porn, I'm sure there are better options. Ubiquitous nudity is the main obstacle to any story. I think the cast did a good job. They played their parts in a reliable way. At the time, there are not many abuses in American films that I am so used to.
