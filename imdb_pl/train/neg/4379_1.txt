<br /> <br /> Okay, well, I borrowed this movie when I was in bed, jumped on painkillers and let me say it did not help the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is about a man who buys a car when he goes through a midlife crisis, loves a car more than anything around him, one day his wife decides to borrow a car. Because I do not want to mess up (not to mess things up) I'll let your imagination find "Zany" (and I use that word lightly) the antics that follow. <br /> <br /> I had to fight to stay awake through this hoarse minute movie, and I would like to say that if you venture into a movie shop and think about being casual, please, no, it's a movie loss it was printed on. <br /> <br /> Then I could be wrong again ...
