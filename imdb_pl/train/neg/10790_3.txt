First of all, I'm not a big fan of modern Turkish cinema, because the usual way to create cash success is to hit below the waistline. This film is nothing like an artistic masterpiece that deals with taboos, as the director and marketing ads suggest. In my opinion, the only purpose of this movie is to earn money by touching sensitive morale (in fact, it is considered a taboo in the home country). br /> However, the operation is almost perfect. In fact, most actors have a theatrical background and tried to compensate for what Altioclar lacked; talent! All members of the cast perfectly fit their roles and were well prepared for work, even those less experienced. (Like Janset) At least Altioklar deserves a small word of appreciation, just because he knows how to choose a cast. In addition, it is simply a media monkey, which is assumed to be a director with artistic talent. Come on, art is not something that only involves dealing with naked / half-naked women. And because the media boast, no director is a milestone in the history of Turkish cinema. Just close your ears and something real artistic, I look forward to applauding your next job. I hope you can achieve an artistic approach this time. <br /> <br /> In short; Pros> Good acting, hot women (only kidding!) :) Disadvantages> Any single thing, other than cast
