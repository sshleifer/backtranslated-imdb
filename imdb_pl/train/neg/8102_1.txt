Oh, I heard a lot of good about this film. I went to see this with my best friend (she's a woman, I'm a man). Now, allow me to divergent opinions from the mainstream. After the first few dozen "take off your clothes," we both felt a very strange combination of foolishness and boredom. We laughed (at it, not with him), we were asleep (and it would be better if we were left in bed), we were convinced that we spent the money in vain. And we had. The plot was inconsistent, and the figures were a group of people that could not be looked after. Loss of money, loss of celluloid. This film does not deserve even one of ten voices, but it's the lowest available. I'm not sure why this movie has a reputation for excellence; I do not recommend it to anyone who has at least a bit of taste or intelligence.
