Defeating bad guys ... The tag of this movie appears again, revealing a lot of truth about it. <br /> <br /> Home Alone, one and two, movie classics. Home Alone three and four, a good movie if you have three! Like Sharkboy and Lavagirl, it's as hard as trying to be funny. Culkina replaces Alex D'Linz or something else. He is a very insipid actor with insipid performances, but this is not his fault, writing speaks of insipid words and bland words. Figs are simply copied from the first two with various cheats and you would have to be blind to think that smallpox is real. A good choice if you are a pre-school teacher in which he shows this film on a rainy day. And for things to be the worst, a completely different cast, go, if you do not believe me, but you will regret it.
