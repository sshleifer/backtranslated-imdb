No doubt, Frank Sinatra was a talented actor and a talented singer. After all, very few actors can get the scene exactly in one shot, and it was quite the modus operandi of Sinatra on the set. <br /> <br /> I feel that after the 60's, the quality of the man really began to crawl. The Tony Rome series of detectives was nothing more than an attempt to compete with the series of Matt Helm Dean Martin, which appeared at the same time. Maybe even the James Bond competition, but in those years nothing really worked for Frank. His personal life in disarray, his music disappears ... Sinatra looked more like a return to the '50s. Sinatra's latest big feature from this period was probably Von Ryan's Express in 1965.
