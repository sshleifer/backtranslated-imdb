Although it is "better" than the first Mulva (which does not say much, I would rather dry paint), it still sucks. Do yourself a favor and avoid everything from those boys at Low Budget Pictures. I was pissed off buying a few DVDs to support the filmmakers, and I regretted the boy. Some have not yet been officially "released" (not bootlegs bought from the filmmakers themselves) and I can not even say how bad they are. Avoid anything that includes Teen Ape or Bonejack, because they appear in other small movies with which they are friends. If you're friends of these guys, there's a chance you've been in their movies and have fun with them. But for those who had to watch them? No way. Bad video, bad sound, bad acting, bad plot ... etc. They are not even funny. I gave it to a 2 only because Debbie Rochon is in it and that's it. Maybe it does not even deserve 2. About 1 / 16th of the star, to show it, was a bit better than the first one (which I would like to be able to assess in the negatives). If you want a decent movie without a budget, take something from LBP "friends" in Freak Productions, such as Marty Jenkins and even Raising the Stakes. They are really decent.
