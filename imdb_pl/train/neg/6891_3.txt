It starts really well, nicely intro and builds for the main characters, but after about 5 minutes the charm is lost. <br /> <br /> The character is in the same form as the main character of American Pie and Loser without supporting the cast or innovative story that made Pie movies a more commercial success. <br /> <br /> Let's be honest - Heder's acting was quite weak. Keaton, Daniels and Faris did everything they could, but they did not have a significant plot or script to get their teeth caught. The film simply continues without any pace or clear logical plot, justifying its length. as they come - so predictable I have marked the field of spoilers for this one line. <br /> <br /> My advice: avoid at all costs, unless you really have nothing else to do / listen to or watch, and even then you will feel that the producers have simply betrayed you for an hour and a half of your life.
