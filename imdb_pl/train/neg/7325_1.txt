This makes the actors at Hollyoaks look like the Royal Shakespeare Company. This movie is jaw-dropping in how terrifying it is. Turning off the DVD player was not a sufficient way to act. I want to find people responsible for this disaster and strike them in the face. You will never regain this time. Never. How can you create such a banal, boring and soulless movie? I could not think of a way of acting that would relieve boredom. Writing the required ten lines is extremely difficult for such a shameful piece of cinema. What more can you say than repeat how terrible it is to act. Please avoid.
