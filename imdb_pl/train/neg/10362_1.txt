Disney? What happened? I would really like the film to be made in the 1960s, just like a book. And I could really deal with cheap special effects to save the budget for a more accurate adaptation ..... I'm glad that maybe someone can influence the reading of books ... but, The Man With Red Eyes interchangeably as IT? And what about the volcanic shock? Where was it in the book? Peter Jackson! Save us !!!! Long ago (1978) I heard that there is a European version of this film. I would definitely like to do it. I can only imagine that it can be closer to true history than this poor adaptation. This film must be X'd.
