Throw that lame dog into the bone. Very bad ... you can watch it anyway. Kol (Ross Hagen) is an intergalactic bad guy who escapes from the evaporation by the zealous commander of the spacecraft (Jan-Michael Vincent). Kolowi manages to steal a ferry that lands on Earth. An unstoppable android killer is sent to restore dead or lively black character. John Phillip Law plays a forest guard / park who insists on caution when dealing with these two guests from a distance, from a distance. Costumes are outrageous and the script is devoid of intelligence. Vincent certainly took the money and ran. The law shows the only sign of effort. It's bad, it's almost comical. Also in the cast: Dyana Ortelli, P.J. Soles and Dawn Wildsmith.
