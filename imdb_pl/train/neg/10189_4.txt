I saw this movie years ago and I was impressed ... but then I was only 12 years old. I have recently watched it again and I want this time to come back. This movie is very bad. When I like Lee Majors, Chris Makepeace (see My Bodyguard (1980), if you would like to see a GOOD movie in which he was ... with Meatballs (also with Bill Murray) for some laughter) and Burgess Meredith does not do anything for your career. <br /> <br /> In any case, the figure of Lee Majors, Franklyn Hart, is a former racer driver who plans to drive his racing car (which he had in stock) across the country to California. One problem: the government banned all private transport. I thought that this concept was fine (not worse, which I heard about), but the implementation failed.
