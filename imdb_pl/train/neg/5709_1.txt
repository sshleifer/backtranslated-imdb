Nick Cage is Gates, treasure hunter (oh, sorry ... treasury "defender", whatever that means), which is derived from a long line of treasure hunters. One of his ancestors got a clue where the huge treasure that our Founding Fathers found, most, if not all, of the Freemasons decided to hide because they simply did not want to finance their Independence so badly. <br /> <br /> The first tip turns out to be in a long-lost ship hidden in the Arctic. Gates and his crew, consisting of financier Ian (Sean Bean), the movie Dork Riley (Justin Bartha from the immortal "Gigli") and several unnamed footmen, enter the ship's hold. Immediately pouring tons of gunpowder on the entire floor, but this is not significant in any way. In the end, they find a clue (a skeleton above it) and it turns out that it is a pipe with an inscription ... on it. Rather. Do not ask me for an explanation. <br /> <br /> It's a puzzle, and despite the fact that his expedition is clearly concerned about the lack of a real treasure, Gates wanders around shouting to himself about the meaning of the puzzles, including the frozen hold, while the crew is just standing with jaws apart . Come on. Someone should be a little noisy in his disappointment that he came to the amazing Arctic and found nothing interesting, but they just stand there when Gates enters into his own world, solving the mystery. <br /> <br /> another indication turns out to be the Declaration of Independence. Ian decides to steal it. Gates is terrified. Different characters provide an extremely obvious exposure (get used to it). All this leads to the situation in which Ian the butler pulls his gun at Gates, and the gunpowder will explode in a big explosion. (oh, that's why they shed all the dust! Huh!) Ian and his supporters are running away, and Gates and Dork Riley's movie go nine miles at temperatures below zero to the Eskimos village to stop them. <br /> <br /> To stop them, Gates finishes after trying the FBI and the Super Archivist Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger), Gates and Riley have to steal them themselves. Riley then tells Gates in terrible detail why they can not steal the Declaration because it is so protected by metal and laser eyes and advanced security technologies. Then Gates tells Riley that there is a chance to steal him from the security room. Does Riley know what the Conservation Room is, Gates asks? "A place where they make jams and jellies?" He is not kidding; this is the real line. Barth also does not provide this as a joke. So Riley does all the research on the Library of Congress and Archives, and the water and sewage, fercryinoutloud, but he does not know what the Conservation Room is. This indicates the level at which this script is located. <br /> <br /> To make the rest of it shorter, Gates actually gives up D I, in a funny break-in that can only happen in a movie. (I also hate the way they present the technology of computer monitors in movies - full of improbable and impractical graphics and fonts.) Abigail Chase ends with tagging for convenience and as an obvious "interest in love." At some point, all three are running away from the law, very loudly discussing all their plans in a clothing store, surrounded by people. <br /> <br /> A series of clues and kidnapping of Father Gates, played by the incompetent Jon Voight, leads good and bad guys to both the great home of Indiana Jones' play at New York. Strange that the metro builders have never found it. Gates and Gates Senior are leading Ian to the wild pursuit. Ian believes that they are trapped in a dead-end street and leave them there. However, after they leave, Riley asks how they will get out. Gates ... <br /> <br /> ... ojej ... <br /> <br /> ... presses the button and the door opens. No, I'm serious. A button, as they can have in a vacuum toilet in an office building. It's good that he knew where it was. In any case, after a few extra turns, they find this huge treasure room (remember, it's all under Manhattan!) Full of all sorts of historical golden things. Riley gets a really stupid line. Again. An FBI officer, Harvey Keitel, forgives them, arrests Sean Bean and lets two homeless chemists marry. <br /> <br /> I think that for each viewer it would be difficult to ignore the entire exhibition, the jumps of logic and stereotypical characters for a very long time. Although some of his exhibits include pleasant history lessons, they are put into conversation at random moments. I would like more such conversations in my life.
