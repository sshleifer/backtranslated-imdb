Has anyone edited this movie? Or maybe only the DVD edition had a huge thirty seconds between the scenes? All right, I fell asleep, watching it the first time. Then I fell asleep for the second and third time. The plot is not the worst I've seen, but it's close. Acting is not the worst I've seen ... but it's close. Production ... well, I can honestly say that it was the worst I have ever seen in my life! Not trying to be malicious, but Unhinged could use more production. <br /> <br /> Please do not think that I am a hating horror movie, and even that I did not like this movie. I just felt that I was laughing at the movie much more than I felt I was laughing at it. The gruesome moments were not too poorly made, but they could have been done better even with a modest budget. <br /> <br /> The characters seemed awkwardly developed or ignored together, the closing of the ending was quite bad, and the exposition lasted forever without too much revealing. <br /> <br /> I recommend avoiding this movie. <br /> <br /> 1/10
