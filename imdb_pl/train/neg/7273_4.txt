This early role of Barbara Shelley (in fact for the first time in the United Kingdom after working in Italy) was created at the age of 24 and it can be said that she made her debut in the Cat Girl in 1957. While the blondes and brunettes attract the most attention (I will always value Yutte Stensgaard), the lovely chestnut-haired actress with a deep voice always emanated intelligence and sensitivity (one of such examples is "The Village of the Damned from the 60s" her screen time was much smaller than her husband its hero, George Sanders). It is the only reason why he sees this gray update of "Cat People" and is seen as a huge advantage over the whole period (it's hard to say whether her beauty has found an even better presentation). Her character apparently sleeps naked, and we are exposed to her juicy bare back when she wakes up (also unveiled 8 years later in 1965 in "Rasputin-The Mad Monk"). the film is a stunning miracle strapless (I do not see what made it so beautiful, but I certainly would like it). In total, prove that Barbara Shelley in a badly-written role that would defeat the majority of actresses, gets up above her material and makes the film consistently watched a real stellar stellar test, which will soon be found in Hammer's study in Bray, for the 60's ies.
