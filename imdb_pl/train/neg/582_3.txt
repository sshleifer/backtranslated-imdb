A brilliant book with wonderful characteristics and insight into human nature, in particular the nature of addiction, which still strongly resonates today. <br /> <br /> When it comes to the movie ... eh. Nothing special. The cameraman obviously had an unfortunate addiction to circulation, encirclement and encirclement around everything, making the viewer quite sick. Why the director did not put an end to it, he is beyond me - but maybe he was too busy trying and some failure to get good performances from these usually excellent, but improperly cast actors. All in all, poor adaptation. Your three hours will be better spent reading (or re-reading) the book.
