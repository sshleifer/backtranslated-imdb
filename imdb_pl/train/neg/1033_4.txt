I grew up on Scooby Doo Where Are You, and I still love her. This is one of my favorite cartoons along with Darkwing Duck, Talespin, Peter Pan and the Pirates and Tom and Jerry. This program is good for children, the voices are good (Don Messick and Casey Kasem are perfect as Scooby and Shaggy), the melody is bearable and has a nice animation. However, this is rather disappointing. I usually do not mind Scrappy, but when he seems to be the main character, he gets very nervous. With the Puppy Power slogan, Scrappy is a bit more annoying than usual. After the first year is also missing half of the gang, somehow it did not seem to Scooby Doo. And the jokes and plot lines were generally poor and unoriginal, very little chasing monsters or exposing the bad guys. All in all, not as bad as Shaggy and Scooby Doo: Get a clue, but this program is disappointing. 4/10 for animation, voices, melodies and the fact that it is nice for children. Bethany Cox
