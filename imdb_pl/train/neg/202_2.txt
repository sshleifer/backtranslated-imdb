This is not the sound of bees, it's the effect of watching this unusually long, incredibly boring, badly preserved movie. How I managed to survive all 3 1/2 hours without falling asleep I will never know. The plot is simple ... 3 totally unlikely morons talk about sex for 3 1/2 hours. And you thought Rohmer was deadly dangerous. It's even worse if possible. > I must really be a masochist if I could watch this whole movie without turning it off ... or killing someone.
