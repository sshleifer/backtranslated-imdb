I'm sorry I missed something? Have I left earlier? The first ten minutes of extraordinary (and untrue!) History made me think, "It will be a classic." But it was all in advance! Acting was brilliant, because what is worth William H Macy is fantastic and it just gets better and better in every movie I watch it. I have been waiting for a great moment in which all stories are connected with each other, and then suddenly ... a rain frog? it was when the writer said: "I went deep down, how can I draw all these stories with calmness ... Oh, let it just rain the frogs." I like clever movies, I like weird movies, but it was just weird and boring. 4/10
