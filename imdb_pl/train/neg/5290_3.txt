Usually I do not have one movie. I try to see good sides and not focus on the bad ones, but in this case there are almost no good points. In my opinion, if you are going to do something so bad, why bother? Part of the film includes photos of Anne's face, while she breathes deeply and violin music plays in the background. the second part is filled with a bad and wooden acting game. Rupert Penry Jones is expressionless. Jennifer Higham plays younger sister Anne with modern manners. Anne is portrayed as being mild and skimpy, which is good at first, but she remains the same throughout the movie, and you do not see why Captain Wentworth falls in love with her. Generally speaking, production makes no sense because of too many mistakes to be overlooked, such as escaping from a concert, kissing on the street, running on the streets without a hat (why was this scene in the movie at all?) The scene in the book was one from the most romantic scenes written.). In conclusion, a terrible movie, very disappointing.
