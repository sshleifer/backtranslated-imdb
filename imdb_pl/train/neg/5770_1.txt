If I had to create a thermometer, this movie would be absolute zero. Out of ten stars, I rate it as follows: <br /> <br /> Chart: zero stars Video quality: zero stars Sound quality: zero stars Action: zero stars <br /> <br /> high school students met with a camera one afternoon, they invented conspiracy and made a movie. There is so much lack of artistic value that I would rather watch children walking around high school than watch this movie. <br /> <br /> HOWEVER, however, something should be said about the depths of the abyss. "The Shooting" in the stairwell is one of the most funny scenes in history. First of all, the fighters simply wave plastic rifles to each other, tugging their hands back and forth to simulate recoil. The pair actually "duck" each other's nonexistent balls. No rustling, no sparks, no empty places, just waved around with dyed sprinklers. If you want to see how two adult men play an "actor", let them spin one day ... after cleaning the fridge, combing the carpet, polishing all the door handles, grabbing the gravel, straightening the books on the shelf, etc.
