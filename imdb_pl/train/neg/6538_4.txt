Reading my review of THE HOUSE WHO HAD TRAVELED, many may assume I am about 14 years old that SCREAM is considered a "classic" horror. It is not so, because I am 30 years old and I watch horror movies for most of my life. But I admit that I am a child of the 80s who grew up on the genres of horror / zombie / ghost / cannibal etc ... so I usually prefer horror movies that are more graphic and faster. Just like someone who can appreciate other music, painting or in this case a movie - but not necessarily like them - I can appreciate why some people can enjoy this kind of movie ... Just not ... <br /> < br /> A HOUSE THAT CROSSS OVER, is an unusually boring and boring movie about a school for wayward girls. A hard-trained lady from the school rules with an iron hand (or in some cases whipping ...) to keep the girls in line. He has a young son who creeps and watches the girl while bathing (in night shirts no less (?!?) ...), meanwhile, the girls disappear from school because they are a victim of a murderer who is lurking on campus ... <br /> <br /> I can see why the DOM, WHICH COVERED, is often compared to SUSPIRY (which in my opinion is a masterpiece of the film ...) when it comes to the atmosphere of the school itself and the interaction between girls and their guardians - but this movie it is so boring and calm that I can barely sleep. I am for "tension" and "tension" in horror movies - but this movie was not for me. Fortunately, I did not expect too much, so I can not say that I was very disappointed - the house, which STREEK, only strengthened the fact that I personally do not like most of the horrors much older than the 70's. This is not a difficult and quick rule, but the ones that I had the pleasure of, definitely seem to be an exception. Probably "must see" for horror fans who like more subtle and suggestive horror movies - but because I do not really know too many fans of this kind of material, I can not really recommend it ... 4/10
