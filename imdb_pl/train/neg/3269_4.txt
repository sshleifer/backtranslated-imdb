Except for the acting of Meryl Streep, which is noteworthy as usual, I would avoid this film because it has the date of "Film of the week". But it's worth observing whether you remember a few podszytach: how a couple can withstand the control of the media and how they are treated different. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, the credibility of the different is a matter. Australians are different from "us" (most of the rest of the world), so we (most of us) automatically come to him with a bit of "strangeness" about them. The engaged couple is religious (different from most of the culture) and Adventists (others). So their lifestyle and way of thinking are suspicious at first. Dingos are different animals than other dogs, so again we are dealing with questions about strangeness. So the real story is how society (and the world) treats different people who have different accents, different beliefs than we do and how we treat what they say as suspects. <br /> <br /> It's difficult to hear the phrase "Dingo took my child!" without laughter and unfortunately humorous posts appear all over the internet. But in the years that followed this story and the film, it was discovered (as can be found in search engines) that dingos persecutes much larger children. The research of dingos experts showed that not only was it possible but also most likely that the child was taken by dingos (maybe a pair), professionally extracted from clothing and eaten in a few moments without a trace. <br /> <br /> However, the question remains, why people defended dingos when it turned out that they expose children to danger instead of killing dingo to save children. Why, because the influence of a woman (word) is so cold, it is assumed that she is guilty on and on. <br /> <br /> Haunting questions, with or without film.
