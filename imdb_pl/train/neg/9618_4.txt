I must say that although this movie was formal, the plot was stolen from films such as Friday 13. / I know what you did last summer. In fact, it was not as bad as most of the horrors that Hollywood recently released. Murders, though sometimes too clever, were in most cases only original. The cast was average, what you can expect from low-budget features, but much better than the one offered by the much larger Artisan / Lions Gate studio. My only real complaint, which was not due to the budget of the film, which had to be small, was the invention of the end of the "turn." I'm sorry, but this is just the wrong category for me. The ending was simply stupid. Before that I was a little bored, but in fact I liked it. 4/10
