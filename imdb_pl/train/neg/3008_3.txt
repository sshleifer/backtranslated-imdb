A group of people are invited to a high school meeting, but when they arrive, they discover that this is a scam from an old classmate in which they played an almost deadly joke. Now he is trying to take revenge on all those who have hurt him, closing all the exits and cutting off all telephone lines. <br /> <br /> A dark movie with an unusual assumption. This is a few good performances, some rather creative death scenes, lots of emotions and horror, a bit of humor and original ending. <br /> <br /> Priceless violence, graphic nudity, sexual situations, profanity and drug use.
