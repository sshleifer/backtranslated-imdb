OK, I really do not have much to say about this movie, except: I've seen over 4000 films in my life, and over 2,300 of them are horror movies. Although I have a hard time deciding which one is the best (as opposed to my favorite, which I can say is DEATH OF George A. Romero), I can say without hesitation that ZOMBIE BLOODBATH Todd Sheets is the absolute worst horror, I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> After this movie I can not say anything positive. Acting, dialogue, direction, make-up, music ... Every aspect of the movie is just so far below what's acceptable that it's amazing to me that it's ever been released. <br /> <br /> Even if you are a compliment to a horror movie or zombie movie, please listen to my warning and do not waste time on this trash. There is no pleasure in watching this. You will not even laugh at the total ineptitude at the exhibition ... Trust me. Please.
