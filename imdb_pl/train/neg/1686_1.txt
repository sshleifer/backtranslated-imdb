Imagine asking for a date, what movie you wanted to see, and remember that you have seen quite an intriguing teaser about "The Grudge". So, in good faith, we recommend watching this video. In the end is the Halloween season. Last weekend it did boffo box office, so it must be pretty good ... so go. <br /> <br /> And you are really shocked when the movie ends so, and you hear me say loudly: "this can not be the end of the movie ..." But, unfortunately, it is. <br /> <br /> And imagine that leaving the cinema is ashamed and embarrassed for recommending such a dog from the movie. You think your date thinks you're a fool to suggest such cruelty, and your suggestion will definitely end the promising relationship. Actually, it was so bad that we both laughed laughing at how bad it was. In the movies, I do not see the future for Miss Gellar and I suggest that she will stick to television in the future. In fact, it will not take long before it is condemned to flea market conventions selling Buffy souvenirs and can not happen soon if you ask for it. Horrible, terrible, horrible. The plot did not make sense; continuity was terrible. It is obvious that the whole ending was aimed at "Grudge II - The Return of 'Cat-Boy."
