This title seems more like a movie practice than a movie that should be made available to the public. For Dafoe and his wife, working with the film for the first time had to be great fun, not taking into account that people can watch it. I felt that I had wasted 90 minutes when I waited impatiently for the conspiracy that had evolved and even started. <br /> <br /> Try to match this movie to the genre, and you will not do it because it lacks a beginning or ending. I've seen "artistic" films and it does not even come close to being artistic, abstract or original, it just seems to be completely pointless. <br /> <br /> I think it speaks for itself when the only people who rated it as 10 were people under 18. Undoubtedly for the continuous senseless erotic scenes that the film insisted on us. I mean, if you can call it erotic. It certainly did not taste.
