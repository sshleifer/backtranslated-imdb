I do not like directing Sean Penn and this early job, The Indian Runner, is no exception. The film does not have a core, it is colored by a generic, anti-authoritarian tweeness that sincerely hurts most of Penn's works, his latest work is even more than before. Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, Clint Eastwood, Sean Penn seem to produce such an essentially banal product, allegedly in some allegiance, but in the end, they are praised in wrestling and moralistic games, almost if Hallmark cards have developed the Hell Angels' hello line, and I will make you miss the days of Liberation, which is a great movie. Viggo Mortensen's acting is much more credible here than the funny game of Eastern promises he made with Cronenberg, and that's all. The film does not make sense and it seems to be an exercise, a series of techniques, more than history. Kudos for Charles Bronson, who proves that he can act. And I wanted more of Sandy Dennis. A miserable 3 out of 10 for this nonsense Indian Runner.
