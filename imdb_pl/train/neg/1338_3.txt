I saw a change of purpose ... twice ... and always the same feeling ... you see the twins Olsen do the same movie .... they like to play different sports, and then they fall in love with boys ... OK about the movie ... First of all, all such small boys and girls do not play on such big goals ... 2. Football does not play on time limits ... 3. If the game ends, the referee gives overtime (a minute or more) ... the finish is so anticipated ... I think this movie is bad due to lack of knowledge about football .... if it was done by European producers, it would be better ... and also mane actors are not picky ... they suffer from due to lack of authenticity .. OK they played in full seasons in full house, but it does not make them big stars ... you have to show your talent. ... and this is missing in Olsen's twins
