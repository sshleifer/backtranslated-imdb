After he became a huge fan of the ten-minute episodes of "Stella Street" by T.V, I was waiting for this movie with excitement and anticipation. Unfortunately, I felt very disappointed. <br /> <br /> I was terrified that almost all the gags and one liner were directly removed from the TV episodes and delivered with less enthusiasm and comical time, as if the actors had said it once, and could not worry about repeating them . I bought my copy on a DVD and felt cheated that I parted with hard-earned cash to see the same jokes again. <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS * The story begins with Stella Street (normal English Street in Surrey), gradually populated by "some of the most famous people from the scene and screen of the last forty years", including Michael Caine, Al Pacino, Jack Nicholson and The Rolling Stones. All celebrities on the street are uprooted from the entire fortune by a local impostor and are forced to live like bums and ordinary people from the working class. There are a few nice moments, but in general, writers manage to make an interesting idea and make it quite boring. * END OF SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> In T.V's episodes, all characters are performed by John Sessions and Phil Cornwell (including the females), but in Ronni Ancona's film he is added to the cast. I think it was a mistake. Her personifications were not fun and her characters seemed to have been included in the story to give her something to do. <br /> <br /> If you have not been a fan of Stella Street episodes, you can find this funny video. But if you were a fan, I think you can leave feeling a bit cheated. 4/10
