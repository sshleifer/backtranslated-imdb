Two old people sitting on a park bench. I really do not have a problem with this scene - The only problem is that it is not a scene that is the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Yup videos do not have a too low concept. They also do not have boredom any more than this, but it's worse, because these two old men are chalk and cheese. One of them is Nat Moyer, who is a communist in Yiddish, and the other is Midge Carter, a former master of golden gloves, who is also black. Now I will see that a Jew and a black man are sitting on a park bench and get along well. I think it is possible, but unlikely, but if this movie has such a harmless scenario, why approach the Jewish stereotype? Why do they make loud tribal robbers who take oaths of Hebrew? It is somewhat ironic that the Jews seen at the beginning of the film are exactly the type of Jews we saw in Nazi propaganda films in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> Stereotypes aside my dearz the problem is that WE ARE NOT RAPPAPORT written for a completely different medium than cinema, it is based on stage art and shows. Walter Matthau sleeps through his role of Nat, while the commentator almost slept the whole movie
