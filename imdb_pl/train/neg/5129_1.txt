The message of this film is "personality is more important than beauty". Jeanine Garofalo is supposed to be an "ugly duckling", but the funny thing is that she is not ugly at all (actually she is much more attractive than Uma Thurman, a friend who looks like a model). > Would this movie work if the "ugly duckling" were really unattractive? When will Hollywood end this hypocrisy? <br /> <br /> In my opinion, despite the message you want to convey, this movie is just ridiculous. <br /> <br />
