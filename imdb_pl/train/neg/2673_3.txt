Not long enough to be long enough, and not short enough that there is one reason to have lesbian in three directions. There are worse reasons to exist. One of the sad things is that it could have been a decent full-length movie. Misty fits perfectly with her outfit and is a very conceited girl, and when people are so enchanted with the character of the game, like Lara Croft, that they make her bare pants, you know that a quick crack is exploding. Unfortunately, it is quite pathetic. Especially painfully artificial sex scene between Darian and Misty, where you can see that her hand touches the air finger. Watch this if you can not get enough of Misty or Ruby, who makes a nice blonde and has a verst jerman accent ever.
