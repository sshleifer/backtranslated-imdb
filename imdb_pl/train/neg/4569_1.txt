I can not believe that the city of Muncie is so difficult to attract attention that they are ashamed to let this performance be done there. This performance is like hitting the face of real hard-working law enforcement officers. I've never seen anything so stupid in my life. If they would say it was a comedy that would be one thing, but the statement that it's reality is a lie. I only saw it once and was terrified with what I saw. I wanted to see how a little guy is chasing a bad guy. What a joke. Nothing in the show was even close to the real world. The city of Muncie, the police chief and all officers should shame their heads and should never want to admit that they come from this city. No wonder he was not on TV
