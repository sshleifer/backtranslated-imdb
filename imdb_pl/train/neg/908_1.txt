After buying a DVD in a container for bargains due to the impressive number of features mentioned on the cover, I threw it into the DVD player and everything looked good. Nice animated menu and many additional features ... but when I was playing the movie itself, what a profession. This is the worst thing I have ever seen and seen bad movies in my time. The commentary that praises the film here at IMDB comes from the people who made the movie. So do not believe it unless you like to waste cash!
