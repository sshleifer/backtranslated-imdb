A young boy has a lot of money and quickly starts living. Unfortunately, the man whose money really happens is very bad. He wants to get his loot back. When he discovers who has bucks, he begins to try to get him back. It is constantly being thwarted by a small child who is lucky not to fall into the hands of an evil man. Sounds familiar, I bet. Very predictable, not at all interesting. Come with something a bit different, ok guys?
