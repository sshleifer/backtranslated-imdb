Spanish icon of horror Paul Naschy in this, one of his weaker movies of a werewolf ... but hold on for a moment. Most people will be familiar with this title in the most popular TV title THE FURY OF THE WOLF MAN, and over the years many of his home video versions have appeared. If you want serious approach to a reliable shot, the most practical version that I saw is the title THE WOLF MAN NEVER SLEEPS and it is an unedited and complete European version that restores several disturbing scenes and contains original nude shots that are missing from FURY. It is also in the mailbox. <br /> <br /> Naschy plays Waldemar Daninsky, returning home from a trip to Tibet, only to find out that he fell in love with a werewolf and that his wife is having an affair. He looks after her and her lover in animal form, but then becomes a guinea pig for a sexy doctor and her assistant. Apparently the doctor is trying to "tame" the werewolf, and between her and the hairy and forged Daninski who is in her trance, at least in the original version, is a very strange sado-masochistic love scene. Eventually, we get two werewolves for the price of one, because Daninsky is fighting the she-wolf! <br /> <br /> The biggest problem in the film is that the director (according to Naschy's claims) was often drunk, and the results are actually rather inconsistent. While watching the copy of THE WOLF MAN NEVER SLEEPS, it is not so difficult to recognize what is happening, although the editing remains awful in places. The worst is the occasional, unmatched recording of wolf werewolf Naschy straight from another previous movie (LA MARC DEL HOMBRE LOBO, aka "FRANKENSTEIN'S BLOODY TERROR") and mixed with it for no reasonable reason! The wolf's clothes change from black shirt to white and back, just like his behavior; in one moment, the wolf circulates lethargically in the hypnotic trance of FURY, and then growls and runs wild with BLOODY TERROR. Really weird.
