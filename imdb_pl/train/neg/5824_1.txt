I thought at least it would be beautifully beautiful. It was slow, pretentious and boring. I almost fell asleep. There are a few decent songs, but in the end there is one song, which is just a guy who yells "Yaowwww!" While someone taps randomly into a wooden object. Having said that, there are some nice songs, but it's not worth watching the hte movie. Go to iTunes (have an album), watch it and choose the good ones. <br /> <br /> Half of the movie is a guy doing tea. Well, it's a slight exaggeration. But you'll see what I mean, if you see it. That said: DO NOT SEE!
