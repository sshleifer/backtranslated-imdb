Apparently, most viewers know nothing about the history of Europe, including Germany, Hungary and all Central and Eastern Europe, as well as the era of Hitler and Stalin. Nuremberg (and many forgotten processes all over Europe) was a revenge and injustice of the winners. Why do you think that after the Second World War there were no accused American, British, French or Soviet? There were no American, British, etc. War crimes? There were no Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Tokyo, Dresden, Hamburg, Berlin, Katyn and so on? The Germans also had war crimes, but in Nuremberg justice was not a real factor. The main point was: Vae victis! Germany must die! (This was also the title of the book in America, 1941). <br /> <br /> This movie is a terrible, naughty American brainwashing tool full of errors, lies, propaganda, prejudices and injustices. And above all: full of hypocrisy. But no wonder ... Why was the Nuremberg trial itself insufficient? This movie is a nightmare. Total darkness after 60 years! This darkness (and hatred, narcissism and lack of self-criticism) is the real cause of the massacres in Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Serbia, Iraq and so on. And there are no American war criminals ... Hooray, America! Very smart. Even Stalin would be jealous of him ...
