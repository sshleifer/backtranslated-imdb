This video, which was released directly on the video, should contain a warning label that it is dangerous to human health and can expose the viewer to boredom. This is another veiled, evangelizing, "religious" religious film in which good people (believers) suddenly disappear, and bad people (unbelievers) are left behind. This is an interesting concept, especially since we can see that this happens during the flight under the supervision of an unbeliever who has a sinful affair with the stewardess on board (needless to say that the sinner does not disappear!). Unfortunately, when all pilots do not believe, the plane did not fall or the film would be graciously ended. Although it may be interesting without a serious religious experience, as a whole, the filmed movie creates one gag, the acting is terrible, and of course computer-generated simulations look very false. Plus, this is another film made in Canada, which is to be New York. Save me ... I just read the Bible.
