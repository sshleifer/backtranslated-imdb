If this series was supposed to be Batman's improvement - The Animated Series, I, for example, think that it did not work out. The character's drawing is poor ... (Catwoman, for example, looks terrible ...) But what really annoyed me is that Batman looked like a kind of mollusk that simply can not be dealt with in battle, without the help of two , even three helpers. I mean, he's Batman, for God's sake! I know comics, I know that Nightwing and Batgirl are supposed to be Batman's allies, except Robin, but still ... they make Batman say he needs help from them ... What, can not deal with a few blows? At BTAS, he could easily face a dozen or so enemies ... Aging? Next ... <br /> <br /> And one more thing: I really do not think that Batman would allow such a child as Tim Drake to enter the battle so quickly without years of hard training. First of all, it's irresponsible (and Batman is everything but irresponsible), and secondly, it's not what happened in the comics if we are to remain faithful to them. <br /> <br /> Batman - the animated series has gone down in history, with its animation, stories and characters ... It really was a Batman legend. The New Adventures series changed the legend into another Batman movie.
