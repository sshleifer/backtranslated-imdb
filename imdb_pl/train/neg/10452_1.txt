I saw 22 showing and I have to say that this movie was nothing special. Although I did not leave the theater, wanting to regain time (because I do not pay for films anymore), I did not really find any redeeming qualities. <br /> <br /> There were a few lines and those that made giggles, but mainly the movie seemed to consist of mad support for the younger fans (with more in mind than the age of the film is rated as R) for the male audience. The fans' service seemed out of place and rather distracted. I know you would all like to hear Samuel L. say his infamous line, but let's be honest, it's a lot of buzz for very little profit. The only really terrible part of the movie was CG, which looked very digitized and did not fit well into live action on the screen. <br /> <br /> Now I am a reasonable man, I knew that I am entering the theater that I will not see "Casablanca", or at least I am grateful that this film is an original idea, not re-make or franchising. However, if I am to be honest, if you're not part of a cult, it's probably better to spend your money somewhere else and watch a movie in a second theater in a few weeks or rent it in a few months.
