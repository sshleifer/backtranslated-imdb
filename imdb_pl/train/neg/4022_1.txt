This movie was terrible. I watched it three times, or even the whole. Watching is simply impossible, history is sucked, depressing and totally disgusting. I do not write spoilers for anything, so if you want to know why it's so disgusting, see for yourself. The only good thing about this movie was John Savage, his dialogue at the beginning and some fun parts in the movie. A small child in this movie is annoying and the whole situation is nonsense. I saw this film in film stores across America, so I assumed it would be a good movie. Jesus Christ, was I wrong !!!! Acting is terrible, and the nakedness itself is lame and nasty. Another thing is that Starr Andreef, the second main character, has not been in such bad films in the past, in fact she was pretty good. Same with John Savage. This movie SUCKS!
