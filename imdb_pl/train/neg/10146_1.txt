"Flight Of Fury" is a shockingly tragic, but the worst of all boring action movies - I do not expect much from Seagal Film, I expect only moderate entertainment for 90 minutes with some thoughtless actions - unfortunately it does not even achieve such a low expectation, action scenes they are few in number, the plot (which is completely irrelevant in these films) is unnecessarily complicated and confusing with huge story holes throughout the game. Acting is really hopeless - it borders troublesome for Seagal and his whispering "One expression is the best among the pitiful fate of the 3rd rescuers". It's hard for me to believe that almost 12 million dollars have been spent on this terrible mess, unless 11 million of this 12 is Seagal's Salary - I doubt it in some way! The only moment of interest of Straights or gays is that seemingly nowhere are two hot babes going to some lesbian sex scene with huge shows other than this - These are average things that do not differ from many films B Michael Dudikoff, znosi≈Çem <br / > <br /> 1/10
