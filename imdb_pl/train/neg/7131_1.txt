I like bad movies. I like to rent bad movies to my friends and rip them while they last. Then there are such disgusting films. Redline is not only a bad film, but a telling sign that perhaps the American film industry should, for the benefit of the viewer, at least correct the scripts before financing the film. <br /> <br /> If the stereotype took shit, this movie would be reborn from it. The story is unbearable, and the acting is ridiculous. Nadia Bjorlin and Eddie Griffin may have the worst screen chemistry I've seen for a long time, and even they should be isolated from humanity and beaten with a bag of oranges until they change their profession into street traders (for the only thing they can legally get into qualify). In addition, Angus Macfadyen's conviction to make this film is so far beyond me that I can not even think about analogy. I'm his faithful fan, but that made me ask him a question. <br /> <br /> In summary. A few people want revenge for various reasons (and if you care about knowing what they are, you're a bigger person than me), so much so that it turns into violence (I think). The movie is like Ouroboros, a snake that swallows its own tail, it is an endless cycle of confusion and dialogue that does not fit the human ears. This film is basically one big car advertisement in the first half and an unrecognizable action movie to the end, it should be avoided at all costs. <br /> <br /> I would like to find a positive aspect in this one, and I think it's because the subtitles start spinning. <br /> <br /> PS Nadia Bjorlin, if you were singing these two songs in this movie, you are a hack and I hope that old age will destroy you. <br /> <br /> P.S.S. If you're renting this movie looking for a funny experience, listen to the lyrics of Nadia Bjorlin's amazing songs.
