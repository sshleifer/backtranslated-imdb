Thanks to this movie, I can now answer the question: "What is the worst movie you've ever seen?" <br /> <br /> I can not even come up with a short second, and I've seen some really bad movies. <br /> <br /> Absolutely nothing works in this movie. List one element of each horror movie, and this movie will fail. Honestly, I've seen better on YouTube. Here's a typical dialogue: <br /> <br /> "Steve?" "Steve?" "Steve, is that you?" "Steve, I'm not kidding" "Steve, that's not funny!" "Steve, are you there?" "Steve?" "Steve?" "Steve?" <br /> <br /> "ARGgh !!!! Ahhhhhh !!!! Nooooooo! "
