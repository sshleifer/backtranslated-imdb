Do not get me wrong, I assumed that this movie would be stupid, to be honest, I gave it an incredibly low standard to meet. The only reason I even saw it was that there were a few girls (another story for a different time). When I started watching something I noticed, this movie was awful. Now there are two kinds of horrible things, Freddy vs. Jason terrible, where you and your friends sit down, laugh and joke, how awful it is, and then there's a movie. The cat in the hat did not arouse even the momentary interest in me. When I watched the first part of it, I was not only bored senseless, but it felt like I was somehow disturbed by the horror of the movie. Mike Myers is usually brilliant, I love most of his work, but something in this movie has not been clicked. One of the things that the director / producers / writers / changers have changed is that they refused to use any of the colors of the original book (red, black, white) on any character, but on Cat. Incidentally or not, they also refused to intercept any of the originals (and I hate to use the word, but it fits) to the disappearance of the original. The book was like an ice Sunday, colorful and tasty, and the film was so colorless and difficult to swallow as sawdust. <br /> <br /> Avoid it like a leprosy prostitute.
