Okay, I tried and tried, but I WILL NOT DOWNLOAD Guy Maddin. The stories from the Gimli hospital left me cold, this movie about Austrian villagers and the one about the Ice nymph looked nice, but it was missing in the plot section ... and this film about nudity about abortion and hockey is just boring. I am glad that Maddin appreciates silent cinema, but I do not like his films for the same reason that I do not like Quentin Tarantino's films: they are a blank tribute to better, more fanciful films - films that develop art or broke new ground - and they are all stylish and without substance. No amount of jumps and strange camera angles can hide the fact that Maddin is a non-original would-be David Lynch, although he has one advantage over Tarantino: generally he does not write an embarrassing dialogue because most of his films are based on subtitles. The most important thing is that schtick Maddina is a clever ingenious film for beginner filmmakers.
