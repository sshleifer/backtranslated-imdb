I rented it by mistake. I thought, after a cursory examination of the box, it is a story about time travel / science-fiction. Instead, this is a "Christian" story and I suppose it is a fairly typical example. If you sell a message, you'll probably forget about the awkwardness of the plot / acting / etc, but I found it quite painful. <br /> <br /> I must admit that I am concerned about rewriting history in this story. Paints the 90s of the nineteenth century as a paradise of family values ​​and morality (the character is terrified that 5% of marriages end in divorce!), But ignores the very unpleasant sides of this "highly moral" society (rigid racial, sexual social discrimination was common , e.g). At some point, the hero complains to the owner of the clothing store for things that do not sound different than complaints from some Iranian leaders about women's styles (as reported by the recent WSJ). <br /> <br /> In general, I thought, I suppose it's something you like, if you like this type of thing, and it's certainly healthy ...
