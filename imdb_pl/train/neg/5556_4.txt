During the first 17 minutes of Bradford May's "Dark Dark Die" directed by Bradford May, we have already been subjected to a silly summary and accompanying lecturer on the first two films, hilarious, over-the-top, about three minutes of material just ripped from the second movie and a slightly changed release, to seem like a new movie material, as well as a long commercial, whose scars and tormented title character are watching Universal Theme Parks - Universal, which is the company that spread the film. Yes, "Darkman III: Die Darkman Die" is pretty good when it comes to cheap money for the success of the previous movie. <br /> <br /> This time the disfigured anti-hero Peyton Westlake (aka, "Darkman", he played the character "Mummy" of actor Arnold Vosloo) closes the horns with the evil master criminal and bad husband Peter Rooker (played well by Jeff Fahey) in the course of 87 minutes the film grows to develop the feeling for Rooker's wife and daughter, once again learning to take care of another person. <br /> <br /> Bla. Blah. Blah. <br /> <br /> This movie is just a stupid way for the studio to earn a bit more from the original film by Sam Raimi, which I think is a great action movie. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, there are also some stupid threads, including the abomination that was supposedly one of the original doctors who saved Darkman from his scars, and she seduces our hero to think he is an ally before revealing her a vile plot to help Rooker create more rebellious people like Darkman. Apparently, he can not just do the same procedure with the bandits she played on Darkman. Why? I really can not explain it because the movie definitely does not. <br /> <br /> There is also a sub-plot of the murder involving the District Prosecutor who threatens to overthrow Rooker and some other very stupid things. <br /> <br /> But that does not really add up. This movie seems to be two or three episodes of a TV series assembled more than a real movie. The direction changes between quite good and even sloppy (the scene in which Darkman drives his train vehicle and avoids the rocket launcher is simply stupid), and the edition is a mixed bag. The film simply moves too fast for anyone to really care about what's going on. And without spoiling it, the last 15 minutes of this movie, and even the whole series is just ... I do not know ... Another 15 minutes of recording with a mixed bag. <br /> <br /> In fact, when commenting on editing, one of my favorite things in this movie is watching material re-used from previous movies, and then searching for footage that is repeated many times. Yes, it's so cheap. One thing is re-filming at the beginning of the movie, or maybe repeating the shot or two, but in their huge amount (minutes of material repeated from previous films) it is simply careless and amateur. /> <br /> I must also say that Darkman's psychedelic montage is somewhat exaggerated in this film. They are so stylized and exaggerated that they work, but only in light doses and in the right context, like Raimi in the original movie. There are at least four or five here, and they feel very violent and out of place. <br /> <br /> With this in mind, the movie is not devoid of certain good points. A few action scenes are well done. This banal story of Darkman, who longs for real life, works well with the direct DVD playback function. Some actresses are nice, especially from Rooker's wife, embodied in the beautiful Roxann Dawson. In addition, although there is no Danny Elfman, composer Randy Miller composes some nice music, which is based on the original Elfman motifs. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie is too fast, cheap and stupid to take it seriously. Arnold Vosloo seems alternatively bored and spontaneous from stage to scene, and Fahey, while the joy of watching as a brazen villain simply does not fit the series. <br /> <br /> Like "Darkman II", I recommend it to the fans of the original who will surely laugh. Otherwise, you do not have to apply. Four out of ten.
