Tony Goldwyn is a good actor who apparently tries his hand in directing. "A Walk on the Moon" seems to borrow from other, better-made films. The current story takes place at the end of the sixties in the summer resort for working-class Jews near Woodstock. The film processing of Pamela Gray has little to say, so this is a mystery why Mr. Goldwyn decided to take care of this film as the first attempt at direction. <br /> <br /> The Kantrowitz family spends some time at the resort. We see them coming to a small house that will be their temporary home. Marta, my father, comes only for the weekend; he works mainly in a family company dealing in small equipment repairing TV sets. In a few days the first man will walk in space, so excitement is obvious. <br /> <br /> Women from Kantrowitz are left behind. Pearl, wife of Marty and her mother-in-law, Lilian, spend idle days until the "seller of shirts" arrives. Pearl goes to browse and finds a lot more than a cloth; she also has a seller. It looks like Pearl and Marty do not have sex life at all. After the two children, Pearl, who seems to be sexy and have a high libido, she is ready for additional marital play. <br /> <br /> This is the basic premise of a movie that becomes a soap opera when a young daughter, Alison, decides to play bizarrely and go to the nearby Woodstock festival, where, horrified by horror, she is a witness how her own mom meets with the blouse seller! What is the girl supposed to do? Well, be vigilant for the grand finale, when all the parties are happily connected by the bed of the little son, when he is stung by wasps, and the seller comes to apply some home remedy, and dad is called out of town after learning the betrayal of Pearl from a younger stud . <br /> <br /> Poor Diane Lane, she went to "Unfaithful" later, which is an exclusive version of this bagpipe. Viggo Mortensen is a salesman who satisfies lonely clients, whispering something in their ears! Liev Schreiber as Marty, horned husband, does not have much to do. Anna Paquin plays rebellious Alison, and Tovah Feldshuh is an unhappy Nana who would like to stay in the city and watch her soap operas instead of witnessing a first-hand game that plays in her own yard! <br /> <br /> Watch it at your risk, or throw a DVD disc on the TV when you have a cool crowd at home and you really want to laugh or two silly videos.
