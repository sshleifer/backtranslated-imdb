We rented a DVD with the hope of a good western. The film was nice and the scenes were reasonable, but the ideas were very bad. Here are my problems with the movie. <br /> <br /> In the first part, why the bad guy killed the owner of the mine? Not really related to the movie, except to find out how bad he was and have a hiding place. <br /> <br /> A bank employee who went wrong, simply does not work well enough to make a convincing decision to hire assassins for his employers. At least guess. No character has ever developed for bank owners or a bank employee. <br /> <br /> A lot of delays in many events. <br /> <br /> The absurd assumption that Martin still needs to see the judge after the gang has confessed to killing his parents-in-law. Even more absurd that he admits to the judge and the judge, he will not listen to the sheriff. even more ridiculous that Martin hanged himself and broke the rope, the sheriff takes him at gunpoint to eventually return to his city and save his wife from a bad bank employee. Would he not come back after a quick gang shipment to save his wife and arrest a bad guy from the bank? Just send a judge a note that the gang admitted before killing on the trail ???? !!! In general, very sad acting and it makes no sense to film.
