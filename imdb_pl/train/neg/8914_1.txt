I had to stop watching this movie (a pseudointelectual product for pretentious movie viewers) twenty minutes ago because it was mediocre and boring enough to inspire yawning, not to mention that I was soon close to the $ 3.99 I wasted in Blockbuster. The actress of Joanna Pacula and her horribly directed Slavic accent are terrible enough to take the trouble to grit their teeth. I knew that two hours would be too much for two hours. Both Breuer and Nietzsche play little-known actors with strikingly few talents. In the subject of talent, it appears that the haughty assistant Breuer was removed from the local acting group. She apparently did not learn her craft. In fact, it is really terrible. All public stages looked staging, and the stats went mechanically on Sunday. Disabling this movie was much more satisfying than turning it on. Do not rent this horrible movie. You will be sorry that you spent your money.
