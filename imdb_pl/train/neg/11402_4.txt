Exactly what you can expect from B-Movie. Different, unpaid nudity, boring parts, ridiculous gore and shoddy special effects. Of course it could have been better, better (definitely) better to write, direct, etc. But it probably would not be a movie. Actors are sucked, in fact it seems to be an episode with a vampire buff, or except for blood, profanity and nudity. <br /> <br /> Tiffany Shepis must be honored. She is absolutely the queen of the new millennium. It's not that acting really matters in these movies, but it was better than other actors. She is also hot in this plastic coverall she wore in the whole movie - wow! Her back is absolutely stunning in this outfit, I mean that every time you turn around, you can help, but check her out. And towards the end of the film the viewer is rewarded seeing it completely nekked. <br /> <br /> So if you have a looser hip-hop horror movie (like me), check it out. If not, you should avoid at all costs.
