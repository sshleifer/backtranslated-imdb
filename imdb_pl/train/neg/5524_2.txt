I did not like this movie for many reasons. During the first ten minutes of the film I was very disappointed and came to the conclusion that if this movie is saved, at least for me, it will have to get out of the huge hole that he dug. Unfortunately this did not happen. Two fates of the film is for me a meeting with Jane Fonda and Felicity Huffman. I do not know enough about Lindsey Lohan's work to get interested in what she brings to the film. Then I felt disappointed and for all three, even though in each of their performances there were "moments". I imagine that for each of them finding their "moments" was a very difficult task, given the incredible lack of character development and boring dialogue. Although the plot is interesting, the whole movie is so badly written, directed and edited that any performance as an actor would suffer and would be contaminated by it. The impudent way he dealt with sexual abuse and the trivial and offensive point of view of small-town America are the two main reasons why this movie failed. As one reviewer pointed out and I would agree, the film is almost impossible to put on the market, given that it is ready. I suspect this, or at least I hope (at least for the benefit of the actor) there are real jewels on the floor of the cutting room. Sad for us, but if it is true, the actors can feel the comfort and feel a bit good, lending their talents and time to such a flap. Oh, and one more thing ... I just wanted to see an American movie once, which included sad disappearing, but wonderfully bucolic settings, such as the one in this movie, in which the main characters were not distracted and / or did not respect the rural side with pop cans, broken plates and other such trash!
