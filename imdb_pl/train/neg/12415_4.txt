I do not remember that "Barnaby Jones" was nothing more than an ordinary, standard detective series, in which, as every show by Quinn Martin shows, Act I was a murder, Act II was the main figure who invented the murder, Act III was a turn of action ( another figure murdered), Act IV was a resolution, and Epilogue was Betty (Lee Meriwether), asking his father-in-law Barnaby Jones (Buddy Ebsen) how he discovered the crime, and then someone said something witty end of the concert. <br /> <br /> One of the things I remember was the great lead song of composer Jerry Goldsmith. Oddly enough, the next credit sequence made me want to see the show and the show was in the air for seven seasons. I also admit that it was nice to see Ebsen in a different role than Jed Clampett, even though Ebsen was poorly manned. I just wanted the program to be more entertaining than when I first remembered it. <br /> <br /> Update (1/11/2009): I watched an interview with composer Jerry Goldsmit on YouTube through their archive of the American TV channel. Let's say I was more polite than Goldsmith about the "Barnaby Jones" program.
