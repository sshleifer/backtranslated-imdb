Whoever wrote the script for the movie apparently never consulted any books on Lucille Ball, especially her autobiography. I have never seen so many mistakes in my biography, from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but it goes on pages. All in all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those unique people who simply can not be represented by anyone but themselves. If I was Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irritated by how many mistakes were made in this film. The creators of the film tried very hard, but the movie seems terribly messy.
