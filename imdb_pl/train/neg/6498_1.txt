I've seen bad movies, but this one will definitely receive the "Worst Film of Life" award !! Anthony Hopkins must be completely mentally ill to be attached to this name - anywhere! I will never see another movie with him, directing it etc. etc. Etc.! I can not believe that the other actors and actresses I liked (in this picture) leaned so low to be part of this disaster! There must be some great drugs there! Anyone who is not ashamed to be part of such a movie is beyond me! Save on this! HUGE FLOP from beginning to end! Shame, Mr. Hopkins! It's also a shame for Christian Slater! I can not believe you put your reputation on this line!
