This program is really overrated. A detective like Danny Pino's hot figure would have been transferred years ago to the "rubber guns" unit. The whole branch consists of picky Egoists who assess people whose activities reach for decades according to 2007 standards. Every veteran from Vietnam he ever had turned out to be an assassin unless he was another veteran of Vietnam. There was only one black killer, and his white boss told him to do it. The only Latino assassin was a "racial traitor" who killed another Spaniard to frame a Latin street kid for a crime committed (naturally) by two rich white children. What a bunch of propaganda. Hey, screenwriters: minorities and poor people are also committing murder. Only in this concert are the most murderers from the upper white class. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the arrest of people in the 70s, 80s and 90s for crimes committed 50-60 years ago is a joke. No district prosecutor will push the murder, because it means the state will be trapped with their massive medical bills until they kick off. The state will do a favor to your families and insurance companies. The prosecutor will simply admit to a forced involuntary death and will not serve for the day. The only really serious criminals who go to jail are organized criminal people or former Nazis whose loud beliefs increase the career of the prosecutor.
