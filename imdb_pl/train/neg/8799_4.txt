Recognition for the patience of Paul Muni, who spent hours every day in the make-up salon to look like part of Zola. Muni was one of the greatest stars of the 1930s and I wonder how many people today - apart from classic cinema lovers - know something about it. He has been a giant in the industry for at least ten years. He could have won an Oscar for the performance that would give him two in a row because he won it for Louis Pasteur a year earlier. In my opinion, it is true that although he tended to act too much, I still think he was one of the great actors of the "Golden Age". Whatever he played; you were tied to the screen, watching it. <br /> <br /> Unlike the role of Pasteur, I thought that this story has a bit too much of what we have seen in the last 60 years: exaggeration to become a hero Liberal. Even in 1937 Hollywood was not able to stop contempt for the police or the army, here we are told how "corrupt" these organizations are. Filmmakers love it when power is questioned and defeated. In this respect, this movie is ahead of its day, since we've seen this great period since the 1960s. <br /> <br /> However, it should be noted that facts confirm this story. In no way does this diminish Zola's achievements as a social reformer, depriving him of evil. Good for him! I would like them to spend more time showing this than concentrating on one attempt.
