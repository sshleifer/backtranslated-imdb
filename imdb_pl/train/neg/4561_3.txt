Trailers will take you to the movie, but the movie just was not worth my 8.50 ... it has some good effects, but the story ... yech, I like tommy lee jones and I will be a blacksmith as actors, they both did something good, but I would like them not to add this to your resume. Honestly, the book is better ...
