I think it could have been a decent movie, and some of its parts are okay ... but it's a B movie in its entirety. As in the case of the story, the parts are OK, but it has a few holes and strangers that do not add up. The operation is mostly OK, I also saw worse. :) <br /> <br /> The beginning sets the level, with cars driving through the desert, making "cool", but completely unnecessary jumps through small dunes (in slow motion! Cool!), as drivers have never seen the sand before .. From there it gets a little better, but not much. <br /> <br /> If you intend to rent it, get one more and use it as a warm-up. Have low expectations and you may succeed.
