This move was on TV yesterday. I'm guessing that as a filler of time because it is badly sucked! The movie is just an excuse to show off some tits and ass at the beginning and somewhere half way. (But not bad tits and butt). But the story is too funny for words. The "Wolf", if you can call it, almost is not fully saved. When it is fully visible, it is clear that they had several interns working on CGI, because the wolf runs as if running on a treadmill, and the CGI fur looks like waxed, all shiny :) <br /> <br /> The movie is full blood and blood, and you can easily see who will be killed / cut / eaten next. Even if you like this type of spray video, you will be disappointed, they have not done a good job. <br /> <br /> Do not even start with the actors ... Very scant lines and girls scream at everything every 5 seconds. But on the other hand, if someone asked me for bad acting just to give me a few bucks, hey, where should I register? <br /> <br /> Generally boring and funny horror.
