I can see what the director tried to do, but he missed the sign. The main actor was really good, but the editing around him brings you out of it. The work of the camera, i.e. Lighting and display, is a kind of amateur that I could forgive if the direction was more fluid, but it was not. The sound was somewhat detached, and besides, it takes you out of the movie. I can see that this director can do a bit better in the future, so it's not a total one right away, but do not expect DVD movie to be as good as 28 days later or not, keep your expectations low and get more then At least it was an hour and a half. Oh yes, and the main acting was pretty bad if you asked me. But I'm a movie snob, so take it for what's worth it.
