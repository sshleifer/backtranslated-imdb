One of my best friends brought this movie for one night with the words "Do you want to watch the worst horror in history?" I always like to laugh at a bad horror movie and say "yes". I was expecting your typical cheesy b-slass, but it was beyond B. This is Z-slasher, the lowest of the lowest. With an obvious low budget, extremely bad performance, bad lighting, no plot, really bad so-called "special effects", trembling cameras and a terrible soundtrack, makes films like the House of Wax look like Oscar-winning masterpieces. The only good thing is that about 15 seconds of one of the heroes becomes topless - she had very nice tits. Most of what I said during this movie was "Wow, it's so BAD", "It's the worst movie in history" and "I'm not drunk enough." To sum up: do not waste your time (or money!).
