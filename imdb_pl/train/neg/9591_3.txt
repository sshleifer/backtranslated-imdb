If you've read the original novel, like me, you will probably hate this thing. <br /> <br /> The film version of _Absolute Beginners_ is a nightmare conglomeration of anachronisms of the 1980s, trying to create a set of "era" in the late 1950s and not to create or even pay tribute to this period - the American monstrosity _Dirty Dancing_ is similar to 1963, except that the film turned out to be a financial success despite equally amateur writing on the screen. In addition to suffering from "looking back to the 1980s," the characters have been changed, arranged and downplayed to the point that the only features common to those of the novel are the smallest superficial appearance and, of course, their names: Suze is transformed from a skimpy former girl a narrator and a promiscuous negrofila who eagerly plans to marry an old queen for money (for her own admissions on the first few pages) into a wretched and naive "Eve" - ​​an archetype seduced by fame and glamor, used and somehow deceived by her boss who unexpectedly did not get Van Dyke and pointy hairstyle. She and the narrator, renamed "Colin" (after the author of the book, Colin MacInnes) for the film, are also in a relationship. <br /> <br /> The figure of the great Jill, a lesbian apparently still massaging "" at the age of about 20 years, which acts like a pimp on the cadre of young lesbians with the heads of the bubble, and one of the narrator's closest friends, giving the narrator honest wisdom, boils down to something like a "named supplement" with just a few lines to throw away and tons of comic outfits. <br /> <br /> Fabulous Hoplite, a gay young man and another close friend of the narrator in the novel, is also reduced to the point that there is no sense in the movie, camped and almost ignored. <br /> <br /> The father of the narrator in the novel is a kind of sad, small character, but in the movie he played so optimistic and strange, despite the miserable neighborhood, and the disorder of his marriage with the mother of the narrator seems to be ignored for practical reasons. <br /> <br /> In his favor, the music (on what it is) is well composed and you have to give the record label and recognition team that he actually took from the book ("... a few days, they will write musicals about 50s ... ") as an inspiration to write a musical, but in the world of bad moods musicals it is one of the worst performed musicals. Unlike _Shock Treatment_ or _Starstruck_, key elements of the story are treated as reflections. Unlike _The Apple_, there is a large and uneven flow between musical numbers and spoken dialogue. <br /> <br /> You can not really blame it is "too eighties" when it comes to the fact that it was created in the 80's. The film version of "Annie" released in 1981, miraculously pays tribute to the New York style of the 1930s, and _Napolean Dynamite manages to capture the characteristic appearance and style of the eighties, although it was created for a low budget in 2003 (though not this is clearly established in the eighties, those who survived a decade can not deny that the film "feels very eighties"). Of course, it was possible to do something about it, especially considering the iconic status that the source novel has in the UK, but apparently fails in appearance and feeling, and in treating the source material, which is even disrespect. <br /> <br /> Maybe, if you did not read and did not intend to read the novel, you could enjoy this anachronism from the 1980s, giving a heinous parody to the modernist Soho jazz set in London from the 1950s. I definitely see what the writing team tried, but they could definitely do better. With Boy George as a home name and mixed-race musicians and bands in the 1986 charts. In Britain, they definitely did not have to bow to the characters in the way they did. Indeed, I would say that the writers finished doing what both the book and the film criticized critically - it ended that an adult group had made nonsense and treated the target teenager like two idiots to break down quickly.
