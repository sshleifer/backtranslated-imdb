I thought that Zombie Flesh Eaters 2 is a pretty good horror. When a terrorist's body, infected with a stolen chemical, is recovered by the US military, the corpses are then cremated, releasing the virus into the atmosphere on a small island. Soon, infected locals turn into hungry zombie bodies, and a group of soldiers on vacation must connect with a group of tourists and get into an abandoned hotel, trying to repulse aggressive living corpses. I did not consider this movie as good as the original Zombie Flesh Eaters movie. But it was still a good horror with a good action. I did not think it was one of the best in this series. 4/10
