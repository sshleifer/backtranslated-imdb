This is by far the worst horror / thriller I've seen in 29 years. If someone offers it for you for free, tell them NO. This movie makes you a stupid person for watching it. The plot is not even the worst part of the movie ..... it's an acting game, camera work, lighting and sound. there is nothing to like in this film. whoever paid for this movie is now broke. I hope that the director will never get the green light for the next movie. In his defense, this film was quickly made to use the real hit of the BTK assassin, but I saw a movie from the weeks that looked like the winners of the Oscar compared to that.
