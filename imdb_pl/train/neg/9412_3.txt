This film was screened as part of the Sydney Mardi Gras film festival in 2007. I did not expect a movie because someone else chose it for me. <br /> <br /> I actually like movies that take time to develop, videos that allow characters to evolve and let stories tell. Tranquility is good. But this movie was just slow. <br /> <br /> The loan must be transferred to the two main actors. There was a sense of tension between them, because two completely different people, really different, meet in a very awkward way. There were delicate moments and sadness when we learned more about them. <br /> <br /> I also liked the setting and the way it was made. It was claustrophobic and monochromatic and added to the intimacy of the film and reinforces the character's bizarreness. <br /> <br /> I just do not understand the ending. What was the meaning of all this?
