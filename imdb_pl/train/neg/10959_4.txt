I am a fan of the series and read all 7 books. I wanted to see it, to see how it happened. I can only say that the only people who should watch this are people who have already read the series and are curious about it. It is very bad and will reject it when reading. It does not mean it, but Lucy is so ugly that it hurts the movie. Was she the director's daughter? Seriously, I'm sure the beavers in the movie were jealous of her teeth. She had an overbite that would embarrass any beaver. The film simply loses so much in translation. CS books do not translate as easily as Tolkein LOTR books or even Harry Potter books. <br /> <br /> They did one well! Aslan! very well done. Although other human actors with painted faces (beavers, wolves) look stupid, Aslan was really well done, because he was not just an actor. (I guess that old custume horse? 2 people inside?) I would also be curious what children think about this film. Maybe they'll like it? But as for adults, a safe bet is not a habit, even if a CS fan.
