Each new show in the autumn composition deserves at least my policy "3 strokes and went out". I give comedy 3 chances to make me laugh, that is, 3 full episodes. After episode 1, I told the TV "Canceled tomorrow". It was so bad. I watched the first 4 episodes of "Cavemen" and I still could not calm down. Not titter, guffaw, chortle, in fact, there is no face movement. I will continue to punish myself, watching each future episode, because I am convinced that I am clearly missing something in this program. I just do not "get it", but I believe that comedy in a large television network in times of the highest viewing rate must be fun; but there is no YET laughter from me. There's simply no way ABC will play the coolest comedy of all time at 20:00. I KNOW there must be an inward joke that just does not spin around in my brain. I have read each of the previous comments, "I get" his social aspect, but WHERE ARE THE LIFE ???? I will continue to suffer for at least 30 minutes a week until I have a moment of light bulbs and I hit my head shouting "Eureka".
