So do not even think about renting it from stores, because it's a good movie. One would think that JJ Abrahams wrote this film. Basically, the rat is flushed in the toilet and somehow has to get out. Fans of the totally awful "Shrek" can enjoy, but fans of "Wallace and Gromit" will probably turn away in disgust. Also, why did not they do it in plasticine or clay? I mean CGI animation? For the AARDMAN movie? !! Of course, Aardman was lazy when they let Dreamworks do the whole thing. Wrong, wrong, WRONG !!! Almost every character is horrible, except for this weird frog, which is just right for the villain of the movie. But everything else in the movie is DULL, DULL, DULL !!! I almost fell asleep with boredom watching this movie. No, wait, actually, I fell asleep in boredom watching this movie. It's just terrible. But fortunately it is not as bad as "Shrek".
