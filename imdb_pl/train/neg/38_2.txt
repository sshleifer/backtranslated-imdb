or someone who was praying for the sight of Al Cliver, who was struggling with a naked, eight-foot black guy, full of Nelson, your movie came! The film star Laura Crawford (Ursula Buchfellner) is kidnapped by a group that demands a ransom of $ 6 million to be delivered to the island. They do not count on the raw Vietnamese veterinarian Peter Weston (Cliver) employed by the film producer to save the girl. And they did not really count on a local tribe who likes to offer young women their horrible god of cannibals with bloodshot eyes of worms. <br /> <br /> Basically the same filming set as CANNIBALS, it's a bit better when it comes to entertainment value, mainly thanks to the funny dub piece and impossibly stupid monster with bulging eyes (Franco confirms that they were balls for playing ping-pong during an interview). Franco receives a strong cast supporting EuroCult, including Gisela Hahn (CONTAMINATION) and Werner Pochath (whose death is one of the most predatory things I have ever seen, as a guy who is not him is shown - close up - trying to be him) . The film contains a lot of nudity, and there is gore (a variation of the Tempra paint). The climax for me was the free fist fight between Cliverem and Antonio de Cabo in the splattering waves. Unfortunately, ol 'Jess catches this for an amazing (and sometimes agonizing) 1 hour and 40 minutes when it should be 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> In most DVDs, Severin looks pretty, but strange images appear in some darker scenes. In addition, one long section of the dialog box is in Spanish, without children (they are an option, but only if you are listening to the French path). Franco gives a nice 16-minute interview about the film and has much more pleasant things to say about Buchfellner than his star CANNIBALS, Sabrina Siani.
