In this movie, old Amitabh Bachchan falls in love with a much younger woman again. He meets her in his restaurant. The younger woman, Taboo, flirts with him. He does not know what to do and asks her. Her reaction to his invitation is rather strange. It was supposed to be fun. <br /> <br /> And it irritates me in this whole movie. It was not so much fun. Jokes and the script were terrible! The only jokes that I liked, concerned the teeth of the waiter, but after a few times, even they began to get bored. <br /> <br /> Amitabh has a little girl named sexy. It was a strange relationship! A little girl with the mind of an old woman! It was terrifying! I know that someone can be attached to a child, but this man leads adult conversations with this child. This did not make sense. <br /> <br /> Tabega's father is Paresh Rawal. He must give Amitabh a hard time, but we all know Paresh, he can not do it. So even the conversation at the end, when they are sitting around the table, even it was supposed to be fun. <br /> <br /> I like only movies that are really funny. I suppose I will never see this movie again.
