I was very excited when I saw the ads of this movie because I recently read the book and I really liked it. The film, however, did not meet my expectations. After reading the book, I have recently prepared for a great profession, as is often the case when stories are translated into films. Characters did not fit the book. The direction was weak. It was difficult for me to enter the characters. There was no real relationship with the viewer about what was going on. The dialogue did not explain exactly what was happening. It seemed that he had just been slapped and driven away. All in all, I was very disappointed with the movie. I suppose if you have not read the book, it may be all right. At least he can encourage you to read the book you're likely to enjoy. <br /> <br />
