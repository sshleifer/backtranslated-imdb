LOC could have been a very well made film about how the war was going on in Kargil; possessed locations, budget and skills that belonged to India "Saving Private Ryan" or "Black Hawk Down". Instead, it appears as a bloated, 4-hour trend of combining the war movement with the masala film. Even the war scenes were terribly performed, using the same hill in all battle scenes and spending unnecessary time in casual conversation. Instead of trying to appeal to the Indian audience, a better movie would be a report from a book about what happened in Kargil (like "Black Hawk Down") and even spending time in a belligerent point of view (eg "Torah, Torah, Torah") . What's more, he could use a competent director, such as Ram Gopal Verma, to write, direct and edit the film. Until then, I'd like to see someone edit the movie again, with only relevant parts included; it would make the movie more visible.
