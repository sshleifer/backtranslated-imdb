I could not believe my eyes after watching this movie. There is no point in it for blood or violence. Unlike other frightening movies that have gore and sense, this movie is just blood, blood and killing one by one. This film is not interesting at all, there is no significant plot or plot, and there is no intelligence in it. The blood looks very false and this film is generally useless. Do not waste time. It's only an hour or two of mindless violence. It has many bloody scenes that are not scary, but simply repulsive. It's probably the worst horror movie I've ever seen from all the horrors I've ever seen.
