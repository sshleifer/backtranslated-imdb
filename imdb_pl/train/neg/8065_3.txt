Steve Carpenter can not create horror movies. First of all, the casting was very bad for this movie. The only decent part was the hot brown-haired girl from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. These movies do not have any gore (usually a key component of horror), no action, no acting and no tension (also a key component). Wes Bentley is a good actor, but he is so dry and simple that it's sad. There were several parts that were supposed to be fun (continued horror / comedy for teenagers) and no one laughed at the audience. I thought that this movie was rated R and did not pay attention and I realized that it was changed to PG-13. In any case, check out this video if you like I Still Know What You Did Last Summer. This is the only type of person who will find this movie even a little scary. And seriously, this is Steve Carpenter for you, stop making horror movies. This movie makes it look like a Texas chainsaw massacre.
