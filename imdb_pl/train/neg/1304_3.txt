A very low-budget police movie about homicide detectives trying to solve the murder of a woman whose body appears in a stolen car in Central Park, and their only clue is the tattoo on the shoulder. Although released by RKO, this has the appearance of an independent production that has been received by the studio for distribution. The cast and crew, with a few exceptions - among them young and invaluable Jack Lord, director Edward Montagne and operator William Steiner - consist of complete unknowns and it shows. The performances are universal and do not go into a training film, the direction is stiff and uncertain, and as mentioned earlier, there is no chemistry between the main actors. However, despite many shortcomings, it has several advantages. Shooting the location in New York and the very low budget of the film give it authentic authenticity, as in the much better "The Naked City", decent shooting in the dark basement and some investigation procedures are clever. Otherwise, there is nothing to write about. But let's take a closer look at the noblest parts of New York in the early 1950s, and lovers of old cars will be delighted to see legions of cars from the 1930s and 1940s on the streets. <br /> <br />.
