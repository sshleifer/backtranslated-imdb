Cafe Lumiere is a beautifully photographed invalidity. Without knowing the director's work, I know the filmmaker, who he allegedly pays homage to - Ozu Yasujiro. Not even approaching Ozu in splendor, Hou did not convey anything about the depth of Ozu's emotions and concentration on the importance of space in a closed space. One of the things he completely misses is Ozu's attention to the character - we are not even "introduced" by Hou to his main character (perfect blank page). There are no medium or close shots of his people. One of the DVD accessories offers interviews with the actors and gives us exactly what Hou does not have - a good look at their faces. <br /> <br /> There was a great Spanish Bardem movie called Nunca Pasa Nada, which translates to something like "Nothing Ever Happens". It would be a much better title for this senseless exercise. Throughout the film, we get tips about an unknown Taiwanese composer, some of whom we hear on the soundtrack. But tips, like everything else, make up nothing. If you are not a coach, this movie has nothing to recommend.
