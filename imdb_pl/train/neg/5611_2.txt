Personally, I think that this movie is terrible, firstly it was not objective and it ensured one side of the debate. The only people who were portrayed as a party claimed to exist as a group of people from Billy Graham's awakening. Secondly, he was far from his alleged subject of whether Jesus (Yeshua) existed, speaking about how violent Christianity is and showing scenes from Mel Gibsons 'Passion'. Finally, the director interviews his former director of the conservative private school and tries to imprison him in teaching children the faith there. Oh, and Techno Music made it difficult to watch the movie.
