There was nothing valuable in the original movie, it was even a lamer. The fact that I even rented was absolutely amazing. Everyone who is connected to this film must have something good! So what was the plot? What was with the girl? Did the viewer get a story in the first four minutes of the movie. Unfortunately, I tried to see it several times. I even borrowed a child from someone to get some feedback. Kid said it was stupid and he was four years old. I think that maybe some credit can go to the movie director, because probably some shots made the movie more than film B It can push it. I loved the theme song. Well, it was only a dollar, it was worth it. I suppose you can enjoy the movie if you were tall, just like the cast and crew had to be. Is it legally in France?
