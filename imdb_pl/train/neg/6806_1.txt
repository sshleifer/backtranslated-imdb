In addition to all technical errors .... <br /> <br /> And what about a female stewardess who alone can kill 4 of 7 terrorists (including former marines), 2 of whom are not even using a pistol. Then the plane lands perfectly. We're not talking about Sigourney Weaver or Lindie Hamilton; we are talking about a regular, scared, but very well composed stewardess. : D What about the leader responsible for the assault / rescue team, who has full proof (in accordance with the logic of the script) of a plan to quench everyone's sleep and to fly someone from his team to fly by plane. Only he decides, under the spur of the moment, to change plans and instead lead an attack on terrorists, shoot from a firearm, not knowing where the terrorists are or how many, and not securing an advantage position so that his entire team is easily erased. Yes, it uses the old cube. Only later decide to use gas for sleep. And it turns out to be useless for all intense purposes. <br /> <br /> However, like this movie, I could not resist watching and wondering what's next? : D I can not help but imagine that all the excellent, unemployed scriptwriters think themselves, it's not fair. lol! :RE
