The idea for a story is perfect. Unfortunately, it fails. <br /> <br /> There is a lack of pace in the film, firstly. It should be an exciting ride, but it is slow and a bit boring. <br /> <br /> I think the problem is mainly about scenario and editing. There are not enough obstacles and turns to increase tension, and there are scenes that do not really transfer history very effectively. <br /> <br /> Manufacturers should have seen this in the scenario and insisted on the main rewrite. Unfortunately, when the producer is also an author and director, it will not happen. <br /> <br /> Many actors seem a bit flat and it is from the director - all actors have been quite competent in other projects. <br /> <br /> It's a pity because thanks to better writing, editing and directing it could be a really good thriller.
