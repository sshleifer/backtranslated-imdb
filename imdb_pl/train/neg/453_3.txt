Ok, first good: Cher's performance and photos. Although I'm not a Cher fan, it gives a great performance, and some of it was well written. The photos were well done and reflect the feeling of romance. <br /> <br /> The rest: a thin plot, a performance by Nicholas Cage and a totally inhuman and weak attempt to present an Italian-American family from New York. First of all, whenever Cage opened his mouth, I crouched. I do not know what accent he tried to use. Honestly, no, it was certainly no New York or Italian accent I've ever heard. It was quite surreal. And it's not because I'm a bit sticky with accuracy, his voice is just clamped in my ears. And I like Nicholas Cage in other performances. Secondly, and this is purely anecdotal, but I have many Italian relations, friends and acquaintances in New York and to be honest, I have more laughter and more joy I feel from the gratitude of the Italian ethnic family much more than this film. And it will be a boring night at home. What a job.
