The chillers start on a cold, stormy night when the bus departs from three passengers outside the bus station, a young boy named Mason (Jesse Emery), college professor Dr. Howard Conrow (David Wohl) and a woman named Sharon Phillips (Laurie Pennington). Inside, they discover that they missed the bus connecting them and they were trapped for the night. Two other people are waiting in the waiting room, Ronnie (Jim Wolf) and a sleeping woman named Lindsay (Marjorie Fitzsimmons), who currently has a terrifying nightmare ... <br /> <br /> While swimming in an indoor pool Lindsay meets and makes friends with a guy named Billy Waters (Jesse Johnson). The next time Lindsay sees Billy, he dives into the pool and apparently disappears into the air before he emerges. Shortly after Lindsay discovers that Billy Water died in a diving accident 5 years ago ... <br /> <br /> Lindsay wakes up and tells others about her nightmare, everyone else answers, saying that they too have suffered recently worrying dreams and decide to share them to kill time ... <br /> <br /> Next is Mason, who tells the story of how he and two friends, Scott (David R. Hamm) and Jimmy (Will Tuckwiller), they are terrorized during a camping trip ... <br /> <br /> Then it's Sharon, whose story revolves around a journalist named Tom Williams (Thom Delventhal), with whom he calls, in a flash Tom is at her door but he actually turns out to be a vampire ... <br /> <br /> It's the turn of Ronnie and describes how he discovers that he can bring the dead back to life, but unfortunately brings a massive murderer Nelson Caulder (Bradford Boll) back to killer life ... <br /> <br /> Finally, Dr. Conrow, Op iada a story about how two of his students brought an ancient god of war with the Aztecs named Ixpe (Kimberly Harbo ur) comes back to life ... <br /> <br /> Then he returns to the bus station for the last time (predictable) return. .. <br /> <br /> Written, produced and directed by Daniel Boyd Chillers is one of the worst horror anthologies I've ever seen and I usually like this genre the most. Boyd's scenario lacks what is needed to make films such as Chillers work, see the last change that ends in a mile and every story is really bad. The first of these is completely pointless and does not seem to have an end, and the best in these anthologies are short, lively stories that are refined in a neat form. The second story is predictable and ends again without any payment. So, throughout Chillers, every story is deeply unhappy with watching and there is no reward for it. Character and dialogue are poorly written, stories do not seem to have original ideas and as a whole the movie is sucked. At least every story does not last long and I liked the idea related to connecting segments. <br /> <br /> Director Boyd apparently worked with a very low budget and it shows. All I can say is that if you want to watch a 15-minute short story entirely in the pool, Chillers is for you. Stories are neither clever, scary nor have any tension or building anything. Having said that it has some nice scenes and sometimes surprising competences appear. Violence and wisdom does not happen much in Chillers, a ripped heart, headless head and bitten hand are as bloody as possible. <br /> <br /> Technically Chillers are bad things that will not impress anyone. Basic photos, bad music, cheap special effects and below average production value. Chillers also have one of the worst thematic tracks in history. Acting is also very low. <br /> <br /> I'm sure that a lot of effort was put into Chillers as a low-budget movie and at least the filmmakers tried, so at least I will consider it, but it still does not stop me from thinking that it is nonsense. Similar anthological films such as Tales From the Crypt (1972), Asylum (1972), The Vault of Horror (1973), and Dr. Terror's House of Horrors (1965), Creepshow (1982) and Tales From the Darkside: The Movie (1990) are much better than Chillers, so watch one of them instead.
