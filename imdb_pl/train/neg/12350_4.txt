Hmmm ... where to start? How serious actress, like Demi Moore, got involved in such nonsense? "First Blood" can be judged as bull *** t, but this nonsense is just Rambo with tits, point. Of course, if you're interested in a leprechaun (Demi Moore just wants to prove that a woman can be part of NAVY Seals), this is the stupidest clich√© I can come up with, say "GI Jane" is a great movie. Just Viggo Mortensen's performance made this movie bearable, but hell, I can not think of Demi Moore as Rambo (especially not in the last, useless 30 minutes). Ridley Scott does not deserve the merit to make this film for women of equal rights, it's just mindless propaganda for the American army, and to make the film more attractive, they cast Moore in it. A horrible movie.
