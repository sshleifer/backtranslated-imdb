Cowboys can leave you some pain in the saddle. Definitely not one of the best Johns movies. Do not get me wrong, there are always a few good places with every move of John Wayne. And this one has its fair share. But the whole picture moves slowly and simply does not satisfy aspirations. Bruce Dern again does great work as a villain. Roscoe Lee Brown is another bright spot in the film. The children in the film were average, but could be better planted. It would be a good movie for viewers between the ages of eight and fifteen. <br /> <br /> It would be a good family move to watch it with children. Just remember that there are several scenes that are worth seeing before you see them young. But most of the kids I know have seen such a movie. Maybe because they see children of their age, they do all their adult work.
