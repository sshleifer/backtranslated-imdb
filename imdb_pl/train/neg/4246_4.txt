Anne Bancroft plays Estelle, a dying Jewish mother who asks her devoted son (Ron Silver) to find the lonely one-time film star Greta Garbo and perform two before Estelle goes through. It could be titled "Bancroft Talks" because the actress attacks this uncertain comedy / drama / sentimental material during its duration. Sidney Lumet, director of Hot or Cold Music, can not achieve a steady rhythm, and Bancroft's constant abuse is not limited by the creator of the film - he keeps it straight ahead: lovely, tearful and screaming. Estelle is getting mad at this scenario (it's not about the fact that a thinly-imagined plot has much to do). Silver and co-authors Carrie Fisher and Catherine Hicks have little to do, but they support the star, and everyone is trampled by her hamming. * 1/2 of ****
