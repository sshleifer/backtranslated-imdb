Much of "Over Her Dead Body" is so painfully uncomfortable that I actually saw myself in a place because of embarrassment for the actors. <br /> <br /> Eva Longoria proves that she can not wear a movie in this terrible romantic comedy, and moreover that she does not even have a comedic sense of time. She is snappy and irritating like a ghost who returns to earth to prevent the kitchen psyche from meeting her widow fiancé. The fiancé is played by Paul Rudd, capricious and graceless, while the mental game of Lake Bell, bringing the movie any energy anemic. I am most sorry about Bell, who seems to have some comic abilities and worked overtime, trying to make the material work. Unfortunately, she faces an insurmountable task of making a film in which you can meet Jason Biggs, and is pushed down with the rest of the cast, like Leo DiCaprio at the end of the Titanic. <br /> <br /> "Over her dead body" actually discouraged me because of laziness and total lack of effort. I started thinking about all the interesting projects that can not be funded, because huge amounts of money are transferred to such bland shit. Seriously, does Hollywood think that such films are good enough? How stupid do they really think that the film audience is? <br /> <br /> Class: F
