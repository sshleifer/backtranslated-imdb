I am a huge fan of horror movies, and zombie movies are my favorite movie. He said Zombie 3 is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Needless to say, I really liked it, it's the best bad movie I've seen in a long time. This story has some similarities to Dan O'Bannon's "Return of the Living Dead", but while this movie was deliberately entertaining, this is the opposite. He has one of the most ridiculous actors I've ever seen, especially from the main character of the scientist. His scenes with the general were simply hysterical. Also, the effects are below normal and in many cases sloppy, and death scenes are often just stupid. This of course makes the fun even more enjoyable. POSSIBLE SPOILER - The worst is the scene in which the guy opens the door of the refrigerator and sees the severed head of the zombie, which then opens his eyes and somehow FLUIDS FROM THE FRIDGE (apparently outstretched with a little string), attaching the neck, killing it. Zombie heads are now able to float in the air? He opposes all the laws of physics known to man and is one of the most absurd things ever filmed. This is just one of many really silly moments in idiotic mess. I can not believe he has such a high rating here. If you're a fan of bad movies, do yourself a favor and hire this sucker.
