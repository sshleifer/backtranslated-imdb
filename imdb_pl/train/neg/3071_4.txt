I think that the characters are mediocre and the story is uninteresting. I never had to read this book (thankfully), otherwise it would be a painful experience. I got the tickets for free preview, but it still was not worth my time or my friend. I think this story is not worth telling. It's like saying that old people have a past before they get old (without jokes). Life of the main characters was painful to watch, one generation was no better than the next to avoid stupid mistakes. I think, however, that the actors did everything they could with a lame history. I've always been a big fan of Ellen Burstyn. I am writing this review to counter positive feedback, which unfortunately convinced me to try this movie.
