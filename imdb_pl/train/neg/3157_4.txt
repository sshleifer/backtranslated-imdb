Sure, it had the makings of a good movie. The plot is good, though a bit bland, and the acting was good enough, although I did not understand why Olivia d'Abo had such a distinct Australian accent if her character was to be brought up in the USA. However, my biggest problem was the wardrobe. As a rule, I know that the average American is considered a grimy cupboard by every self-respecting European, but that was more than that. Anna's color combinations were definitely weird !! And the one like a potato bag, a sad excuse for a coat that she wore throughout the movie, forced me to burst the hives. I suppose the idea was as realistic as possible (how many school teachers are there in Prada?), But simple does not mean absolute lack of taste. A word for the wise ...
