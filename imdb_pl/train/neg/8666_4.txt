This television thriller is all conversation, a small action. He works hard to set up his complicated plot, but the writing is so confused that the exposure is still muddy at best. At the end I did not know more about these characters than at the beginning. He has a quasi-screenplay for "Ten Little Indians", but he loses half in favor of Sally Field and her killer discovery. The field is here without grace, which I rarely saw in her. Early introduction is good, but the letter quickly leaves the course and eventually goes to the top. Lots of hysteria and constant thunder and lightning (which nothing adds). An interesting failure on the part of producers Aaron Spelling and Leonard Goldberg. With all this talent, could not they give us something more than a script full of red herring and Sally Field hiding in the closet?
