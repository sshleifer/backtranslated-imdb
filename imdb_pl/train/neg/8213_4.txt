I can not believe it, IMDb really knows every TV program! I have not seen this show for over 20 years. I only remember two episodes and I barely remember them. I remember that Tony was not turned on from the beginning, because one of the episodes I remember is the one where everyone tries to get Tony to join, but he rejects them, but usually at the end of the show he becomes a Power House member, with all cheering. <br /> <br /> I remember the second one, in which Lolo, for some reason, pretends to be dead (along with a funeral and mourners). I do not remember why he plays dead or how the show ends. <br /> <br /> This is one of those concerts that I convinced myself that I had to dream because nobody else heard about him.
