What I hate about this series is how poorly written the tips are. These women have no respect for themselves or dignity. The whole thread is that they are throwing themselves at the boys. Amanda Bynes's talent is totally wasted. She was brilliant at "All That" and her own show. Why they write her and Jenny Garth as vapid, airhead, desperate, chasing men, "naive old maids" is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Their storylines and dialogue remind me of "The Simpons", says Homer whenever his cartoon character Poochie is not on the screen, "everyone should ask, where is Poochie?". All conversations focus on whining about a guy and then whining about a guy. Sometimes they change it and the guy whines. Then they come back to each other or break up at the end. Two women are either shallow, stupid or addicted to sex. The only word I think about is 'sucks'.
