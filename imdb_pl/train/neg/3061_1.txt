This movie is horrible. Give me a dentist anytime! Can you believe that one of the main TV stations here in Saudi had its Christmas movie! I can only assume that they expect to entertain mobs rather Dudley Moore than this one. Last time I looked at my bottle of hot water, she had more action, a better story, more drama and much more interest than celluloid waste. Do not even watch if you're drunk!
