Nothing happens. <br /> <br /> Then characters without personality do not develop. <br /> <br /> Then the end never comes because there is no beginning or measure. <br /> <br /> There are beautiful shots that are not beautiful, because they are not allowed to even be, because this movie is not HERE. In this film, there is no "is" because there is no plot or form, motives, ideas, symbolism, discussion, dialogue or point. There is nothing! <br /> <br /> There is a good point: it has a good soundtrack. But the sound editing is so, and the right movie is that watching it is not even worth your time, so if you're really interested, I suggest going and buying a soundtrack or something like that. With this film you get everything you can, without tiredness, headache and impatience. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
