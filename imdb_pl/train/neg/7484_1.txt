Within 15 minutes, my whole family was cheering for Goldie Hawn to be killed, or at least her character left her. After 40 minutes we turned it off. There are only a few films a year that we try to get so angry that we can not even stand it long enough for history to solidify. <br /> <br /> I usually like Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn and I remember enjoying the original Neil Simon. So I blame Marc Lawrence and Sam Weisman. Combine the director "Whats the Worst That Can Happen" and screenwriter "Miss Congeniality 2" and I think that's what we're finishing.
