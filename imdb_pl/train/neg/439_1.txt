Simply a residual detachment from the infinitely better "Murder, She Wrote", it is absolutely amazing that this badly written garbage has survived the full eight years. I'm sure most people who watched this rough shit were in their sixties and seventies and just tuned in because they did not have anything better to do, or they just remembered their star from the old Dick Van Dyke Show. Van Dyke, who had only a decent career in the 1960s, was never too much an actor (as he admitted) and he was much too old to play a doctor when the series began in 1993. the result of years of smoking in the chain and heavy drinking. His devoid of talent, the real son of Barry, a wooden actor who was rarely in something that did not engage his father, plays his son in the series.
