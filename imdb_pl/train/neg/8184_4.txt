It's almost two films - one literary and engaging, the other stupid and stereotypical. It is a pity that all the problems were not worked out while writing, but given how quickly most B movies were written and produced, it is not very unusual. However, it is a real shame because it could have been a very good movie. <br /> <br /> First, good. The film is original and includes code breakers from the times of World War II. This is quite fascinating and I liked to observe how a leading man (Lee Bowman) goes through his steps as a master code breaker. In fact, the first two-thirds of the film was very good. But now, for the bad, the movie just lasted too long and lost steam for about 50 minutes. In addition, the role of Jean Rogers as a "kooky girl" must be one of the worst and distracting roles in film history !! After every intelligent move by Bowman, the idiot Rogers stepped in to screw up the case as a kind of misguided "comic relief." If her role was intelligently written, the overall video would be greatly improved! Instead, by observing it, it is difficult to understand how we actually won the Second World War !!
