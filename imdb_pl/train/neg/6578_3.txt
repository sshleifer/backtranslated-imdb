Intransigent, unwavering hybrid "Cruel Intentions" and "Wild Things", but it is not as good as none of these mini-classic trash. It's about the acting sheriff, called Arti (Taye Diggs) to investigate the almost fatal drug overdose in the exclusive higher class of Univesity, but to keep it at a low level. As it goes deeper, it seems to him that it is much more than at first glance. We follow Alicia, a girl who also overdose flashbacks. About 90 minutes, if the film was welcomed at the beginning, it would wear out. This film brings nothing new to the table. But this is the only movie so far, in which Miss Swain is topless, so in this case the rating is higher. <br /> <br /> My class: D <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dominique Swain gets topless fixing the "Happy Campers" mistake); inna dziewczyna jest topless <br /> <br /> Candies against the eyes: more men than girls' buttocks
