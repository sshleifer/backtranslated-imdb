Until the last few minutes of the film, I would give the film 7 or 8 stars. However, the ending is so horrible and "Hollywood" that it completely undermines the first 80% of the movie. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around a submarine and the possibility that they have been given the order to launch nuclear missiles. Captain Gene Hackman is ready to take off, while his first officer, Denzel Washington, supports the approval of the start orders first. The problem is that the captain and the first officer must simultaneously use their start keys. The Hackman is determined to take off, and Washington stands in position until it finally leads to an armed insurrection aboard a submarine. Eventually the error will be detected and missiles will not be fired. Cool. However, a part that does not really sound is coming. After returning to land and in front of the revision commission, Washington and Hackman (who just spent half the movie trying to kill) shake hands and they are all buddies! Huh ?! Too trivial ending to make the film worth it.
