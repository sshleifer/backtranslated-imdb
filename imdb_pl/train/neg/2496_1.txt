I would like to mention this movie in the genre of horror. I did it because I'm not aware of the genre called the terrible. Because genre horror is the closest to horrors, I decided to put it in this category. Acting was amateurish. You know who the villains would be on the first scene. The heroine is as ugly as a movie. Film making students should take this film as an example for a lesson, what not to do in the film. This is so bad. The word "bad" is understatement. The villains have kidnapped an ocean liner and want $ 10 million. They want money to be delivered on the inhabited island of Rose in the middle of the Pacific. They would sit ducks after getting money. Is there no plan to escape. Like a stupid Female Cruise Director, she was a policewoman, navy, kung fu. I'm afraid. A funny part is the way the clock bomb is broken. He says he knows what he's doing, and he pulls all the wires in turn. Then he puts it in his pocket and, according to the film, all connections are in place. Is he angry? They were just as mad at us who watched the ANYTHING. If you have M-i-L you do not like. To upset her, rent this movie and pretend you like him. I assure you that you will definitely tell your spouse that you have such bad taste and that her son / daughter married a person below the family standard.
