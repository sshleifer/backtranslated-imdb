If it were 0 stars, I would gladly give it to this absolutely horrible pile of waste. The fact that the actual summary is fine and that if it were otherwise, it could be brilliant, only worse. The basic task of closing a group of people in the experiment chamber is OK, but WHERE EXPERIENCE? I only see a group of unintelligent surfers and blondes talking about music and culture that I do not know or do not want to know ... Challenges are pathetic and stupid. The whole point of TV's reality is to show REALITY. If you set a "challenge", do not force them to play with exaggerated props and stereotypical elements of culture in "Friday night games." make them do the real challenge. And when it comes to earning cash prizes, it's okay if they actually make money! These people are crazy. If only they would make the performance better, the real idea would be great. But it will not happen!
