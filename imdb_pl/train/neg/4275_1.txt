I can not understand why so many people are praising this program. Double peaks are one of the most boring titles I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> Now I saw all the episodes of the first season and watched episode 1 of season 2. I just can not watch this anymore. <br /> <br /> 1) Where is the correct induction in the investigation? <br /> <br /> In season 1 there was a scene in which Cooper's agent throws stones in a bottle. Do you know why he did it? He simply wants to identify the murderer, making this "joke", mentioning the supernatural abilities given by the dream of Tibet. Wow !!! <br /> <br /> 2) There are too many unnecessary scenes in this program. <br /> <br /> For example, season 2 started with a "funny" scene, which stupid old man serves Agent Cooper with a cup of milk, while Cooper lays on the floor (he has already shot him in the stomach). That's all. <br /> <br /> This scene is really boring and even long (3 min 30 sec .... It's like hell.) <br /> <br /> I would read more comics than I saw this program is already there.
