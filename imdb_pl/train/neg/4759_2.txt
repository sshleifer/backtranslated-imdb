In the name of Pinter, every knee will bow - especially after the Nobel Prize, which did little more than draw the can, the numbers, the anti-Americanism of the sixth form. But it is even worse; not only is the driving force of talent without talent, a great example of how to escape the excess of its long-standing reputation, but also represents the slaughter of an excellent work. The original Sleuth was a masterpiece of this kind. Yes, it was a theatrical confection and it is easy to see how its central device would work better on the stage than on the screen, but it still worked great. It's a piece of Michael Caine's vanity, but let's face it, Caine is not Olivier. Not only can he not fill Larry's shoes, he did not even fill up the slippers in the bathroom. Actually named Caine is clearly an average actor whose only real recommendation, like many British actors, is their longevity in business. He was a good Harry Palmer, great at Get Carter, but it's yours, buddy! Give it a very wide angle and stick to a great original. This is more a semi-pinter.
