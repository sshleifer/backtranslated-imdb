Given the story of the director of this film, it's hard to believe that it was such a painfully bad movie to sit down. I was at the European premiere yesterday evening and one of the executive producers was there. He had not seen the movie yet, and, boy, he was surprised. I have not read the book on which it is based, nor do I know if it is highly appreciated or appreciated, but I read "Captain Cornelli's Mandolin" and considering how poorly it was adapted to the screen and how bad was the movie, I suppose that something similar happened. Acting was not bad, although there were too many eyebrows from Farrell. Honestly, I can not believe how little I cared about any character in this movie. Situations take place on the screen in an empty sequence of nothingness. Part of Donald Sutherland includes several scenes in which he opens the door, says something and closes it again. I looked at my watch when I was not cowering on the screen. I never went to a movie, but I was tempted to start at that time. I gave the film the result of "2" for reasons that seem terribly shallow to me, but these are the best things I can say about this film. First of all, I really liked the short earthquake scene, and the second was that Salma Hayek was naked and looked beautiful. I can not say anything more about this movie. Do not ask anything about dust, can not speak!
