If movies such as Ghoulies tear off Gremlins, Hobgoblins fall to a new level, tearing up trash like Ghoulies. These barely animated furbys have a kind of fantasy pattern (which mainly involves sexual dreams of groteque heroes - oh joy), but what has something to do with anything is the presumption of anyone except allowing the director to devote himself to his perverse inclination to erotica. They suspect it in the eighth circle of hell. There is no real conspiracy - only "goblins - kill!" And weak attempts at humor and gentle attempt to arouse the audience.
