I thought I read somewhere that it was the last production of the Monogram, but whether it's true or not, it does not matter, because if it does not, it should be. It's a deadly boring affair involving John Carradine with gray hair that makes him look like a senior scientist who's experimenting with the help of his young student (Robert Shayne), bringing the dead back to life. Every time their subjects are revived, they appear to have a whitish face like marble when they are tied to a lab table (a big deal). Carradine manages to bring his faithful dog back to life after his death, and mutt gains a remarkable ability to go through the walls in a spiritual way (wooooooooohhhh). That's all she wrote. <br /> <br /> For the ultra-cheap Monogram quickie, this thing at least uses a more sophisticated laboratory configuration than usual. The funniest joke from the movie is that "older" Dr. Carradine is constantly referring to his "young" Shayne assistant as "m'boy", while in reality Carradine was 40 years old, and Shayne was 45 when they did!
