From time to time, a new dish from foreign films is served. This is their great attraction. They take life and serve raw food. American films rarely dare to touch the forbidden themes of society. Too many disconnections and morbid fear of financial failure. The Almighty dollar determines their choice. Something that invites European directors. In addition, audiences around the world are hungry for "different" films, especially those that offer a spicy bite to the miserable, suffering human body. Despite the fear of directors or producers, many viewers miss the beauty, poetry and impeccable taste of life. Here's what the movie "To the Father's Left" offers to interesting viewers. The family closed in the conviction that family unity stems from the unity of its obedience to tradition. However, when the patriarch of the family forgets that his members are flesh and blood people, filled with raging, unbridled dreams and dark passions, they are both put in front of them. Selton Mello plays Andr√©, a son who tries to control his inner passions because of the stagnation of his father's philosophy. Raul Cortez plays his father. Simone Spoladore is Ana, a young woman who wants to quench the forbidden desire from family waters. Leonardo Medeiros is Pedro, the older brother. The film offers a lot, but it takes an extremely long time. ***
