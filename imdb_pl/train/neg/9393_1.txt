Really, really, bottomless, vociferous, terrible. But the actor Clayton Moore (the film Lone Ranger) gains the competences as an actor. It's the only one. <br /> <br /> A rare feast, for five minutes, if you want to explore the depth of grotesquely transparent special effects, southern California as "moon" (again and again), and acting so ineptly that it may be a travesty. . . except that it is clear that this is not the case - there is no humor here, except inadvertently. <br /> <br /> The dialogue may be worse than any of these other aspects and costumes. . . Well, just say. Thread? What story? Bad guy (well, bad guy) and his followers, including his earth agent named Krog (listen carefully, or you suspect it's a trick in the name of founder McDonald Ray Kroc) and his unbelievably inept riflemen guns that never require reloading just like Commando Cody, so there are numerous fights against fires. <br /> <br /> Enjoy.
