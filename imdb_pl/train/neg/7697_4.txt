This mini-series is actually more entertaining than some others with much larger budgets and bigger aspirations. SOTD is somewhere between "Kung-Fu" and "H R Pufnstuff" in the entertainment spectrum. If it had not been so long (almost 3 hours), I think children would like it. He has adventure, action, "scenes with cliffs" and not too many romances or other "malicious" things. When you are young, you are not too critical when it comes to bending rubber swords, camping scenes and repetitive scenes. (At least two scenes are repeated identically in the film, as it was done in a series of old times to speed up the audience.) Finally, children usually accept dialogue with American English emerging from the mouth of Asian actors. (Not to mention that a few main roles are played by non-Asian actors.) <br /> <br /> I wanted to give this film three stars, but I felt like a director, producers and staff deserved an extra loan for at least project implementation. This film is not an art, but like painting a house, it took some time, effort and discipline to do it. <br /> <br /> In general, it is not recommended to use it on time, but it can leave children playing while traveling in a minivan. <br /> <br /> Oh, yes ... hey, IMDb! "Dialog" is the preferred and traditional spelling. Your spell check seems to think that "dialogue" is the right spelling. Although "dialog" is acceptable, both Webster and OED believe that it is an alternative form.
