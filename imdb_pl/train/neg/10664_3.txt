Very tired Burt Reynolds plays a mercenary fighting with his former employers for a gadget that these non-heroes plan to sell to the "Iranians." Low-rent video nonsense from "Silk Stalkings" producers offer decent footage and many inept "dramas" ... the lack of logic and really frightening dialogue are the decisive aspects, although the final twists and shifts of loyalty could be a nice end to a better movie. Burt is still present, although it also means you'll notice more when he verbally offends a half-baked "one-liner".
