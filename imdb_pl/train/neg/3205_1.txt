From the comments I noticed that most people discussing this film base their comments on ventilation of MST3K. This is quite fair (I mean, in the end, as it has the widest exhibition), but after the unhappiness of seeing "Ultimate Justice" in its original form, I would like to share some thoughts and comments with the version. <br /> <br /> First of all, you have to admit that the original version is a bit more consistent than the MST3K transmission, mainly due to the display stage between Rossano Brazzi and Venantino Venantini (I can use heroes' names instead of actors), but I love typing words "Venantino Venantini"), explaining why Venantini's runaway figure can not leave Malta at once. (This is not a very convincing feature point, but at least the filmmakers tried to cover it.) I do not know if this scene was cut only on time or if it did not provide too much material for the riffs. <br /> <br /> There is no other thread in the original: Zdant Venantini by stripper Joe Don Bakerowi, seemingly unmotivated in the version MST3K, is explained by an earlier, extremely unpleasant scene in which Venantini violates her in the shower. Although it gives her a motive to turn against him, the whole scenario is really ... bad. (There is no other word for it.) Some moments worthy of MST (eternal cut off "Son of a--" and shooting "sheriff deja vu") were purely the result of the print edited by television, with which they worked, and it was not in the original movie. <br /> <br /> One of the scenes I wanted to make went to the MST3K version: Before entering the bar, to ask a question to some people, Joe Don asks a Maltese policewoman accompanying him to stay outside because "they see this uniform, not they will cooperate. " However, Joe Don himself is wearing a ridiculous cowboy and sheriff's outfit with a shiny badge! I can not imagine why they went through this great opportunity to laugh at him ... <br /> <br /> The final remark about the original, uncut version of "Ultimate Justice": Why, oh, why? do you feel the need to put Venantini's naked butt on the screen?
