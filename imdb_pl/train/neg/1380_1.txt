It was the worst movie I saw at WorldFest, and then he received the least applause! I can only think that he receives such recognition based on the number of famous actors in the film. It's great to see J. Beals, but she's only in the movie for a few minutes. M.Parker is a much better actress than the one allowed. The rest of acting is difficult to assess because the film is so funny and predictable. The main character is completely unpleasant, and therefore boring to watch. History has no real emotional depth. A film that revolves around an actor who can not get a job is not too original for me. There is also no development of clay. It seems to me that it is one of many films straight from the video that I saw in the 90s ... And not even good at these standards. <br /> <br />
