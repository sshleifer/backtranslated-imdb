This movie was very clever. It's thematic rhymes with every horror film. Valentine makes ZERO trying to be original. What is Valentine? It is a group of people giving each other the same bad news that was passed on to the same people a year earlier. There is nothing original in Valentine. <br /> <br /> I've only seen it once, and one of them is some of the movies that he snatched. 1.Prom Night 2. Carrie 3.Scream 4. Any other horror in which someone kills someone. <br /> <br /> I know there is more, but my mind slowly turned into a puddle of silk, so I could not catch them as soon as they appeared. <br /> <br /> Valentine had no chance of being a good movie. Why every horror must have a killer "surprise", people you do not care about, because their emotions change in every other scene. In one minute a nice girl turns into a bad B-ch, and then she is an uncertain woman, and so on, and a son. <br /> <br /> Usually, any horror movie (in my book) can be saved by gore, once again Valentine does not have it. It looked as if they tried to make it PG-13, but it failed, so they left the edition. <br /> <br /> Do not look too inspired, rip off unless you hate yourself and want to die. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (3) -J.Lonon Rollins -
