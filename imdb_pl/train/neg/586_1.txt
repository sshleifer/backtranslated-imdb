After what I thought was the masterful performance of two roles in Man From the Snowy River, WHY did Kirk Douglas replace Brian Dennehy in the sequel? It was not the same without Spur and Harrison, as Douglas put it. Maybe he understood how weak the plot was - Jim returns after a long absence to find Jessica chased by another man. He could not expect that any girl would wait so long without contact with him and would not find competition. In the case of the Disney film, it contains a vulgar language, as well as a very unnecessary part in which Jim and Jessica bound themselves unmarried - very LAME. According to my family members, it is quite an insult to the spectator's intelligence. I will stay at the first and try to forget that I saw the sequel!
