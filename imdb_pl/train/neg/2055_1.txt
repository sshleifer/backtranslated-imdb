There is absolutely no reason to waste time on this "movie". The original said everything and still holds. Either read the book or look at the story, and you will understand that this remake is ridiculous. Eric Roberts as Perry Smith? His sister could do a better job! Being in Holcomb and Edgerton, KS, where history takes place, kits and locations looked like NICs, such as Kansas. The original is riveting, from filming locations to the use of real participants, weapons and victims' things. Unforgettable performances by Scott Wilson and Robert Blake. The soundtrack of Quincy Jones and photos of Conrad Hall ... The original is now available on DVD on a wide screen. Let this turkey die quickly.
