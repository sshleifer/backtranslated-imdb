Did the filmmakers even watch it before the release? The script jumps from place to place without giving a lot of explanation. The beginning does not explain whether it is a prequel or not. It starts from the beginning of Superman on Earth, and then jumps to the point after the last movie - but it does not really warn the viewer. Very confusing! Sam Superman is weak and needs Prozac. He is portrayed as a potential home destroyer, persecutor and someone who is clearly depressed and confused. This type of character rarely makes an interesting hero. The ending is absolutely funny. Superman ending up in the hospital made me want to kill him. I am seriously waiting for the SNL sketch in which Superman appears on Maurym Povich, and Maury says: "The results are - in the case of a child, Superman, you are a father". In conclusion - OK, thanks to Superman and Kevin Spacey, but HORRIBLE script. The film is virtually unseeable.
