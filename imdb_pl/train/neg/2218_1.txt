I admit that my review comes from 2006, almost 30 years after the creation of this film and at the time of its creation, it could have been a genial horror / thriller. <br /> <br /> Starting on the night of Halloween in 1968, 6-year-old Michael commits a brutal murder on his 18-year-old sister. Michael is involved in a psychiatric institution, and 15 years later escapes and returns to his hometown to murder again. <br /> <br /> From now on it is clear that the movie will follow the basic and basic path that is highly predictable. The beginning of each scene is easy to predict in the way it will end, while the music for each scene containing Michael (the murderer) is exactly the same in the whole movie, thus warning the viewer of the probable events to occur. <br /> <br /> For horror / thriller enthusiasts, there is a strong lack of blood / blood compared to modern movies, although I'm not similar to the number shown today. A happier medium could be found. <br /> <br /> No scene is unexpected for half an hour. Acting in the movie horror / thriller is quite typical of the era and therefore there is no blow for the modern enthusiast. <br /> <br /> The film's positive is its long-lasting camera shots and dark lighting that creates a terrifying atmosphere. The second positive would be the figure of Michael's doctor, who provides clues as to the probability where this story can lead. <br /> <br /> However, it is clear that the star in Jamie-Lee Curtis is in the stages of acting career in childhood, and thus does not provide a truly frightened central sacrifice. <br /> <br /> It's hard for me to judge this movie, as it was in his time, but from other horror / thriller movies actually in the 80's and to a lesser extent in the 90's does not fit into a really great horror / thriller . <br /> <br /> I suggest you go to the classics from the 80's. Your health!
