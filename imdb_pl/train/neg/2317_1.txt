The direction clearly stated that the idea and the plot of this film are completely original ... however, when it comes to those who read the comic "slam dunk", it is clearly visible that the characters are very similar and even jokes ... <br /> <br /> Another note is that Jay Chow himself does not know Kung Fu, it just will not impress anyone if he tries to behave as he can, many people today see differences ... Fortunately, the movie does not contain many fights KunG Fu and many others were delighted with stunners and visual effects ... <br /> <br /> I think that Jay's acting is still painful, especially when almost everyone else in the film is much better. The only reason I think Jay is the main actor is simply his popularity. <br /> <br /> In spite of how much I would like to stop anyone from watching this, it does this "original" movie what it should not have become one of the best budget films in China this year.
