Although the book was not strictly in line with the real situation, it was still described as Japan. It's hard for me to believe that anyone who was involved in making this movie was ever in Japan because he did not feel Japanese the least. Almost everything was terrible. I admit that the actors were generally quite good, but they did not have a chance to save them. Before the film began, I was surprised that on the Friday evening just after the film was opened in Japan there were only ten people in the cinema. 30 minutes I was amazed that they stayed. I stayed, so I will have the right to criticize him. The whole movie was interrupted by my moans and suppressed the laugh of disbelief of my Japanese girl. Everyone I saw going out of this cinema had confusion and disappointment on their faces. <br /> <br /> You owe me two hours for the creators of this movie.
