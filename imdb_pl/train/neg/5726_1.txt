The obvious b level effort to earn at buzz Hostel / Saw, my expectations for this movie were low (really low!), And yet he was disappointed in every level. Acting is so bad that it is not even funny, the plot does not exist, and the only horror was to realize that I wasted 1 hour 21 minutes watching! I am surprised that 34 people awarded him 10 stars. I can only suspect that 33 of them are cast and crew. 34. is probably the director's mother? - although I am sure that even she will have difficulties with exceeding 2! DVD accessories include an hour-long "create" function. What raises the question: "Why?" (Although it can be used to show what not to do!). Avoid at all costs.
