This film reminded me so much of the "History of Violence" that pretended to be a strict study of violence and violent behavior, but ended up being nothing more than a cheap action movie pretending to think about violence. Dustin Hoffman and his new British bride move to a small English town and encounter endless harassment from local drunks who do nothing but sit in the pub all day and cause trouble. Do these men have no job? In any case, Dustin takes everything he can and the end of the movie that he keeps in his home, and fights every drunk attacker with such horrible means as cooking whiskey overflows to someone, feet are blown out by a rifle and someone's head caught in a trap bear. It's funny that someone will need such a big bear trap in a small British town, except maybe put a man in it. <br /> <br /> Sam Peckinpah, who created the "Wild Bunch", which also included the topic of blood allowing violence, in which no one was spared. But it was done with style, and you believed it. Straw dogs are not reliable. First of all, the location is bad and does not work. Why is it worth to put it in England? I would think maybe in some location in the city center or in a small town in the south of America in the thirties or something. Secondly, I do not think it's ever been clear why these people are so violent, except maybe they get drunk and feel the need to kill Hoffman and rape his wife. <br /> <br /> Sam Peckinpah did not notice this one.
