This "movie" is more like a music video. Kusturica said in an interview in 2004 that when he's making movies, he wants to make music, and when he makes music, he wants to make movies. The best thing about "Promise me this" is music written by Stribor Kusturica. <br /> <br /> Kusturica said in the same interview that for him dialogues in movies are like noise. "Promise me this" has very little "noise". <br /> <br /> I liked "Life is a miracle". For the first 30 minutes he was like a music video, and at some points later, but he had a beautiful storyline. "Promise me this" no plot. I was waiting for this movie with great expectations, because I read that the script was written by Ranko Bozic - one of my favorite screenwriters, who also participated in "Life is a miracle". Ranko Bozic writes great dialogues, but for Kusturica it is "noise" and to my regret I saw only two dialogues that I could identify as written by Ranko Bozica. The second part of the script was used by the director to create a chaotic music video for the music of his son Stribor. <br /> <br /> Gordan Mihic (the man who wrote the screenplays for "Gypsy time" and "Black cat white cat") said in an interview that Kusturica never follows the script. The "black cat white cat" was the only writing for which Kusturica said he would not touch it. According to Gordan Mihica, finally Kusturica returns to the script, and if not, does not make a good movie. And I think that's the case with "Promise me this". He should have followed the scenario of Ranko Bozic. <br /> <br /> "Promise me this" is billed as a "comedy", but there are a few moments that made me laugh. Comedy moments are in the same style as the "Black Cat White Cat", but they are not so funny. I think the difference is due to the fact that "Black Cat White Cat" was written by Gordan Mihic. <br /> <br /> However, I know some people who liked to "Promise me this", they consider it a very positive film.
