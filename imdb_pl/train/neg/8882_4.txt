It would be too ironic to call a movie about the mutilated spirit of vengeance from beyond the grave and dead grave, but here it is undoubtedly a combination of GASLIGHT (1939 and 1944) through LES DIABOLIQUES (1954); although you can still watch it, it's as trite as to provoke chuckles instead of deliberate thrills. However, thanks to the tragic difficulties encountered by the British film industry in the late 1970s, even a mediocre scenario like this was able to attract 10 stars - Cliff Robertson (as a spouse), Jean Simmons (in the title role), Jenny Agutter (as Robertson's half-sister), Simon Ward (as a mysterious chauffeur), Ron Moody (as a wretched doctor), Michael Jayston (as Robertson's business partner), Judy Geeson (as Simmons "best friend and wife of Jayston), Flora Robson (as hostess home), David Tomlinson (as a notary who reads "Simmons") and, perhaps surprisingly, Jack Warner (as a grave sculptor) - although most of them do not really have any parts, sorry to say!
