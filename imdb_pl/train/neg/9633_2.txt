Does the rich, ill Elizabeth Taylor seek for the Angel of Death on her fortress on an island in the Mediterranean, or simply overdo it - or more accurately, excessively - as usual? Actually, both are applicable to the wandering, meandering mess of director Joseph Losey called "Boom", appropriately titled, because the temperaments in the luxuriant, luxurious surroundings are almost ready to explode. Richard Burton, uninvited, climbs up Taylor; he dresses him in the samurai robe with a saber. Although it looks great on a panoramic screen, the picture is quite deadly dangerous, even Liz-n Dick-Philes should avoid (the attitude of the stars to "what the hell!" In relation to the movie career of the late sixties he reached the madness of ego nadir here). A senseless, lost and crazy "Boom" is a disaster - although screenwriter Tennessee Williams, who adapted his failed play "The milk train does not stop here anymore", he liked it! * with ****
