Anyone who has ever been a fan of the original series, and even has an idea about the story, should be embarrassed by this series. Borg does not appear until Q moves the Enterprise to the Gamma sector, the Klingons are NEVER seen until Kirk sees them. Berman and Pilliar mocked Gene Roddenberry's creation. After his death, they saw only $$$$ and just went their own way. No wonder that Majel Barrett was in every episode of the Star Trek up to this series. I do not blame her for not being involved in this mess. Poor Bakula. He is a great actor, just like the whole cast. I like them all, but the plot is tragic and ignores all the precedents set by the original series. Just check the ratings. I think more people watched Deep Space 9 (which was prematurely canceled).
