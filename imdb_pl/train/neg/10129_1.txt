I can barely find words to express how terribly this film is. I've been sold on the promise of action, with Segal and stealth planes that usually create a fun action movie. I can honestly say that I prefer to pick my eyes with a cocktail stick rather than see the movie again. Acting was so terrible that it was almost fun. The story was incredibly weak, with story holes so wide that F117 could pass through them. The script was so poor that if I found out that the 10-year-old wrote it, I should not be surprised. The direction and production are so amateur that I would not even hire these people to make my worst wedding videos of opponents. Utter Utter drivel. Those who are responsible for making this film have reduced the cost of art and should be ashamed. Steven Segal should never show his face in public again, I can not imagine what made him play in the worst movie I've seen in my entire life.
