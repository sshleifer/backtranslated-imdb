Could anyone stop John Carpenter from continually and deliberately ruining his reputation? How low can you go? It seems that this man has lost his respect for himself. <br /> <br /> This episode looks like a film student did, it's not worth even talking about what was wrong, because it was just a borefest, directed by someone without talent or without motivation ... <br /> <br /> Come on, Mr. Carpenter, please leave immediately with the rest of your self-esteem and stop pouring garbage as it is in a bad tradition from Escape from LA to Ghosts of Mars. <br /> <br /> Get drunk instead.
