Uma Thurman plays Sissy, a young woman with a Gypsy spirit (and weirdly big thumbs) who hitchhoes across the country, finally finding her true place among a group of enlightened cowboy peyote on the ranch devoted to the behavior of the Crane; Rain (bow) Phoenix is ​​their lesbian leader, Bonanza Jellybean, who falls in love with Sissy, thumbs or not. Gus Van Sant directed and adapted the book by Tom Robbins, but his satire has no main purpose and just revolves around the map, like Sissy (maybe it was his goal, but this does not apply to the audience). The famous flop was not as dominated as it was ignored, and you can see why: it's a series of sketches in search of a story, and the performances, director's accents and photos are variable. Thurman is a stitching poser on a road that tries to get on a ride, but it largely gave the kibos a career in Phoenix. Writer Buck Henry (who did not write it, but maybe he should) should give the most confident performance to the doctor who is working on one of these thumbs. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down.
