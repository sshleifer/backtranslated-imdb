An early, hard, short propaganda war that encourages people to be cautious in spending practices in order to prevent any collapse of inflation. <br /> <br /> Using fear, guilt and patriotic chauvinistic rhetoric that was normal all the time, the government was concerned that sudden production during the war, and therefore wage increases and subsequent expenditure practices, if not checked, can cause serious problems during and after the war. <br /> <br /> It really is a window into the past, historically and culturally.
