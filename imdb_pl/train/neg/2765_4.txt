How this movie was created with a budget of up to 70 million dollars and is completely beyond me without being completely transformed. The plot and dialogue go beyond amateur. Characters say things that no real person would ever say and almost never react to things that have been said before. Nobody seems to be grounded in the real world. The effects of leads are fine, considering that writing is such a misfire ... but several supporting actors really drag the production down. The protagonist's hair should probably get his own recognition, it was so strange to attract attention ... not to mention that it gave one of the better performances in the picture. Finally, in the case of the movie about L.A. besieged by giant reptiles, this movie is shockingly boring. What a pity! If you notice this, your mind will constantly race, thinking about the ways you could take SFX scenes and build a much better movie around them. Unfortunately, it would not take much.
