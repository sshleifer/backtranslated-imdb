This is another depressing and boring movie about AIDS and tragedy. It starts very calmly and predictably and lasts throughout the whole movie. I was waiting for pickup, but unfortunately he never did. Acting is fair, but the script requires a lot of work. And if you're looking for nakedness, do not waste time on these not-so-hot actors. Due to poor sound quality and no subtitles, I missed 1/8 of the movie. If you've never seen more than five homosexual films or recently agreed to be gay, you may think that this movie is interesting, otherwise it is your cheapest low-budget movie. This is one of the worst gay movies I've ever seen.
