Slaughter Blow up the story of the revenge of a nervous guy who fell victim to one of the coolest and coldest jokes in cinema history. Unfortunately, after the promising opening, the film went straight to hell. A very boring and unnecessary mess with average cuts and the last half hour that sucked in a completely new level of suckiness. The guy who played the ner was killed shortly after the movie was released. If you want to rent a movie, stop it after the trick and remember, choose life.
