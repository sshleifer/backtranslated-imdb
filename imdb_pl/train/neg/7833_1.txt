I just saw the third week of the mini series Stephen Kings Nightmares and Dreamscapes; which means that I have seen 6 episodes so far. I must say that the stories are really weak. I read the "Skeleton crew" of Stephen King, a collection of his stories that was published back. I remember that most stories were average, but weak, but it was really perfect, if not outstanding. <br /> <br /> I want to say that just because this mini series comes from Stephen King's story collection does not mean it will be okay. In fact, if his previous collection of short stories is a clue, most of this mini series will be average for the poor. <br /> <br /> In defense of Stephen King I have not read these new stories. Perhaps they are good as stories in the book and can not be easily adapted to television, or maybe it is the blame of screenwriters trying to write an interesting script. Who knows. These short stories could also be intended only for this mini series and were not intended for printing. Maybe it could be a problem. If Stephen King gave this nonsense story to an editor, I'm sure the editor would tell him immediately to make him more interesting because, as it is, he is simply boring. <br /> <br /> What results from all The problem is that stories / scenarios are not actors and actresses, because this mini series is wearing great people. <br /> <br /> Seeing this mini series I really appreciate the old "Twilight Zone" series.Every series lasted only half an hour, but it was fascinating and thrilling I do not understand why this mini series could not achieve a similar feat I am sure that this mini series had a lot of money to create a good mini series, but unfortunately something could not be clicked. <br /> <br /> For example, this week shows two episodes. The first concerned a horror writer who buys a photo made by the artist who committed suicide.The writer begins to notice the changes in the picture when he goes home, feeling uncomfortable, rejects the picture, but still appears close to him.The portrait of the person in the picture also kills people and is about to kill him. even about the second episode this week with criminals and their booty, because it was even more boring than this episode!) <br /> <br /> This assumption is interesting and for this story should be good, but after seeing I was frustrated because there were too many gaps in history, and there were also foreign materials that did not help in this story. After the last scene, I had more questions than answers. <br /> <br /> For 3 weeks I tried to get into this mini series, but it was too heavy due to the bad stories / scenario. If it was a movie, I would recommend that people wait for the film to come out on a cable or such. I would not even recommend renting it in the video store. However, considering that this is a TNT cable channel, I would say that if you have not seen it yet, try it for a week. If you do not like it this week, you will not like the previous series or the future, because they all have the same boring quality.
