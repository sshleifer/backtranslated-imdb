The poor direction is destroyed by the otherwise captivating story of the wonderful Zhang Ziyi, in the perfect role of a woman who joins the extremist group in 1928 in China, just before the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, and meets with a former lover who is now working for Japan. Each piece of drama and forward movement is sucked through the somnambulistic director style of Ye Lou. The characters are still looking at each other for long minutes, saying nothing, the cameras kept in their hands hold forever on their faces, showing endless reactions for much longer than necessary, the editions repeat the same reaction is triple redundancy. We do not know anything about the characters when the story begins, and we do not get new information as the story unfolds, only the silence and static shots of lovers who do not speak, interact with quiet dances, but have no explicit emotional intimacy. A very impressive dream movie.
