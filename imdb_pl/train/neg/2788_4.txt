Much has been written about Purple Rain, the obvious "quin-essential" bio-music, but I am here to say that the film does not deserve high praise. <br /> <br /> First of all let's go one simple Prince is a great musician, and music is the only area where Purple Rain excels. Even the score is hypnotizing, and if it was shot only as a concert movie, it would be a great experience, unfortunately, it is not and as such the film has some problems. <br /> <br /> First of all, frightening acting / writing, the figure of the prince "The Kid" is to be a mysterious loner with a few words, unfortunately it is only kitsch and incense. A good loner character should have at least some talkative moments, unfortunately the figure of the prince rarely has a few dialog words in the film and it is hard to believe that in this way he will get a girl. Everything just seems a bit detached here, which is a shame, because it can be said that it is a character that is terribly conflicted and lives on a very complicated concert, but we must never go inside. <br /> <br /> The surprising aspect of this movie is how much of it takes place during the concert. The life of Prince and Morris seems to occupy the back seats here, which I think makes sense from a business point of view, but the exhaustion of a two-hour movie, which seemingly half takes place on the stage, is particularly exhausting, especially when the characters' stories become he moved aside. <br /> <br /> In conclusion: this is not a very good movie.
