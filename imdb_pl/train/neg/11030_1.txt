I recently watched this movie at the 30th Gothenburg Film Festival, and to be honest it was one of the worst movies I've ever had the misfortune to watch. Do not get me wrong, there are funny and fun bad movies (like "Manos ?? Hands of fate"), and then there are horrible bad movies. (This belongs to the second category). The cinematography was unbelievable and not in a good way. It seemed that the cameraman deliberately kept everything out of focus (except for the unpaid nipple), lighting was something between "one running with a bulb" and "nonexistent". The actors were as bad as soap actors, but not as bad as porn actors, and gave the impression that every line was a total surprise to them. The only feature of redemption was the look of the masked assassin, the classic look, and Jason Vorhees from "Friday the 13th." The plot was very poor and the end was even worse. I recommend this movie to anyone who needs an example of how horror does not look like, or maybe insomnia needs sleep.
