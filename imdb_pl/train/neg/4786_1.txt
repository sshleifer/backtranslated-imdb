I hate horror movies, it's not a secret. Lack of plot, bad action and gallons of blood are the basis of these errors of cinema, and this "film" is no exception. I can not believe that some cable stations actually manage this garbage. (I recall that this particular garbage was released directly on the video). Mentioning any other film would be a great insult to this other movie, I say this: All films of the phantasm, all Jason films, Freddy films, Chucky movies and most of Michael Myers' movies can be summed up in one word: TERRIBLE !!! <br /> <br /> Evaluation (Phantasm III): 0.5 / 10
