Of the ten actors who played the role of Philo Vance, Edmund Lowe seemed the most handsome, but in this scenario, the audience ahead of the famous detective. Finally, when the jockey Douglas Walton stares blankly into space, apparently hypnotized and says something like, "I have to go and be killed," I felt stupid that no one caught him when he was killed. The police thought it was suicide because he said he would do it! After Gene Lockhart, the owner of the hated horse, is shot and killed, Frieda Inescort does the same, saying that he intends to be killed and then deadly jumping off the bus. I laughed when Lowe finally screams, "I have it," as if it were a revelation. The guilty side, however, was cleverly hidden and there was a lot of tension as the party began to hypnotize Lowe to force him to jump off the roof.
