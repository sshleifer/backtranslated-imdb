Flock is not a movie. This is a would-be movie with actors who were not. Regardless of Richard Gere, he gave a great performance, but when only one of the actors really gives in to his character, and the rest of the actor just plays ... the result is pathetic, just like this movie. You see, the idea of ​​acting is hiding the fact that you play. What the hell is Claire Dains doing ?! She is the most inadequate actress for this character. In 99.9% of the film it looked very out of place, with everything !! All she did was ask stupid questions like "do you really think that" and stupid faces. I was ashamed of her acting, seriously, and I liked her ... Is a type of romantic movie, I do not know who chose her from all the actresses ... LOL, and saw Avril Lavigne ?! it really made me laugh ... Anyway ... If you want to feel that you are throwing, this movie will do it for you !!! I would like to be able to vote for -5 ..
