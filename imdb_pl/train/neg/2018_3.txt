Do not get me wrong, this is a terrible, stereotypical movie, but it is a delight for fans of Olivia Hussey - probably the most intoxicating beauty that has ever graced the silver screen. One of the posters stated that he looks at her unpleasantly - I wonder what his perfect woman looks like - Paris Hil-slut? Blockbuster should really set up a sub-genre of this type of film, because the plot of Fatal Attraction has become a genre in itself. When will Blockbuster adopt the "Adultry" section? It will fit pretty well between drama and action sections, right? This movie revolves around Olivia Hussey, who spends the night passionately with an unstable yacht owner who has probably murdered his ex-wife who looks extraordinary like Mrs. Hussey. This immaculate good begins to persecute Olivia and thus make her life a living hell. I like Olivia Hussey, but I do not like the characters in the movies that cheat their spouses, so I did not really cheer on Olivia to revive this stinking alive. <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $$ (There's a bit of violence in the movie. Don Murray and Anthony John Denison are engaging in fiction when Denison says he will not stop meeting Olivia, Murray's wife, because he's just too good at Olivia is also coping with the shooter and he can squeeze the round - I will let you watch). <br /> <br /> NUDITY: $$ (Olivia is the queen of short nudity and supply a little here.) She has a love scene with Anthony John Denison, and also has a scene with a shower - shot at a distance. <br /> <br /> STORY: $ (We have seen this story earlier - hundreds of times, and often much better. The culprit trying to figure out why this movie was a dud is William Riead .The man's dialogue is sophisticated and moronic Man does not have the ability to tell stories and builds faith possible These people, from the upper classes of society, speak as children in junior high school - with sleeping habits during English lessons. I put Riead on the Never Viewed-Again list. <br /> <br /> ACTION: $$$ ( Acting was not "telephoned", as the initiators say, but it was a great opportunity for a minor Riead scenario Olivia Hussey resorted to calling Anthony Jonh Denison "strange" and "sz" alony "on the face when Hussey, who is still beautiful, starts to haunt, it provides the best results here, but Denison was equal to the task of depicting a mad, mad-ridden persecutor Don Murray was basically just there - his character was not developed, and Edward Asner, a great actor, when he received something with a substance, is misused in this film).
