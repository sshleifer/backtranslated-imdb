I'm sorry, but it's terrible. I have told people about this film and some of the bad acts that are in it and they almost do not believe me. The idea is nothing bad, modern Japanese troops are retreating back in time to Busido warriors and thanks to their modern weapon they fit almost everything. When the soldiers realize for the first time that something strange is happening, every person in the back of the transport must say, "Hey, my watch has stopped"? Imagine such lines as repeated 15+ times before they say anything else, and you are unsatisfied with the film in a nutshell.
