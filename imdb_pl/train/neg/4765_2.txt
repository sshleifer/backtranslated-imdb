While the original excites the intellect, this cheap remake is intended only to shock the sensitivity. Instead of intricate twists, this so-called thriller contains sudden and seemingly random changes in history that only serve to further reduce the value at every bizarre development. Worst of all, replacing the original sharp dialogue is an overturned solarium full of unnecessary four-letter words, leaving a raw but uninteresting taste. <br /> <br /> There was a promise - unfulfilled promise. The prospect of Michael Caine completing the Keller-to-Sullivan exam similar to Patty Duke is intriguing. Unfortunately, this brilliant and respected actor only undermined his reputation, first accepting the role in this horribly remade nonsense, and then turning to a performance that only looks competitively compared to the amateur abuse of Jude Law. > If you have not seen the classic original, overlook its outdated visuals and tricks. Hunt for him, watch him and just enjoy the story and half. Regarding the remake, pass this offense to the original.
