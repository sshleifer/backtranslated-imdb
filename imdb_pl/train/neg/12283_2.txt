Alex Gardner (Nicholas Celozzi) harasses nightmares with a ghoul living in a basement in Alcatraz. He dreams of cutting his own hand, spitting out a worm, a ghoul tearing his chest and baking over an open fire. After his friends see him levitating "6 feet" above his bed, a helpful, demon-obsessed teacher (Donna Denton) suggests they sneak into Alcatraz to face his fears. Of course they go in the middle of the night when no one is around to help when things get out of control! <br /> <br /> The group is imprisoned, Alex's brother Richard (Tom Reilly) is possessed and starts killing everyone. Toni Basil from the famous "Mickey" appears as a helpful ghost of Sammy Mitchell, the vocalist of the "Bodybag" group. He teaches Alex how to levitate from his body, and performs a rock dance with a recurring nightmare to level the time. All victims appear as wisecracking ghosts a la Griffin Dunne at AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON. The screenplay is full of storylines, bad dialogue and lame comedy attempts. A good FX job and cool opening credits (both by Ernest D. Farino) are the only things that gain value. Basil and Devo ("Whip It") make a few songs on the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Score: 2 out of 10
