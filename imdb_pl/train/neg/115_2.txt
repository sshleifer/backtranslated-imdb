Never throw Playboy models and bunnies into your movies! Bob Fosse's "Star 80" about Dorothy Stratten, about whom Bogdanovich was obsessed to marry his sister Sister after her murder at the hands of a husband with a low standard of living, is a million times more interesting than Dorota on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is not an actress either. I expected to see some lost masterpiece of la Orson Welles, but instead I got Audrey Hepburn in jeans and ugly "poodleskie" hair ... Very disappointing .... "Paper Moon" and "The Last Picture Show" I could see many times . This snappy I could hardly sit. This film was allegedly not released because of the storm surrounding Mrs. Stratten's cheesy death; I think the real reason was that it was so bad!
