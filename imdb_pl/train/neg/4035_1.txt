I hate to be the one who falls on the parade (even so small), but from the first scene, you can say that this movie will be an absolute shite. It's a pity I really like Martin Freeman and Danny Farr. I was intrigued by how they would mix the movie together, but to my horror they did not even have a common scene !! I think I have to repeat it - the two leading actors (who stand side by side on advertising posters and DVD covers) did not have one scene together !!!! They did not talk to each other and at the same time did not appear on the screen. It almost sums up this bad excuse for the film. False advertisement. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was painful, every character in the film was unrealistic and inhuman. The scenarios were far-fetched, the plot was nonsense, the jokes were thin, Freeman tried too much to be funny (and played poor man's husband from the office), no one was sympathetic, and worst of all, some characters were annoying that almost led me to shut down because I could not stand watching or listen to them anymore. <br /> <br /> This low smelly budget was an epic failure. Even Danny Dyer could not get into it, but bless him, he tried. What a waste of time. <br /> <br /> How anyone could rate this movie as "ten stars" is beyond me. Ten stars? Seriously? Come on ... I will not even give you a few stars from ten stars, because ten stars suggest that the movie was perfect. This film was far from perfect, on the contrary, which means it was almost completely frightening. <br /> <br /> Watch if you like, but if you've seen a lot of movies and watched a lot of great movies, your review will probably be similar to mine. <br /> <br /> 1/10
