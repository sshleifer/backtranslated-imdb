When my own child pleads with me to leave the show opening the movie, I know it's bad. I wanted to take my eyes out. I wanted to reach across the screen and hit Mike Myers for dedicating the last piece of dignity he had. This is one of the few movies in my life that I watched and I immediately wanted to "listen" if it was possible. Other films are "Troll 2" and "Fast and Furious", both are better than those nonsense in a hat. <br /> <br /> I can drink tonight to forget that I've ever witnessed this blasphemy for the good name of Seuss. <br /> <br /> Mike Myers, I'm talking about holding Austin and even resurrecting Waynes World. The fact that it worked for Jim Carrey does not mean that Seuss is a success for all Canadians. <br /> <br />
