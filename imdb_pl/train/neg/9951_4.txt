Johnny and Jeremy are some kind of vampires. Of course minus the fangs. They are dark, bitter creatures, having nothing better to do than spreading their own misery. Through their charms (namely a sharp tongue and a thick wallet), they seduce desperate souls who go to torment and persecute. It's more or less the basis of this black comedy, as I understand it. <br /> <br /> This is not a mix of black humor that I can easily subscribe to, partly because it bothers me to imagine cheering the audience poor, the main character. However, I was enjoying the sound and melody of quick fire (and supposedly very witty) remarks. I was impressed by the strong acting of the cast, especially by David Thelis; only Jeremy's character seemed too two-dimensional. Photography and music, both dramatic and gloomy, work very well together. <br /> <br /> What really turns me away from "Naked" (and the main reason why I would never recommend to anyone) is the way it often seems to represent misogyny as an important way to free ourselves from anxiety. In other words, in a world that sucks so much, what difference does it make if girls get hurt, right? Suggesting (as some have on this page) that Johnny is not so bad, because it's not as harsh for girls as Jeremy, seems absurd to me. They are both horrible, nasty people. And they are particularly interested in hurting women every time they have a chance. One would argue that Johnny finally gets what he deserves, as if his evil karma suddenly turned and bit his ass. Nevertheless, his and Jeremy's sadistic behavior is to some extent regarded as laughter. And I can be wrong, but I guess most people who love this movie also find this aspect of the film darkly comic.
