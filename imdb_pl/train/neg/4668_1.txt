Potential film extravagance, established in the nineteenth century, did not bring results. In the case of great actors such as Maggie Smith, Albert Finney and many others, there was no reason for the film to fail. The film, however, had no end, it had an apologetic excuse for the plot and it broke with its continuity. A typical story of a rich girl and a poor boy, connected by love and destroyed by beauty (or lack thereof) and disapproval, has a touching side to the early death of the mother and absent father. The father, played by Finney, is an alarmed man, tormenting both his daughter and death. He believes that his daughter's lack of good looks would ruin his wealth through marriage below their social status. The actors tried in vain to save what was left of the story. Washington Square is a black hole of ruin and destruction, wasting valuable time for those who look sadly. I give this film 1 instead of 0, only for the actors' attempts. Save yourself, do not get close to Washington Square.
