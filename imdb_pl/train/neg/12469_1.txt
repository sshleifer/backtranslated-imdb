I rarely give up a movie without watching the whole program. This is especially true when I rented it on DVD. Syriana was the one in which I gave up. Halfway through, I turned it off in bored distaste. <br /> <br /> This movie is chaotic, boring, confusing and unremarkable. Acting was dry and without reliable performances. The overall story was good, but it evolved so boringly and in a way that it did not understand my attention or interest. Multiple threads often did not combine with each other and seemed more accidental than the actual combined plot. It is a pity that such a serious topic and such great actors can create such a flap. I can not imagine that this film will receive any nominations, not a reward.
