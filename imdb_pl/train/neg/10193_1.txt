In this film, Bunuel manipulates the viewer with the whole strength of the film, while clearly indicating in the film that his work is "objectivism". Of course it is not. For one reason many scenes "shot by accident" are obvious settings (when this poor goat "accidentally" falls off the cliff, you can see the smoke from the gun on the right side of the screen!). Second, hiding one important piece of information: people from Hurdes were like them for the specific reason mentioned in the film. That is, the will, disease caused by the lack of iodine (salt). The will is the cause of their cretinism and made Bunuel devote only a little time to his research (heck, if he checked "cretinism" in a medical dictionary that would find "will"), CAN end up telling the truth about these people (still, doubtful) . Instead, thanks to his film, he constantly evaluates them, referring to them as "morons", still and still, dramatizing the action, setting scenes to create a spectacle, all this is very unacceptable for a documentaryist who claims to be working for an omnipotent objectivity. Bunuel speaks in this film all the time, not saying a word to the people he's shooting. He speaks for them, and even then he judges them. This song has its roots, ideology and it's a pity that it is a great movie.
