Al Pacino? Kim Basinger? Leoni tea? Ryan O'Neal? Richard Schiff? My lips were tearing. I dropped everything to watch this movie on Cable. 30 minutes I had trouble waking up. 60 minutes and I pressed the record button and I fell asleep. I finished watching him the next morning. I should not care. What a waste of a great cast and an idea that could be an interesting story of "A Day in Life ..." Cure your insomnia if you have it and watch this movie. I guarantee you an hour and a half of continuous sleep. Dialogue terrible. Continuity does not exist. Work in the camera could have been done with the manual Super 8 and it looked better. <br /> <br /> This movie was a total disaster.
