If you do not know the pop stars that are playing in this movie anymore, save time and stop reading this review when you reach the end of the next sentence. <br /> <br /> FORGET THAT EVERYTHING WILL KEEP A VIDEO AND GO BACK OF SOMEONE. <br /> <br /> But if you insist on reading, consider: <br /> <br /> A lame vehicle for Japanese idols with nice idols with a nonsense, intricate "storyline" that drags you into an unbearable time until you're ready to shout. <br /> <br /> Nothing in this movie makes any sense. It's a never-ending series of people expressing different emotions, from joy to anger, from happiness to tragedy, WITHOUT GOOD REASONS. Of course, we see that something incredibly "dramatic" is happening, but we just DO NOT GIVE CRAP, WHY there is no history. <br /> <br /> Until the end of this movie, you'll be sick and tired of those stupid, skinny faces of girlish stars. You will rebel that you spent all this time watching them smile, scoff, cry, look mysterious, "seriously" and any other senseless expression that hits their faces. <br /> <br /> ever go so far as to refer to this piece of bland garbage, as the "soul" of any of its "actors" should prove to you beyond any doubt what the trailer and countless adoring comments on this page they will not say: <br /> <br /> Only "converted" mindless servants will like this film, most of them are teenage girls with pathological adoration for all androgynous. Freud would have a field day. <br /> <br /> Unless you are one of those mindless "fans", stay away from this abomination.
