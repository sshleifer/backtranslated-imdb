Are we talking about the same film? This movie is completely ridiculous, the plot is disgusting and completely without logic. This is a typical DVD / TV movie containing all the necessary ingredients for a horrible movie experience: excessive acting is actors, side steps away from the storyline that remained unexplained, GIRL SHOWING ITS T * ts (why, God, why?), People do not respond to things like in real life. I will not even bother you with details, it will take all night. Well, just one thing: if two people were murdered in front of you when you walked down the street, one of the victims practically dies in your arms, his blood spurts from your wound on his head, or your first worry be; "Oh, he left the world and the last thing he saw was my angry face!" My thoughts go to Harvey and his lost career.
