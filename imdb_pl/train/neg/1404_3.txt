Arthur Askey's great skill as a comic was the way he communicated with the audience. His youthful jokes, stupid songs and stupid dances went well because he was able to engage people and attract them to his world. The lack of a living audience was a disadvantage for him and he never felt comfortable in movies. He has his moments in The Ghost Train, and his character, Tommy Gander, was created to take full advantage of his talents, but Askey's performer had to be seen as appreciated. <br /> <br /> Askey's support in the film is not strong, it contains Richard Murdoch's regular interplay; Betty Jardine and Stuart Latham as a lousy honeymoon; Linden Travers leads as a "crazy woman". On board are also Peter Murray-Hill, who, off screen, married Phyllis Calvert, as a nominal leading man, giving a completely impertinent reading of this part, and leading lady Carol Lynne, who performs equally bland presentation. The remains of the character Kathleen Harrison effortlessly steal the movie as a parrot who loves a lonely woman who is shattered into the brandy of Dr. Morland Graham.
