When Carol (Vanessa Hidalgo) begins to look at his brother's death, he begins to suspect something more sinister than "natural causes". The closer he gets to the truth, the more he becomes vulnerable to his sister-in-law, Fiona (Helga Line) and the rest of the local Satanists. They will do everything necessary to stop her prying ways. <br /> <br /> If you like obscure satanic films, the black candles have a lot to offer. The film is full of nudity and ritual soft-core sex. It should be considered that one scene in particular relates to a young woman and a goat. Unfortunately, this whole world can not save the Black Candles. Most of the movie is boring. In addition to one scene, which I have already mentioned, numerous sex scenes are not shocking and certainly not sexy. Acting is uneven at best. Even Helga's favorite line gives disappointing results. The story really does not matter. Its main function seems to be to maintain sequences of boring sex scenes together. I know only one film directed by Jose Ramon Larraz. Compared to his daughters of darkness, which masterfully mix up eroticism and horror, black candles are amateurish. 3/10 is the best I can do.
