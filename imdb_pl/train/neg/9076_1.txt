It was certainly the stupidest, most primitive and the most repulsive movie I had seen for a long time. I was tempted to turn off the recorder, but as in fascination with watching a terrible car accident, I literally discovered that it is REALLY Hates in every possible way and got through to the end. I am by no means a pruder who opposes the comedic representation of sexual antics on the screen. Animal House, Porky's, There Something About Mary, both American Pie films, and even the famous Freddy Got Fingered, which I find very pleasant on their harsh conditions. Mama Doren's sponge bath is the most frightening look of a naked geriatric since Shining. Unmistakably edited and filmed, with incredibly annoying performances by Devon Sawa and Jason Schwartzman, the film ended without the benefit of giggling. The only useful purpose of this movie is a textbook example of how not to make a glaring picture. Oh, it would also work well as a lawn fertilizer.
