I stayed one night and was very bored around 2:00 in the morning, so without a destination I turned on the canals and met H.B.O. where he played this "classic". At first I was happy that I caught something at the beginning, but my luck disappeared about two minutes in the film. The whole film focused around an unattractive man who was afraid of women, four beautiful but empty women who worked as waitresses in the uncle's diner, and his extremely fat and extremely unhappy cousin who also works in a restaurant. There are a few strange phrases in this movie that make it somewhat interesting, but certainly not worth a look. Basically, if you do not have anything to do overnight or simply can not sleep, the drugs work much better. However, guys have a lot of skin, so it can be well viewed without sound, but even this can be annoying
