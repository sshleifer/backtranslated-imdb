I love Clash music and I love Joe Strummer and The Mescaleros music. I went to this movie in the hope that I would find out about the man behind it. But I left the theater without knowing more about Joe than I did after reading the Wikipedia entry. The film never reaches the person, his thoughts and feelings. They collected a small material that they had, trembling blurry films and interviewed some people about Joe Strummer in the fire. It turns out that most of these people knew him very little or not at all, and that the director just wanted them in the movie, so that more stars would say, "Oh, he was an inspiration for us." Like Bono or Johnny Depp (who seem to have asked to keep their pirate costume to take advantage of his current success in the Pirates of the Caribbean). It looks like the director could not even wait for the body to be cold before he jumps in to sell his version of "the biggest punk and hippie in the heart" that ever lived, sanctifying the person without knowing enough about him. > <br /> Sure, being a fan, I liked watching the band's pictures, listening to anecdotes behind songs and the like, but in the end I felt that what remained as a portrait of Joe Strummer could easily be said in 60 -90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Go see the movie if you're a fan, otherwise you'd better listen to Clash music or even better undeservedly unknown Mescaleros, where Joe Strummer reached the peak of his musical development before his death, combining all his rich influences together with one amazing sound.
