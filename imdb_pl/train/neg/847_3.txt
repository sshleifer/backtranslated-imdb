The film is about two brothers who are supposed to be similar - but they do not expect them to be intelligent - one is a surgeon and the other is able to write a computer code. Geniuses, how they like to call themselves, which sounds very exaggerated, if you compare them with personal qualities, you can see the material from the title. <br /> <br /> To be honest I did not like the style of the movie. I believe that the anxiety, confusion and deep blues that it brings are aimed at, but what I do not understand is why there are so many of them. The film is cheap in stages and tells the story basically without a human aspect. It gives the comic experience. However, visually anesthetizes the viewer, somehow introduces him to the blues with short dialogues, monotonous scenes, dynamic cuts, music and sudden sounds. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is very simple, most of what happens drastically imaged for long minutes, mainly in the misleading effects of simulating the delirium of drug use and dynamic cuts. <br /> <br /> I will say openly that this movie did not meet my expectations.
