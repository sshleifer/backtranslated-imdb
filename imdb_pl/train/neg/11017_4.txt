Women's nightmares are fueling her fear of being buried alive. Cheating husband wants her to die and decides to use her phobia well, sticking her to the coffin and leaving her in the basement. hideous ghostly creature. The only reason to see this amateur trash is Michael Berryman in a really small episode and two sex scenes with Delia Sheppard. the broken head is really awful. Better viewing "Skalps" or "Alien Dead" again. Of course, I do not expect classic entertainment from Fred Olen Ray, but "Haunting Fear" is too boring to be pleasant.
