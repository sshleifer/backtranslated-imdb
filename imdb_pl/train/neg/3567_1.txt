Family with dad Louis (Dale Midkiff), mother Rachel (Denise Crosby), 10-year-old Eileen (Blaze Berdalh and about 3-year-old Gage (Miko Hughes) move to this beautiful home in Maine - seemingly unaware of the semis that roars Co 90 walk down the highway in front of their home! The neighbor on the other side (the wonderful Fred Gwynne) makes them feel at home ... and shows them the animal cemetery where the children bury their animals is a sacred land that can restore dead ... ... but the dead come back in a nasty mood. <br /> <br /> "" DEFINITE SPOILERS ** Stephen King's novel was good - it was a long time, but the characters and situations that made you care about What has happened In this film, ALL character development has been rejected and you just play up and violence, animals are killed on the camera (I know it is faked, but it is still repulsive), hit by half and its coffin they are celebrating during a funeral (in a completely sick scene), to which lives come back and attacks and kill people, including his mother (I wonder how the 3-year-old was able to hang her); a ghostly runner (do not ask) tries to help a family without a reason ... The movie just works in the audience, stuffing every macabre death or violence into your face. It just does everything to shock you. ** END SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Acting does not help. Midkiff is just as scary as a father - he is handsome and stunning, but completely empty. Crosby is not much better. Two children are just annoying. Only Gwynne alone saves this image thanks to its seamless game. <br /> <br /> This picture shows total contempt for the public performing big jumps in logic and having characters doing incredibly stupid things (especially Midkiff at the end). This film was (inexplicably) a huge box office hit in 1989, which led to an even worse sequel in 1992. I saw him at the theater then and I was worried about how the audience supported the violence and was just appalled at what I saw. Sick repulsive horror. 1 all the way. <br /> <br /> When you think it's all over and it can not be worse, Ramones are singing the title song !!!!!! ("I do not want to be buried in an animal cemetery"). Really unbelievable.
