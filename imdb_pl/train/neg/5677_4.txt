"Seed" is a porn torture ... no doubt. But, oddly enough, Uwe Boll wrote, produced and directed a more polished film than any other film he did recently. <br /> <br /> Every time I watch the Bolla movie, I feel that some pages of the script had to disappear. There are simply huge gaps in the story and dialogue. Of course, nothing makes sense. The films are somewhat surreal in this respect. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILERY ***** <br /> <br /> Why the six cops who are going to arrest Seed are parting and leaving separate paths when they reach a darkened mansion, in contrast to real cops who went in and cleaned the house in pairs or threes? Why are cops never using their radios? How can bodies break down so quickly, which usually takes many months? (I KNOW it's time-lapse photography ... but Seed would never be able to stop on the set, killing people, if he always waited for the previous victim to fall to the point shown.) How the Seed is wearing a bib overalls and a mask while he waits on the death row instead of the typical prison uniforms? How can Seed enter a prison with maximum security, walk around the cell block, and then exit again without stopping or even noticing? If almost 80 people (according to some press articles shown in the film) were murdered, why is there only one investigator working in the case? Why did the investigator suddenly decide that he should look for Seed in Seed's home, where he was originally arrested and where he murdered his victims? (Did not he think about it earlier?) Why is the police detective doing it solo, without support and not even letting the dispatcher know what he is doing and where he is going? <br /> <br /> It is particularly frustrating when Boll apparently does everything to make sure that we understand why the electric chair is not working properly. He spends a few minutes on the screen when he can spend it, making other aspects of the movie at least a little more logical. <br /> <br /> ***** END SPOILERS ***** <br /> <br /> In short, the movie simply serves as a framework for several different scenes (maybe Boll would think of them as his "visions") of brutal death by beatings, shooting at the head, execution by electric shock and skinning of live animals bred on their skins. (Initial scenes of skinned animals were really unnecessary and disturbing, but I understand their purpose in the context of the film.) The central point is undoubtedly the crushing death of a middle-aged woman by Seed using an ax. It's obvious that a lot of time has been devoted to this and it reminds me of the classic scene in "Reservoir Dogs", though without the soundtrack of Steely Dan. <br /> <br /> Is this a good movie? No. Is it worth seeing? Only if you are a devoted fan of the torture porn genre or if you are totally determined to see a sample of porn torture. As I said at the beginning of this review, although this movie is quite disgusting and may be nauseating at some points, it is much more knowledgeable than most of Boll's films. Perhaps he will continue to improve as a filmmaker. I can only hope that he will achieve more than porn torture and continue more in the style of "Postal".
