I'm a big fan of David Lynch and I have everything he did on a DVD, with the exception of a hotel room and a 2-hour movie, Twin Peaks. When I found out about it, I immediately caught it and ... and ... what is it? It's a bunch of crudely drawn black and white cartoons that are loud and disgusting and obscene. Maybe I do not know what's good, but maybe it's just bullshit that was imposed on the public under the name David Lynch to earn a few bucks. Let me explain that I did not care about the vulgar language, but I had to adjust the sound because my neighbors could. All in all, this is a very disappointing release and it might as well remain in the deluxe box as a curiosity. I highly recommend that you do not spend money on it. 2 out of 10.
