My children watch the program every day. This is a great program for younger children. However, they must stop showing replays and make more real shows and get rid of Rooney's and Deedee's YELLOW TEETH. Maybe it's the only Doodle Bop with clean, white pearl teeth, and kids notice these things and ask if 2 do not brush their teeth? Does the series ever go to the United States, and if so, where can we find its schedule. And one more thing if we can add it. Maybe, you have to stop so much to hide. Sometimes, when you jump out of the place where you scare younger children and what about pulling a rope? What does it mean? others then always wet. They must add newer things to their show instead of the same ole. Children lose interest in this way.
