The problem with these types of films is that literally dozens of them are created each year. Fortunately, only a handful receive a cinematic release, while others are sent directly to video or television, such as this movie. <br /> <br /> The main problem of this movie is its originality. This is one of those movies that uses the formula of a "hard" but difficult but anxious guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. In this case, it is a character played by Casper Van Diena, who works for a security agency that thoroughly tests security procedures for companies and individuals. In this case, it is sent to a cruise ship, which, of course, is kidnapped. You can see this movie as a mix of "Die Hard" and "Air Force One", and the movie does not even try to hide that these two films were probably the biggest source of "inspiration". Actually, this film can not be considered original. Uses all the stereotypes from the book, and this movie really does not offer any surprises or anything that remotely resembles something original. <br /> <br /> As you can expect from a movie like this one, he has a very poor script. Or rather, he said that it contains very lazy writing. As I said earlier, there is nothing original in the film, but the actual story itself contains some elements that are far from probable and are simply simple ridiculing. I mean, kidnapping a huge cruise ship with just about 8 guys, half of whom carry only some small guns, and then they ask for a ransom of "only" 10 million dollars, for a ship that is already worth 10 times more than the same amount enough ridicule. How do you intend to divide this money then? Each person gets over a million or something like that? It is not profitable for such a large and risky undertaking. And then there is the case of taking passengers as hostages. Somehow, they manage to take all the passengers to a huge ship as hostages and manage to put them in one room, with only one guy with a gun that he does not even seem to be able to hold, watching them. However, you never see more than 30 hostages as if they were all people who were aboard then. Also when Van Dien is looking for his son and vice versa, regardless of the room they are going through on the big cruise ship, they always fall in on each other. Here are some examples of lazy writing in the movie. <br /> <br /> But this is of course an action movie, so of course the story becomes secondary. But on the other hand, it's not like this movie has any good action at all. Half of the actors look like they've never had a weapon before, and the movie is full of ridiculousness in slow motion. It really becomes funny in points. <br /> <br /> Of course, the movie also does not have the best actors, although I must say that Casper Van Dien really is not a bad "action hero" and actor, as for the genre and B-movie system. He just suffers from the same problem as Tom Cruise; no matter how old he is, he never looks convincing enough to play the father of a teenager. Van Dien started out as a promising new young actor, but being in such films does not really help his career. He is probably capable of something better, though he never has the right opportunity to show it. All other actors also do a fairly good job, but their characters are just so formal that they never really get interesting. <br /> <br /> Well, this is not the worst movie genre I've ever seen, but also the ain is exactly the most original or unforgettable. <br /> <br /> 4/10
