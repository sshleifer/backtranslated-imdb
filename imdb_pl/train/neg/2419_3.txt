I just give it three because it fulfilled what my friends hoped and I would: entertain. <br /> <br /> I was not stupid enough to rent this thinking that it would be a zombie movie with people like Romero or Fulci, but what I hired him for was a laugh. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a movie for entertainment or a movie that will make you shake your head with embarrassment, go to him. This is the perfect solution for fans of the "Mystery Science Theater", but the only downside is that it is so bad that it makes fun of yourself. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think it's a shame to link it to any other Hollywood title that we can know, because when the movie is sucked, it has its own genre.
