... which is not exactly calling support. In general, "DinoCroc" was a much better movie. Sure, in this movie, Matt Borlenghi played a complete bag, which the whole movie cried when his younger brother was eaten by DinoCroc. But the special effects in "DinoCroc" were better, the plot lines were better and the game was better. Here are the problems with "Blood Surf" - 1) the deadly crocodile looks like a child's model with a retractable jaw. 2) the plot is funny. Matt Borlenghi & Co. crashes on a deserted island, where he meets a furious group of ugly Filipinos who try to force themselves to be women in the group. Which was a complete loss of 15 minutes of film. And 3) there is not enough time for croc. There are several outstanding features of "Blood Surf" - actresses are quite attractive, and Matt Borlenghi is eaten by the croc at the end of the movie. But if you're on your deathbed and have enough time to watch one of Matt Borlenghi's films / killer crocodile, skip this video and run "DinoCroc" instead.
