Warner Bros. he made a lot of potboilers in the thirties, and most of them are fast, economical and very funny. I really love how the studio used less-effective elements of our everyday life. This is one of the few Warner melodramas that simply do not work. Edward G. Robinson plays the ruthless editor of the newspaper, who revives the 20-year-old murderous story of tragic consequences. Robinson gives a live performance, but is surrounded by actors who do not cross the mustard. H. B. Warner, Aline MacMahon and Boris Karloff are good, but the bad behavior of Frances Starr and Anthony Bushell in the other leads really hurts the movie. Starr is particularly angry during his great dramatic scene at the end of the movie. In addition, the moralistic tone of the film seems ridiculous in the context of Hollywood's pre-coding. LeRoya's direction is full of innovative visual accents, but he can not overcome bad behavior and accidentally funny situations. The work of the Sol Polito camera is strong. Somehow this piece of draka received an Oscar nomination for the best film (for the year that he gave us "M", "Dracula" and "Frankenstein").
