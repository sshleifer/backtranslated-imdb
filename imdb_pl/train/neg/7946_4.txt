one word boring. <br /> <br /> young demi looks good but is pregnant (- point for it = D) the movie is not scary at all ... <br /> <br /> the first scene looked a bit bad, I could render better clouds using my laptop and after the effects. but it was then ... and now it is now. some movies do not age well ... this is one of them. <br /> <br /> not worth renting or buying ... instead of something exorcist, better ... <br /> <br /> next = D <br /> <br /> for part of the drama at the beginning only and just suxor = D
