This show turned out to be a 30-minute loss of valuable hard disk space for DVRs. I did not expect much, and I received less. Not only do I expect this series to be canceled by the second episode, but I can not believe that Geico will ever try to use the caveman advertising campaign again. I would rather spend the night checking my daughter's hair for lice than watching this piece of rubbish. I wonder what ABC has gone through to make this concert fit the upcoming fall, maybe a hospital / crime / mocumentary reality show with an AFLAC duck? In case I have not been able to express my opinion about this program, let me make it clear that it is not very good.
