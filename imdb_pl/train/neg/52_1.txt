I was excited to watch a Cataluny movie in a competition in Berlin. But after the presentation I was totally disappointed and furious. Too much blood, too much time, too many topics for nothing. The Spanish Civil War, like every war, was terrible. Vengeance, very human behavior, not quite nice, is shown in countless films and plays, as well as in relations between homosexuals and skepticism in Spain about Catholicism. But what Mr Villaronga is trying to do is a pseudo-tragedy that may be one of the worst films in history. It's really a pity to see Angela Molina in this movie. I advise anyone under any circumstances not to watch this movie.
