I just saw this movie yesterday. <br /> <br /> My girlfriend wanted to see it only thanks to Richard Gere. <br /> <br /> I feel that I've wasted my time and money and told my girlfriend it's the last time to see the movie just because there's an actor / actress in it. I hope that she learned this lesson because I had a problem with keeping her in place. As for me, since I paid, I wanted to at least see the end, in the hope that something good will come, but I did not hold my breath and thankfully because I would be a victim of the same film. <br /> <br /> This is not a black and white film, only black and black. The main character (Richard Gere) is almost as bad as his registrant, and all sex offenders are portrayed as irreparable tough criminals, and the bad guys among them were really very bad. Talk about the stereotype and use of a typical American phobia. <br /> <br /> Actor Richard Gere was as good as ever, but the blond girl who was supposed to replace him was pathetic at best. Completely unconvincing for work. <br /> <br /> The film tries to use the popular theme and gives it a cheap, dramatic and sensational queue, which is simply unrealistic. They simply use sex offenders as a pretext for violent acts of murder, beating, rape and torture - something that seems almost unjustified. They even have a wolf attacking people in the movie - how low you can get it. <br /> <br /> I agree that the film will not be released in the USA and will go straight to the DVD. That's how it should be in other countries, but because Hollywood and Richard Gere had to show it. Believe me, without Gere, the movie is not even worth the movie from the B series.
