The story is very trustworthy and powerful. The technical side of the film is quite good ... even directing it. The main problem lies in the castings, which changed the film into an almost different local and regular stereotype with a great lack of influence and an even greater lack of impression. Apart from her father's small role, Rafael (played impressed by Asa Dayan), all other actors were unfortunately not in the best shape. The role of the older blind girl, played by Taly Sharon, was fresh, but without any intensity as a leading role. that is why the figure she was keeping became gentle and low. There were moments and episodes that looked more like rehearsals and then a real movie. But in the end it's a good point to start and make great improvements in the future.
