Lindsay Anderson was a very European filmmaker, while David Lean, Ridley Scott and Alan Parker are making spectacular films in the field of visual film. on the whole movie, whose main function should be entertaining the audience. <br /> <br /> What you think about IF is about what you think about British filmmakers. I am very convinced that cinema should be a universal medium (the best British film are those who, in my opinion, try to imitate Hollywood), if you want to send a message try pony express, and I will find a movie with a date, pretentious and set in the sixties. 1968 was a summer of love and a year of student rebellion in France. You can imagine every French leftist venerating this movie, especially the climax. The French creators of new waves will also admire the abstract surrealism of some scenes, but the international mainstream will not like it, and many will not like it very much
