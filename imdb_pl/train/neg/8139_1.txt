Or maybe that's how it feels. In any case, "The Bat People" is more or less as flat as a carpet, bland like a sack of flour and just as exciting as a rock ... and as intelligent as all three connected. <br /> <br /> Okay, the story of the pill (matching vessel, this ...): the doctor (Moss) gets bitten by the bat while checking the cave with his wife (McAndrew), and then turns into a bat - no, exactly a bat, but a bat like a creature that looks more like a werewolf that kills its victims in the first-person perspective of the camera ... <br /> <br /> But this is the sheriff's (Pataki) thing, which is the WORST kind of sheriff: hick kind. It harassed people, looks at married women, steals haberdashery handkerchiefs (FIEND!), Burns with one of these cigarettes in their mouths and talks simultaneously, making them look and sound like Buford T. Justice in "Smokey and the Bandit" and (this is the worst part) ... THIS IS THE MOST LIKELY CHARACTER IN THE WHOLE FILM! <br /> <br /> The whole movie is, however, only a TV movie a week like crapola (in this case guano). It's AIP, for loud crying! What did you expect, things about the Oscar caliber? <br /> <br /> And what else can you say about a movie that even MST3K can not save? <br /> <br /> And maybe ... there are no stars "The Bat People", full version OR version MST3K! <br /> <br /> By the way, if there ever will be a sequel to this movie, I'm hiding my TV.
