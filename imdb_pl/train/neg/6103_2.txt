Honestly, I'm surprised by the positive voices that this movie received. The film simply stretches over 81 minutes and the audience has to suffer all the way. There are several positive moments in this film; Charlie Spradling gives a decent performance. He gets a rather pathetic dialogue and he does it quite well. On the other hand, Scott Valentine (boy Merrideth in "Family Ties") is quite a rough watch. It seems to me that the main attraction of his performance is watching a guy lying on the beach in chummies with the pattern of a tiger .... give me a break. In addition, Valentine gives us a rude and pathetic portrait of a suffering vampire who misses the day (to see a more convincing depiction of a suffering vampire see Denice Duff in "Bloodstorm: Subspecies 4"). The film moves so slowly and is positively interrupted only by the dance scenes of Charlie Spradling. This film can be honestly recommended only to avid fans of Charlie Spradling (whom I am and still had a hard time watching!).
