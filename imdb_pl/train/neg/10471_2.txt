Honestly, the Omega Code is the worst movie I've seen in a very long time. For the first 30 minutes I sat stunned in my seat, trying to decide if I should demand a refund. But because I did not pay to see it (passes), I thought I might as well stay. And I did not think it could be worse. <br /> <br /> Yes. I will quickly pass through low points (including several spoilers): terrible confusing behavior of Casper Van Diena as Gillen Lane, motivational speaker with two PhDs. The characteristics were inconsistent; for example Lane, despite her references, is a complete fool. Then there is a lame description of the fulfillment of biblical prophecies; we see some sensational messages that accompany funny computer printouts of the translated biblical Code. In addition, terrible sequences of "action": Lane escapes from difficult situations without explanation, and when Lane seems to be in danger, it turns out that this is a sequence of dreams! It's cool for middle school writing tasks, but it's an unforgivable plot device in the movie. The pace was bad: after a long opening, the first third of the movie changed scenes every 90 seconds. Later, the stimulation improves, but there are still too many unnecessary jumps. And as someone else mentioned, the years go by, but no one (not even Lane's young daughter) is aging. It was disturbing. <br /> <br /> There are a few good things, though. The quality of the film (eg no graininess) is high and very attractive. Outdoor photos were well done, and shooting to the place added a touch of realism. There are also a few moments in the last part of the movie, when Lane calls God (in the end) to help him - it turned out to be quite joyful - even to me, someone who does not accept Jesus as a personal savior. But I liked it because it seemed to me that it was the only real scene in the movie. Unfortunately, there was serious incomprehension. <br /> <br /> Characters, dialogue, direction and acting were all wrong. Michael Ironside had nothing to do, and Michael York was just weird. I think the producers wanted to do too much; if the plot was tighter and more focused, and the characteristics more developed, the film would be much better. <br /> <br /> In short, the Omega Code fails. I definitely do not pay to see it. I give it ** out of ten stars. <br /> <br />
