As soon as it hits the screen, it destroys all the intelligent life forms around! But on behalf of its producers, I must say that it does not fit into any known film category, it deserves a completely new name! It's a "neurological drama"! It grieves and overwhelms every single neuron in the brain of a person. <br /> <br /> This is the closest thing you will ever achieve without suffering. It keeps you dumbfounded, all members get numb, mouths open and remain so, and the most bizarre symptom of everything is that you feel like blindness and deafness. this kind of "movie". <br /> <br /> The only word that comes to mind after my attempt is OUTRAGE !!!!!!
