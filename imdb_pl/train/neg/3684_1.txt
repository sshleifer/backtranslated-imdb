They sell it as a horror movie, it's supposed to be a thriller, but I think it's quite funny (comedy? I do not think), I was laughing at the whole movie, I think it's because of the absurd game and the story. I do not blame the actors, I think they were not very good, but O.K. I think Cillian is a very good "bad guy". I loved his playing at Batman Beggins and Rachel McAdams .. whoa! is a beautiful and good actress, but let's try to be a bit objective here, mm mm history ... mm mm ... he lacks good tension, it's really a boring movie, but there is one good thing, it's a short movie, only 1 hour and 30 minut (FOR ME IT WAS AS 10 MINUTES UNDER WATER !!!) <br /> <br /> I just do not know why this film is rated so high, and in rotten tomatoes, even higher, which is wrong with good, rational and objective criticism?
