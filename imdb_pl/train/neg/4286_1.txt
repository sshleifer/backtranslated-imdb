This is almost the first movie of Jason Scott Lee that I saw. I say quite a bit, because I also saw Soldier, in which he plays the villain ... but from what I've heard, it's not a movie by Jason Scott Lee. This, however, is. And if it testifies to the quality of such films, I will not see any others. Lee is pretty good as a martial artist ... as a leader, he's awful. He fights with random characters unnamed every few minutes of the movie, probably because the screenwriter could not figure out how to stretch the movie to the minimum time required for a feature film. The villain is the only character with a bit of personality and beyond the fact that he is insanely crazy, he does not seem to be a villain at all. Most of the movie is basically Lee chasing the villain with time ... or maybe it's the other way around. I can not say for sure ... and I certainly would not see it again to be sure. The effects are not completely frightening ... but they are close. The title comes from the popular idea of ​​using a time machine to kill Hitler. Somehow the movie also turns off this interesting idea. The plot is too complicated for its own good. Stimulation is poor. I can not come up with one positive thing about this movie ... I can not really. It's just too formal and pointless. If only I had a time machine, so I could go back and prevent this movie from being ever made ... no, it does not matter. I only hope that so few sensitive minds will be exposed to it. Listen to negative reviewers. Avoid this turkey. I recommend it to Lee fans and to no one else. If you're looking for a good quality movie ... that's not it. For sure. 1/10
