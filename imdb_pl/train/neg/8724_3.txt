OK - the first minus: a mandatory alligator from the 70s (well, correction - caiman) with immobile limbs is worse in the case of miniature underwater photos of the scale (with full reptile length comparable to the size of the boat) using the toy alligator was spinning around the toy boat in the wide-lit water - even during night photos! <br /> <br /> Unlike most primitive-killers-exploiters-films from the West, superstitious natives go crazy and start massacring tourists this time unreasonable. Nobody really abused the natives - exploited, yes, but far from abusive treatment. After all, it was one of the natives (boiling with a spoiled supermodel during the full taboo), which brought the Demon River curse on them, right? <br /> <br /> Holidaymakers are easily annoying (with a notable exception to the symbolic old soul / mildly blasphemous-small-girl-who-takes-glow-to-heroes, which is often seen in Euroflicks from the 70's ), but far from deserving a violent death - unless they were your next door of neighbors, remember. The pair is actually killed because it is heroic - noteworthy because none of them is a helper. There are only two villains in the whole film, so falls tend to be more arbitrary than purifying. <br /> <br /> A sequence in which a giant cayman crunches and hides thirty tourists in less than five minutes, will probably strike you unintentionally amusing. <br /> <br /> A point where the natives decide not to wipe out the survivors of the West and practically do not say "hey, you're not so bad, I'm sorry for that fuss last night" - because a monstrous lizard broke out - do you shake your head, when music is cheeky. You know, the local military dictatorship will destroy the village, pushing the tourist trade over the inscriptions ... <br /> <br /> Pros: Barbara Bach. Barbara Bach. Barbara Bach. Barbara Bach. EVERYTHING you know WHY you're interested in this movie, right? I thought so. If you're a specialist in Bach, take part in the re-release of the DVD by NoShame movies earlier this year (digitally remastered without any additional additions referred to, in addition to the director mourning the current state of international film distribution). <br /> <br /> The hero is not half angry, he is not an idiot (always plus in B movies), and the cynical little kid provides most of the comic relief. <br /> <br /> It's worth a look, but get it cheap!
