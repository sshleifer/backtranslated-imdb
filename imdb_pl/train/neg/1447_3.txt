The year 1934 was when Shirley Temple played three major films and really began to gain fame. Unfortunately, the studies had to experiment to see what the public liked here. Two of these things were singing and dancing. Another was a short, interesting movie that caught people's attention and broke away from The Depression. You know the other keys to successful Shirley movies. <br /> <br /> This movie did not reach any of the above, despite the presence of Gary Cooper's and Carole Lombard's stars, and despite the very good director at Henry Hathaway. In addition, there are too many chatty parts that just become boring and too many disputes between grim Lombard and Cooper. To make matters worse, you have not achieved the normal well-being that society wants. I think they've learned after this movie.
