WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS (Not that you should care.) Excuse me for the hats. <br /> <br /> Starting with an unnecessarily dramatic voice, which is more irritating to saying nonsense, it happens with nonsense and unnecessary drama. It's bad, but it's right. <br /> <br /> We know that space travel is a risky undertaking. There is a complex system with high potential for failures, radiation, stress-related symptoms, etc. And unexpected things can happen in most unknown environments. They knew something could go wrong. In fact, things went wrong. This is called learning. Granted, Appollo 11 was not safe by today's standards and there was enormous political pressure, but overall technology performance in the mission was impressive. <br /> <br /> Various errors / comments that I did not even have to look up: <br /> <br /> 1) Nixon prepared a speech in case something went wrong. Well, I would do it. In the end, it was the height of the propaganda war. <br /> <br /> 2) NASA gives a green light even though Appollo 11 will probably break out. (However, this is "only" implied.) Yes, that's why they let people and press on their watch in almost real time. <br /> <br /> 3) Throwing away the capsules would not work. As if it did not work when the chimpanzee was inside. The one who survived? It was a test run and the rocket exploded, the capsule accelerated and landed with a parachute. There's a movie there, you can probably find it on youtube or at least watch it somewhere. <br /> <br /> 4) One of the interlocutors says that the explosion would destroy a large area of ​​Florida. I can only assume that it was supposed to be a hyperbole, because if I do not, I'm just terrified of how he could do it so badly. <br /> <br /> 5) Technology was then primitive compared to today's standards. Actually, relatively primitive software and hardware are used today because it can not fail. It is even worse for spacecraft because their computers must be made of comparatively large elements that are not susceptible to radiation. (And the ship itself has to be piloted manually, so a complex steering system such as B2 could not do that.) What happens to the fact that they used "television screens" instead of "computer screens"? It's the same goddamn technology. In fact, television monitors have been and are manufactured with a much higher definition. <br /> <br /> 6) "If this object was not part of a rocket, it could only be one thing." We see where it happens. Apart from the fact that the statement is wrong, who says it was not part of the rocket? At least one of the interlocutors explains that if something flies and you do not know what it is, it is by definition an unidentified flying object. <br /> <br /> 7) The voice of the lector and some misquotes make it look like the lander radiator foil was actually its hull. Which would make him thinner than the space suit. <br /> <br /> 8) The death of Neil Armstrong during a training flight is a material that I can appreciate; I have not seen this before. As I said, any manifestation of technology may fail, especially if it has not been sufficiently tested because it is unprecedented. <br /> <br /> 9) The divergence of the trajectory of the descending lander (due to irregularities in the Moon's density) did not threaten life at any time. There was also "fifteen seconds of fuel," which actually was "fifteen seconds of fuel before we had to interrupt the mission and return to the command module." <br /> <br /> 10) And the "catastrophic chain of events" usually leads to a catastrophe. I really do not know how to simplify it. However, this is a perfect example of the rhetoric used. <br /> <br /> 11) There is a short sequence of one of the astronauts walking and jumping aimlessly like a happy kid, and then the voice of the teacher who tells us that the reason for this strange behavior "can now be revealed". It turns out that he walked and jumped aimlessly like a joyful kid. Funny things. <br /> <br /> 12) It was mentioned that all contacts were lost when re-entering. This is a completely natural phenomenon known at that time, because modern technology can not be missed. Again, the seriousness of this is hidden, but very deliberately. <br /> <br /> 13) There was never a space shuttle lost, while the reader presented this "fact" as evidence that Appollo 11 was a pile of nonsense. Appollo 13 was a defeat, but two real disasters took place respectively during the start and re-entry. In any case, the comparison of the shuttle with the rockets of Saturn is somehow ... well, just stupid. Even ignoring this, successful shuttle missions do not seem to be interesting to the public. <br /> <br /> 14) What happens to UFOs? Even in the context of the film, it makes no sense. Unless you assume that it was created for entertainment purposes, addressed to a specific group of recipients (which seems to include people who do not understand history, science or rhetoric). <br /> <br /> Even the point of the movie is a bit unclear. There are phrases like "covered up to now", "publicly disclosed here for the first time", but the film does not blame or offer lessons or anything that you would expect from a film so emotionally done. In the old good tradition of sensation, there are many photos from interviews and recordings of fragments that are often out of context or with people we know nothing about, except for the "NASA scientist". Wow, so the astronauts were very nervous before the venture? You want. What does this have to do with the point of the film? Oh, at what point. <br /> <br /> In summary, except that it is careless or imprecisely inaccurate, it is not even good entertainment. And believe me, I'm a guy who likes his bad documentaries; this movie is not funny, funny, quaint, it's nothing.
