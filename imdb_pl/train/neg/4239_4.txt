It was better than the average movie that I thought was on the cable. I was expecting something similar to a tacky melodrama and bad special effects in such classics as Christmas Rush or First Daughter / Target / Shot, etc. <br /> <br /> The cast was well matched ... I especially liked Ron Livingston as a strenuous commander MATCHMAKER. It's good to see him in the same material with which he was so lucky in the Band of Brothers. Producers and designers did their homework because all the scenes and shots looked just like they did in 1997. <br /> <br /> So if you have a chance to see this movie, and I'm sure it will, because the FX will repeat everything 50 times ... it will take 2 hours and will enjoy it.
