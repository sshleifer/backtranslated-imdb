Unsuccessful train. Bad phone number. An extra cup of coffee. What will happen to people around you when you make a seemingly harmless decision? Most people do not think about how they absorb their thoughts and actions. <br /> <br /> "Happenstance" talks about the mutual relations and causes and effects of mundaneness in relation to a group of normal Parisian people. It has all the components of what goes into contemporary theater, with a full cast of dysfunctional and disappointed. <br /> <br /> There is a crook, a husband, an illegal immigrant, a classic slacker, a pickpocket, a crazy grandmother, an annoying girl, a selfish roommate and a homeless man. Audrey Tautou serves as a former heroine (in the sense that she is in the camera, like every other and opens and closes the movie) and a normal girl who simply can not find the right rhythm in her life. <br /> <br /> Learn at the beginning of the day from a stranger on the train, which holds her horoscope. What happens to her during the day is narrated by different characters. Does the prophecy fulfill itself? The concept is good, but the story is weak. Calls from one event to the next are weak. There is a better story telling in 15 seconds of the Liberty Mutual insurance ad, in which one person sees a good deed and passes it on to others than within two hours. <br /> <br /> If you like Audrey Tautou, then you can definitely take the time for this movie, but you will end up being dissatisfied and wonder what the same story might be if it was supported by a better producer and director.
