Wide enough for you? Wait until you see this heavy <br /> <br /> adaptation of a small collegiate of one act. What is shocking and wild in college <br /> <br /> can hardly last with time, and this is proof. To take on yourself <br /> <br /> Catholic church with humor on the sides is not shocking nor <br /> <br /> interesting or funny, it's boring. Performers are a game <br /> <br />, giving everything they have, but it's basically a game that does not <br /> <br /> open to filming well. Not much fun.
