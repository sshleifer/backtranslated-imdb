Usually, every movie with Sylvester Stallone will usually suck his ass. Rambo: The first part of Blood II was no exception. The only films in which Sylvester Stallone found themselves were Rocky and First Blood movies. This film is extremely unrealistic and boring. Has action, but not very good operation. I did not like to watch it and I will never see it again. No wonder he won the Razzie Award for the worst picture. I would give it 3/10, the only reason why he got 3 was that he had a good share, but not good enough.
