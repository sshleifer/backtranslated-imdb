I liked the first half hour of this movie. The obvious romance between Ingrid Bergman and Mel Ferrer was sweet to watch and I wanted to see how inevitable it was between them. However, when the action turned into the home of Ingrid's fiancé, everything fell apart. Instead of romance and charm, we see the horribly stupid parallel figures emerge that destroy the film. Gawowski's fiancé's son and the battle of the military attaché for the maid's attention looked stupid - something like the story from the old episode of Love Boat. How the charm and elegance of the first part of the film can give way to provocation is beyond me. This film is an obvious attempt by Renoir to regain success with the GAME RULES, because the movie is very similar when the action changes to a country estate (as in another film). I was not a big fan of the rules of the game, but ELENA AND HER MEN made me appreciate the artistry and nuances of the original film.
