I admit that after about 30 minutes I had to rewind this poorly transferred DVD - nothing happened and everyone has already described the "storyline". But did anyone mention the opening scene - the butcher knife is stabbed by the wig and is stuck on the grass in the yard! I'm guessing that the ugly child did it, it was never explained. A really monstrous opening. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that it was not a better-written or well-thought-out movie, because what we stayed with, if it's good and a movie that does not make sense, is not a "smart" movie, it's just bad made movie. <br /> <br /> I would like to see the cleaned version, and if there was a lack of material, I would like to see if it will help. Otherwise, it's a weird little movie that's best to scroll forward!
