Released on DVD in the UK as Ax, The Choke is a teenager who can not handle almost any department: history almost does not exist, resulting in a movie that mainly consists of people wandering around a dark building; with the exception of two characters (which are obviously intended for the survivors of the film), they are all totally unacceptable, which means that the viewer could not care if they were killed; deaths are not bloody enough (unless a short shot of a pound of ground beef covered with artificial blood turns your stomach); and the unpaid sex scene contains no nakedness (an unforgivable mistake that can be made at a faster pace!). <br /> <br /> A thin plot depicts members of a punk band locked in what seems to be the world's largest night club (there are endless abandoned corridors and rooms, unlike any club I've ever seen), where they're chosen by an invisible assailant. In the case of low budget expenditures, production values ​​are fine, and all casts seem to be quite capable actors, but with almost enough real terror, reluctance to be really messy (this is a slasher, so where is the graphic splash?), Much for a terrible dialogue (especially from an inexperienced drummer) and some people have badly coped with the use of sticky video techniques to add style, the movie quickly becomes very boring.
