What do you have when you have bad acting, bad directing, scenes that are terribly long, terrible lighting, painful montages and terrible effects? You get Jessica: A Ghost Story It seems to be a shot at betacam, which is okay, but the lighting must complement this medium. In this case, it is not. There are several CUs in which the person's face is completely in shadow. One scene in particular is a scene at psychiatrists. It's a joke, if you ask me. Some of the scenes were so long that they could easily be cut in half ... but I think that then they would not have a movie length. The main character is incredibly flat. He is a LEAD man, so he should have elements of the "hero" of his character, but he does not. He sways and is afraid of the whole movie. I can go on, but I do not want to waste time. Although the lighting was terrible, I must say that they had a nice camera movement. It is a pity that the lighting did not complete it. The DVD cover is pretty and it ends there. Just horrible.
