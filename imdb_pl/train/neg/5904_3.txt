With the uncontrolled success of the "Divine Army", every Mormon with a camera now seems to be trying to make a movie. In the case of the recent "other side of heaven" it was not a bad thing at all. This film, although not great, was quite good. "The Singles Ward" is not however. <br /> <br /> Telling the story of a young, divorced Mormon man thrown into one life, the style of writing and shooting "The Singles Ward" is, in many ways, very similar to the comedy from the 80s "Ferris Bueller's Day Off". However, the similarities end. While the "Ferris Bueller" was fun, original and well played (if such stupid comedies are ever), "The Singles Ward" is completely opposite. Very trying to be funny. However, 90% of the gags either fall flat, or are cliches and jokes that you've probably heard a million times before. The remaining 10% seems to be thrown to fill the time. And acting, though not terrible, is natural at best. <br /> <br /> In addition, if you are neither Mormon nor very, VERY familiar with the Mormon culture, you will hardly get anything at all. While "God's Army" and "The Other Side of Heaven" appealed to a wide audience, both inside and outside the Mormon church, this movie is definitely one big joke, and even if you get it, it's just not so fun.
