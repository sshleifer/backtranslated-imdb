When I read the back of the DVD case, I thought it sounds really interesting ... so ... I had my mom put her in the pile of movies in the "4 for $ 20" section of Blockbuster. When we returned home and found ourselves in the movie ... twenty minutes ago, it turned out that we were turning to each other: "It sucks. Let's assume something else. " I admit, a few lines from friends from the cafe made us smile a bit. But give it a rest, at least get decent actors! Every now and then in the movie, if the game is bad, and the movie does not run at a painfully slow pace and actually seems interesting, I can spot it and laugh a little at how they end up (or under) make their lines. But I can only take so much. Weeping scenes looked as if the actors had hysterical attacks of laughter, there was no delivery for their lines ... an amateur does not even approach the acting in this film. <br /> <br /> Anyone who came here saying that this movie was good had to watch REALLY good drugs while watching the movie. This is the most pointless thing I've ever had dissatisfaction with watching. DO NOT WAIT OR BUY THIS FILM !!!!!
