It was the worst movie I've ever seen Billy Zane. I understand that this film was mainly intended to show new arrivals who did quite well for beginners, but above all the film was not credible. > If you were shooting with all your strength, you would think that the police would intervene. Even the coin being a worm on Seanie was stupid. The way Sean suddenly realizes that the coin is a mistake was not realistic. <br /> <br /> It looks like this movie was quickly slapped. Poor work. Get a better writer. <br /> <br /> The countdown to the end was not synchronized with anything. The fight lasted longer. And what a coincidence that every time Billy wanted to fire Sean, he would not have bullets. Once I can believe it, but not twice. <br /> <br /> Actually, Billy's character was unwise. It was so stupid when Sean hit him at the end. It was like a comedy. Bad! Bad! Bad!
