I really wish I did not write this review. I am a Christian, so I was waiting impatiently for this film. It seemed great - a Christian movie with fairly familiar stars and a plot that seemed intriguing (it's not that I'm buying the Bible Codex itself - you can make it say anything you want, but I believe everything in the Bible). So I sit on the edge of my seat, enjoying the announcements when the movie appears and manages to destroy my mood in a few minutes. I had to bite my lip to stop commenting on horrible writing and acting when I was in the theater (people would be torn apart by people cheering on a rather clumsy, but essentially uplifting scene and breathing on the incredibly obvious and predictable Stress Scenes, I'm sure). But when the final credits began to spin, I could think about it. I liked many parts of the movie - some mostly unexpected twists, some effects that were really special (I do not count the vision.) These were poorly made), as well as some interesting technical work - lapses, sets that sort of thing. Unfortunately, I got the clear impression that if I read the Apparitions of the Apparitions book and put the monkey in front of the typewriter for an hour, I could get a better scenario. And the music was out of tacky (even for Bond, who likes some bad music in action scenes and intrigue). I regret that I can not be like everyone else in the theater - like people who came out crying and breathless, because it was amazing - but I'm not someone who can be satisfied by a writer who throws a few words over the Biblical shell and hits with a Christian stamp. I need a good storyline and a reliable dialogue before I can enjoy the majority of films, and this simply did not happen. I'm sorry, but I would not recommend this movie to anyone. And this is a tragedy. When will we see some intelligent Christian fiction? He must be there somewhere ...
