I looked through the list of Richard Burton's films when I came to this title, which I remember vividly when I first saw it on the cable in 1982. I remember the dialogue with Tatum O'Neal, who was simply incredibly angry. I remember the figure of Richard Burton looking so hopelessly lost, and then reminding himself how his motivations did not explain me. In short, I remember "Circle of Two" because it was so phenomenally awful. <br /> <br /> This movie came out at a time when America was going through a rather troubling period of fascination with unhealthy or skewed angles of teenage sexuality. Recall "The Blue Lagoon" (and other irritations of Brooke Shields), "Lipstick", "Little Darlings", "Beau Pere" and other films that seem to involve teenagers having sex, especially with adults. As a teenager at the time, I discovered that the obsession with sexual excesses of the '70s and' 80s was a subconsciously disturbing environment in which everything could be expressed, so to speak. <br /> <br /> "Circle of Two" is not done or unnecessarily caring, like "Blue Lagoon". In fact, it deals with the issue of love between the young and the old in a brave way, if completely unsuccessful. But honestly, it's one of those movies you'll never * see if you did not see it in the first run because it was really scary. Nobody would like this junk surface to be publicized again.
