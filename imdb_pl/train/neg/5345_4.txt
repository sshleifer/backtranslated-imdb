If you manage to go through the "classic Meyer titles / intrigues", you can get through everything. But do you want to? I did not find much there to dig my teeth. I suppose that if you enter it with low expectations for enuff, you will be delighted (Charlie's Angels.) But for my money I would like something a little more visual, more moving. More. I feel that I'm begging for gruel @ at the master's feet. men got the goods. but he does not want to share.
