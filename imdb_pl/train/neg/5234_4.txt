This is a weird comedy of sex, because there is very little comedy, but all sex, most of which takes place behind the car and is so graphic that BASIC INSTINCT looks like the TELETUBBIES edition. I'm not kidding, the sex in this movie is that it can strangle your face, especially if you look at your grandparents. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of RITA, SUE AND BOB TOO has nothing more worth mentioning, except in a language where every sentence seems to contain the word F. It's a pretty gloomy, hyper-realistic British film made in time, when Channel 4 was the main investor in British films, which explains its low-budget television style
