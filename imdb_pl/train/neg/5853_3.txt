THE IMMORTALIZER was interesting. He certainly did not kill me within an hour and a half, but I was not impressed either. A group of kids are kidnapped in the alley by muscular mutants (in the scene with the least convincing sound effect of the head of the cinema) and taken to an elegant house in the suburbs. Here Dr. Divine and his team perform brain transplants for their rich old patients so that they can have young bodies again. Hey, he was quietly reworked with a big budget a few years later as FREEJACK! Who knew that when you transplant an old man's brain to another body, his new voice would sound exactly like his old voice? With all this talk about the pineal glands and the use of a glowing green serum, you can almost see the visions of FROM BEYOND and RE-ANIMATOR dancing in the heads of the producers. But production literally has no courage to pull it away. I never understood why when someone makes a low-budget horror film, he does not put it on the edge of the frame. Acting is equally horrible, with Clarke Lindsley's only good performance as assistant to Dr. Price. He has a nice bad laugh. The only thing worth noting in THE IMMORTALIZER is that it contains many old people doing their own acrobatics. Seriously, most casts have serious shocks for older people.
