Ah, Channel 5 local Mexican t.v. Horror movies are broadcast every day at 2:00 from the 1970s to the early 2000s. This was the film Return To Cabin By The Lake, which was broadcast yesterday. I regret that I watched it. <br /> <br /> The original "Cabin By The Lake" was a regularly popular budget and was well received. The problem is that this sequel is awful, even unintentionally funny, and tries to imitate the original. Ugh. The plot is really stupid in the whole sense of the word. <br /> <br /> At some points the film looks like a soap opera because of absurd dialogues, photos and direction. > My advice: avoid it at all costs. It's a movie that nobody should watch. Even for lovers of average filming. <br /> <br /> You have been warned.
