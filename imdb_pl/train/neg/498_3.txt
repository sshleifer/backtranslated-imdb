I saw this movie when I was much younger and thought it was fun. I saw it again last week and you can guess the result. Some funny parts, very little and too long. The beginning is the only thing that's fun if you ask me about it. <br /> <br /> If you want a total movie b, this is a good choice, but do not expect too much from the size of the alien dwarf
