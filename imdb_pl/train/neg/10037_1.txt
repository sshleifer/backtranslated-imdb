I never thought the Yashraj movie standard would ever fall to such an extent! The film has a nonsense story that does not attract interest. <br /> <br /> Saif is already working. Kareena has improved her figure, but she is not a good actress anyway. Akshay is good. Anil is good too. I can say that the role was not good ... <br /> <br /> A lot of cheaper is filled up. I wondered if it was supposed to be the "comedy part" of the movie. Just because the last few movies were flops, does that mean that Yashraj movies should make this kind of garbage? He has a history of so many good films. <br /> <br /> Overall, I was totally disappointed with the movie.
