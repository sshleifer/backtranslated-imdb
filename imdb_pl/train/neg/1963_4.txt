this movie is similar to Darkness Falls and The Boogeyman (2005), but it is also much more graphic than both, and not as good as slow and quite predictable. It also has shades of Deliverance and Amityville Horror.plus, we get a bit of a new taste in the mix, and some of these scenes become a motivational / inspiring sermon. Of course, this movie is a mix of almost everything. Even if it's bloody, the effects of makeup do not look too realistic. in fact, they look a bit cheap. besides all this, there is a really awful stereotypical dialogue. And I will not say when, but there is a point where a few character actions were not authentic or credible, given the circumstances. no one would be right, what would happen in this way. If you watch a movie, you'll know what I mean. there is also some unpaid nudity because of nakedness. it simply was not necessary. the good news is that the acting was really good. better than it deserves, after careful consideration of the evidence, I will say that this film was satisfactory, but not good. my verdict for a fortune teller: 4/10
