Although this film was made before Dogme, it became the dominant method of filming, and before digital triumph - it hit it. You get a point. This masterpiece from 1991 clearly predicted these events. Corin Nemec is simply outstanding, because ne'er does a good job as an author and narrator. The pace is slow but elegant because the pictures are so beautiful. Record it next time on T.V. because I guarantee you will never see a better movie with a nostalgia of breaking. Direct-to-video has never been so good!
