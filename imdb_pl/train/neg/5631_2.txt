The photograph on the DVD is so dark that I thought the screen was lost. I think I missed half the movie. Nevertheless, it was poorly made and not interesting. I did not find a story related to the title of "The Black Widow". I counted on a mystery or thriller, but I did not get involved enough to care about the first frames. I rented a movie especially for Willem Dafoe and I was sad that he had wasted his talent. I do not believe that Giada Colagrande studied film making long enough to create a big movie. She is attractive and can become an actor, but she has taken too many tasks in this film. Although they are married in real life, they lack chemistry on the screen. Their relationships did not seem credible. I do not understand why other characters have even been introduced to the story.
