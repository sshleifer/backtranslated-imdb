"Laugh, Clown Laugh" released in 1928, plays the legendary Lon Chaney as a circus clown named Tito. Tito raised the founder (young and beautiful Loretta Young) to adulthood and calls her Simonetta. Tito brought up a girl in a circus life and she became a great ballet dancer. While Chaney gives his usual great performance, I could not ignore the fact that Tito, who is already middle-aged, has a fever for young Simonetta. Although not her biological father, he raised her like a daughter. This kind of "ick" factor permeates the whole movie. Tito competes for the feelings of Simonetta with the young and handsome "count" Luigi (Nils Asther). Simonetta clearly falls in love with a young man, but feels guilty of abandoning Tito (from loyalty, not romantic love). The whole premise is funny and I am surprised that no one in the movie tells Tito how stupid an old fool is (until he reveals it himself at the end). The film is notable only because of Loreta Young, who had a great career. Although I love Chaney's brilliance as an actor, the whole movie seems to me repulsive and even frightening.
