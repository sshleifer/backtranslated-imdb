The book is fantastic, this movie is not. There is no reason for this film not to embrace the futuristic vision of a technological book. Hell, total recall was released a few years later and it worked well, even the orange dial released in the 70s did a good job of trying to create a futuristic world. Gloomy German expressionistic colors, black and white material from vision screens, there is no reason for this approach to be used when the film was made in 1984. The main character has a job in a white collar, yet he dresses like working with oil and grease in the garage. This film decides on an apparent communism approach to the set design, atmosphere and theme, but the novel did not necessarily dictate the communist theme itself, worshiping a humble worker. This book must be seriously adapted in a modern context because this book is more current than ever before. I could not watch more than 20 minutes of this shit. The soundtrack is annoying, the lack of foresight is annoying, this movie seems to be created to deny the sense of realism or credibility, when it is exactly what is required to drive messages to the viewer.
