Rumor has it that when NASA technical advisers were asked to maintain the image's credibility for the film, they laughed for several hours. After all, unless you're a politician or you're working on a ferry, you will not get on a shuttle. What's more, the Space camp (Cadet) is located in Alabama, not Florida. <br /> <br /> The truth is that everyone on Earth will win multi-billion dollar lottery prizes before the events presented in this film are possible. This movie was intended for children and had to be written by one because they are not aware of countless restrictions and requirements regarding access to KSC / CCAFS. <br /> <br /> This is the most useless movie of all time and it was a well deserved flop.
