An attempt to appeal to those who underestimate the opera, using the reputation of one of the greatest opera singers of all time, fails very badly. Everything that is desirable in this film is an opera, and it's best to find a recording of Pavarotti doing what he does best. The action revolves around a romance with a doctor who heals the throat, which suddenly becomes troublesome. <br /> <br /> Only because it came out so long ago is it largely forgotten. Like most opera stars, Pavarotti is a decent actor and has a stage presence outside of singing talent, and nothing he does in this film does not deny this opinion. His guilt is not to reject the terrible writing. Perhaps because great operas may have stupid stories, he tolerated it. <br /> <br /> Who knows, except for those involved? Do we need to know? <br /> <br /> The plot is weak and banal. This movie is like walking through the cold mud to pick out some juicy treats (opera music) hanging over the mud. We have other ways to appreciate the great Pavarotti, and this one is not one of them. Just get one of many great opera or vocal-concert recordings and recognize the master tenor in which he is most suitable. <br /> <br /> It would be one of the 100 worst IMDb movies if more people would remember him and give him some voices; it would suit the list of some singers, actors, models and athletes trying to use their popularity through the movie. Very often everything goes wrong because of incompetent action or horrible scenario. Pavarotti would be a decent actor if he did not show such a great voice. However effective as an actor (the opera requires it), even Jimmy Stewart could not save this turkey from the script. <br /> <br /> I gave him courtesy 3 out of 10, because someone could become a fan of Pavarotti's Singing and opera because of the movie.
