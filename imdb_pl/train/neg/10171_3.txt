Comparison with American Graffiti is inevitable, so save money and time by renting this timeless classic. Talking about the news, there was the episode of Cheers, in which Norm and Cliff competed for who could find the most anachronism in the film. They would love this movie, everything from some songs, and some clothes were wrong. There were cunning references, such as "hardening paradise to park a car park". The creators of the film hoped that they would make us smile, but basically they made me moan. <br /> <br /> The heroes of this film are incredibly politically and socially insightful to young people. Almost as wise as people in their thirties and forties when they were writing a film about the complexion. Not much of what the heroes said was reliable. Combine bad writing and bad acting this movie will simply fail completely. Although there were two exceptions, Kelli Williams revived as a future flower kid and, despite what another reviewer said, Rick Shroeder was pretty good. Showing this dark feature that will fully boil in its possible appearance in "N.Y.P.D. Blues".
