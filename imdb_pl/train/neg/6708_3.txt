Turn your back or you will be in big trouble with RETURNING MY BOY! Only a happy ending can flourish with your innocence, which is full of darkness and destruction at the moment you view it. It's safe to say that the whole movie is falling apart, with a sarcastic approach and homage to zombie shows that oppose maximum nonsense. Every now and then we get the name "Johnny", and this "Johnny" has nowhere to go. There is no specific reason why our "dead corpse" slips out of the grave to survive until the ball night, making the film completely unusable. Without a sense of sadness, his mother is convinced to tell the doctor that he is dead. Johnny then bites Eddie's arm. The viewer is asked a difficult question: why the film must be the corn ball? There is an answer. Any resemblance to all living or dead people is accidental. "Life" is a coincidence. "Dead" has nothing to do with the movie. Show it to your girlfriend and she will leave the older ball, turning your life into an abandoned ruin. Blah !!!
