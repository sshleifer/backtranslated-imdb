When you have a disembodied skull, an empty residence, a schizophrenic wife, plotting an intrigue and nutzo gardener, throw in the minister and his wife - what have you got? <br /> <br /> AIP response to insomnia. br /> <br /> "The Screaming Skull" receives points for boldness, offering free caskets for anyone who will die for fear of watching the movie. A pretty safe bet when you're asleep by people who think they're in the production of "Suspense for Dummies." <br /> <br /> But Peggy Webber was cutie anyway. She had a few good moments to act here and there (especially when she tried to communicate with a gardener) and no one else fills up her nightgown like her. But this terrified face she herself does - terrifying in itself. Whoa. <br /> <br /> As a whole, however, there is little tension here and everything is telegramsed like a blow by the mime. You can not be afraid of this movie, it's impossible. He has his moments, but there are not enough of them. <br /> <br /> HOWEVER, thanks to one Mike Nelson and his two robots, there are a few moments of pure joy, especially in the copy they took ("The movie jumped and it was really scary!"). <br /> <br /> One star for "Screaming Skull", eight and a half for the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> Talk about "Screaming" bore ....
