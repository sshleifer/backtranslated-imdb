Do not be fooled by borrowing this movie. It has nothing to do with escaping from the death cell, despite the (English) title. I do not have anything good to say about the movie. Poor acting, poor editing, poor directing ... a funny "plot" and sound / music were so annoying that it's strange that this movie has no warning label. The only possible way to watch this movie and enjoy it is its historic quality. They just do not make such bad movies anymore.
