American Pie: Beta House is sort of suspended between genres. On the one hand, it's a comedy without a storyline and some really smart jokes. On the other hand, it's porn that's a bit too soft to turn on viewers properly. Essentially, Beta House is a collage of sexual scenes - some humiliating, some other just lame trials of humor - with a few thin feature points thrown into the effort of cohesion. Characters are barely two-dimensional, most development works are based on Naked Mile knowledge, and "important" storylines are so distant from each other that you wonder why the writers even felt the need for a story. > With all honesty, I did not go to this film without expectations. I liked the original three American Pie films, and I thought Band Camp and Naked Mile were solid rentals. It seemed to me that Naked Mile is almost good enough to be released in cinemas, so when I saw that some of the same heroes were returning to Beta House, I was excited to see this part. I realized that there would be many scenes of debauchery and sexual humiliation in many forms. And it was good for me because in the past these scenes were supported by history and were well integrated into the story. However, in Beta House, almost as if the writers have forgotten why the formula works in other AP movies. They spent too much energy working in nudity, which they forgot to write a story about. <br /> <br /> This movie is a disappointment and not even worth borrowing for a dollar. Jokes are bad, history does not exist, and the porn aspect is too tame if you really care about watching.
