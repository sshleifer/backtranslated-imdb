This movie proves that you can not judge a movie thanks to the amazing composition on the DVD cover. It also shows that you should learn more about the movie before you buy it (or get it for someone for Christmas). The beginning of this movie looks really promising. Well, until you meet a character. Pumpkin Jack (an old guy from the street) brings the college to a book full of witch spells that he leaves in their annual haunted house (where the movie takes place). Then there's some drinking, fighting and a soft porn core. Then the film action finally takes place after over an hour. <br /> <br /> In general, Hallow's End was predictable, unexpected and reminiscent of soft-core porn. This movie is probably best viewed with a group of friends who have nothing better to do, because it's a good movie to make fun of. And for viewers, it's really cool to predict the order of people who are dying for the first time.
