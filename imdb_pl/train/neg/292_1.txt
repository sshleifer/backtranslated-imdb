I saw it by accident, showing on the cable that I would like to like it, because I thought that Sandra was quite funny from what I remembered. The only facial movement I've had in the whole movie is a jaw-dropping, awful movie that I suffered. <br /> <br /> The person who said that this is one of the funniest movies of all time indicates one, only one scene that is even worth giggling. <br /> <br /> He is a much better singer than I remember her, but I did not want to watch the show in the salon. <br /> <br /> I think it is a movie that is very difficult because they think they should and do not look at it objectively.
