METAMORPHOSIS I'm working on the Chilling Classics 50 Movie Pack collection, and METAMORPHOSIS is the seventh film in the set. Released in 1990, METAMORPHOSIS seems to be a remake of "The Atom Age Vampire", which also included a scientist seeking similar results. In modern times METAMORPHSIS is not a kind of horror. <br /> <br /> A university researcher is working on breaking the human genome to create a serum that will prevent aging. Pressed by the administration to publish its documents; and, bringing some results (or risking a loss of funding), the scientist decides to use himself as a guinea pig! At first, thinking that he had not experienced any unwanted side effects, he finally discovers that the serum actually changed him in the most unexpected way! <br /> <br /> Acting is stiff; and performances left me much less interested in the movie. The result is pandering. And the science behind the experiments and their discoveries is not only wrong; this is absurd; this is ridiculous ?? in best case. <br /> <br /> As others have noted, the end turns into a 30-minute gag that seems to have no end. Without giving too much, I would call it "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde meet the Creation from the Black Lagoon, meeting the Lonely House. "
