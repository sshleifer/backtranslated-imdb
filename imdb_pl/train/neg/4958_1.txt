They not only brought the heroes to error, not only their voices are unbearable, not only the writers seriously need to get girls, not only the drawings are really primitive, but it seems that they were created mainly for children aged 1-6. The only episode I've ever seen in the series that watched me was "A Mattter Of Family" because I liked Robin. Sometimes I think it's just a general copy of the Batman The Animated Series. Example: At BTAS, Bruce is friends with Harvey Dent, right? In two episodes, he turns into an unlikely villain, TwoFace. In "Show," Bruce is a Friend with this guy Ethan, and over two episodes, he talks about how he turns into the unlikely villain of ClayFace. This was just a small example (maybe not even true), but in short it's the worst rehearsal in the Batman series. And that says something.
