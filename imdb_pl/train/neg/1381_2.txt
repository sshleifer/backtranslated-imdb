Mild SPOILERS included in this document. I'm breaking this movie to save you the trouble of watching. <br /> <br /> Jet Li's films fall into one of two categories: films and films from the Shaolin period taking place in today's Hong Kong, revolving around the Triad or organizations similar to the Triad. Each genre has its best and worst movies. `Twin Warriors' is Shaolin's best film from the era of Jet Li, while 'The Evil Cult' is his worst one. `Fist of Legend ', while in recent years is the best film of Jet Li from modern times. "Black Mask" is undoubtedly the worst. <br /> <br /> Jet Li is playing a self-mutilated mercenary who has received an injection that gives him superhuman abilities but shortens his life. In his "new life" in exile he plays a pacifist librarian. When his old squad of mercenaries goes crazy, Jet Li becomes a guard who wants to stop them. He carries a very stupid corrugated cardboard mask to hide his identity from the police (and the public) as a librarian, and to hide his true identity from former comrades. <br /> <br /> The version that I saw was named, and it was horrible. Why does Jet Li understand and hold the hostage of his colleague in the library if he is a pacifist? Is there a love story between them? Why does not the police chief care when he learns about the true identity of the Black Mask? The plot is simply BAD. Wrong because of the superhero's cheesy, bad in the sense that characters are never properly developed, bad in interactions with characters, all complemented by a half-explained story that quickly lost interest. and martial arts sequences are at the highest level. The film has a lot of blood, blood (abundant parts of the body), explosions and superhuman Matrix style fiasco. Unfortunately, this is the best movie and the only point of sale. If you want to see Jet Li playing a superhero in a Mission Impossible movie, "Black Mask" provides. For the rest of us, Jet Li fans are a real disappointment. This is one of those movies in which Jet Li is never a Jet Li: there is no chance to charm us with his charisma or the chance to impress us with an impressive but realistic martial arts skill. <br /> <br /> Usually, the Chinese knockout of Ozzy Osbourne would be enough to get me into the movie, unfortunately the "Black Mask" turned out to be an exception to this rule. Indeed, the antagonist of this film, by the way dressed, his long straight hair and characteristic round sunglasses looks like a modern and old Ozzy Osbourne. However, the villain is not on the screen long enough to make the trick worthwhile. I assume that the similarity to Ozzie was intentional; in addition to the appearance of the villain, he also led a satanic hiding place. Much more could have been done with the oath of Ozzy Osbourne the villain! If only the writer, director or EVERYBODY had taken the trouble to create a background and developed the character of the archaic villain of the film! <br /> <br /> `Black Mask 'was the first Jet Li movie released on US video after Lethal Weapon 4 and I'm happy that I stayed away from it. It could ruin all my perception of Jet Li as a war artist and actor. If you want to see Jet Li at its worst, borrow "Black Mask" and "Bad Worship" and make it a double trait or horror, both intentional and unintentional. Otherwise, stick to the moves that use Jet Li's talents and have stories that are well thought out and credible. 3/9 stars.
