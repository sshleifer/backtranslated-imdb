I am watching probably 200 films a year in both theaters and at home, and I can certainly say that this movie is by far the worst I've seen this year (if not ever, I have not seen "Quest of the Delta Knights" yet). This movie is just a bad joke after a bad joke directed to the 13-year-old, and because I did not like the fact that I was watching it on a bus trip, I could not leave. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and skip one in the rental passage. Four dollars can be better spent on any movie by numbers produced by Jerry Bruckheimer.
