I just finished watching the guinea pig - Devils experiment. I must say that this film, although it has very good results, better than I expected, was not a good movie. Honestly, I can not say that I liked the movie at all. Of course, it is effective in the way of being shocking, realistic, tortured 43 minutes, but I found it very boring (and not as bloody as I expected). And I found that the torturers were very annoying when they talked and fooled around, trying to sound hard all the time, which ruined it even more (and I'm sure there are people who will agree with me). Now I saw the guinea pig 1,2,3,5, and the best one, in my opinion, is guinea pig 2 - Flowers of the body and blood. I will not say more about the Devils experiment, other than the Great fx, from the girl, annoying torturers, generally I give him 4 stars because of FX because they are amazing.
