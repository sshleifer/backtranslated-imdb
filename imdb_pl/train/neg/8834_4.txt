there was some truth in this movie. I remember a story told 15-20 years ago about 4 fishermen who found a body in the water and decided not to report until their journey was over. I also remember that they were accused of interfering with the corpse (or any such fee). I'm not sure if it was in Australia. Viewers outside of Australia must think that we live in a country full of rapists and serial murders. Wolf Creek and this movie will encourage this perception. The film itself reminded me of a simple plan. But so far, he was one of the best Australian films, as someone claimed, I can not be so generous. Put it this way, I would not bother looking at it again.
