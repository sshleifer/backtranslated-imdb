I will be short and to the point. This movie was an insult to anyone with room temperature IQ. I'm sorry, liberals, feminists, etc. No women will ever be a Seal. They can forget about drafts or being in combat. It will not happen. You see, it is difficult to understand or accept that men and women are physically different. Regardless of 2007, reality can not change things so that people do not hurt their feelings. Men can not give birth or breastfeed their children (Oh-I forgot about San Franfreako). <br /> <br /> Women do not have physical strength to be on a par with men in battle or in other difficult situations. How many women play in the NFL or NHL? In the end, I could not give a bloody cry in hell if what I just wrote disturbs you. Think about it - if it upsets you, it just warms my heart more. I did not write a single thing that would not be true. This imbecile film is nothing more than a comedy and a bad movie.
