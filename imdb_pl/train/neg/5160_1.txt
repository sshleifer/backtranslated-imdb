You get a gift. It is perfectly packed. The box in which it is located is hand made of the best wood and shows the skills down to the smallest detail. It is wrapped in magnificent paper, handmade and hand-painted by the most talented artists. The whole is wrapped with ribbons of delicate silk lace. This is a view that must be seen. <br /> <br /> Then you cut the ribbon, break the paper, open the box and find ... nothing. It's TOYS. You like to pack or forget about it. <br /> <br /> The film is not devoid of sense and purpose: war is not a good thing. Well, is this not the original! The moral is so obvious that it is even embarrassing to even indicate it. And even this weak insight is undercut by a story in which elements of war toys in particular are clearly wrong until they need an exciting climax, and the film simulates a war with the use of innocent toys. It is like someone who delivers a strict, condescending sermon, but ends up saying, "I'm just joking." <br /> <br /> But even as an empty box the film does not undergo a thorough analysis. Yes, this is a view that can be seen thanks to unusual, striking images. The sets are clever, and the photos are cleverly grabbing colorful scenes. But the images are cold and sterile emotionally. Like the script, the movie's appearance is helpless and sometimes aesthetic, sterile and surreal. It's a movie that wants to praise toys for great and unique things, but shows that they are creatures of a world that is empty and cold. The film tries to be funny, in a rather gloomy way, but humor is forced and artificial. Robin Williams, as heir to the toy manufacturing empire, throws himself in his ad-lib shtick, which seems alien to only the bizarre, coldly ordered world that he lives in. Indeed, the thematic references and senseless sexual insinuations that are scattered throughout the whole are contradictory to the childish story that the movie is trying to be vaguely trying to be. For this movie to work or make sense, it must be embedded in its own universe, Oz far from Kansas. Every time the jokes draws us into reality, the toy from the movie becomes an increasingly obvious fraud. <br /> <br /> It is said that it was a project of animal director Barry Levinson, which he tried to create for ten years. It is unfortunately obvious why he had problems getting support. Like most home projects that will eventually be done (RADIOLAND MURDERS, RADIO FLYER and BATTLEFIELD: EARTH are great examples), it seems to be a dead spot in the field of view of the filmmaker. Perhaps Levinson directed and directed the TOYS so often in his head that he did not have a fresh vision for him when he finally entered the sound stage. He had perfected him to death. <br /> <br /> Many of the toys in the movie are clumsy, mechanical, wounded monsters. Like the movie itself.
