I can say without a doubt that Going Overboard is the worst movie I've ever seen, and yes, I've seen Cujo. Adam Sandler is an abomination like Schecky Moskowitz, a would-be comedian working on a liner. This is the plot. <br /> <br /> That's it! Nothing else in the film makes sense, it is everywhere like a madman's breakfast, not in a crazy, naked pistol, but rather frustrating, "throw both shoes on t.v". even General Noriega appears for no reason to understand (it certainly was not humor). Add to the Miss Australia mix, which has the worst Australian accent I've ever heard, and you have something that I do not call the worst movie ever made, because going overboard does not even match the basic definition of the movie. I highly recommend watching this movie because it will raise the position of every bad movie you will ever see. I guarantee that the first thing you will say after watching the wrong movie will be "at least it was not as bad as Going Overboard".
