If I could give this film a real rating, it would probably be a minus. Although I respect the fact that someone must seriously treat these horrific films of "horror movies", people, buying a ticket for this movie is a waste of money that can be spent on something much more worth the time. br /> Although it is a horror film, there is nothing terrible about it, unless the idea to see how many horrors can be contained in one movie, scares. If the rating was higher, it would probably provide a better movie in the long run. <br /> <br /> Whoever made this version of Prom Night, you screwed up. Actors would probably do a decent job, if not for doubtful scripts. It was a terrible loss to travel to the cinema. I will go again and see "One Missed Call", at least in this case.
