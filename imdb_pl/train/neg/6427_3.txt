so I completely considered this document to be strange and really pointless. I know he got prizes and items, but personally I did not enjoy it much. there was no humor or drama in it to interest you, only a handful of wierdos and their work. some people are rather different, which is not bad, it just did not make a good impression on me. This film bored me very much, without offending my creative writing teacher. circus theme throughout the movie was pretty cool, but I did not understand it, and robotics and taming lions are definitely not my thing. the green animals were well cared for, I really liked the garden full of colorful flowers, but how did these four tasks combine? it just did not make any sense to me why someone would make a movie about it. But if you're interested in such things, you can enjoy it. who I am to stand in your way. I simply warn you about possible suffering.
