In 1972, after his wife left on her own, Elvis Presley began meeting Linda Thompson. Miss Thompson, good-natured, long-haired, beautiful, statuesque beauty queen, aims to fill the void in Elvis' life. When the divorce of Elvis became final, Linda was already in place as a living girl of the legendary performer and travel companion until 1976. <br /> <br /> This is a flashy look at their romance and company. Linda tries to satisfy her lover's needs and desires with all her heart. And even lifting his swallowing of drugs through a handful and introducing her into her own romance with valium. Sometimes this movie is raw and dark; a very unattractive look at the "King" and his queen. <br /> <br /> Don Johnson is absolutely horrible like Elvis. Excessive action on the handle is not attractive. Stephanie Zimbalist does not have the classic Linda, but he does his job well. The cast includes John Crawford, Ruta Lee and Rick Lenz. Watching it twice is more than enough for me, but do not let this review stop you from checking. For most of the Elvis fans I talked to, this is not a favorite presentation.
