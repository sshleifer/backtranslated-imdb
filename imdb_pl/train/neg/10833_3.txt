I wanted to like Magnolia. The story reminded me of the Grand Canyon (which I liked). 4 different lives / stories that meet at the end, but Magnolia made a wrong turn in the middle of the movie and I got lost. I almost turned it off, but I felt that I should stay there until the end, I did not know much that it would be another 1 1/2 hour torture. Thank God I rented, instead of seeing it in the theater. I almost screamed in frustration after 2 hours. The biggest kick in the trousers was the ending scene of frogs. My DVD player still has not forgiven me and I do not blame him. It was a special movie, but a bad, boring and senseless movie.
