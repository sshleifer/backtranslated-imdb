I think he sucked ice because he left the cube and gave us a lot of information about who and why. The original CUBE never left the ankle and left everything imaginative. This festoon gives you all this. and I did not like it ... Although the acting is solid, I think the reason the game was lower was that people other than ORIGINAL filmmakers did it if they had Vincenzo Natali to do this prequel, or even a sequel that it would be better and would be more faithful to the source. so I recommend that you stay away, far away from it, and HYPERCUBE, another movie that I do not even want to talk about ... (I gave him 2 for acting only)
