If I had only one camera that accidentally stuck to the floor, enough film on one shot of each shot, then I lost the whole movie and I had to collect a few dollars to buy some digital video tapes and I had to do more than a 2-hour film about the revolution and he did not have any sets and he had to have my 4-year-old autistic son who painted the background, and the only actors I could find were people who did not. Do not make interrogations from that year's soap opera, and I was forced not to use any music in the whole movie, and the camera's zoom function did not work unless I accidentally started to zoom in and could not stop, oh, and if I hated my audience, I could do something like this horrible, but erroneously funny, worthy hell of wasting time. Almost gorgeous, but completely false looking background reminded me of some of George Lucas' latest creations, which made it much more disappointing, because throughout the movie there was such a small flash of hope in the depths of the movie that the film will be the culmination point in duynku / space battle for a lightsaber. I do not want to spoil the movie for those who have not seen it, but it does not end there. The only thing I can think about is that I've lost more time than watching this movie is to write this review. Room.
