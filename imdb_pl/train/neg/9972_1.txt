CHILD PROBLEM is one of the worst movies I've seen in the last decade! It's a bad movie about a wild boy adopted by two parents, but later gets into trouble. This Junior can drive a grandfather's car. He can scare people with a bear. He can set a room on fire! It's a bad movie, just like EARTH BATTLE. Continuation is an even worse fate. Rent CHICKEN RUN instead. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 from **** I give.
