This documentary begins with an interesting assumption - it is an intriguing and convincing argument that the story of Jesus, as it is generally believed, is probably a myth. Unfortunately, after we forced it to, the movie completely changes gears and becomes nothing more than a constant attack on Christianity and focuses on easy goals. <br /> <br /> The writer / director clearly has some problems with the church (he is a former Evangelical Christian and has some legal anger) and this film seems to be his form of release. It would be interesting to see the first 20 minutes, but as a whole the movie is disappointing.
