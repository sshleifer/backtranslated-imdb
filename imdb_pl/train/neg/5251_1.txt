This self-appointed "very talented artist" easily directed the worst Spanish film of the 21st century. Lack of emotion, consistency, rhythm, skill, humor ... repeats the same situation over and over again. It does not show character development. It does not even show any brutal and / or sexual content and adds nothing new to the sub-genre psycho-killer. It is a pity that it should not be shown in film schools as an example of "what not to do" in the first film. <br /> <br /> By the way, where the hell is the "talent"? there are scenes that were shot almost identically; there are scenes that have two or more pattern shots and it's awful to see how the action jumps from one main shot to another for no reason. The camera almost never moves, as if "a very talented artist" was afraid to show a lack of visual skills. Actors playing major roles behave like amateurs, and the supporting cast is unreliable. There are more holes in the scenario than a conspiracy (if any) ... <br /> <br /> A really daunting movie and any talented director.
