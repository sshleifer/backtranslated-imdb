This may not be the worst movie that Peter Sellers ever did (I think the laurel goes to "The Prisoner of Zenda"), but it is certainly the most depressing. The seller, especially without make-up, like Nayland Smith, looks like he has just undergone chemotherapy. As Fu Manchu it looks almost bad and spends most of the movie (except for those strange disturbing scenes in which it shakes electricity) on the edge of collapsing under the weight of the entire make-up. Supporting players also look tired and neglected, and the presence of Sid Caesser is offensive, even without constant references to "Chinks!". (One bright point: this would be one of the last moments in which the main film would depict Asians so offensive ... or, in this case, an unusually one star!). The film seems surprisingly cheap, with soupy photos and colorless sets - even the best Elvis number at the end looks lowered. Only a dizzying Helen Mirren and a tall, skinny, nervous guy who has wet pants, add sadness to this sad thing. In conclusion, this movie is an amazing premonition of the death of a great comic book, and even an even stranger documentation of his death.
