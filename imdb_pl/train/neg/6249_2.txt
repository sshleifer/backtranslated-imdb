(r # 97) <br /> <br /> There is one good thing in the Pokémon of this poor man (do what you want): the opening theme. It must be the coolest themed music of any sloppy Japanese anime series created for consumers, oops-I-mean-the-young-fans. Unfortunately, there was no need to add a show after the opening theme. They just could not think of anything more interesting than people who argue loudly about whose cards are better than the cards of others. Freud would have a day off, unfortunately I can not imagine why any children would like to sit down at a show in which a dialogue written by a thousand monkeys takes 98% of working time in five minutes. <br /> <br /> "My Uber-fantastic monster from Doomsday with Ultimate Doom will take your miserable Diamond Animal Pyramid in one shot! Do not you see that you have no chance of winning this battle, fool ?! HAHAHAHHAHHAHA! <br /> <br /> "Oh yes, look at this! I am going to use my Destruction Force Delta Times Pie Card, which eliminates each of your Power Munchers and makes your Uber-Fantastical Doomsday Creature with Ultimate Doom's Destroy Beyond All Significance Attack! I bet you did not see it! <br /> <br /> Seriously, that's all they do in this program, say. While in another shitty program for children I watched , namely the commercial Pokémon phenomenon (every mommy's dog), at least the monsters had the courtesy to chase him away from time to time, "Yu-Gi-Oh" is just in the quiet words of A Clockwork Orange Roger Ebert's review, "plain talkative and boring "Not to mention the long divorce (I am aware that I am a hypocrite here, given the sentence I just wrote). This series takes forever. I do not know if there is any conspiracy, and static monsters they do not have the character of Pokémon. Even if it is not compared to my favorite drawing as a child, this show sucks. It is involuntarily fun, but not so much fun that it is worth seeing. Hi, sleep well, dream wet dreams.
