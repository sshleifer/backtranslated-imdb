Watching the act of Josh Kornbluth in this movie reminds me of my television production class in the first year, where "not funny" had the chance to prove how uncomfortable they were! to mind when I try to synchronize this would-be comedy. Jokes are sophisticated and telegraphic. The delivery is painfully bad. OUCH !!!!!!! The letter is simply capricious. This is similar to Bob Saget's show. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is as painful as watching an hour and a half of Saturday Night Live (Belushi post). <br /> <br /> I hated this movie and I want a refund !!!
