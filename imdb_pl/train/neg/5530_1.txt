From many problems with this film, the continuity is the worst; and re-edited it on VHS for a cable channel many years ago, I tried to find out what went wrong. It seems that they have actually constructed a much longer film, and then cut it for standard cinema viewing. How much longer? Fill all the holes in the story as we would need about three hours of narration and character development - especially considering the fact that the movie we have is so slow and treated so seriously. <br /> <br /> It's stunning; what could the Halperins achieve here? Their previous film, "White Zombie", was a successful low-budget attempt to replicate early films about Universal Studios monsters (Mumia, Dracula, etc.) and as such got stuck quite close to the zombie mythology of which they know in North America from popular magazines. <br /> <br /> Revolt of the Zombies, on the contrary, seems to be conceived as an allegory of contemporary war policy. This would not only explain Dean Jagger's opening and changing of the megalomaniac, but also explains why the zombies do not do much in the film, stand out, look scary and wait for orders - they are just allegorical soldiers, not undead cannibals that we all love and love we hate zombie movies. <br /> <br /> I am equal to each of my aversion to modern war and its politics - but I think that the film should be fun as the first, or maybe later, educational one. And for sure - a zombie movie should be about zombies. <br /> <br /> Really one of the strangest movies in Hollywood history, but I can not recommend it, even when it comes to historical value.
