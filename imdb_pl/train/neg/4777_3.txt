The idea of ​​this movie was good. It is a pity that it was not well written. Manning Sidney Poitier as an FBI agent was a good idea and he did a great job. On the other hand, Tom Berenger knows only one emotion in most of his films, anger. The character of Kirstie Alley could have been great, and even showed a few possibilities, but the writer really let us down, making his role mainly a helpless woman. It was completely incompatible with the strongly independent character it was meant to be. In any case, I do not care about Alley's behavior. The movie should end about fifteen minutes earlier. The director drove the cow dry before the incredible final action. I will keep this in my collection only as an example of Poitier's performances.
