Our teacher showed us this first class movie. I have not seen this since. I just watched the trailer. Does it look like a first-class film for you? I do not think so. I was so scared by this movie that I could barely see it. It was mostly a scene where Shirley McClain cut this little girl in half, and then he was a boy with ketchup! I was terrified by this movie. Today, at the age of 20, I probably would not feel that way. I just wanted to share my experience and opinion that maybe young children should not watch this movie, even though it is PG. Be aware of the possible results of showing this to your children. I do not even remember what's going on, once it was enough!
