This film does not offer any imagination in its premise or in its implementation, but these are just two things that come to mind after seeing this so-called comedy, which has no energy to speak. The story of a bizarre approach to insurance risk manager Reuben Feffer (Ben Stiller), who discovers that his new wife Lisa (Debra Messing) cheats on him with a diving instructor (Hank Azaria) after just one day of his honeymoon. After returning home, Reuben and his best friend Sandy (Philip Seymour Hoffman) go to a party and run into Polly Prince (Jennifer Aniston), who they went to school with years ago. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** Polly is forgotten and messy and lives carelessly, which is the opposite of what Reuben is a person, but they are starting to meet, and Reuben begins to change as a person who begins to try new things, such as salsa dancing and eating spicy dishes. But one day Lisa comes back and wants to be married to Reuben, but she really does not want to, but Polly decides to leave because she does not believe in marriage. <br /> <br /> This film is the second directing effort of John Hamburg, who wrote two generally unpleasant scenarios in "Zoolander" and "Meet the Parents", but these two films seem classics compared to this stale song. It is very easy to say that something is not fun, but I think that thanks to this movie it is easier to find out why. This movie is completely and completely predictable from the beginning to the end, and each scene looks like it only happened because of the ridiculous scenario. Hamburg, who wrote the screenplay, seems to have written it without thinking about trying something else, and sometimes it seems he is trying to generate the same energy as "There's something about Maria," but instead events seem to be incredibly forced. Did anyone really think that a ferret is fun? If so, easy! Several times during the film the characters would inexplicably have those emotional speeches that would sum up everything, but everything they achieved is exaggerated. Stiller works a lot, but maybe he should work less and wait for better scenarios because this movie does not work as a comedy or romance.
