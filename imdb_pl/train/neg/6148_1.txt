First of all, the film was not at all consistent with the facts. I just saw the document a few days earlier, and the movie was not like that. First of all, Nash was a genius of mathematics and it is in this film that there should not be a story about a man who has been healed and who found love at the end and so on. There are also many scenes that were simply wrong - the scene in which he rode a bicycle on campus, took place in his early university years, and not later. In my opinion, Russell Crowe did not fit this part at all, because he does not look like an intelligent / individualist type, so he really could not play one. It would be great if he focused more on mathematics (similar to Pi) and not on a too dramatic life. At this level, ABM was too Hollywood and too superficial to be great. Personally, I think he was not crazy or paranoid and he was on something because people of this caliber know more than we "lesser mortals." 5/10
