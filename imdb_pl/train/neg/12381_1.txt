This movie is really mean. He plays the urban paranoia of the '70s and' 80s and puts it in a school context. I am not saying that urban crime was not a problem for many people, nor that schools were / are not problematic areas, but this wicked piece uses biscuits. Violence goes beyond anything realistically imaginable, but in this case it is not a social issue, but a white high school student uses it to transform into the king of the crime of his local high student. And of course he knows how to play this system. Does it sound familiar. Yes. This turd is pure brutal exploitation, really nasty work. This is disturbing brutality disguised as a social comment. It belongs to the same category as garbage, such as Exterminator, Death Wish 2-5 and so on. The only amazing thing is that Michael Fox was so broke that he had to do things like that.
