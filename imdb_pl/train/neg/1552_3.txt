This movie was very well advertised. I am an avid movie viewer and have seen the announcement of this movie for months. Although I was a bit skeptical about how funny this movie would be, my friends thought it would be great and it terrified me. Then I went and saw, I sank almost in place, until I remembered that I had paid for this movie. I made fun of most things in the movie, so I would not feel bad and ruined the good mood I was in, and I wanted my money to be worth the movie! I always go to the cinema with an open mind, not trying to enter with too many expectations, but this movie was not so much fun. Now it was not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's definitely worth waiting for HBO. If you have not seen many announcements for the movie or you like very slow and dingy comedies, you can enjoy it, but for real comedy fans I have to say it suits. Maybe you'll see The Kings of Comedy again. Something told me to go to see Meet the Parents instead !!!
