Unfortunately, this movie 54 was a pathetic attempt at the true history of "Studio 54". The only thing that was good in this picture was "Mike Myers" who was happily watching. "Neve Cambpell", although her role was small, unfortunately she was angry. The most important thing is that the film lacked a good performance of actors, with the exception of one, and that the transformation of true history was a desperate attempt at a good script.
