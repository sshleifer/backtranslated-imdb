Such films are for the originals what album-oriented rock stations are something that music once was - repetitive, boring and devoid of all the original energy by a committee of corporate drone. I am glad that Aragorn was not a typemast as a future psycho of P.O.S. Go back and view the 1971 version. Count the things that will NEVER be included in the modern version, and thanking the deity you worship, someone somewhere in the distant past had balls to write and make an original conceptual film that was not based on someone's ideas and it was not handed over by the company's management before it saw the light of day.
