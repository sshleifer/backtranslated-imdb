This film was the longest film and film definitely record-breaking. He had 30 actors. After JAANI DUSHMAN (2002), nobody had the courage to do something like this. <br /> <br /> The movie, as the title suggests, is based on the Kargil war, but the problem is that there are too many characters and romantic threads in the story, and songs of many characters are boring <br /> <br /> Even too many cinematic liberties, like killing people with knives, I wonder which soldier does it? <br /> <br /> Direction JP Dutta bled BORDER Music is ok <br /> <br /> Among the huge cast Ajay Devgan stands high, Saif is very good on his part, and is also his first movie with kareena, Abhishek is sympathetic Manoj Bajpai has his moments Sanju is wasted, Suneil is okay Akshaye Khanna his part is well rested is good Rani is good, Esha is alright the rest is passable
