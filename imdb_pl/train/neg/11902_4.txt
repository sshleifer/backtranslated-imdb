The hysterical thing about this film is that, according to the director, he finds it difficult to find a distributor in the US because most of those who watched him could not reconcile the seemingly contradictory messages of Christianity and American anxiety. The thought that someone perceives it as a religious film in any case is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Since the minister on the mission is praying to the homeless or wishes to someone "God", does it make him a "Christian" movie? One could interpret that in reality they mock religion in the "Land of Plenty" with all its material overload, the best organized mission is to hand out a bowl of soup and a biblical verse. Lots of unfortunate or oppressed? Lots of useless homeless missions? How about a lot of mental vets from Vietnam? As an aggressive "agent", a "stupid" villain, do we think that America is the "land of abundance" of paranoid patriots? Maybe we have a lot of psychiatric patients? Certainly we do not have many people interested in Palestine's policy based on the telephone conversation of the main characters in the film. Of course, if you worked in a German homeless shelter, he would be much more concerned about peace in a distant land than their personal survival, because the world knows how Europe is "the continent of abundance" when it comes to sophistication. /> <br /> I really agreed with the title in the end, because the United States is a "country of abundance", and in this particular case refers to the abundance of poor scenarios, amateur actors and dispassionately shot films. Life is too short, and one, even an American, does not have much time to lose by watching this song.
