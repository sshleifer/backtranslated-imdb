good ladies! (and the one coming from the atheist), this "movie" is bad! <br /> <br /> many have already been said by reviewers earlier (those who rated this track 3 and below), to which I fully agree, I would just like to add a few things: <br /> <br /> three guys who had to eat their own digestive products, were chopped by an ax, raped by a broom, blew balls - a former boy suffers the worst torture when he has to listen to endless and meaningless chattering girls at the kitchen table (like us, but at least we have the pity of a button mute). <br /> <br /> the director had cut down the point and endless scenes of the cemetery and reversed, our suffering would end after 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> the only thing that made this move at least bearable was Emily Haack's tits (one point). <br /> <br /> forget. do not buy it. do not waste time. and your sanity. my brain is so fried after seeing this. I feel an urgent need to watch (and suffer?) "Notepad" right now.
