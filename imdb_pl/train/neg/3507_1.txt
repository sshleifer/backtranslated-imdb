A low point of interpersonal interaction has been achieved by the Maysles brothers with this film. Remember that when you were reviewing this video, you who used words such as "masterpieces", these sneaky Maysles did not just go to the Hamptons and there are some pictures of some eccentric people. No, when they found these two poor, pathetic people, they had to finance their project (and imagine what they had told people to sell the project). Then they became friends with two extremely sensitive women. There is no meeting of minds or real participation in the consensus. The unfortunate Maysles smiled, kissed his ass, did everything they had to force Beales to cooperate, and then used them as brutally as never before. We would like to think that those busters from time to time had remorse and guilt. However, the process of creating the film, taking into account preliminary planning, real shooting and then assembly, took a long time, and their purpose did not contain any provisions regarding human beings as human beings. An operating film committed by the worst people. As time passed, their film reputation was seriously affected by what they did here. Their reputation as human beings is feasible. People will remember them. Grotesque hustlers.
