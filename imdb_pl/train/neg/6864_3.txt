Below is a bit of a spoiler that can ruin the surprise of ONE unexpected and really funny scene in this movie. There is also information about the first film in this series. <br /> <br /> I caught this movie on DVD, which someone gave as a gift to my roommate. He came as a set along with the first film from the series "Blind Dead". <br /> <br /> This movie was certainly much worse than the first "La Noche del Terror Ciego". In addition, many features of the first movie have been significantly changed. To run, the movie was dubbed in English (the first was written), which usually distracts me. <br /> <br /> The concept of the series is that in the distant past the local branch of the Templars was involved in hideous and secret rituals. After the discovery of these crimes, local peasants die of the Templars to death in such a way that their eyes can no longer be used, preventing them from returning from hell to get revenge. Then we jump to modern times, where because of an event the Templars are raised from the dead, to take revenge on peasants whose ancestors first confused them. Of course, since the undead knights have no eyes, they can only find their victims when they make noise. <br /> <br /> Templars were a secret order from the 12th century, originating from the Crusades. They were only about 150 years before they were suppressed in the beginning of 1300 by the Pope and others. Because they were secret, there were always rumors about their ceremonies, especially about initiation. In addition, due to the way the society was organized, not necessarily church officials supervised the case, which meant that they did not have an inner man when something was heating up. And because of the nature of their attempts, they were tortured in confession. The Order was the strongest in France, but existed in Portugal and Spain, where films are held. <br /> <br /> Where the first movie had a virgin sacrifice and the knights drank blood directly from the virgin's body (photos from the chest here, of course, this is a horror movie), and then, when the knights come back to life, they attack their victims by eating eat them alive and suck blood; in this sequel, all this disappears. You still have the same scene (reworked, not the same) that sacrifices a virgin, but they drain the blood into a bowl and drink it. So when they come back, they just break people in with their swords or man's claws to death, which I have to say is a much less effective way of disturbing the audience. There is also a problem with time: in the first film, dates are much closer to the Templars, where they now say that it is the 500th anniversary of the peasants smoking these guys at the stake, which took place around 1473. And the way that Templars lose their eyes is much less interesting. In the first one they are pecked by ravens. Now they are simply burnt and in a rather absurd way. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, or maybe it's just me, but there seemed to be a lot of people from the first movie appearing in this movie (despite death). This really is not a problem, because the movie is completely different and is not a continuation in the sense of continuation, but odd nothing more. <br /> <br /> The main attraction of this movie is a rich guy who uses a child to distract the undead while he makes a break for the jeep. The father of the child has already been dragged by this rich man into trying to get a jeep, so he goes out and tells her to find her father. This is a bit unusual and is the funniest scene in the movie. Of course, why the child is not dying at this moment, he is beyond me and disappointed by the horror fans. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie to anyone. It is not so bad that it becomes funny, so it ends with a mediocre horror. A huge part of the film has several people occupied in the church, each of whom makes various attempts to go out alone to escape the blind who surrounded them. When the movie ends, you are not surprised by the result; in fact quite disappointed. If you're interested in the newness of watching a Spanish horror movie, see the first movie that has at least some innovative ideas and not so expected results.
