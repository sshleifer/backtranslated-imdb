I do not mind fast horror, but this Stephen King's nonsense is too fresh, too bright and modern. The plot, about a new teenage boy in a small town who is a "Sleepwalker" - a kind of vampire and werewolf crossing - and who feeds on the blood of female virgins, begs for a more mysterious, ambiguous treatment. This thriller has an unsuitably colorful look and atmosphere, almost without atmosphere. The children are predictably nice and energetic, but the big plus is Alice Kridge as the boy's mother; Kridge from "Ghost Story" has never broken out of the filler-female form and it is a huge loss that it was not used anymore. Her performance is frightening and intense, and implies that "Sleepwalkers" could have been a much better movie with a different focus and a more compact direction. It is too exaggerated and commercially driven, with an uneven tone that changes dramatically from thriller to comedy and drama. Stephen King appears in the episode, just like the real directors John Landis and Tobe Hooper. * 1/2 of ****
