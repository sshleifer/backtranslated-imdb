What has ever possessed Martin Scorcese to make this movie? And not only did he change it, he completely ruined it? A meaningless decision that the character played by Robert DeNiro (in his most exaggerated performance, and that says a lot) in a religious fanatic, is funny and exemplary in relation to Hollywood (and especially Mr. Scorcese) - attitudes that compel writers to judge that the best way to make a mad person is to tattoo the crucifix on your back. In any case, this movie is terrible. <br /> <br />
