The first actor's film is usually something you can afford - it is often the first work in which the lack of movie experience of all involved is really visible, and this film is no exception. <br /> <br /> But worse than that even by the standards of 1982 it is so bad that it is hysterically funny. Shot entirely in the Chicago area on a budget of course, most of the cast is rigid, wooden and cartoony - the cross between high school play and bad community theater. The noise from the nearby movement often drowns dialogue, and the dialogue is really bad, very declarative in a way that seems rather forced and deliberate than natural and organic. The scenes are elaborate and restless, and although the heroes go through years, neither children nor adults grow old at all. <br /> <br /> I believe that it is possible to make a Christian film that is pleasant large, secular audience, but too often the creators of such films are so focused on the "message" or in this case on their own autobiographical links with the project that good film production values ​​are thrown aside. (I'm sure it's no coincidence that the main character has the same name as producer / director / editor - and cast member.) Fortunately, Michael Madsen was much more interesting - and credible - to watch his next movies. Careers like his are certainly not based on movies like this one.
