It is a kind of movie that looks with a wide open, terrified silence, but still observes, mesmerized, as if watching a wreck in slow motion. And yet, in the depths of your mind, thoughts are spinning: "Who on EARTH lit this garbage?" <br /> <br /> Some of the previous comments of users say: "A good way to introduce children to Laurel and Hardy" - insulting children all over the world. The fact that children need a training plan to learn to love slapstick comedy shows a deep misunderstanding of the nature of children around the world. Others have commented on the allegiance of the two stars of Laurel and Hardy, to which I would reply: so WHAT? One might think that the BOMBS movie spill based on the beloved series (Rocky and Bullwinkle, Avengers, Flipper, Mod Squad, ad nauseam) taught Hollywood that there are a few things that simply can not be reproduced. The films of Laurel and Hardy are readily available on video: why bother yourself with that? <br /> <br /> What about F. Murray Abraham, a great actor on the stage and screen ... well, I can only say, he had to have trouble with the IRS. <br /> <br /> Run, do not go, stay away from the TV if this trash appears!
