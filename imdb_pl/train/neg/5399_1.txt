SPOILERS Too often Hollywood adaptations of Shakespeare taking pieces of cinema. Beautifully made are well-made and true to the text. Movies, including Henry V Branagh and 1993 Much Ado About Nothing, are powerful works. That's why watching "Love's Labor's Lost" is such a huge disappointment that you expect it to be so horribly wasted. Unfortunately, "Love's Labor's Lost" is awful! King Navarra (Alessandro Nivola) and his friends for three years left the drink and women to focus on their studies. Plans begin to fall apart when the enigmatic Princess of France (Alicia Silverstone) arrives and her surroundings. Soon, love is in the air, and philosophy is beyond the mind of the prince. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning you realize that this movie is not quite Shakespeare. Cleverly transferred to Ken Branagh's musical from the 1930s, the plot still exists and the script remains, but now it has been devoted to the horrible musical taste. Classics such as "The Way You Look Tonight", "Let's Face The Music and Dance", "I'm in Heaven" are destroyed by weak singing and a strong sense that they simply do not belong to them. <br /> <br /> In addition to poor singing, we are also treated to an increasing number of awkward performances by ordinary stars. Ken Branagh and friends may like to create this movie, but they provide us with amazing roles. <br /> <br /> The main eight actors (four men and four women) are equally horrible, and the only positive on their behalf is a huge improvement over the really terrible Timothy Spall. <br /> <br /> In fact, only one person leaves a film worthy of praise and it is invariably a great Nathan Lane. Lane has proven over the years that he is a comedy genius and in this function once again adds humor to the buffoon Costard. <br /> <br /> You can not really say much. "Love's Labor's Lost" deserves mild praise for Branagh's original approach to the old story. Unfortunately, this is the end of positives. Poorly played, performed, sung and constructed "Love's Labor's Lost" is probably the weakest adaptation of Shakespeare in the last forty years. It should be avoided like a plague and you should never do it. Branagh's weak, disappointing choice, and we hope his next effort will be better.
