It's a complete and absolute garbage, a great example of what a BAD movie looks like, it can not be attractive to anyone, even for movie fans. Do not repeat, DO NOT waste precious time in your life on this piece of garbage. Bad acting, bad directing, horrible (but I mean really horrible) scenario and a complete lack of idea of ​​what entertainment is (any form). I bought a DVD for $ 3, I swear I could almost pay someone to take it. Burning it would not be enough for what this movie did to me. I like movies-b, deadly toys, strange monsters from the lagoons, but they're not around. Do you know those movies that are so bad they are funny? Not even. Just old, pathetic.
