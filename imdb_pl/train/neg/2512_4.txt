Tim Robbins is strangely gentle, manned as a mechanic in a garage in New Jersey in 1950, who falls in love with a dashing blonde who turns out to be Albert Einstein's niece! Although most of the time it is on the screen, Robbins cancels the inner action of his intense personality and fades in the background (it's easy to forget that he's even in the picture!). Lumpy romantic comedy with a grip, this is Walter Matthau playing Einstein (who does what he can do with a cartoon character). Otherwise, it is sweet and sunny, directed rather sleepily by Fred Schepisi, who shows the heart, but no wit or mind. Meg Ryan is her usual kind person, and the chemistry between her and Robbins is lovely, like the feelings of her sister and her older brother. ** with ****
