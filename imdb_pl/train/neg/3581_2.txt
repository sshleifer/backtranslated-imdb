I was not able to decide if this movie is so bad that it is good, or to quote Enid Coleslaw, "so bad it's gone well and it's bad again". Regardless, it forced me to look just like a pile of weird, colorful vomit, and it offers a lot of scenes that you will not forget, even if you like. Mocking young Ray Liotta tells Pia who is strumming that her creative trophy is reminiscent of a dick. A little later, Ray appears again, molester Pia, not a properly shaped trophy, but a garden hose. She is determined, conquered Pia, who tells her dominant mother that she wants to go to bed with Ray's father, Walter. The actress on the cemetery scene turns the best line ever written by Pia or anyone else: "WWWWHHHYYYYYYY!" There's this garden hose again, because Walter waves his face to Pia and roars "Is this more to your liking?" Pia is her date, so excited about the close ups of each of them that they start to pull each other's clothes off. There is a Pia shower, but she forgets to take off her dress. Perhaps the best thing is the Pia typewriter, but instead of the keys are miniature talking heads of those who tormented it the most (then I was afraid to open the laptop). And finally Pia is at The Awards, staging Hollywood on the cesspool, spitting out the second best line ever: "I do not think I'm the only one who ever had to get to the top. "I see that I have spent more time commenting on" The Lonely Lady "than on much better photos, so I will give up. But be forewarned that when you start watching, you probably will not be able to take your eyes off the screen until the two hours of your life are gone forever.
