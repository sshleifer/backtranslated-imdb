Look carefully at the great set of talents created to create this movie: Connery, Fishburne, Capshaw, Harris, Underwood, Beatty, Thigpen, and even the Slezak, Lange and Plimpton cameramen. They prove, in spades, that a good throw can not save a bad script. The plot requires so many jumps of faith from the audience that its improbability should exceed even Hollywood standards. It is not particularly original, and "twists and turns" are cruel.
