We saw it on the shelf in a local video store, saw "Coppola" in the subtitles and we were excited. It was the only time that this movie aroused any interest. I would never know if it was an attempt to humor the film, which failed miserably, or the attempt of a serious film, which suffered a defeat. In general, the whole production seemed unbelievably amisherishish. In particular, the sound was absolutely horrible, especially in scenes shot in a small bar; the dialogue was so banal that it was unbelievable. Very disappointing.
