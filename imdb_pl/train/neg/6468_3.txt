It's good that The Score appeared for Marlon Brando as a farewell show, because I would not like to think about going for free money. Not what his fans should remember about him. <br /> <br /> Brando has been more like Orson Welles in recent years, and Free Money is a movie that Welles would do, looking for financing his own work. Brando is the guardian of a local prison, which in America, when in a small rural area, is usually the largest employer in the area. It gives someone who has a lot of punch. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately he has one weakness he gives himself, his two twin bimbos called daughters differently. Even when they are pregnant by a couple of losers, Charlie Sheen and Thomas Haden, their hearts still belong to my father. <br /> <br /> Do not be afraid, because Brando is ready to give them a job in prison, in which they work in conditions not much better than convicts. What to do, but commit a robbery of a train that passes through the town, every now and then carrying money intended for burning by the State Treasury. <br /> <br /> Although Free Money has a few moments of humor, most of the time is quite below the talents of all involved. Some of them would include Donald Sutherland as an equally corrupt judge and Mira Sorvino as his stepdaughter, but also an FBI agent with a direct arrow. <br /> <br /> Of course, these people and the rest of the cast had to work with someone who is considered by many to be the greatest American actor of the last century. If it were not for Brando's presence and whether it was about 40 years earlier, Free Money would play on the American red track, where the public could see how they are satirized. <br /> <br /> Or trying to satire them.
