Really, everyone in this movie looks like they want to be somewhere else! No wonder that throwing is done not with the left hand, but not at all. I did not see anything worse than Natascha McElhone impersonating an agent carrying a weapon. In this role you do not use the broken urban appearance. The only worse thing I can imagine is throwing Doris Day as a prostitute. The rest of the cast is also awful, probably with Hurt as the only exception, sometimes you see him trying but suffering. Did I mention that this is a completely crazy story? Combating many people is alive because you are divorced and want to see your family? Well, it's because the guy (Weller) is German? <br /> <br /> 2/10, because photography can be worse.
