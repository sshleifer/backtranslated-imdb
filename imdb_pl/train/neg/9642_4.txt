I could not believe in a terrible dialogue coming out of people's mouths, and the final spinning wheel attached to the body of the movie was a real bang. And we get the titular shots of Angelique Pettyjohn (genus) and Lorena Crabtree to run. <br /> <br /> A teleportation device activated by a psychic Angelique Pettyjohn brings a foreign container to an underground laboratory in the desert. According to director Fred Olen Ray, these were remnants from the film by Klaus Kinski, ANDROID, which gives the film a greater value than what cheap looks like. <br /> <br /> Inside the container is a dwarf alien (played by Ray son) who begins to scratch people to death. It was quite funny to watch this little "creature" in a black reptile suit with big beetles on it, running in the dark. We even see a small stamp on the ET poster that seemed funny to me. <br /> <br /> And then there is something that looks like a snake that also comes out of the container that William Fair's death is driven into after the mini creature chews Frank McDonald's neck in the kitchen. Low budget for ALIEN, I suppose ... <br /> <br /> The whole thing ends abruptly, looking like there's a movie missing at the end before the reel blooper with the final credits appears. Talk about lack of funds ... <br /> <br /> Fred Olen Ray also mentions in the director's comment that they were also not sure if Aldo Ray would go through the shooting and remember his lines. He barely did it. <br /> <br /> Low budget sneeze from cheese. It's nice to watch, I'll give it to you. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
