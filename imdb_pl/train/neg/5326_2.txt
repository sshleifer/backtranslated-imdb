"Smithereens" is a kind of worthless movie that simply stops among cable channels, taking a place like a cheap novel in a public library. A worthless piece of guts and the first effort for the average director Seidelman, the film is full of bad action, bad sound, bad camera work and poor quality in all aspects of the film. Many better movies never go to the market and that's why junk movies like they do and never seem to go away, it's one of the great mysteries of life. (RE-)
