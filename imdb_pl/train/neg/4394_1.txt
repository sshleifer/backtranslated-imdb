John Goodman's program was quite awful, but this thing just stinks. The only thing about this mess that made me smile was to recognize Patrick Starfish's voice as Frosty. History is hopeless, written by someone who has distorted the memories of rebellion in childhood, but has never achieved any adult sense of perspective in the years to come. Paranoia rules the dark world inhabiting these figures. Everyone is unpleasant and without reason. The plot is predictable, but the spectacle revolves around one inexplicable, unrelated scene to the other in such a purposeless way that watching it does not bring pleasure. The worst thing is that no one in the production team has ever seen snow!
