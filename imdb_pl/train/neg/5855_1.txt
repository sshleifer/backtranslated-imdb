The film was released at the beginning of 2000. Together with MELA and both catastrophes. So sad to start a millennium with such nonsense. <br /> <br /> The film seems to fit the 70s, but looks like an unintentional komedia na 2000 <br / > <br /> Anywayz some classic jewels from the movie: Paresh Rawal I do not understand to laugh at his role or cry Reason: Seeking his mother in the village the worst thing is when he realizes the secret of Anil, who hides in the stomach that becomes big and makes her look pregnant. I remember that in my childhood my teacher told me the same joke Urrf !!!! as a child, I was laughing at that time, but here? <br /> <br /> The whole film is a joke that can not be explained. Anil's mom in a double role (one older and younger) and Rekha playing older wife and Raveen the youngers. We also rejected Harish while Shakti played the son of Aruna Irani who fight, who has the worst wig <br /> <br /> Direction is out of date. Music is bad <br /> <br /> Anil looks very much older and younger in the older role, but Rekha's good effort is right, Raveena is okay Harish is bad Shakti Kapoor is horrible Aruna Irani is as usual Rajnikant is alright in an episode
