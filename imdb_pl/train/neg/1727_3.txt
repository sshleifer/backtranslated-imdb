We have a lake. We have an energetic meteor disaster. We have a deadly dinosaur with flippers. Okay, so let's call it a MONSTER OF THE NATIONAL LAKE. What else can we add? Hmm, two idiots called Arnie and Mitch to define the final definition of "comic relief." We also had to have a sheriff who does not really do anything about the film and which nobody listens to. Nonsense, we're halfway through the movie and we've forgotten to put in a bad guy! Do not worry, let's introduce a guy with a mustache, tell him to rob the shop to show he's a bad guy, and then ask him to come somewhere near the lake. as dinosaur snacks. It should work. <br /> <br /> A complete, clumsy mess, this movie. His logic will distort your mind to make you laugh. The first movie in which Dave Allen performed as a "time-lapse movement director". After this event, he joined forces with Charles Band for several years, until the mid-nineties, when he did not have enough money to pay him. Dinosaur effects are cute, and the whole movie is damn involuntarily funny. Unfortunately, this is the only good thing you can say for it. <br /> <br /> Good evil? Yes. The logic of bending the mind in the narrative should be enough reason to put it on the list. If not, Arnie and Mitch will do the trick. 3/10 and 8/10
