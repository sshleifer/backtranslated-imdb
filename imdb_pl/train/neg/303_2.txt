I can not objectively consider this movie. Not that I do not try, remember - but I sit down and fall in the VHS age, and watch the opening ... and suddenly I'm five years old again and hug my own Caring Bear and watch a movie with open eyes and a hot heart. <br /> <br /> I see, objectively, that this movie is a combination of BIZARRE cozy children's mascots and terrifying preschool children with evil powers that have a thin story of uninteresting animation. But my inner five-year old goes "Yay! Care Bears! "I think about it every time. So - I (only cautiously, reluctantly) recommend this film to those who have seen it in their early youth and can recall the incredible power of nostalgia when watching it (like me) OR those cynical Gen-X / Y-ers. who deliberately seek a wonderfully evil / strange (category to which this film ... definitely belongs). For those who are looking for a fascinating movie or healthy family entertainment: you may want to look further.
