I read about the film in the magazine and was intrigued. A woman who one day sees in her own car. Well, I thought it might be interesting ... <br /> <br /> ... but it is not. First, the title. Broken? The Broken ... what? What's wrong? Oh ... wait ... I understand, the title itself is "broken"! WOW, clever! Unfortunately, this is practically the only thing that is based on it. <br /> <br /> The premise is not so bad, but I think that Kiefer Suderland did much better in "Mirrors". The cross between the Invasion of the Body Snatchers and the Mirrors and quite average. A more appropriate title would sound "The Boring" because it draws every scene for bloody ages. And maybe "The Confusing" because it does not explain anything, either in the narrative or in the story itself, only the vague notion of bad copies and somesuchy, dotted with cheap horror and scenes accustomed to death, but nothing tangible. It is simply collapsed. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, acting and special effects are quite good, but on the other hand, it is not a difficult role to act. <br /> <br /> After watching the movie twice, I still feel unhappy, maybe a bit confused, not in the way of EA Poe or Stephen King. Do yourself a favor and do not watch it. Simply put, there are better thrillers out there.
