I've seen a not so fantastic IMDb rating, but I saw it anyway because I'm a huge fan of Bible-related materials. The first thing that worried me was a little too big a movie with Indiana Jones, but it also looked like Casper Van Dien did not see those Jones movies (but he should). I believe he tried everything, but the script just stunk. Music also tried to be a little Jones-like. Great work, but for such a movie it seemed like too much work, just as part of the video does not deserve this great music. Robert Wagner gave his best acting skills, he did a good job, but somehow the script brought everything back. "Jokes" is an old school, somewhere for 20 years; they only gave me a cynical smile. There are some really bad camera angels, SFX looks like homemade and unrealistic. Kevin VanHook probably had a good idea for this story (in my opinion, but I love stories like that), but things just did not come out. Maybe he should put it on paper when it was fresh in his head. When (in the first minutes) I saw that the movie would be one of those "low-budget movies", I was hoping to at least "hear" a good story, but sometimes the videos just disappoint.
