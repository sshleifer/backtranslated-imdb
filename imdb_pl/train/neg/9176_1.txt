You know that you are in trouble when the opening narrative basically tells you who will survive. From there everything goes down. Unnecessary work with the "Matrix" camera. Useless cuts in video game materials. Crusty old sea captains and crazy sailors. Ravers who become skilled soldiers in the blink of an eye. Even zombies are boring. <br /> <br /> I was hoping for at least a "bad good" movie about zombies, but this one is "so bad that those involved in creating it should be banned from making a movie again." <br /> <br />
