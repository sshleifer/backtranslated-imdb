Shame on shame Shame on UA ​​/ DW for what you do! <br /> <br /> I was terrified. <br /> <br /> DO NOT take this movie to children. Humor is completely inappropriate for children - plus they will be bored and disappointed. Certainly * everyone * read the great book for children Theo and we certainly have expectations ... but this is clean trash. Dr. Seuss would be ashamed and certainly would never give his "thumbs up" in such a terrible attempt to use the classic. <br /> <br /> It's a pity. <br /> <br /> Spend your money on the book. If you have a copy, buy a book and give it to the Toys for Tots program. This movie is NOT worth "free" watching tickets. <br /> <br /> Stick to the book. The TV comic version works well if you want to get a visual image - save money ... seriously. SAVE your money - it will be on the cable by the day of holy patty. <br /> <br /> Shame of shame because of what they do !!
