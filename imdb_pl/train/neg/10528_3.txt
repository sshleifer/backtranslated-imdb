I chose this because the music was made by Hans Zimmer, the client of the modular synthesizer Metasonix (created by someone close to me). The art of the jacket says "2003 version". <br /> <br /> This gives one point for a strong woman, one point for a cheery dialogue and the last point for the light blue eyes of a meg foster, which is a lot of pictures. <br /> <br /> It was great to see how David MacCullum swims freely (the pool has a plexiglass window!) while his love was chased by a psycho in Greece. <br /> <br /> The sets were minimally impressive - that is, houses of wealthy people in L.A. and Mendanassos (sp?), where the castle was. I wondered how they were able to keep order with all the dust around. The wind was not sharp enough to be credible to me. I kept thinking that animal furs on furniture must be nasty ... etc. and I realized that the movie must be quite boring if I think about these things when the alleged story unfolds. I stumbled on why he lit a fire, blew a match, and then put the match in the fire ?! Stupid things like that. At best, it was clumsy. Well. Robert Morely got some fun with his bizarre character and a nice vacation.
