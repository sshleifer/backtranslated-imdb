The problem with family dramas is that in addition to television films on channels such as Lifetime, most people do not want to watch them. And those that are watched tend to be sensational and to current or current problems or problems in the news (or the latest news). Films that explain or investigate human condition are not popular. Especially with a young crowd who would be a Miss Lohan fan or a younger crowd who has a tendency to create not only popular but also financially successful films. <br /> <br /> The special problems that I had with this movie are the cartoon character of some of the characteristics. It was a bit of blame for all of Lohan's actors (smashing the car, using drugs, etc.) for what he did to her stepfather. Although it is not unlikely, we just expect a little bit that the audience will swallow. In addition, other aspects, such as giving a young Morman boy, oral sex or the fact that she would actually make a good vet assistant who accidentally has something for her mother, etc. All these elements just do not really help in this movie. She placed it more in a situation comedy trying one of her "special dramatic episodes" and then a fully-realized, well-written feature film. <br /> <br /> When you watch a DVD and listen to a comment, especially for different alternative endings, you can really see everything that is sharp.
