Wow ... what would you do with 33 million dollars? Let me give you a choice; you can either a) destroy it and rinse it in the toilet, or b) make a movie based on Whoopi Goldberg's assumption as a hard futuristic policeman who works with a rubber dinosaur who uses phrases such as "I did not blow the trumpet" blowing raspberries on the basis that it fun. That's right, you would choose an option that has more advantages - flushing the toilet. <br /> <br /> You have to believe it. I can not even find words to describe how bad the movie is. It does not even fit into the category "so bad - it's good". In fact, I write it on television - and during watching I felt the need to enter IMDb and register my disgust. <br /> <br /> Considering the Jurassic Park was formed a few years earlier, how the devil think that the audience will tolerate a man dressed in a rubber suit for longer? WG should just walk and condemn the consequences. Everyone interested will go to hell for this criminal wastage of money. <br /> <br /> I have to stop writing - I'm just imploding.
