"Three bold daughters" is a sickly sweet, rose look of divorce, remarriage and a single parent. Of course, social problems and economic hardships do not take place in the picture of the perfect life of a single mother, who feels exhausted, takes a cruise, and then arranges with the conductor of the band. Even if the phrase "her only movie" justifies the scenario to solve real problems, "Daughters" suffers from too many inconsistent songs with high notes, children whose personalities are not based on real children, and the leader of the band Hose Iturbi plays alone. Is not it strange that some real person will play in a movie in which their alleged true marriage will get married? <br /> <br /> Admittedly, this movie was released in the forties. Only love for the old style of Hollywood romance and comedy can make "Daughters" a viable movie.
