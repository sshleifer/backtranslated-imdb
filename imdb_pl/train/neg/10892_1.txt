This movie is horrible! I do not even know where to start, I have no speech, I can not even describe how terrible it is. The blood is primarily fluorescent, and the acting is AMAZING! The only good part was the cyclist's stick, which saves the day. This movie was ridiculous, I do not understand how it can even get 1 vote so bad. It looks like it was made by high school students.
