Thinking about captivity, many words come to mind. These include: uninteresting, non-binding, unexpected, non-sexual, unfathomable and unobservable. <br /> <br /> I hated these movies from the middle to the end of the nineties, which were basically Scream madness, but these new fakes Saw begin to make these films look like classics. They are still following the same demographic as the other films they have managed to achieve, but now they are adding a new level of degeneracy that makes twelve to fourteen-year-old girls feel like they're hardcore and hip. br /> <br /> This movie is a lot of boring nonsense! What the hell happened to Larry Cohen? From 1993, his name is not attached to anything good! Still, I was still surprised to see that it had something to do with THIS evil! Was anyone surprised when the film's love interest turned out to be one of the psychopaths? Did anyone not know when they saw him for the first time? Only someone who has never seen another movie in his life!
