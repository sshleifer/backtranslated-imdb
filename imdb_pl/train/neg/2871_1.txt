I rented this horrible movie. The worst thought I've ever seen. I believe that a first-class class could do a better job. The worst movie I've ever seen and seen bad. Nothing terrible except that I paid 1.50 for rent and it was 1.49 for a lot. Acting is terrible, characters are worse, and the movie is just a piece of rubbish. The scenes in the slave house are so low that they make B movied look like an Oscar candidate. I can only say that if you want to waste a good evening and some money, rent this horrible movie. I'd rather watch deadly clowns from space, sitting in a bucket of razors, than sit in this flop again
