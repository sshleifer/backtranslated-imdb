It's been a long time since I last saw a movie so bad ... Acting is very average, the story is terribly boring and I have no words about the execution. It was completely unoriginal. Oh, and this is just as comedy as Clint Eastwood is a pregnant Schwarzenegger! <br /> <br /> One of the first scenes (the one with the TV series - where the hell are you?) made good - the cast was 80% let's look at it - forgotten actors. If they hoped to resume their careers, I think that this will never happen in their CV! The script had potential, but neither 80% of the actors nor the director (who is an actor and apparently not an actor) distracted him. Fred Durst was the only one who seemed better than everyone else. <br /> <br /> Excuse me, but if you ever think about watching it - I strongly recommend that you turn to something less traumatic, because not only is it a total waste of time, but also a weak example of how bad cinema looks like.
