Actually, I had to stop it. Do not get me wrong, love bad movies about monsters. But this one was too boring, regardless of the tense music that never drives you. The actress had too many teeth, and the moment in which she made contact with one of the beasts was too obvious a stereotype. This movie completely betrays a DVD cover that looks quite interesting. A giant monster is expected from the cover, but you get the sweet, not as gigantic as expected electric eels. I've reviewed another movie called The Killer Rats, but this is another review. The deep shock was really ridiculous, a great shame, given the fact that it looks like a fairly high budget.
