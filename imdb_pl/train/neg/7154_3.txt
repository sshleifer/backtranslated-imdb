This movie contains all the characters of too many chefs spoiling the goulash. Based on the autobiography of Shiellah Graham, it seems that powers that can not leave well enough alone. They could not decide whether it was to be Graham's story or Fitzgerald's story, and how they should alleviate the story of who it turned out. The film, which could be a tale of two fascinating personalities (Fitzgerald) and the infamous (Mrs. Graham), becomes a gloomy chaotic soap opera about which he does not tell us much. Added to this there is absolutely no impression from the period beyond 1959. The clumsy scene follows a clumsy scene and we have no idea where we are in history or how much time passes. However - and it saved my film - Kerr never looked nicer, and Peck is as always a very handsome man. They really make up a beautiful, mature couple and I just want them to have better material for work. There is one scene that works - Scott follows Shielah, being in a drunken state, and see that these two normally sophisticated stars are knocking around, is very disturbing and gives a glimpse of what is happening in a relationship like theirs. In addition, the film is a wasted opportunity and nowhere near the classic increase in other soaps produced by Wald soap from 1950 (PEYTON PLACE, THE BEST OF ALL).
