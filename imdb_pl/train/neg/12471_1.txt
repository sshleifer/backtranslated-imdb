Living in the Middle East (in Israel) I was excited when I bought a ticket for Syriana. Seeing the trailer and being a fan of thrillers, I expected to see above all a fast-moving, breath-taking film that wisely immerses itself in the global shaping of politics and the relationship between oil, power and corruption from a fresh perspective. I almost left the movie inside. The tempo was painfully slow, almost all the characters were stereotypical, the intertwined edition made the understanding of logic very difficult, but, as Steve Rhodes wrote in his review, you do not care. Save money, save time, choose a different movie. <br /> <br /> Doing Chernitsky
