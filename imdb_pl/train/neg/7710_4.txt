"Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" consists mainly of shaky, poorly assembled materials in search of a film. The plot does not make sense, and various characters appear and disappear from the picture without any explanation. Watching this stupid parody, you get the impression that so many other comments so aptly captured: that it is easy to make a cheap, low-quality movie, and then use the "parody" angle as a pretext for its cheaper and low-quality one scene, swimmers are terrified with tomatoes, who are swimming near them, how far can "disbelieve" - ​​even in a parody?). However, the title song is great. (* 1/2)
