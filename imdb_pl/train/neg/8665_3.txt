This is Roger Corman's low budget. DinoCroc arises when manipulation of prehistoric genes runs amok. The constructed croc first kills one of its own, and then it gets the taste of a man and becomes a rapidly growing terror after the escape. None of the characters has any depth, but they are not the focal point. We only get a few flashes of the giant dinosaur's two-legged offspring and some of the best "killing" scenes in a small budget. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is a moronic figure trying to use three legged dog for bait and become croc of food itself. Nothing was left on the pier, but feet on the ankle. Without real outstanding roles: Jane Longendecker, Bruce Weitz and Charles Napier. The most pathetic is Matt Borlenghi and the unbearable professional crocodile Costas Mandylor. I was very impressed by the voluptuous Joanna Pacula when, with respect, Dr. P. DINOCROC was mentioned as a pot of marinades.
