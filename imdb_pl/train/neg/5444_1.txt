It was 1974 and Martin Sheen appeared in it. <br /> <br /> The same says what you can expect from this movie. <br /> <br /> And it was a movie. According to the film, Slovik reformed, got a good woman and refused to fight. <br /> <br /> In real life, Slovik could have been a naïve innocent man, or maybe he wanted to manipulate the system. <br /> <br /> Who was a Nightingale or not, the story was decided, but it was a movie that dealt with desserts while the country was wondering why he was fighting and the movie took sides. <br/> <br/> Regardless of the soldiers who were in Vietnam in 1974 (as Willie Nelson would say, let's say the truth, it was a war in Vietnam, not World War II), EoES was propagandistic as Gung Ho was in the forties. <br /> <br /> According to this film, Slovik stated his position, simple and simple. He had a nervous problem. Hell, I have a clinical nervous condition and trust me, if I did military service, it would not be a problem for me just to let my nerves go and get my job done and get degradation or put a KP obligation or a latrine duty without a problem. <br /> <br /> If we believe in a teleflik, Slovik did not have that option, no doubt because of his criminal history. <br /> <br /> Whatever the viewer believes depends on the viewer. I learned that films from this decade or decade, dealing with military service or duties, will in principle take the same position. <br /> <br /> The 1940s and 1950s serve the country. <Br /> <br /> sixties and seventies, we mock your country. <br /> <br /> This is history. <br /> <br /> The whole movie seemed to me predictably Hollywood. He refused to serve, and only when he was attached to execution did he show excitement. <br /> <br /> Such an emotional outburst could easily work in his favor in the declaration of his nervous condition, but of course the film wanted to show him as a human being and only when he is about to die becomes sad. <br /> <br /> I'm not a Catholic, but I thought about Mary Ned Beatty's recital of hail and Sheen at the end, with the Lord's prayer, he was funny because it sounded like they were trying to see who could say it faster. <br /> <br /> I do not see how this movie could be watched, without realizing that it was directed to Tricky Dick Nixon and the Vietnam War. <br /> <br /> I hope everything was worth it for Słowik and everyone who decided to follow his example.
