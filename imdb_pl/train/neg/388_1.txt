I can not stand the majority of the reality show, and this one is the worst than the one from Paris Hilton and it is certainly his company. But "you're fired" or "you're employed" for how many seasons now? After watching the show I would not like to work for a guy with his ego and everything and I think that watching dry paint has more entertainment valves. <br /> <br /> I would like to hear only one person standing up, say "Donald, I quit and I took some of your money and I bought a decent hairstyle". I see that he even tries to buy fame in WWE stocks. I hope he will be hurt, so I do not have to see his pathetic face anymore. It must be sad that we want to make fame so bad and have no talent and make an ass trying to buy it. I would give this show a negative sign if I could, but I will get 1 and it does not deserve it.
