DEATHSTALKER is perfect for B-fantasy movie fans; this barely 80-minute travesty of film features everything that the tormentors can ask for - a non-existent conspiracy, horrible acting (except at least a hoarse-sounding old woman), fun scripts and editions of schlocks and basement-style background settings. There are no characters who might like or be interesting (in particular, there is nothing attractive about it in the lead), and the assembled actors barely do anything to rise above the F class material. If that's not enough, then what about the lack of interesting the plot (which this movie has nothing to do) to make DEATHSTALKER qualify as the main turkey? I was also offended that the women in this movie barely serve other than 1) be topless and / or scornfully clothed; 2) be raped; 3) have sex with the hero; 4) all of the above. In addition, background music is hideous; a bizarre mess of electronic noise, cheesy choral outbursts and glaring orchestral cacophony. Feeling the ears and numb eyes in one package that no one is interested in, DEATHSTALKER is probably the most suitable for people looking for something to laugh at (and believe me, there are a lot of them here). Otherwise, I do not recommend to anyone the lowest CONAN on 100 level.
