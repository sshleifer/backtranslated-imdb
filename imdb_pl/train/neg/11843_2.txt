Just because an event really happened does not mean that it will make a good script / movie. The Cat's Meow, by Peter Bogdanovich, claims that it is based on the actual events that took place during the cruise led by William Randolph Hurst. The writer drew more attention to the creation of bizarre characters than he took the time to create a story for the bizarre characters that inhabit. The key moments of history seem unlikely; for example, when Hurst accidentally shoots the producer, believing that he is Chaplin. Putting a key element of history on someone in a bad hat is trivial and invented. The story tries to be a dark comedy, but The Cat's Meow misses an important element of this equation, comedy. There is also lack of empathy for any of the characters. It does not matter who is shot, who is killed, who is guilty and who is innocent. He has no strong character to support. As a result, conflicts are difficult to care for, and the final result is accidental.
