I should have thought that the movie with the Poltergeist lady would not be good. It starts well, but during the first scene of the murder you find out that the film you are watching is a film in the movie. People are sitting in the cinema watching this movie. One girl in the audience is so annoying that I would turn around and strangle her. A bit strange, but far from good.
