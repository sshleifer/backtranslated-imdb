Prom Night talks about a girl named Donna (Brittany Snow), who is being hunted by a psychic assassin trying to kill her at her ball. And killing her family, friends and enemies. <br /> <br /> Before I start, let me say that you were tired of PG-13 horrors, which were not terrible lately. Are you tired of the dialogue of a stupid girl "Oh my God" and talking about girlish things. And are you really tired of girls in relationships and then you cry. The last thing is the fatigue of reworking American, Japanese and Chinese movies in the US. That pretty much sums up the ferry night, but I still have not finished with the review. <br /> <br /> The only reason to see "Prom night" is to break the laughter into homicides. If not, do not watch the night of the ball. You never see murders that only hear screams and see blood on the wall. By the way, deaths recur as 24/7. So they are not only scary, but unpleasant. Before I met the cast, I think I was ready to quit. Too much talk about girls, too much talking about guys and lots of "Oh my God. This is our ball. " I understand that it's fun, but seriously, it's too much to not focus. <br /> <br /> If I put Prom Night on the list of the worst movies of 2008 without watching other films, I would be the first one. I will not be surprised if it will be released on DVD for cheap and fast. Seriously, do not spend money or time for boring acting, cheap horror and "Night for death" while watching the movie. <br /> <br /> 1 star on the 10th (PS If I could give a movie I would break the stars that I would like).
