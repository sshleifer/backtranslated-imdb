Sometimes the movie is so exhausting that it has a devastating effect on your morale. You're starting to really ask yourself, what does this mean for our society that the standard is so terribly low? Can they honestly expect us to survive many stereotypes and still have fun? <br /> <br /> Of course, GUN is the main character, feature device and source of everything. conflict and resolution in movies. The character needs a weapon. He gets a weapon. I can not do it because it has a weapon. First puts down the weapon. OH MY GOD What will we do? He has a weapon! He wavers him, behaving more maliciously than real people. He pushes him into someone's face for 90 minutes, shouting questions. A distinctive feature of any applications will be the comforting sound of police sirens. <br /> <br /> The real challenge is to make this tired, broken formula work again; the film must be very clever and well made. This one is not either. He has no life or personality and he sucks these ingredients from YOU. will make you feel WORE about life in space and time that you do. Really, who needs it!? So yeah, I'll say it: I think it could be the worst movie I've ever seen. Everyone who participated in the creation of this junk murder of the soul should be publicly embarrassed for the harm done to us all.
