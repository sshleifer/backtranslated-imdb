This film was heavily distorted by Steven Seagal's presence. Or, as I should say, Steven Tak-blÄ™py! As before, Seagal is either too good or too stupid to re-copy his own lines, leaving someone who impersonates his shots with sounds that must be looped. A few films have been done before, but I do not think about it! Honestly, the movie looks pretty good, the script could use some work, but the fragments of the movie looked like a real movie! Of course, everything is said, this movie is quite bad. <br /> <br /> It would be much better without Seagal, who became a drawing of himself. Do not worry. Everything for PLN is too much for it! I honestly think it's the last time for me and the Seagal movie. What took me so long ?!
