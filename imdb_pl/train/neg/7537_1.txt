And I thought that The Beach is bad, with the difference that this movie has one of the greatest actors of our time, Nicolas Cage. Do not blame him for the awful scenario, if anyone can understand what the hell was the purpose of this movie, give yourself a tap on the back. It is the intersection of The Village and the worst scenario. It starts to fall into the eye a little, and then when it goes on in the story, it just does not make sense and do not let me start to finish !!!! What was that? The only thing that makes this movie exist is the great humor of Nicolas Cage and his ability to be funny in the strangest situations. If you go to a blockbuster movie and it's the only movie to watch, save yourself five bucks and just go home and light a fire, and when someone asks you, just say the stupidest thing that comes to your mind and go there!
