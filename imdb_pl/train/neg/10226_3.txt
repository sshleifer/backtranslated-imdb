"Do not worry about watching this movie" would be a better advice if you like Marilyn Monroe in her other roles. It was a huge disappointment, considering the great cast, not just Marilyn. <br /> <br /> The story was just nothing, certainly not similar to the one described in the VHS box. There was simply no tension, no valuable excitement and too many boring places, most of them were trying to show why "Nellie" (Monroe) was so dumped. It was not a good role for Monroe, though I did not have to see this character to know he could act. Sam "Some Like It Hot" was enough proof for me. But this role just did not suit her and it is not a surprise that it was not one of her more popular films. <br /> <br /> It's also a bad movie that wasted the talents of actors such as Richard Widmark Anne Bancroft, Elisha Cook Jr., Jeanne Cagney, Donna Cocoran and others. <br /> <br /> Summary: it's not fun, and entertainment is the name of the game.
