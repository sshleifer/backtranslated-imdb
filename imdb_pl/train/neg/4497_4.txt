- I was planning to write something explaining what I did not like about this film, but it will be more difficult than I thought. Honestly, I do not remember much about it. I watched it just three days ago and it did not impress me. Usually it is a sign of a real stinker. The only thing I remember is that most of them were very bored. The novelty of Humphrey Bogart looking like a detective quickly broke down. It would be different if he could act, but he is an artist-musician. Scenes with killings were treated amateurishly and there were no tensions leading to them. If you do not see the killer five minutes after the film, you need to see more horror euro. Throwing is a dead killer's identity.
