This film deserved to work on the Mystery Science Theater. Even if it has nothing to do with King Solomon, it is worth seeing because it is unintentional laughter. Really! Worse than "Destroy all monsters". Check out the following: a shoddy medallion (looks like Shriners here), of course a Norfolk polyester jacket in "Allan Quatermain", a badly made stammer by David Maallallum (which distracts attention from his even worse acting), an incredibly bad process that works on all "monsters", the monsters themselves - a puppet that threatens a little girl, a huge snake that threatens Macallum, when it is drowning in porridge, red eyes on motorized crabs, an incredibly funny boat (oh, brother !!), which seems to be made of plywood mounted on an old sandbox and looks like leftovers from Jr.Sr. ferry ("Journey into the future with class '71"), the Phoenician city - where they wear Roman imperial armor, but inexplicably have Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions - (Phoenicians invented the alphabet-future!), and the worst of all, Macallum and Ekland (with wig), playing smoochy-face -oh the horror! The best thing is that intrepid explorers manage to lose the Frenchman's comedian, and the African guy -nuffleupagusa or whatever - apparently prefers to die heroically rather than be in other scenes.
