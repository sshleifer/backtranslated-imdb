(possible spoilery) <br /> <br /> Someone once asked Dr. Seuss if they could secure the rights to the film for his 1957 Christmas classic. How the Grinch Stole Christmas. He rejected them, insisting that no one could do anything better than the wonderful special film by Chuck Jones TV from 1966 (Perhaps, perhaps, his bitter experience writing the script for The 5000 Fingers of Dr. T) from 1953 . When a good doctor died in 1991, his widow, Audrey Geisel, stubbornly refused to sell the rights to the film. But when the widespread use of CGI effects becomes a reality, Mrs. Geisel changed her mind. Universal made her a generous offer she accepted; she also accepted Jim Carrey's casting as the title character. Apparently she was satisfied with the final result. Well, Mrs. Geisel, it makes one of us. <br /> <br /> The film received a budget of $ 123,000,000 (more than even the cost of the Heavenly Gate, including adjustment to inflation), which of course went in the direction of sophisticated makeup, stage design and special effects (which are undermined <br /> <br /> slightly blurred images). Unfortunately, it seems that none of this money has been reserved for a better scenario than what Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman (writers who Framed Roger Rabbit?, Who much better <br /> <br /> used a high budget) turned . While the special TV show included 26 minutes of no ads, this movie tries to fill 105 minutes with more information about Grinch. It turns out that as a child he was the object of ridicule, including a particularly humiliating experience at Christmas at the age of eight. It turns out, therefore, that everything that is wrong to our poor Mr. Grinch results directly from who they are. The problem is that it seems to be quite long 105 minutes, and too much dead wood clogs up the story. It may not seem so bad if only Grinch were a little more ... well, Grinchy. The character that Dr. Seuss wrote, and later Chuck Jones animated, was a cunning fox, whose skilful attempts to kidnap the holiday season were undermined by his sudden change (and exponential growth) of the heart. Carrey's Grinch is a loud, hyperactive fool, and sometimes a bandit who, when he made the holiday "Cheermeister", in anger destroys the square in Whoville <br /> <br /> (hopefully, the scenery tasted as good as it looked). This undermines the attempt of the script to make Grinch more likeable, and everyone in Whoville is so unpleasant (at least in this interpretation). <br /> <br /> Whoville's vision of Dr. Seuss was a small town inhabited by honest people who knew in their hearts the true meaning of Christmas. Whoville film is a rather noisy and crowded place inhabited by rotten, selfish, materialistic ninnies; an obvious attempt to comment on American consumerism. This is insulting <br /> <br /> hypocritical, because the film industry has benefited greatly from American consumerism, and because this film has contributed to this huge merchandising campaign <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> The film also expands and redefines the character Cindy Lou Who, a small but key character in the original. An innocent two-year-old waif who has entered this false Santa Claus is now older and wiser, constantly questioning the false values ​​of those who are trying to understand Grinch's point of view (her one main scene from the original is recreated, making it appear to have no character). <br /> <br /> seems to be the only person who would ever know that Christmas is more than just presents and decorations, which makes it a completely different and more irritating character. <br /> <br /> Those who celebrate Christmas, should earlier adopt a clod of coal in their <br /> <br /> stockings December 25 in the morning, than a copy of this too long, exaggerated, frighteningly tedious, primitive, harsh attempt the reversal of classic children in the feature film. He proves once and for all that darkness, vulgarity, manipulation and heavy hand are insufficient substitutes for charm, wit, sincerity and heart. The people of Universal should fall to their knees and thank God that this truly disgusting $ 123 million bomb has made $ 260 million in the country or would not be today. What's more, it's possible that Mike Myers' The Cat in the Hat!
