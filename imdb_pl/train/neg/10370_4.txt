I really regret every single second I lost while watching this movie. Unfortunately, it's always difficult to turn off the movie when I started watching it. Especially when it is such a classic or people call it classic. I think it is one of those movies that every film lover should have watched at least once, so that's why I watched it. Do not get me wrong, I like Humphrey Bogart and his wife Lauren Bacall, both as a couple and as actors, but in my opinion this movie was a big scam. No real plot, no espionage, no romantic love story. Well, not even a convincing mix of these two species. The only thing that caused the tension was that it was not sure if "Bogey" and Bacall would stay together at the end or in part of each other. I think "To Have and Have Not" is very overrated, and Bogart was in many better movies in the 1940s.
