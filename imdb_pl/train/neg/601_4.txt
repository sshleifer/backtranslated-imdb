!!!!! THE COURSE ARE SPOILERS !!!!! I am sure that this project began as a script writing workshop on avoiding stereotypes in horror films: Female hero - Check Bad things happen to drug users - Check Heorine knocks down the villain - Check Heroin does not notice the villain regaining consciousness - Check the frame sequence, so we can see recovered villain creeping behind the heroine - Check Unfortunately, it seems that someone sent this list of stereotypes to the film studio, instead of using it for classes. Dear oh, if only the transport in London was as regular as the cliches appearing here. In fact, there are so many stereotypes and we have seen it all before, that nobody really thought about what the title creeps are or how long it kills people in the underground. I am convinced that this is the result of some experiment on people and maybe only this night he decided to take revenge on humanity, but all this is so vague that it makes no sense Not to be completely negative I doubt very much whether the producers thought that this year they will shoot a movie that will bring Oscars, and there is always a horror movie market. Similarly, I doubt if it would cost too much production and had one eye on the DVD market, not the cinema distribution, and I find it a bit better than the 1934 DEATH LINE, in which there was also a murderous cannibal hiding in the London subway. just when you think all the stereotypes have been used in this movie, another clich√© appears to raise his ugly head
