One would think that the first landing on the moon would be dramatic enough without having to make up for it. However, this document seems to need to drop everything in the most terrible light. He talks about the risks associated with the lunar module and mentions the lethal law of Armstrong's accident with the training vehicle, as if the trainer and spacecraft had something in common. This makes the problem of overloading the computer (alarms 1202 and 1201) encountered during the final landing sequence sounds like a catastrophe, when it was only irritation and did not pose a threat to the crew. And it takes "thirty seconds" to mark thirty seconds of fuel that is running out, or actually thirty seconds before the break is mandatory. <br /> <br /> If you want to see the Apollo 11 document or drama, go to "From the Earth to the Moon" or one of the PBS documentaries, but skip this one.
