The movie trailers were better than the movie. What a waste of talents and money. It is a pity that I would not wait until this movie appears on DVD, because at least I would not have wasted $ 9. The film completely bypasses the sign. What could have been a BIG movie for all actors turned out to be the best B movie. The film moved very slowly, and as soon as I thought it was going somewhere, it almost worked, but then it did not. These days we need unpredictable twists and turns in the film, and this movie did not offer either. The whole thing about how everyone is suspect is good, but he is not sure if it was the way he was directed, lighting, delivering lines, writing or what, but nothing came of it. A lot of noise for nothing. I was VERY disappointed with this movie and I tell everyone to NOT see this movie. Trashy saxophone music also made the movie worse. And the ending had nothing to do with the rest of the movie. What a disappointment.
