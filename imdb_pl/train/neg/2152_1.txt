this movie is trying to be extremely clever, and Tarantino-like <br /> <br /> before you try, you need a solid foundation of film. they include good sound, editing, scenography, etc. <br /> <br /> lets you talk about the sound in this movie. absolutely horrible. I've never been more distracted by the soundtrack, never <br /> <br /> and before we talk about a low budget, film produced in Chile etc., remember that today's sound is much more achievable than it ever was. anywhere. and more information about the technique is available before <br /> <br /> the sound in this movie is bad. foley in particular is out of place and inappropriate throughout, the atmosphere is equally horrible. I heard at least four loud clicks during the movie, which are the result of poor sound editing. the sound in the cars is terrible, the sound of closing the car door is terrible. the sound of the lady's voice is bad. Foley is either overboard, or he simply is not there, just as the sound person just got bored and gave up. the spaces are bad. everything is wrong with it <br /> <br /> and yet, without allowing the limitations of creativity to get in the way, at the same time the movie tries to be bold. for example, the sound of the aquarium is used on the next street scene. we hear a sound when we should not. sound edition precedes visual cuts. every trick in the book is used, but the foundations simply do not exist <br /> <br /> when it comes to editing, we have scenes that use heavy jump cuts, we made the timeline, etc., yawn. all these techniques are imitated in an extremely low standard <br /> <br /> in general, the mix is ​​crap, the sound is nonsense. so the movie is nonsense. How can a movie with so many basic disadvantages be taken into consideration when awarding prizes and praise? Film new Chile wave? the best creative achievements that Chile has to offer? I hope not, and I think not. <br /> <br /> My theory is that Chile's more selective and better talent has escaped this film as a plague, perhaps because of its risky content. the film probably received such unjustified critics' recognition of the so-called "world cinema" enthusiasts for the same dirty reasons. they're probably intoxicating with this trash. of course, film critics rarely pay attention to technical details and quality <br /> <br /> this movie is rubbish. it's all in the mouth and without pants and it never deserves to be rated 6.8. the film has all the quality of production of cheap Tarantino, inspired by a new wave of porn!
