I had high hopes for this film, even though I got a bad opinion in the newspaper. I was very tolerant and sat throughout the movie. At the end I felt sick enough. <br /> <br /> Although I'm not the least prudish or particularly sensitive to the tasteless cinema - I really liked "Everything you ever wanted to know about sex" by Woody Allen. . "And" Funny games "by Michael Hanneke - I found the obsession of directors towards this 10-year-old who wants to drink women's milk completely disgustingly. And when the movie reached a climax in the "orgy," in which the boy drinks both the mother's milk and the woman he desired for the whole movie, I almost vomited in disgust because of the total perversion and sentimental pulp that it is. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I enjoy a huge majority of European cinema, and independently produced movies, so this movie should please me very much. Avoid this movie at all costs, it should be moved to the chronicles of history as a lesson in a bad cinema.
