Straight to the point: "The Groove Tube" is one of the most uninteresting, unclean and downright awesome films ever made. This "comedy" is so empty of anything that resembles a trace of wit that it is almost incomprehensible that it has even been created. I said almost because there are fans of everything. <br /> <br /> This movie is not even "good" bad or "pleasant" bad. Placing this movie on the same level of entertainment as "Plan 9" or "Robot Monster" would be a crime for these movies. You can watch such movies and make copies of them. But this movie is BAD, so badly made, played, written and so amazing that there is not even a trace of "camp" or "schlock". <br /> <br /> Even if it was done before the premiere of Saturday Night Live, comparisons were probably inevitable. I'm not a big fan of SNL, but this movie is worse than the worst SNL sketch you can find. And man, it's BAD. In order to stop the audience from leaving, Shapiro throws a few breasts from time to time, but the poorly filmed breasts from 1974 will not excite anyone. In truth, this film is so poorly made and is such a dream-inducing trip, I doubt if in 1974 they were excited about someone. <br /> <br /> This movie was made by a man named Ken Shapiro. I swear to God, every ten-year-old with a video camera could do something more fun and smarter. It's simply unreal - it's really an incredible movie. "Jokes" and "gags" are so infantile that even the little boys who like to dream up daddy's porn portions at night will not laugh. <br /> <br /> I will give this movie one thing - the last sequence of a "dancing man" in which a guy (Shapiro) on the streets of NYC dances to the melody, is certainly the best thing in this awful movie. It's not that the sequence of a "dancing man" is also so great - he definitely has moments when he is not clever, because Shapiro desperately tries to fill the whole song all the time - but in reality he was a bit visible. Part of this sequence, in which the policeman begins to dance with a man, is the only trace of cunning in the whole film. No wonder Shapiro placed this sequence at the end - again, although it is not so great, it easily beats everything in this "movie". <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this movie is such a complete piece that it is unfathomable as a real human being can be so clever. The name of this movie should be "Craparama Kena Shapiro". It's amazing that it has been done, but many really talented filmmakers can not enter. I will say, however, that I will bet that NYU geniuses will love this film. Total rubbish.
