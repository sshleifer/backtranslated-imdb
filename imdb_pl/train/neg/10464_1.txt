This movie is not based on the Bible. It totally leaves Christ from the movie. They do not show the admiration or the second coming of Christ. Not to mention this. He does not quote from the scriptures. The times of the end are called the great tribulation. The film does not even show bad times. Seven bowls, seven sticks and seven trumpets of judgment boils down to a 15-second message from the sea changing its structure. The Antichrist was killed for three and a half years in tribulation, and so the film ended. The only correct part was the two prophets. Of course, they did not use names, because it would be too close to the truth of the scriptures. The worst thing was that I really wanted it to be a good movie. I wanted to take unsaved people to him. I feel that the movie is bad. It's a fake, like everything the devil does. I just hope that he will not pick up the upcoming movie based on left-leaning books. <br /> <br /> The second problem with the movie is simply bad. Bad acting, bad special effects, bad plot and bad character development. I've seen better episodes of Miami's vice.
