It's one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen. He breaks off almost every type of thriller and manages to spoil all of them. <br /> <br /> There is not a single good line or character in the mess. If there was a story, it was a reflection and when it comes to acting, there is nothing good to say, so I will not say anything. Honestly, I do not understand how this kind of nonsense is produced and actually released, or someone somewhere at some stage does not think: "Oh my God, it's really a lot of shit" and I call it a day. His shit, such as the fact that people download illegally, the trailer looks like a completely different movie, at least if you downloaded it, you did not waste time or money. Do not waste time, it is painful.
