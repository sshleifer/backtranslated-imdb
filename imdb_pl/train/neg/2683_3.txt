Have you ever wondered what would happen if several of the characters from Beverly Hills 90210 were thrown into a Thai prison? If so, this is your movie. It's Midnight Express for the MTV crowd. It would be good, but the story was badly made. Abundant twists, weak dialogue and unresolved issues abound. This small film did not bring the right to be as mysterious as it ends. Potential spoiler and impossibly ridiculous plot - a moment full of false tensions, when a hotel employee discovers that the girls do not have a room there and immediately throw them away. (This moment is inadequately played with the same gravity and seriousness as the moment when they are arrested under the threat of using a weapon). Later the same hotel employee was somehow found - and Bangkok is a big city, remember, I was there - and I testify against girls, as if a few free Mai Tais guarantees 40 years in prison. Come on. Instead, rent another day in paradise.
