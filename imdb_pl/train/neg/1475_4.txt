Most episodes in Season 1 are terrible. There is no comparison with the Twilight Zone or External Borders, because the programs actually have decent plot lines. Most Amazing Stories are boring ... not amazing in the smallest release ... I will rent or buy a series of Twilight Zone ... I heard that season 2 in this series is much better ... also for some reason the parts of Ray Walston were cut out on DVD, which further reduce this compilation. One nice thing is to see actors and actresses when they were younger in 1985 ... Most plot lines are very predictable, and the series could be better thanks to the twists and turns that made you wonder ...
