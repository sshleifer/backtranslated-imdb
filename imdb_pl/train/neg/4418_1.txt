It's a movie that needs some digestion. On the one hand, we propose a hard outer shell, a story that not only originates from the Catholic Church, but does so stupidly and uninformedly. On the inner layer, we have a story about orthodoxy over orthopraxis and what happens when people blindly follow a faith they can not understand. <br /> <br /> At first glance, it seemed to be a comedy. If so, then Mr. Durang must open the dictionary because he clearly does not know the meaning of the word. Jokes are pale; humor is uncomfortable and badly delivered. In particular, Mrs Keaton's performance is brilliant and unbearable, far below the quality of her days Annie Hall and Sleeper. Jennifer Tilly is again a stridence model with a high voice and a whining style. All this could be forgiven if not for the last 20 minutes of this film, which was clearly a controversial play from 1981. <br /> <br /> *** Carefully, spoilers ahead of yourself *** /> ​​<br /> It all starts with the appearance of four former students of Sister Maria Ignacej (incidentally, Ignatius is a male name and the nun would not accept after any weddings, just for this reason, to show you how much tireless research began with the project.) When everyone admits that they do not follow the teachings of the church, the sister becomes irrational and abuses them in the way the audience has I believe that she did it back when she went into obscene, too banal sepia-flashbacks. When one of them admits two abortions, the nun becomes even more offensive until the student pulls out the weapon. After separating from her, the nun kills the student, probably in self-defense. Then he starts screaming, killing a former gay student because of his sins. The last shot concerns a dead student lying in a pose similar to Christ, when the shadow of the cross hangs above her. Can you say "hard"? I knew you could! <br /> <br /> I know that there were offensive nuns in the past and I know that many people have suffered emotional damage as a result, but these photos are fed our throats in almost every shot in this wreck of the film. I have heard from the writer and director that this is a film about hysteria and why it is not appropriate to apply orthodoxy so orthodox, not intending to play the words. This explanation, however, is difficult to swallow just because we never have an authoritative point of view that would not be biased against the Catholic faith in one way or another. This film is simply an anti-Catholic flak, which in the name of justice and equality is vile and full of hatred. <br /> <br /> This is a film that I would recommend to a Catholic, namely, the awakening of the reality of what cynicism and ignorance they face today. If it was "Rabbi Ray explains all this" or "Imam Muhammad explains everything", there would be riots in the streets and Showtime would lose all of its subscription. But unfortunately, because it is a film that hits what is seen as the majority, it is accepted and even applauded by those who share the same malicious point of view. <br /> <br /> I certainly hope that every member of this cast was a practicing Catholic, so it was not just the ignorance that brought them this film. <br /> <br /> I gave him 1.5 stars out of 5, not because of his offensive nature, but because he was badly written, poorly directed and generally bad film. Do not waste time.
