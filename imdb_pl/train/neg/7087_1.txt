Normally, I would not write an online comment, but this is the worst movie I've ever seen. Not only that it's filmed like a soap bar ("Young and Restless" is really filmed by professionals compared to it), but it also has horrible cuts. There is no action. It's full of useless junk. <br /> <br /> Here's an example: a guy wants to kill the main character because he's fired. So (after many nonsense) they are here: the guy puts the knife on his throat and says something like "You are dead now". Then the main character says: "If you kill me, you are dead. I told the police that you were threatening me. " So (deadly) the guy is walking (he's crying): "Oh, no ... the cops follow me !? !! Oh ... my God. " <br /> <br /> Remember: this is just an example. I really can not believe that this movie really exists. So: IF you want to see WORST movie ever ... go ahead, I recommend :)
