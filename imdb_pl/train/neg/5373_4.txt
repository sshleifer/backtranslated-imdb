This is a classic example of a growing problem with movies. Why is background noise and soundtrack much louder than dialogue? What does it make sense? This movie is not alone. Most movies seem to do it now. For 2 years I was wondering if this is something wrong with my TV, but then I got a new TV and it's there again. The noise in the background, which can take place in the city block behind the actors, drowns dialogue. <br /> <br /> In this film it was even more distracting, because in the English version the woman still mumbles. I was hoping Jean Reno would say, "Excuse me, will you talk to me or throw balls off your mouth?" If you watch it on DVD and you even have a French high school, I recommend a French version with subtitles. <br /> <br /> It gives me 4 because Reno was so good at Leon. People are delighted with the scenery, but I saw it on television and lived in the Rocky Mountains for several years, so "Enh".
