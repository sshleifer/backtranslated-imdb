In fact, the non-Broadway adaptation of "Threepenny" by Marc Blitzstein was not as "flattened" as it is generally believed. <br /> <br /> (I have a special interest in Threepenny, my father was part of the first full production in the USA, U from the Illlinois Theater Guild did it at the end of World War II) HJitler was so close to success in suppressing art that they had to reconstruct the script and the score of the recordings in two different languages ​​{neither English}, Script of the German fitter and similar sources.) Blitzstein's adaptation - not the "translation" - which received the full approval of Lotte Lenya - was much closer to the original than was generally thought. <br /> <br /> The problem is this version that most people know is a MGM-molded recording (recently available on Polygram on a CD) (including Beatrice Arthur {as Lucy, "a big complete girl" and I can not see her hands on her hips and arms) thrown back into the line - Bea was the main child in the 50s, Paul Dooley and John Astin) was strongly censored by Mike Curb, MGM Records label manager - I mean, 17 ( I think it was) "Bloody" was cut into "damn". <br /> <br /> (At some point, MGM also offers a set of 2 LPs with * the whole * game, undoubtedly as heavily censored.)
