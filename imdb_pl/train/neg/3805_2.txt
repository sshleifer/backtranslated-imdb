Err ... this movie was sucked. MUCH. <br /> <br /> I have read some of the other reviews. Apparently there are many people who think that everything Woody Allen writes or plays in the stars is automatically good ... <br /> <br /> I watched some of his films, hoping in vain that something is missing. But no, they just suck. Badly written trash. All characters are very stereotypical (not to mention stupidity). The plot is ... I think it has to be mysterious. I'm not sure. Mr. Allen's character is ... Woody Allen, in any other movie you've seen him. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Woody Allen, go and see this movie. If you are under 50, do not worry. (If you're a fan of Woody Allen, and you're under 50 ... well, you're atypical, I do not know what to say.)
