This film was an absolute torture. First of all, it's over 4 hours! It is true that the Kargil war could have several points that were captured and fought for, but each of these battles did not have to be shown. So maybe it's a documentary, not an advertised film advertised. Probably it did not look like this because there was not enough basic information and some defects. The battle sequences were so badly made. I am terribly disappointed with the man who gave the well-made sequences in Border. Each battle was the same as the previous one. It was so predictable. (It can be a spoiler.) The whole army is marching uphill, five or more soldiers are cursed five thousand times (each time using the same sword), one of the main actors is shot, somebody is shouting at the stretcher, the actor says: "No, no carry a stretcher. It will take six men from the battalion, "and then the actor dies. The same happens over and over again. Oh, and the songs are so bad and so long. The cast of the movie is too big for your own good. Despite such a long film, none of the heroes was well developed. Actresses had the most tiny roles. Everyone is dressed and presented as the same. Two of them cried synchronously. It was so comical. They shifted their hands and heads exactly at the same time, then bit the dupatta together. <br /> <br /> The list just goes on and on. I know I still forget something. Anyway, I think I was able to shoot the movie enough to get a photo.
