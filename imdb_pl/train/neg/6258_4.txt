Writer-director Tony Piccirillo adapted his own art of a simple man, recently widowed, learning in the last three weeks that he is HIV positive; he follows one homosexual partner he has ever had, brings him to the apartment and binds him, forcing him to test blood on the guy and promising bloody revenge if the results come back positively. The intriguing idea sounds better on paper than on paper. The slave of James Marsden is realistically cynical and snotty, but the manners of the actor are disturbing - it's like watching Tom Cruise in a roadshow. Scott Speedman must work harder with a more demanding role, but his personality - turning away from the shy guy to the abductor on the edge is not convincing, just like the conversations of both men. The boy from the gay party Marsden is obviously not apathetic - he is temporarily sympathetic to the fate of Speedman - but he does not react or behave as homosexual would. The film is not exactly that, but it is a scam, handicapped by bad editing, ill-conceived flashbacks, low-budget production and a grand finale that smells of stupid pretentiousness and melodrama. * 1/2 of ****
