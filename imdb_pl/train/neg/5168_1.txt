If you're going to build tension in a movie, it's always a good idea not to build it out of boredom. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the Butcher Brothers have not understood it yet. <Br /> <br /> This movie sucks, unlike most of its characters, who (if they did not come out as vampires in the first few minutes and then are ashamed) prefer generous deliveries "no one knows, where I am a type of cheerleading and homosexual vagabonds who move comfortably and fast food, passing their insulated door. <br /> <br /> The only bit of originality is how these vampires become vampires in the first place, but the rest are absurd and messy. <br /> <br /> Forced to regularly pick up sticks (as opposed to rates) because of their tendency to fill basements with bloodless bodies, they are not really bright. If they fed their victims, they could run their own little blood farm, and that would reduce mortality, allowing them to settle in and get a chintzy. <br /> <br /> Why producers thought it necessary to introduce incestuous twins and homicidly gay older brother, I'm not sure. He added zero to the story, which was unfortunate given that there was not much storyline and no shock value. <br /> <br /> I have never been told why my parents died, unless this was explained during one of my frequent breaks for tea. Apparently, the social worker had to be warned by the family for some reason or another, but again the viewer had to write his own reason. <br /> <br /> The only well-rounded figure was the youngest brother who emerges like Pugsley from the Adams family. In fact, he was too rounded, looking like a child who unwittingly wandered from the observer class to a very bad horror movie. He had it, heaven. It does not matter, I have another donut with a delicious blood center.
