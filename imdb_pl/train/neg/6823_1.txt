I should better trust my instincts: no expectations - no disappointments. Instead, I was expecting to experience a similar masterpiece, such as Koyaanisqatsi (1983), and I was brutally disappointed. Powaqqatsi is in my humble opinion nothing other than a cheap attempt to earn the cult success of his predecessor and - artistically - fails miserably. It seems that some producer has collected the remnants of Koyaanisqatsi material, hurriedly threw them together, put everything in slow motion and got some pop artist under the pseudonym Philip Glass, to hurry to throw away some trivial music in the background, which is constantly repeated. Where Koyaanisqatsi entertains the viewer with clever fast and slow changes, Powaqqatsi is one long sequence of mundane images in slow motion (if you see them on a VCR in Quick View mode, you'll see what I mean). However, I was most disappointed with Philip Glass's soundtrack. I could not - and still can not - believe that these commercial-sounding New Age drones, which could easily be composed in one afternoon by a 14-year-old on the Casio calculator, came from the same composer who perfectly composed emotional and perfectly synchronized music for Koyaanisqatsi. All in all, a great waste of time! My advice: Forget about commercialization! Instead, watch Koyaanisqatsi!
