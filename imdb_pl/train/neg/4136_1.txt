I read the reviews before I watched the movie, and I did not believe them. I love stupid movies and I was expecting the film to be mediocre. There was no. This movie makes Camp Blood 1 and 2 look great. The film contains bad acting, weak sound, bad story, bad make-up - and that's how boring I was to turn it off. even the nakedness was nonsense! Did they even have a budget for this film? I think it was not like that. You can say whether you like this movie or not in the first 5 minutes. if you want a good movie about cheesy blood, look at the toxic avenger 4 and even the blood of the camp. Avoid this basket - I watched it on TV and felt that I was tearing away, so do not spend anything on it. The best part is probably the end.
