Geez, as a gay who lives in New York, I can say with gratitude that I have never seen the gay abdomen of the Gay Culture which is presented in this film - and I'm glad of that !!! Whether this movie was broadcast on television in the United States, there would be a great anti-gay opposition and I can not say I blame them. The people in this movie do not represent the average gay American, or even the average American from Trandgender, what they represent is an ordinary nightmare. Inclusion of minors is frightening, and obvious racist moods (anti-white) are glaring and disturbing - society can not be blamed for people who chose drugs, unemployment and rejection of education on the "cast" of the film - these people are not acts of desperation, but rather the rejection of anything reminiscent of personal ambition and the will to do something of themselves.
