The original is a relaxing watch with truly unforgettable animated sequences. Unfortunately, the sequel, although not the worst of the DTV sequels, is completely unheated. <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointment is the lack of history. As in the Magic World of Belle, characters are narrated by a series of vignettes. The magical world, though slightly better, can still ruin history. Between vignettes we see mice at work and personally I think that the antics of Jaq and Gus are the merits of this film. <br /> <br /> The first vignette is the best when it comes to Cinderella getting used to being a princess. This is the best because the mice were the funniest. The worst of vignettes, when Jaq turns into a man, is sometimes sweet, but he lacks imagination. The last vignette, when Anastasia falls in love, was also lovely. The problem was that I could not imagine Anastasia being friendly to Cinderella because I thought she was a half-sister's whore. It also destroyed quite a ridiculous thread about Lucifer falling in love with PomPom. <br /> <br /> Accidental music was very pleasant to listen to, but I hated songs, they were really uninvited and nothing like the beautiful melodies of Tchaikovsky's original. <br /> <br /> The heroes were the strongest event here. Cinderella, while still looking after him, lost his sincerity and a lot of charm from the original, although he wears very nice clothes. The prince had a really funny time, but it was not enough to save the film, just like Prudence and the king. As I mentioned before, mice were the advantages of the movie, because only they contributed to the captivating character of the film. I must say that the animation is colorful and above average, and the voice acting was surprisingly good. <br /> <br /> All in all, a sweet, though unoriginal follow-up that was interrupted by songs and lack of history. 4/10 for mice, voice, animation and beautiful dresses.
