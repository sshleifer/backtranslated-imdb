Revenge of the Sith begins with a long sequence of action that is impressive, without being terribly exciting, and then gets boring for the next hour and fifteen minutes, with the same horrible dialogue and boring machinations that have plagued the rest of the prequel series. The only thing that improves behavior is slow - and I mean slow - expanding what we know will be the birth of Darth Vader. And when it finally arrives, everything is fine. Not the best. Not even good. But quite well. This film is very praised because it does not suck it into heaven like previous sequels. Instead, it is simply painful, boring and routine. But you must say, wow, these CGI environments are really impressive. Bu light fights? They are all indistinct mess. I think the dark side embraced Lucas when he started these prequels and nobody noticed. It will bring a lot of money, but thank God it's over, this once-vaunted franchise has been defeated enough. I saw the show 12:01, and then I heard a group of very small children saying: wow, it was amazing! But everyone older than eight all complained about the same: I fell asleep inside. It was a bit boring. I just thought that the birth of Darth Vader would be better. So we're all talking.
