First of all, in this movie there was nothing that really caught me. It was not a bad movie, just another movie in which I said, "Well, that was nothing special" after I saw it. It was probably a drama and so on, but it just did not catch me, but it was more dull. As I said in the headline, in a sense, it was very cheap. The quality of the film itself (photos) was low and reminded me of a cheap TV movie rather than a respected English filmmaker. The angles and camera shots were very amateur, I think. There are really no close-ups or similar effects to create interesting scenes. I did not see many English films, and the ones I saw did not impress me much, and they did something similar to camera work, colors and the like. "The Game" tried to be more cool, fashionable and intelligent (see my review of "Lola Rennt" on this topic if you want), but I also failed. In general, a bit indifferent movie, which was nothing special (at best I'm afraid) and unfortunately, unfortunately, for two hours wasted.
