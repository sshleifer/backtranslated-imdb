SICK. it really means So Incredibly Crappy and I killed myself. There was absolutely nothing to say. The best part of the whole production was a work of art on the cover of the box. Budgeting this movie was enough. Filming took place at Sezamowa Street. Production looks like in underground films for mob hits. Props used in this movie were stolen in the clothing store. The ending was so predictable that you should fast forward for the last 5 minutes and laugh. If there's a movie book out there, I'm sure it's better. I would avoid it at all costs. I really liked the intimate scenes that made the whole movie worth it. kidding.
