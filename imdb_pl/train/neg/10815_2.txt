I love the Jane Eyre book and have seen many versions of it. Everyone has their strengths and their disadvantages. However, it was one of the worst I saw. I did not care about Jane or Mr. Rochester. Charlotte Gainsbourg (Jane) was almost bearable and certainly looked like a simple part, but she did not have any emotions in any of her lines. I could not imagine what Mr. Rochester saw in her. <br /> <br /> That brings us to Mr. Rochester. William Hurt had even less emotion than Jane, if possible. How two such bland people could fall in love is a mystery, but it certainly did not pay attention to me. Perhaps the director (Zeffrelli) fell asleep during production. <br /> <br /> Timothy Dalton (too handsome for Mr. Rochester!) The version is much more faithful to the book, but Ciaran Hinds plays the perfect Mr. Rochester in A / E version from 1997 (which is NOT compatible with this book ). <br /> <br /> Trying to find something positive in this movie: Geraldine Chaplain was perfect in her role.
