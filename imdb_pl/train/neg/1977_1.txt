Wait, do not tell me ... they threw the movie away and stayed away. You know, this movie could have been filmed in an alley in New York. I think "Gangster Bangster". Gangster Rap, Designer gangster duster clothes, including a bandana that somehow has been moved from the neck to protect from dust storms to the head. I think it was about protecting your head against filtering heat through K-Mart hats. It seems that "Budget rent-a-hors" provided horsy. A one-bedroom scene in which the girl was talking and the guy was saying her words ... I thought he was talking. You know, watching this movie only confirms it, it's not about acting anymore ... it's about looks and it's about money. There could not be too much of what pertains to this movie. Well, all in all I think this movie will be abolished as the worst movie of all time. One more thing, where was Ice T? Did he finally travel to Oprah?
