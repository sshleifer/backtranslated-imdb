The explosion of TV channels must be eternally grateful to Randolph Scott's production line, because at any moment there must be one of hundreds of Randolph Scott movies played on at least one station without a budget. <br /> <br /> "Man Behind The Gun" is a typical early melodrama from the early 1950s with pre-World War II production values ​​based on a historically-relevant murder story filled with action scenes to hide the total lack of character development and therefore no voltage. In the coming years, the role of these films will be taken over by television programs such as "Gunsmoke", "Bonanza" etc. - and these actually worked better. Randolph Scott, who looks particularly gray, is a good guy, fighting against evil opponents, against which he will eventually win. There is not much interest in what he is emotionally experiencing than what his horse feels, unless you count on wondering if he will sort out the initial misunderstanding with the woman leading to the end. Music is a stronger indicator of the emotional state of the "character" than acting. But all right, if it lifts your boat; and I would not agree with you for the joy of "Diagnosis, murder." <br /> <br /> Workers, walking and aging is fast. 3 stars for a skillful combination; 0 for an artistic undertaking.
