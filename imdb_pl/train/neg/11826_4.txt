There is something sad about seeing someone who is so good at doing something, trying to do something completely different ... and in the end is mediocre. I was thinking about Jordan playing baseball, but the same applies to Steve Martin. <br /> <br /> This movie is quite well made and directed, but the script is smelly. Martin did a great job adjusting the classic story to the comedy in "Roxanne", but this effort to bring the Victorian drama to the modern scene hits the wall of improbability. If you want to see an old story updated in some style, it's best to borrow "Big Expectations".
