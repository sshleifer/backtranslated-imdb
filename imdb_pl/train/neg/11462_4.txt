Generally I like monster movies. Even if they are unbelievable and stupid. But it's hard to like this movie when it's so unbelievable and stupid and tries to treat everything seriously at the same time. As in a really elegant style. <br /> <br /> Although the idea is a bit matter, as the Orcs are known for killing the Great White Sharks, it is really difficult to find it terrifying when I can not help but simply see the evil Shamoo destroying things. Especially this one scene in which a building exploded the cause of the Orc's action ... and when it explodes, the object jumps out of the water and I felt that I was watching a show at Sea World with fireworks. They also kill horrible moments before they even suggest they will happen. In addition, Jaws performs several blows. It's like "hey we look, we're real and we can come up with BETTER reasons why Orca attacks." <br /> <br /> Yes, ignoring your outrageous **** in logic of course. But JAWS had one thing that your movie does not have. This is terrible. Yes, it's unbelievable. Yes, it's a bit outrageous. But honestly, actual or not, Killer Shark is not nearly as frightening as Big White. A weak attempt to develop characters and writing simply hurts her. Even JAWS the Revenge is more frightening.
