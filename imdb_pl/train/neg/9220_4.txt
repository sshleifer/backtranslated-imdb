When the movie started for the first 4 minutes, it seemed to be a guide to California, I was wondering if I had mixed up tapes. Then I breathed a sigh of relief, seeing Paul Thomas on stage with the charming Joanna Storm and Laurie Smith. This is tracked by Jimmy (young Tom Byron). Jimmy's aunt (Honey Wilder) is worried about his behavior, so he hires him as a private teacher (Kay Parker). I could do without an animal, play robot roles or aspects of incest. There's one good sex scene between Byron and Parker, but it's not good enough to save this movie. <br /> <br /> My class: D +
