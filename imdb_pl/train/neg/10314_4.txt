As someone who likes to chase scenes and was really intrigued by this fascinating story of real life, I was optimistic about this film, but too many obstacles entered the path of a good story that should be. <br /> <br /> THE BAD - I am a fan of Robert Duvall and many characters in which he played, but his role is boring as an insurance researcher. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is bland, and the pretty Kathryn Harrold is a real junk. From what I read, there were several directors who were replacing themselves in this film, which is a shame. You can say that history is not right. I could not "get involved" in the role of Cooper in the movie Treat Williams. He should have been fascinating, but he was not in this movie. It is also a sad comment that the guy who commits the crime is a "folk hero", but I admit that I finished also cheering on this guy. <br /> <br /> Not everything was disappointing. I can not complain about the scenery, from the lush green forests of Oregon to the Arizona desert. <br /> <br /> I would like to see this movie again and again, because it is a unique story.
