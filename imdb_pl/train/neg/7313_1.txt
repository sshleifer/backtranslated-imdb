I wasted 5.75 to see this bad movie, so I just want to know a few things: <br /> <br /> What was the point of dividing the dog in half at the beginning of the movie, the disease had nothing to do with the split in half. <br /> <br /> What was the point of pulling Karen into the shed, she had already infected her room completely, could have closed her where she would have been safer. <br /> <br /> Why did the hermit run around the forest asking the strangers to help him when he could ask a relative, a swine, to take him to the hospital? <br /> <br /> Why not? t none of the characters is going to go to the city to get help when things start wrong, are they really so lazy? <br /> <br /> Even if Paul was threatened by a rifle man for watching his wife, Paul could have just sent Jeff or Bert home to ask for help. the girl he loves is getting worse. <br /> <br /> What was the meaning of this box? <br /> <br /> Why did Jeff return to the cabin after he left, when everyone else was infected, if he was such a big jerk, to go first, would not he go home? <br /> <br /> If the police took the trouble to gather the children and burn them on the fire pit, why did they throw Paul in the middle of the river, it was not even necessary for the story, because the water was already contaminated. <br /> <br /> Who makes lemonade from river water, this nonsense has leaves of dirt and bugs in it. Why two children could not just use tap water, it was contaminated too, so the stupid ending will still work.
