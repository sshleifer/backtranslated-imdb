I just watched this movie and I have to say that thanks to such a great assumption and great talent this turkey is lying there !!! A friend borrowed this movie and watched it with an open mind, mainly because he praised the story. <br /> <br /> Well, the movie started with Kevin Costner as a fighter pilot retiring ... why? Why did they make him a fighter pilot? He was supposed to be hired by Anthony Quinn to become his new pilot ... well, we'll never see Costner approaching the plane until the end of the movie! Costner bumps into a Texan (James Gammon) selling a horse to a great Mexican businessman and Costner for a ride. Not knowing what happened, Gammon is about to die, and Costner brings him to see what's going on with Quinn's companion! But nothing comes of it ... nada, zilcho! Why did they have the character of Gammon? Why did they sell their horses to Quinn's colleague, if nothing came of it? <br /> <br /> In addition, after leaving Costner to death, they make the character Madeline Stowe a whore, then attacks one of Quinn's men who paid for the return ... stabbed him with his own knife, and another thing that she was transferred to the monastery! No explanation why it was moved or when it happened! <br /> <br /> Too much talent wasted on such a poor script and poor editing !! I watched it only because a friend owned it and let me watch it ... I'm going to throw it at him for 2 hours, which I wasted in my life watching the cursed thing!
