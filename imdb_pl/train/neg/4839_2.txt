... and be more disappointed than ever before. I will not make any direct references or anything here, but at least this movie is pathetic. If you're trained in the army, do not worry about watching. I put it on a DVD with two friends who want to watch a somewhat interesting action / war movie. Why could not I read the review for the first time? <br /> <br /> Already on the first scene of the "bomb" the movie has huge glitches and continues to show up and becomes bigger. My two friends, not affiliated with the army, in any way noticed some errors of the filmmaker almost as quickly as I did and asked if some of the things that are happening are realistic. Well, as you probably guess, they're not there. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie unless you are able to overlook these completely idiotic and repetitive mistakes. 2/10 at the beginning for interest.
