Maaan, where do I start this horrible movie from God. Bad bad bad story telling. I do not know what the director thought when he made the film. To be honest, Namaste London was quite a nice movie, even though the soundtrack was good. But in this ... ..o my good ... for the movie to be musical ... the songs are very bad. AR Rahman should have been the musical director. <br /> <br /> Given the two great actors, the director should do a much better job. Even if the first half sucks, the last 30 minutes of the movie are OK. The performances of Salman and Ajaya save the film from total disaster. <br /> <br /> See if you do not have anything better to do. The last good movie from Bollywood I watched (and I watch them a lot) is Dev D and Wake Up Sid.
