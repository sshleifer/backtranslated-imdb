I can not believe that this movie even reached the video, and the video rental stores want to put it on the shelves. Literary I asked for a refund. Reject the fact that the film has no historical truth, and this is still the worst movie ever found in the video store. It's not even good enough to be called a movie with an assessment of B. Do not waste your time or money on this movie. Just writing down the voice and the terrible music made me sick. Anyone who is involved in this movie should be removed from the relationship, giving the industry a black mark, but after watching most of the movie I really do not think anyone involved is a union member.
