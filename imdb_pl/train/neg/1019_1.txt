Honestly, before I watched this movie, I heard many people say that this movie is a disgrace. I did not believe that since Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey took roles in this movie and they watched it myself. Apparently they were right. I was very disappointed and I wondered all the time - why the hell was I watching this movie? <br /> <br /> Of course, I did not expect much from Justin, because he really does not belong to the movie / theater business. But Morgan and Kevin? I could not stop asking myself why the hell had agreed to take part in Edison. Honestly, their roles are rather stupid. <br /> <br /> Well, you might think that if players suck, I should devote more attention to history. Indeed, history is the core of the movie, but guys ... trust me ... this is not a movie that you would like to praise for your story. Imagine that an intelligent journalist (Justin Timberlake) wrote a story against the system and at the same time learned how to become a "real" journalist from his boss (Morgan Freeman). All this has been supported by one agent who still has a heart for justice (LL Cool J) and a brilliant researcher (Kevin Spacey). At the end, they defeated the system with a happy ending story. <br /> <br /> Jesus, I could not even continue. Remembering the film has already made me sick. My advisers, do not watch this! Save your money and time for the next movie.
