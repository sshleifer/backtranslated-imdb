The Meatball Machine must be one of the most complex, horrible and exaggerated science fiction horrors I've ever encountered. It is about good against evil and a story about the coming age, in order to entertain yourself with a bloody, dingy and humorous context. For this reason, violence is not particularly gruesome and does not make you squirm, but free bloodletting and nudity runs freely. Performances by Issei Takahashi and Toru Tezuka are the worst I've ever seen, and if that's not enough, it's directed by unheard-of director Yudai Yamaguchi. This movie has it all, it's bad for bones!, It must see for every maniac b-movie !!! ... Simply: a delightful and rare jewel.
