Did I see a worse movie? Perhaps only "Manos: The Hands of Fate" went on more than "Dukes". I had more pleasure to dig in gigantic holes than the movie gave me at any moment. Let's take a look at a few ... <br /> <br /> There is a noticeable scenario of death and rebirth when Sheev talks with the Dukes and they do not react. He shrugs and goes on, because neither Knoxville nor Scott knows what he is talking about (nor us). It was as if the engine died and was restarted. <br /> <br /> A few times General Lee flew in the air, he was not even that exciting. Nothing I have seen in the TV series. <br /> <br /> Very little chemistry between Knoxville and Scott. The best part was that he was angry with Luke for stealing the girl he liked. The only reason it works is because the script actually covered it (though roughly). For the rest of the time it seems distant and forced. <br /> <br /> Seann William Scott is terrible, terrifying (or missing). <br /> <br /> I hated the performance of Willi Nelson. Were bad jokes to be endearing? I wanted him to disappear. <br /> <br /> Jessica Simpson looks great on the big screen. Actually, she felt like one of the better actors in the movie. It tells you how awful this movie is. She is a goddess. <br /> <br /> During the culmination of the film, I supported Boss Hogg and the bad guys to flatten entire Hazzard County, starting with Willie Nelson and his associates. A nuclear bomb would be enough. <br /> <br /> It is not meant to be a coherent disassembly of the film, but to release frustration due to the terrible writing and performance of what could have been a really nice film. <br /> <br /> If only we could erase and start again ...
