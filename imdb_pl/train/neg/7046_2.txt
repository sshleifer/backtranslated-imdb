I saw this boring waste of time on the HBO comedy channel, so quite innocently and of course I assumed it was a comedy. But there is nothing funny here. A good cast is basically wasted on the script I could write with my left buttock - after the 15th century executioners of the Inquisition beat him senselessly. The first half is particularly bad because it has one of the most boring, meaningless dialogues I've come across at once, and zero zero with a comma that you can talk about. The fact that stars like Ewan McGregor and Zeta-Jones are in this little film, and yet this movie has less than 1000 voices on this site, should say everything. A few nice shots of waves hitting the cold British coast, but that's all. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie that is made only because the people who wrote it have good connections (family connections, preferably) and / or a lot of cash lying nearby.
