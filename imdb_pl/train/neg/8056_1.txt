Anxious, boring and inconsistent supernatural "thriller" in which a student Cassie (Melissa Sagemiller) is a permanent victim of hallucinations and nightmares after a car accident that claims her boyfriend Sean (Casey Affleck). > I can not tell you how bad it is ... nothing important will ever happen, nor will there be any real entertainment value. I did not like this cast in this particular movie - all of them are unfortunately unconvincing (then their roles are not good). Promoting this as a horror movie is a joke. Where are the horrors? There is no sense or tension - there are some good songs, but that's all. <br /> <br /> How did the project gain green light on Earth? Screenwriter-director Steve Carpenter has no perceptible vision or talent I can sense. Worst of all, the proposal really makes the whole movie pointless. <br /> <br /> The alleged "killer cut" that I watched was 86 minutes of pure boredom. <br /> <br /> 1/10
