At the beginning I was convinced that it was a movie created especially for television, which was not worth the time of the original. But after a few minutes of stupid admiration I realized that at least in the comedies of stunts and acting movies there is at least a comic value. This film would have been awarded to 1 if my wife and I did not laugh as much as we watched with surprise that the actors could keep their face straight. It was like a less fun spy version of The Big Hit (I laughed so much that I bought a DVD Big Hit) with even worse acting. We were disappointed that Nick decided to marry Elena, not Jim, after all the hugs and fives. A few rum and colas will certainly facilitate this descent.
