It's getting really bad. The only advantage in the middle of the road is the effect of thousands of bullets used during the movie. Contextual errors exist everywhere. Acting is awful, except for Kirk. History is as full of holes as the grail, and the belief that a movie is a video game in itself, kills a movie if it was not a corpse anymore. So it's a waste of your life. I would say that zero was an option on the rating scale.
