This is one of the worst films of Clark Gable. Only PARNELL was clearly inferior. It is simply painful, banal, and the dialogue is so bad that it is not something Gable and Jean Harlow should not have been proud of. <br /> <br /> Gable is the heel whose illegal activity causes his girlfriend to "go slammer (like a gangster talk?). He maintains the hope that he will do the right thing, but he just leaves her there - none of them knows that he is "on a family way". Ultimately, the rogue returns to do the right thing and somehow combine it all into a happy ending! They seemed to have forgotten that Gable must rape and spend a few years in hooseg. Leonard Maltin says "the stars are the best here". What standard? Is it best to produce unintentional giggles? Give me a break! <br /> <br /> PS - after she said that, my wife thinks Leonard Maltin will find me and kick my ass. Hmmm. However, despite my comment, I think that Mr. Maltin is the best reviewer and man on this planet (I hope he calmed him down). <br /> <br /> UPDATE - 2/08. Because for the first time I did not like this movie (especially funny), I decided to watch it again. After all, sometimes when I watch the movie again, I like it much more and I realize that I was a bit too harsh. Although this was the case with several movies in recent months, I still did not like this movie - even the second time. Most of them did not result from the first half of the movie. In the first half, Harlow was incredibly stupid, but at least she was credible. But when she was sent to prison, it was all clich√©s all the way to the final funny marriage scene. The most important thing is that this sequence is embarrassingly stupid - it just does not make sense and is like turning a movie into some crazy fairy tale instead of a love story with two defects. I stand by my original review (despite all the "NOT HELPFUL") and I think that apart from PARNELL and probably POLLY AT THE CIRCUS, this may be the worst Gable movie.
