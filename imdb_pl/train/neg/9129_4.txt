You can not get around this - this movie is terrible. I've seen old films by Christopher Lee / Fu Manchu, I know characters and their beginnings, but it's still awful. However, the genius of Peter Sellers is still shining through the portrait of Nayland Smith, with an echo of sadness, tragedy and power seething through the Stoic fa√ßade; it is a performance that I put on a par with the portrait of Van Helsing by Peter Cushing, but I made it in the tenth part of the total time on the screen of all Dracula Cushing's films. If the film was shot in a more seriously comic style, such as BUBBA HO-TEP on the AVENGERS television program from 1960, it could have been something special. If you're a complete Fu Manchu or Peter Sellers, this is something that you have to see, but it's a pass for everyone else.
