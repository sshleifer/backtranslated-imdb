... so I thought I would say a few words about William McNamara. This is not a bad way to spend a few hours, if you want to see him in his bizarre personalities - it's obvious that he pumped up for the role and looks pretty good in them - or less. In the cave there is a prolonged sequence in which he must break down into his undies. There is a nice piece in which he must chase Miss Eleniak in the buff, only his hands rest on his groin. William McNamara is naturally a bit thin, but he has a nice, generous handful of booty. There is also a moment when he gets up from bed, that if you stop the action at the right time, you will see the whole enchilad. If you're willing to do this, and come on, half the people who decide to watch a navy movie while "traveling by car" is. I would like to thank Dennis Hopper for his equal chance of unselfish nudity. Can William McNamara work? Heck, if I know.
