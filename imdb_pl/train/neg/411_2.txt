Usually, I do not want to comment on films that I do not like, but in a case like this one I have to say something. This movie is horrible, illogical and stupid. There are so many mistakes in telling stories that I do not even feel obliged to develop them, because it's time to go from this experience. The most annoying point, though, is that at no point in the film is anyone explaining whether the motives of madness of Bacon's character result from the power of the power or the physiological response to his condition. <br /> <br /> The agreement is impressive, and in the past Paul Verhoeven did some good things (Robocop's cutout on a DVD is great). However, this film is stupid and generally does not come close to explaining the point or technical aspect of the subject, and instead sets a predictable action without pleasure. <br /> <br /> In short, like many other reviews here, say (I regret that I have not read them before ...) - Stay away from this movie!
