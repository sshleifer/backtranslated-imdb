Ok, I like B movies ... I know what B movies should represent. But that's just awful. I am amazed that he has obtained such a decent overall result. The only advantages of this movement are (mainly) the effects of marginal splashing. Do not get me wrong, gore abounds in this movie - but few effects really jumped on me (like anal "probe" ... it was great!). <br /> <br /> I believe that this movie filmed on the camera. Come on - at least Betacam, I saw porn with better production values ​​(and I was better at working). <br /> <br /> Acting - sucked! But not in the style of Troma or Full Moon. <br /> <br /> History - invented! But that's what you get from such movies. Very loose! <br /> <br /> Sets and props - sucked! My 16-year-old brother prepares more sophisticated sets for our home in Halloween. <br /> <br /> Dubbing and dialogue - sucks! Horrible voice acting (I should not even call it) and every other word is "S ** t" or "F ** k". <br /> <br /> There are tons of good classic horror and B / splashes there and they are not difficult to track down. Do yourself a favor, not wasting your time on this shit!
