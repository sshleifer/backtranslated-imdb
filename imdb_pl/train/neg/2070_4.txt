After too many bad memories, I skipped this episode every time it appeared in the sequence of the 2nd season. I recently looked at it again to remind me why. I've always considered this to be the worst episode of ST: TNG (with the exception of "Shades of Gray", which does not count as episodes). <br /> <br /> I am constantly listening to the clumsy dialogue and script thinking in a red pencil written by the author. Writing 101: "SHOW, DO NOT SAY!" From the statements of Deanna Troja and constant reminders of all others about how charming, dangerous villain Okon is to explain Guinan about how funny her droid joke is (it is not), who cares about solving the conflict, there is no plot point that is underscored and threefold underlined for our building, and there is not any reliable moment. Unfortunately, Bill Campbell, a charming actor in other circumstances, is too puppy-dog-hugging to be the center of plot machinations. On the other hand, it may be that no one except John Barrowman (Jack Harkness from "Doctor Who") can attract this guaranteed deputy role. <br /> <br /> (By the way, zero points, to Date dubbing.) Although I think Joe Piscopo stopped being fun decades ago, he and Brent Spiner had nothing to do with it. Although Jerry Lewis was stupid .) <br /> <br /> On a good day, you may be able to think of it as a lovely, small tribute to a smaller episode of the Original Series. I would prefer to go to Time Squared or Q Who.
