Completely pretentious nonsense. The material is boring, boring, boring, and most casts would not even make duplicates in previous Allen's films. And to listen to the unsuccessful Will Ferrell, his imitation of Woody Allen makes me hate the second (though mysteriously popular) Ferrell even more. It seems that the gloomy 70-year-old Allen should knock out his job when the clock rang in the new century. <br /> <br /> I really tried to get involved in the movie, but it was simply impossible; my snyaps could not shoot so slowly. So instead of falling asleep and killing the afternoon while sleeping upright, I got up, left my wife and daughter in the theater and went to the car, where I had a really good book to read again (George Bailey's great book 30 years ago, "Germany".) Finally the day turned out pretty good, not thanks to Woody.
