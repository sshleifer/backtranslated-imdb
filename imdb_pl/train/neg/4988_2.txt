In a sense, the Time Corridors is a success story because the film achieves its goal: to be seen by thousands. But they fail to make them laugh ... <br /> <br /> Les Visiteurs was successful because the subject was an original way to consider time travel: forget about Zemeckis's Back to the future, old France is coming, medieval knight and almost a barbaric lifestyle. Full of pride, funny thanks to the ancient words he uses, Montmirail can sometimes be disgusting, but he keeps his honor. Then comes the sequel. <br /> <br /> No one predicted the huge success of Les Visiteurs, the first. And it makes no sense to be a film expert to realize that the Time Corridors were created for money. <br /> <br /> The general story begins after the end of Les Visiteurs and immediately tries to justify a sequel sometimes a paradox that would need a second second. Explanation: it makes no sense to try to retrieve the jewelry Jacquouille stole; do not you remember that nice red shiny and expensive car that he bought at the end of the first episode? Where do you think he found the money? Selling jewelry ... And that's just one of the many holes that Poiré tries to avoid ... and fails. <br /> <br /> Let's take a look at the characters: Montmirail does not change, it's just a little more boring. When it comes to Frenegonde ... this is another story: Valérie Lemercier decided not to compromise in this sequel to avoid getting stuck in the role of the bourgeoisie. And Muriel Robin tries to imitate her in a way that I find so pathetic that I almost felt pain for her. And Poiré does not realize that the cast of humorists is not enough to make a good comedy. <br /> <br /> Forget about traveling in time, about digital effects, concentrate on history, and you'll see that there is enough space on the postage stamp to write it 10 times. <br /> <br /> The main interest of this film are landscapes. Film for young people, say up to 13 years old.
