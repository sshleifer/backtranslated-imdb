Resnais, wow! The genius that Hiroshima Mon Amour brought to us takes up the challenge of creating a French musical from the 1930s in a vibrant color. Opening the reader with old, decorated titles was a nice touch. Then the camera stop (like an old hand crank) opens on a black and white plaque. The camera is retreating (or rather up), suddenly showing the surprisingly bright colors of the elegant tea table. It's all in the first 60 seconds. <br /> <br /> Then the music starts. Quite a banal and unforgettable movie in which there is an unconvincing refrain of 3 girls blabbing some nonsense, which does not matter to the film (and yes, I speak French, so I can not blame him for the subtitles). These characters come out the door and are replaced by more people who break into an even more forgotten song. Then they leave, and finally Audrey Tautou appears and we hear our first meaningful dialogue 15 minutes in the film. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what Resnais was going to do, starting with such a yawning waste of time and music cacophony. But the effect on the viewer lies in the fact that you want to throw bowling on the screen and break down. I stand it. <br /> <br /> It was not better. I'll tell you why. He has no knowledge of any of the characters. We do not even see their faces for half the time (because Resnais seems too focused on showing expensive scenery to take care of real people in front of the camera). People dance on the stage like moths around a lamp, and we, the audience, are not able to focus on any particular person or story. It's like you have to take every episode of Brady Bunch and push him into a 2-hour movie. With bad songs. <br /> <br /> The only thing that allowed me to watch as long as I did it (1 hour) was that I was looking at camera techniques, lighting and scenery that I admit were excellent. But is it enough to keep your attention for 2 hours? Not me. Maybe I'll try to see the end tomorrow. Aw who I'm kidding. I have more important things to do. I'm also sure. Skip it.
