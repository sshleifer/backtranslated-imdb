Wrong. The rating of PG received by this film is another big mistake MPAA. Whale Rider gets PG-13, but this movie gets PG? Please. Parents, do not be fooled, taking a child from primary school to this movie is a huge mistake. There were many times that I felt uncomfortable not only because humor was unsuitable for children, but also because it was completely ridiculous and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> But aside, a cat in a hat is still a terrible movie. The cast and general appearance of the film are the only salutary favors. Beautiful Kelly Preston and the always lovable (or in this case hateful) Alec Baldwin are good at their roles, although Preston is almost too good for such a role. Children are conditioned actors and this shows, especially from Dakota Fanning. Fanning is the only human aspect of the movie that made me watch and not throw things on the screen. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that there was a big talking cat in this movie? Mike Myers is absolutely deplorable. I did not like him as Shrek's voice, and I really believe that Myers must never be allowed to approach the kingdom of children's films anymore. His portrait of The Cat is a slightly subdued version of Fat Bastard and Austin Powers. <br /> <br /> In the end the cat should not have come, he should have stayed, but he came, even if only for one day ruined the 82 minutes of my life, 82 minutes of personal anger and quarrels. <br /> <br /> A cat in a hat can be the worst movie for children in history.
