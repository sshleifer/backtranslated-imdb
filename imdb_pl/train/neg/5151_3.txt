I thought it was a great idea, but, boy, it was badly made. We get a broad understanding of how complicated and demanding operations are behind the scenes of the program, but there are virtually no details about it. It seems that the producers have not found any way to tell a story or give the viewer a "passing line". (This does not mean that they have not tried, but having stage performances accompanies the summary of the Ringworld cycle, because the narrative of the program does nothing to tell us about the physical assembly work of the opera.) <br /> <br /> We see many things, but little is said about what people do and why. There is little point in who who or where different production departments fit and cooperate. For example, we hear about a problem several times - it is expected that you will see the problem and its consequences and / or how it will be resolved. But instead, filmmakers usually just cut off something else (generally, quite a general recording of people pushing things or talking with headphones.) <br /> <br /> In general, the movie ends more like pastiche of images. See how it runs under the final credits program, not anything worth seeing on your own.
