this movie was a fantastic, great movie, all horrible as hell. and I mean, it frightened me as much as the pulse and IT, omen, etc., but thanks to the great movie ends the crap? WELL! this end of movies was pathetic. I mean, the ghost has gone back in the house of the chicks and is thinking now that I've done what it means that I can call her and that's the right time because she thinks so. well? wrong. my ass! I do not care if the spirit is Satan, it just does not happen. it's a movie like that, but most of the bad movies or such praised movies make sense, but it did not happen. it just showed us what I just said and people do not think about it. can anyone tell me why everyone did not notice this pathetic part. the film ended for me in the hospital and that's all. check number 3, which is much more popular
