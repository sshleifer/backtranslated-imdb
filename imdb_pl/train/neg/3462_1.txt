Darts are few and far away from now, so when I heard about Cut, I had high hopes and heard good things about it. The good things that I heard were bad ... very bad! This move is bad and I mean BAD. It's just stupid. Everything about it. Especially the origin of the killer and how he lives, and how he finally deals with it. There is nothing original or special about this movement. Another slasher who wants to be with these "hip", "self-aware". The characters "understandable movie". I'm sick of this shit. Someone is doing something else, because the slash genre needs new blood, literally.
