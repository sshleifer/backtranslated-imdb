With the title "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes!" Anyone who enters this game would expect a) a bad science fiction movie or b) a comedy that would ridicule bad science fiction movies. It's supposed to be a mix of both, with a dose of sprayed parody. Unfortunately, it soon falls. <br /> <br /> You should never take this movie seriously, I realize it, but you guys think it's funny, right? I found only a few jokes or situations that were fun (ie. Side-by-side phone calls, Russian Olympic spy eating steroid flakes, walking Superman by Lois, etc.). "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" tries to be an iconic classic, but he fails. The cult classic is a film that is so different that only a selected group of people understands it (or a similar description). The "attack of deadly tomatoes" could be enjoyed by any 8-year-old with a bad sense of humor, which is why he does not qualify as a cult movie. <br /> <br /> There's one good actress in the whole thing: Sharon Taylor as Lois Fairchild. She is a slim reporter, but has an engaging personality, loves to abuse and is a natural comedian. Unfortunately, it is badly used here. <br /> <br /> "Attack of deadly tomatoes" is not as funny as, say, "Amazon Women on the Moon" or "Kentucky Fried Movie", but yes I have some fun moments, so I still recommend seeing it once. Avoid the director's cut, he is interrupted by the producer of the film and some supposedly "lost" material dubbed in a pretend African dialect (you can find it in English on a printed tape).
