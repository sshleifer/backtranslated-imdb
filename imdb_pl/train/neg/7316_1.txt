When I saw the announcement of this film, I did not expect too much - about the second horror for teenagers. But wow, this movie was absolutely horrible. And it is generous. <br /> <br /> First of all, the casting was horrible. You do not feel compassion (or any morbid feelings) for heroes. Acting was so terrible that I just waited and counted on a horrible thing to the end. <br /> <br /> Secondly, there are points in the movie that had absolutely no relation to the plot. Can someone explain to me why a girl boy starts screaming "PANCAKES !!!" at the top of his lungs when he goes into Jackie Chan's movements I've never seen before, and an even more biting guy who has a virus? Why is the father of a kid angry with a man infected with a virus and goes to hunt a redneck to find him? I was left with the feeling of such confusion and utter disbelief that I literally said out loud: "Where did it come from, hell?" <br /> <br /> I just could not believe what I saw. I really thought I saw bad movies, but I have to admit that Cabin Fever eats them all. This movie made me want to puke and then vomit again. Then throw me out of my head. <br /> <br /> Save yourself an hour and a half and do something more productive. Probably a good alternative is to observe the growth of grass.
