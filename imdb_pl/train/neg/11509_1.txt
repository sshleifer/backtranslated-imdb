I do not know what some of you smoke, but I suspect that he is strong. <br /> <br /> Calling Swept Away awful would be an insult to the very concept of horrors. Acting is hideous and I do not choose Madonna here, we all know that it is useless, but someone should warn others that her illness is contagious. My back is literally hurting from knocking so badly with badly delivered lines. The editing is so sloppy that it asks for a description. Photography and composition (which in this era should be a GIFT for each movie with a budget) are amazingly inept, even the lighting is terrible and unnatural. These are BASIC elements of creating movies, if you can not fix them, you should look for a different line of work. It is as imagined as the production of the 3rd degree Snow White, except anywhere close, so well done or interesting. <br /> <br /> The original film by Rina Wertmueller is a wonderful satire and metaphor, perfectly preserved and written, with breathtaking effects - you can practically taste the sea salt and feel the windswept sand in your hair. Sexual tension seems real and immediate ... those of you who have found the regrettable version of Guy Ritchie should see this, it really is one of the landmarks of world cinema. <br /> <br /> Those of you who have thought about the remake is some masterpiece that should have examined your head.
