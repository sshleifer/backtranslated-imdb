I went to school with Jeremy Earl, I heard about this movie, I do not know if he was in the theater at all. I do not remember the name. I saw it, it's like one of those after school. Acting is OK, not great. The plot was weak, and the lines were quite trivial. The only comment I can give this movie is "Eh" I borrowed a movie from Jeremy, if I was in a movie rental company, it would be one that I would like to go through and after seeing it I would not recommend middle school age to anyone. I also noticed that many times when urban children are portrayed, slang is abused or simply outdated. I think many times that it makes their characters unbelievable.
