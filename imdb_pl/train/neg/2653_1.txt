I could not believe how awful this movie was; I rarely watch commercial television, but I thought, "Well, Diane Keaton is always worth watching." I was corrected. Everyone involved should be ashamed. <br /> <br /> I realize that there are not many great roles for women of a certain age, but the scenario for it was so inept, trivial and surprising that it surprised that it ever developed or that Mrs. Keaton thought that he can make a silk purse out of the ear of this sow. None of the characters had a bit of credibility and was so unbelievable. Acting looked like exercises in the BEGINNING class - I stared with open mouths for most of this wonder, "What were they thinking?". Very sad that it happened. Do not waste time.
