One of the worst movies I've ever seen. My only thought was "how can I get my money back from Hollywood Video". It is not worth four dollars or dollars. I think it was an attempt to break the films from Mexico or Vin Diesel, but it could not be done. <br /> <br /> Acting was awful, I felt sorry for the actors who could not find something better to do with their time. The story was ridiculous. We were calling lines in front of the actors, it was so predictable. The Mexican accent of the leading woman was insultingly exaggerated, worse than a cartoon. <br /> <br /> Skip it.
