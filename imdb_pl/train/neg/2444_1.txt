Two houses, one street, one telephone booth, one car, a neighbor girl, a neighbor boy and zombies. This list of ingredients should be enough for a great horror movie. All you need is blue light, ambient music and ... ready. But not in the hands of the Dutch director van Rouveroy! <br /> <br /> I like to organize "bad movie nights" from time to time. The concept is very simple: get alcohol, invite your movie friends and immerse yourself in the worst cinema you can offer. On this evening, this peace of dirt is one of the best. Laughter guaranteed! <br /> <br /> It is strange that van Rouveroy is still defending his film as if it was a great achievement. To be a witness, you have to listen to the DVD commentary. Again: I do not believe and laughs guaranteed!
