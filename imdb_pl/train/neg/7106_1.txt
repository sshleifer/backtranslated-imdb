I'm not a big fan of horror movies and I've only seen a handful of them (and none of "Halloween" or "Friday the Thirteenth") - but I can appreciate the terrifying horror not because of gore. I'm sure it is not scary. <br /> <br /> What's so scary in a small plastic skull that appears everywhere? There are distant shots in all of their performance, so there is no surprise in any of these films. (It's not that the skull itself is so scary, but ...) <br /> <br /> The story is about the third cousin of Claus Von Bulow (John Hudson) who marries a look reminiscent of reed Donny (Peggey Webber, giving one from the worst performances in history), who begins to see the skulls and hear the mysterious screams of a group of peacocks on the residence of the husband. Did I mention that her husband lost his first wife in a mysterious incident of drowning? OOOOH !!!! I wonder who did it !!!! <br /> <br /> It's the same old story about a rich boy who is trying to kill and / or lead his wife crazy. If you want to see a well-made version of this material, try "Reversal of Fortune". And BTW, Jeremy Irons is one hundred times more talented than John Hudson. <br /> <br /> MSTing was okay, but nothing special; in combination with the short version of "Gumby", however, makes watching good. <br /> <br /> Two stars for "The Screaming Skull"; eight stars for the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> And now, paraphrasing Mr. Von Bulow himself: "How bad is this movie?" "You have no idea!"
