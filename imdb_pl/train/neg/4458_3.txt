Most of the French films I've seen - and I've enjoyed - are more conversations than action, but that's fine. I found them interesting, well photographed and with intriguing actors. (However, at some point I was wondering if Gerald Depardieu was in every French film he has ever made!) It seemed like it was.) <br /> <br /> This film has the same interesting visual elements and had a good opening. But then it began to talk, talk and talk ... which is good for the drama, but not for the mystery of murder. After some time I almost fell asleep watching it. <br /> <br /> Actually, the movie was more like a game with almost all the scenes taking place in one room. So, if you love to play, you should like it ... but I want a bit more bang for a murder story.
