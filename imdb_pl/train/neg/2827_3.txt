The story at the beginning is interesting: slavery in the (late) XX century from West Africa to the Arab Middle East. The problem is that he intentionally stigmatizes the two favorite enemies of director Richard Fleisher: Arabs and Germans. Let us believe that men who look like Arabs will be able to roam freely around the area and easily catch Black people in West Africa, is just as credible as White hunts for slaves in "Roots". Of course, both transactions are / were led by residents and involve (d) much more advanced networks. While Arab countries are involved in today's trafficking of children and sex slaves, Israel is one of the worst criminals according to Amnesty International. Why, then, indicate only the Arabs and then choose the German as the only European buyer? This is obvious prejudice and hatred of these people by the Jewish director. <br /> <br /> Acting is above average, especially by Peter Ustinov (Suleiman) and Kabir Bedi (Malika). Michael Caine (Dr. Linderby) is always good.
