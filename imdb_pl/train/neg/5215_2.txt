It's the same old "If I can not get funds for my project, I'll inject myself" with a monster movie. There is nothing new here. This is similar to Jeff Goldblum's Fly. Man manages to keep the appearance of common sense, but finally succumbs to the effects of his experiments. Acting is very bad. There are people who behave stupidly on the way, putting their lives at risk for no apparent reason. The guy goes back to the lab he was forbidden to enter. Then there is his relationship with a young woman and her son. Admittedly, he is handsome, but it looks like he has a lot of trouble. It's just a waste of time. Even his tyrannosaur suit looks as if he has stepped off the stand during the Star Trek convention.
