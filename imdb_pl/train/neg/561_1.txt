I saw this movie yesterday and it is - unfortunately - worse than it might seem. First of all, the plot is idiotic, it does not make any sense at all. The screenplay is full of deliberately funny dialogues. The audience laughed many times. And the voltage is very low. Actors are playing this, except for Sharon Stone, who has some good moments, but also terribly bad moments. The saddest are the moments in which she tries to be aggressively sexy and says things like "I want * beep * you" and it looks like, let's say it gently, a very mature woman who plays naughty and not sexy at all. This erotic tension from BI1 has completely disappeared. From a technical point of view, Basic Instinct 2 is an average movie - better than typical DVD, but much lower than the original movie. For example, a scene of crazy joy is poorly made. The director of Basic Instinct 2 is not Paul Verhoeven and it shows. The new composer is not Jerry Goldsmith and his programs. The script is created by people who do not fit Joe Eszterhas. There is no substitute for Michael Douglas in it. The film looks cheap and poorly edited. I'm sorry, but my first thought after leaving the theater was: "Why have not they made this film before and with the original talents for the success of the first movie?" The entire film is reminiscent of Citizen Kane compared to that. The first Basic Instinct is a classic and was a breakthrough in the popular cinema. It was provocative, sexy and controversial. She had the best performance of Sharon Stone in her career. He had the specific style of Paul Verhoeven. Unfortunately, Basic Instinct 2 is an involuntarily funny movie, badly directed and a sure winner of the Razzie Award in many categories. It is a pity that they made this film.
