five minutes after watching this, I logged in to IMDb to warn you all that they would not care about this movie ... genre: horror? I had moments of gentle tension, and throughout the movie I thought, "something must happen soon", no ... when the movie ended, I felt so embarrassed writer / director that I was never the biggest fan of patrick rea this guy just did not he knows how to make movies and after watching the apologetic excuse of a horror movie, I moved from not the greatest fan, not to watch another of his songs ... <br /> <br /> I was abducted by a summary of the plot, please do not make the same mistake. <br /> <br /> I gave the film 2 for the actors ... they were not bad and there was no guilt in them that they got such a bad direction ...
