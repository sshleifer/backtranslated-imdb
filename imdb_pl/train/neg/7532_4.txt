Something that I really love in the short films of this woman is the elusiveness of the subject - especially in "Life with happiness." This film has some interesting beginnings - an unusual location and the potential for strange film treatment, but it does not manage with awkward exhibition dialogue, patchy performances and a very televised message. <br /> <br /> Once again, a charming television is a regular cinema. Ideas are so developed that they almost feel like TV commercials. But the sentiment is good, so we can not complain too much. <br /> <br /> I would really like this director to make a full animation and try to work with a producer who does not require such boring clarity.
