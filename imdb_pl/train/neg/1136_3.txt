Every movie from the 1930s is dated, but if you were to watch only John Ford movies, it would seem more obsolete than if you were watching other films. ie the Grand Hotel is a relatively modern melodrama. With Ford, it is always hard to sell someone's nobility (Abe, The Joads). Always an excessive pressure on the evil of some severity. Always badly developed, uncomfortable and obvious scripts. This is no exception. It's just a rather sophisticated device that provides feelings. And sentiment is everything that goes with it. <br /> <br /> What Ford does here does not appreciate Lincoln, but wonders how the US has been populated by a population of complete morons presented here. Ford made decent movies. It is too old to be bad. This is completely false. <br /> <br /> Henry Fonda with an artificial nose is bizarre. And no one from Illinois pronounced the final "S" nor said "Shonuff!"
