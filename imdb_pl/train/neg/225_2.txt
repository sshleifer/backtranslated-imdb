SPOILER: A young lover, Jed, gets fired by the maid, Kate (Andie McDowell), because he wrongly believes that Jed has an affair with one of the two feline girls. Kate thought she caught them in the act. Kate throws Jed's shoes out the door. Jed reluctantly leaves, then sits in the middle of the road to put on his shoes. Then he is driven over by a truck ("Crushed", one of the meanings of the title). And he dies. <br /> <br /> "And then he is driven over by a truck". Can you imagine a screenwriter who actually sends a script with this element of the story? Until now it's a comedy that is supposed to be foamed, but it lacks a real mousse. Everyone, but Jed is just annoying. And then they kill Jed and everyone is sad until the end, where the girls learn to love each other and help, instead of destroying. I give it to Ugh's 2.
