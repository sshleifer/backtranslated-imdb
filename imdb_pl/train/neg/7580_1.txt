It was a horrible movie. Essentially, Jane March was a half Korean Korean spy sent by Kim Jong Il to do something terrible for the American forces in South Korea. She becomes a maid to an American military family, everyone considers her to be Korean, although she looks more white (I believe that the actress is either 1/4 or 1/8 of Southeast Asia, not Korean at all), and the teenage boy of the family begins to hate her and ends up sleeping with her. The way Korea and the US military are presented in Korea is completely crazy. Of course, the screenwriter and director were, of course, white men who never spent a day in Korea before this movie and they did not intend to show any real insight into Korean life, neither for Koreans nor for American geographical indications, and instead simply tried to fulfill them pathetic fantasies of Asiaphile, no matter how unbelievable it was in the movie. Anyone who has ever been in Korea will know that it is complete garbage. Finally, the North Korean spy girl honhyol is killed in the "pay for sins" manner. Very bad movie with a "tailor-made" effect of the TV.
