This film was promising: my favorite actor in the historical drama during the War of Independence. He had memories of "Dances with Wolves" for great prairies, Indians, military fights and "Barry Lyndon" for the atmosphere of British lights ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the script is terrible: the continuity of the story is missing (cuts out "5 months later ";" 3 years later ") and the romance is so ridiculous that it is hard to believe: America is a great country, but the heroes are falling into each other; Above all, wait for the ending and understand how to kill the story (imagine the same in "Titanic"). <br /> <br /> Sometimes the bad script is saved by a genius filmmaker. Unfortunately, bis, Hudson is poor. He has already committed "Greystoke" and again I see the same disadvantages: lack of dynamics in the scenes, in the edition, in the scoring: it is long, boring, flat .... <br /> <br /> I knew that this movie was a disaster for Pacino career: now I understand. Finally, this last film for 2006 is alive for me this year: painful ...
