My God, what an amazing movie! He reminded me of a similar scene in Mel Gibson's "We were soldiers," when "the company is not lost, they're just cut off" And another scene in Pearl Harbor when the British officer says to Ben Affleck "If all Americans are like you and then God helps the nation who goes to war with America! <br /> <br /> Put all 3 movies together and you will have enough BULLSHIT to impregnate the entire Sahara. <br /> <br /> The history of the cut off battalion may be sufficiently real, but the film could be used without the American chauvinistic propaganda to which propaganda joined. In the above-mentioned scene in Pearl Harbor, there were groans) The Lost Battalion is really a class in itself. <br /> <br /> "Americans think they are unbeatable? "Actually, I cringed and fucking vomited, when all this leak was thrown by this polar disaster (the movie that is) <br /> <br /> The battle scenes were well done (3 stars for it), but if the script is manure and then even wrapped in bright ribbons, he is still manure, writer James Carabatsos also wrote these other screamers: Hamburger Hill, No Mercy, Heartbreak Ridge, someone, please, shoot him before he writes more of this trash. <br /> <br /> Director, Russell Mulcahy is also an Australian, God, shame !!!
