The only advantages of this movie are quite original death scenes. Besides, this movie is a big DUD. We have Kim Basinger, a beleaguered housewife who is slowly moving around in the local shopping center for the first 30 minutes. a movie that has not added anything. Then the movie is a bit up because it has a confrontation with 4 punks who took 2 parking spaces on this hard-working Christmas Eve. They start chasing her after releasing the local guard who tried to help her. From there, this movie gets worse, worse. I know it's just a movie and you have to go with the flow, but it's about 5 minutes. headstart, and she can not hide or find someone who could help her. Instead, he drives up to a partially built-up division next to the forest. In a typical way, she does everything she can to allow her followers to easily follow her. But now he turns into one hard mofu. You get a point. Under no circumstances can you buy or rent this movie no matter how much you like it. It is so illogical that you will question each scene. It's embarrassing for Basinger and Craig Sheffer and the rest of the cast as well as consumers.
