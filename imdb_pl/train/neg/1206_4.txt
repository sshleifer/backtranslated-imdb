This thought, which has long lost traffic, is sometimes available online. So I bought a copy for me. Well, of course, acting is terrible, and the plot is childish, but it has its moments. I think that people who have been looking for it also know its history. It was made by the owner of the grindhouse cinema for an extremely low budget. But for me it certainly did not spoil money for props, but for makeup. Make-up is for this kind of well-made movement. Zombies are observable and the blood is intact. The only problem with this type of film is the quality of the pelican. It's horrible, luckily you can not hear the buzz, but sometimes it's too dark. So you have to look clearly to see gore. In a funny way, they tried to sell this as not really for squeamish. At the beginning of the movie the voice of the narrator speaks of a sign and a man appearing with green flashes, which tells you that he is on his way up. Of course it does not work, it made me think of Cannibal Girls, I had this annoying bell when red things started flowing. They had an original idea, Cannibal Girls was created a year earlier. Do not go into the story, go to the zombies and notice the continuity error. When a girl and a guy love each other first, she takes her bra, then she loves each other and suddenly her underwear comes back ... try to do it, if I'm a bit offline, ... eat this ugly corpse
