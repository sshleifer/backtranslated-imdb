This movie made me feel like I had missed some important scenes from the very beginning. There were continuity errors and threads that stopped as suddenly as they started. I was very disappointed because I love Whoopi Goldberg & Danny Glover, except that I have always trusted and respected Danny Glover in his role choices, for example 'Grand Canyon'. I just could not finish this movie after what seemed like an eternity, but it probably was just over an hour; we had to turn it off. There was no comedy, there was nothing about characters that would make you feel sympathetic or sympathetic to them, there were no emotions associated with the movie, and the clips from their past were badly edited, confusing and unnecessary. What could be a great idea for a movie, even as a drama and not a comedy (although I think that comedy in this situation would be better, because I love watching white people going crazy and starting to behave like complete idiots, it makes me laugh) became a loss of my credit 1 $ in the video store.
