If you've ever seen Dukes of Hazard, you know that you never had to worry about drugs, curses or the primitive behavior that young children see. If you've seen a movie, you know it's not anymore! This movie was scary! The main characters who make drugs and think that it is funny and cool are certainly not what I call entertainment. They took a great show and they just turned it into rubbish. Daisy, who was a little coquettish in the original series, now looks and acts as if she belonged on the street corner paying for her services. I was so excited to see this movie before it appeared, 15 minutes after the film I was ready to leave. I stayed thinking that it must have been better, but instead it got worse and worse every minute. It is a pity that I have never seen this movie. I destroyed a good performance and left only a terrible taste in my mouth when I left. Do yourself a favor, see something worth your money, because it's not just a waste of money, but the loss of 2 hours of your life will never come back!
