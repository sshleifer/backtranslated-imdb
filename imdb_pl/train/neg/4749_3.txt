This movie was so badly written and directed that I fell asleep for 30 minutes in the film. Jokes in the film are trivial and although the story is interesting at certain angles, it is too far-reaching, and at some points is ridiculous. If you are 11 or older, you will miss writing in the movie and you will be disappointed, but if you are 10 years old or less, it is a movie that will attract your attention and be surprised by all stunts (which I can add that are badly made) and I wish you to be a warrior. The cast in this film was not very good, and the music was very disappointing because it was as if they were trying to increase the tension, but it did not fit at all. On a scale of 1-10 (10 is excellent, 1 awful), the acting in this film is 4. Brenda Song is talented in comedy, but with this kind of film, in some of the more serious scenes, her acting was ridiculous. When I was posing for a fight, I began to laugh loudly. I think the worst thing about this movie is definitely the direction, for example the part where her enemy turns out to be a bad villain, how her voice gets dark and angry, I think it was incredibly stupid and like Wendy's Teachers (Brenda Song) were her teachers at a school possessed by monks, which was quite funny. To sum it all, a disappointing movie, but good if you're 10 years old or younger.
