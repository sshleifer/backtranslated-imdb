We bought this series on DVD because of all the glowing reviews we've seen here. I gave him three stars because there is no doubt that sometimes acting, directing and writing are brilliant. In fact, they are so brilliant that we did not see any propaganda that was so smoothly broadcast in the series. If one looks at it with discernment, he will see the whole litany of radical right-wing beliefs promulgated by the Fox (Faux) News Network. To avoid distributing spoilers, I will refrain from pointing out all dozens of specific cases. A brief look at the plots found here on IMDb will reveal that everything, from torture, through gun control to the right to the network, to provide "infomercials" and to call them news, is motivated by cute twists and passionate speeches of some of the best actors in the world. We watched a lot of concerts and eventually gave up in disgust when they justify torture, using Attorney General Gonzalez as a great example of why all kinds of torture should be used in the name of protecting us all. The series also manages to humiliate male and female gays in a subtle way, using them as plot devices depicting bad people. In total, the full litany of the radical religious right. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, the popularity of this program will be used by future historians as proof that America has lost its way at the beginning of this century. As a history student, I would characterize the program as being in league with the propaganda produced by Goebbels for Hitler and part of the propaganda Hollywood produced for the American public during World War II. <br /> <br /> So if you want to use it as a teaching tool to help students understand how subtle propaganda can be at all costs. Remember to buy an inexpensive used copy to avoid enriching the ultra-rightists in Faux Network who have created this parody.
