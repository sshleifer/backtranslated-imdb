This movie was painful physically, maybe because (like many people my age and younger) I grew up with Dr. Seussem and I loved his books - both funny, wise, capricious and subversive. "The Cat in the Hat" draws all interest and spark from history, and the performance of Mike Myer as a cat is mostly stunning. Why an accent with a borscht stripe, unpleasant patter, inappropriate jokes, a magic costume? I had to go back and read the books again to see the real problem: the books are simple. This movie is OVERBLOWN and way too long. <br /> <br /> You do not expect any movie for children to be Toy Story or The Iron Giant, but this movie sets a new level. How did Mike Myers need money?
