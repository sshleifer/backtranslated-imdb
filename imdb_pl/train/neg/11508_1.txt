Whatever Guy Ritchie possessed to convert Wertmuller's film is incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> This new movie is a mess. When I saw her, there was one more person in the audience who left her for about an hour. (I hope she demanded a refund.) The only reason I stayed until the end was that I never left the movie. <br /> <br /> But I was sitting through this piece of garbage completely stunned that Madonna and Ritchie could think that they made a good movie. Dialogue is funny, acting is terrible, and the only nice thing about this movie is the scenery. Ritchie took Lina's film and changed it into another "Blue Lagoon". <br /> <br /> It's a movie you would not waste even watching Cinemax late at night. Time is too valuable to waste it on such nonsense.
