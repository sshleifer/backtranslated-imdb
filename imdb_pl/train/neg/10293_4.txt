My wife and I watch the movie every night without distractions, and mainly artistic films that require thinking. I have lots of patience for films that are slowly blooming. My wife has twice as much attention as I do. All this has been said - this film is just empty and NIGHT! It has not gone anywhere. He never blossomed. It started fairly well with a promising story ... then baked cookies ... goes to Spain ... she is sulking, she is looking ... the loans are rolling. Uneven, full of holes, false starts and dead ends. We have reviewed several of her subsequent sequences, staring into space. Artificial depth was suggested when playing with mud and cried. Zzzz ...... It's like a beautifully shot chick that pretends to be deep or artistic. You never know or understand Morvern. About halfway, you do not care anymore. We just wanted to see at least one of the feature lines. Do not waste time. I am shocked that it achieves such a high result.
