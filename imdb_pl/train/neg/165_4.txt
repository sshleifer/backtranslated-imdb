Although it is early to say how the series evolves, I can say that the pilot was smaller than I thought it would be. However, there is still potential for the series. Of course, when I saw the Voyager for the first time, I thought it also had potential - but it was very disappointed. My premonition tells me that the Enterprise will not be as bad as Voyager. <br /> <br /> Regarding the pilot's impressions ... <br /> <br /> The pilot had some good ideas and he was good at themes. I liked the introduction. The initial performances of the series were interesting, with the progress of the search and a matching theme song. Scott Bakula copes perfectly well in the role of captain. <br /> <br /> Where I was weak, to a large extent this story did not have the "feeling" of going on a great adventure. The story of the episode itself was a more "general" Trek tale with the topics of "exploration" and "the first step towards the cosmos", and only a subordinate thread and subtext. If you had to edit the references to being the first mission in space, the plot would be difficult to distinguish between Enterprise, TOS or TNG eras. The central thread did not reflect or convey the great theme of the series. <br /> <br /> The plot of the first mission would be big enough without "action". Instead of individual references to the novelty of exploration, they could have been history. Get a little more nostalgia and philosophy about it (oh, for a TV program that will once again make us THINK). Let us experience the excitement of "the wind" and being on the "sea" instead of distracting us with rescue and a lot of shooting. There was too much shooting. <br /> <br /> We had the impression that people are "the first" in a fixed school. New children in the block, as opposed to setting off into the unknown universe. Unfortunately, Klingons landed on our doorstep, and we did not find them. This meeting could have been much more historical and much more sociological. How do two such different societies interact? Do not just suggest it, SHOW! <br /> <br /> I had to think about it more as "Trek with accredited crew and limited technology" as opposed to "first bold steps into the unknown". I wanted to see something new and fresher. The series promises to be a new concept, but so far I have not seen this new, great concept. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I will say that the series has potential. There are several interesting characters. Bakula is wonderful. Blalock has potential. The general theme is the most interesting since we saw Kirk in the world before Apollo 11 for the first time. If only future episodes give justice to this wonderful and wonderful topic, we will have a show that will create new legends. <br /> <br /> You shoot an arrow in the air ... Good luck, Captain Archer. <br /> <br /> For producers: TAKE MORE RISK AND MAKE US * THOUGHT *! :-)
