"Dahmer" is an interesting movie, although I would not use a "horror movie" or "thriller" to describe it. It is rather a study of a character who seems to sympathize with the killer. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Renner portrays the serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, who drugged, murdered and dismembered his male victims. The film focuses on the relationship between Dahmer and "Rodney", played well by Artel Kay√†r. <br /> <br /> Rodney is an almost more interesting character: in love with Dahmer and once escaped the attack, returns to Dahmer for sex and experiences a second attack. <br /> <br /> I think the movie is chaotic because it does not show much about Dahmer's years, how events could create a human monster that we see on the screen, and does not give an insight into Dahmer's belief that he could create sexual the zombies of their victims. <br /> <br /> the roles are well played, but the story is thin.
