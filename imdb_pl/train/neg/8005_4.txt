Gwoemul (Host) - Due to the pollution of the Han River, the mutated beast is going crazy. The youngest member of the Park family is kidnapped by the beast, and the rest of her family must find her before she becomes the last meal of the beast. <br /> <br /> First of all, I love monster movies: mutated bears, bulky alligators, Komodo's dragon packets of predators, a whole lot. Characteristics of creatures is my favorite kind of horror. So I really wanted to like the host, but it was not like that. <br /> <br /> There are three main problems: <br /> <br /> The first one can be seen after a quick view of the page IMDb <br /> <br /> Genre: Akcja / Komedia / Drama / Fantasy / Horror / Sci-Fi / Thriller <br /> <br /> Too many damn species. He took the comedy too seriously, yet he was too reckless to have any real message (though he seemed to be trying to make some kind of statement. Counteracting pollution, anti-American or anti-government). The drama was poorly placed and confused in misleading mish-mash with all other styles. <br /> <br /> Secondly, after the initial attack of the monster, nothing happens for almost the entire movie. The central family is about looking for their own, while the governments of Korea and America apparently do nothing. And all this, they just wander, occasionally hitting each other, presumably for a bit of comedic relief. This lack of action caused that my attention wandered and apparently did the same for the director, because the entire story lines were not resolved (the mystery invented by the bad Americans is completely forgotten and never solved). br /> Finally, the movie is awkwardly political. This makes Americans stupid and angry, but they do not give us American characters with more depth than cartoon villains. The opening scene has the most obvious stupid American and wise Korean moment. With a Korean mortuary assistant asking his boss, the coroner, not to pour chemicals into the Han River. The American coroner is almost maniacal when he orders the assistant to continue. He is a racist, he is lazy filming and there is no excuse for it. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, the monster is good, the kind of mix The Relic and Deep Rising. Some of the effects of the movement are quite cool, and the initial pursuit of the monster in the park is great fun. There are also cool shots in the film. Some of them, oddly enough, remind me of the way of filming Firefly (camera shake, sharpening photos, etc.). At the end there is also a nice scene in which the hero and the little boy he saved reside in a mobile food stand. It is night and the snow is falling, the street lamp emits cold light, but the food stand has a warm glow coming from it. <br /> <br /> In general, I was very disappointed with this film. I was looking forward to a decent creature and I am getting a bit of a pseudo-political, horror comedic solid instead. Looking at comments on IMDb, I can not help but think that if it was production in the US, it would be planned. Just because it's a movie does not mean it's good. In recent years there have been great films from Korea (for example, the trilogy of revenge and the Brotherhood), but it certainly is not one of them. <br /> <br /> I support a remake for the first time. Tighten the direction, improve the script and it could have been a nice movie. In fact, it is not worth a few hours someone's time.
