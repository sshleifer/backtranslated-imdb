I have never been impressed by JD, and Final Justice (which I have not seen before the MST3k broadcast) turns out to be no exception. It's not that the character is less sympathetic than Mitchell: he is just less than Geronimo ("Call me" Heronimo "), not to like. <br /> <br /> In fact, you can suspect that Mitchell and Final Justice were all plans of Agent Joe Don's revenge trying to kill the "star" by triggering a heart attack. <br /> <br /> Joe Don had to find a new agent because he now finished "comic relief" in James Bond films. The problem is that it's hard to distinguish his comedy characters from his "serious" characters in action movies like this . <br /> <br /> When it comes to the plot ... .umm, what plot? They repeat the same songs so often that you think you watched Groundhog Day 2. It's probably a comical relief to use the same Geronimo scene coming out of jail. Ummm, yes, whatever. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, the scenery of Malta is quite great, so I threw it to 2. One suspects this fiction Lick Set Maltese tourism for several decades.
