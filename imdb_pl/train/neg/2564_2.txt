When I go to see the movies, I will stay on my feet and look at it, and if I do not like it, I will go to sleep, but it was pure nonsense, I actually got up and left! I hated it together. Besides, they should not have taken Brendan Frasier, he was much better. It was not as good as I expected, given that I really liked George from The Jungle 1, and the graphics were not as good as the first, for example, a bird, and when it ever crashed in a tree. I hope the director will take care of it, and the next films he makes will have to rethink ... terrible! I would really like to give Ursla a job well done, because she made the film worthwhile (until I left) ... generally I give this film 2 out of 10
