Repetitive music, annoying narration, terrible cinematographic effects. Half the plot seemed to focus on shock value, and the other half seemed to focus on calming the crowd who would complain to people to start the fight. <br /> <br /> One of the best scenes was in the "removed scene", the one in which the rules with my mother are in the office. I do not understand why they did it. The film seemed to be desperate to pay attention to everything that he could, and Domino talked about sororities would be the highlight of the movie. <br /> <br /> The funny work with the camera reminds MTV and it is not necessary or helpful for the film. Accelerate the movie to skip many things and rotate the camera around something that has repeatedly grown old during the first use. It's as if the directors want to use all the extra material they did not want to throw away. <br /> <br /> Another movie with Jerry Springer? That should tell me not to watch it from the preview. <br /> <br /> Popular movie for the "w" crowd.
