Yes, right. <br /> <br /> I spent the first hour patiently waiting for the movie. It was terribly boring and consisted mainly of people riding randomly over the hills without any visible direction. Then the hero appears in the picture. He was born as an Asian, but when he grew up, he became white. White, of course. He was not even close to moving to Asia. He looked like Justin Timberlake. It was very distracting, and history did nothing to help the case. Pointless sequences of battles and lame dialogue. It was an hour and forty-five minutes, and at the end I tried to eat my own face. I watched this because people in the video store I work in always ask me if this movie is good. Now I have an answer. It looks something like this: ahem. "NO! GOOD GOD NO! IS DANGEROUS! Do not do it for yourself!
