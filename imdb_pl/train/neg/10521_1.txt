This movie is a terrible waste of time. Although it is only an hour and a half, it seems to be close to 4. I have never seen a movie moving so slowly and without a goal. It is also a movie of "horror", which takes a lot of time during the day. My friend and I have laughed a crazy number of times when we were probably afraid. <br /> <br /> The only thing we want to know is why such a horrible movie has been released in many countries. Demand can not be so high. <br /> <br /> Supermodel Nicole Petty should stick to modeling, because although she is beautiful, she has lost her accent so many times in this film, half the cases are British and half are American.
