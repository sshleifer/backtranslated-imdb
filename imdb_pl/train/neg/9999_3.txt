This is a movie that my enemies describe all the time, but this is not true. I only watch it once in a while to make sure it's as bad as it seemed. <br /> <br /> A gangster kidnapped a Boeing 747. (At least an upgrade to Boeing has kidnapped a large portion of the Pentagon.) The aircraft descends into a Bermuda triangle and submerges under pressure as a kind of post-facto submarine. <br /> <br /> He has one of those stars. , stars falling or barely above the horizon. <br /> <br /> "We are alone!" says pilot Jack Lemon. He is right. Except for George Kennedy. It is in all these catastrophic films. <br /> <br /> Watch a different movie instead. Oh, not the "airport" original. This is not good either. Instead, watch a decent movie about stuck aircraft, such as "Flight of the Phoenix".
