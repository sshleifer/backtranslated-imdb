I was expecting something from "K-911", i.e. it looked like a sweet movie that I could get into. I've always loved comedy movies for dogs. But it looked like it was Jame's movie, not Jerry Lee's. The plot was pretty bad, and these two love really did not have chemistry. Not to mention the fact that James had a total sexist view in the film, even though the writer was not heading in that direction. James just really chose me for over half the movie. The dogs were real stars and it is very sad that the actors jumped out of them. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad that it's not just me on IMDb, I agree that it was quite a stupid movie. But hopefully James will realize that his brother Jim was talented, without offense, but not everyone can be their stars. Do not you want Ashlee Simpson to use the same advice? : D <br /> <br /> 3/10
