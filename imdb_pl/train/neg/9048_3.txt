Originally aired as a movie of the ABC week. This applies to two young, innocent college students who go to a POW camp in a small southern city. No phone calls are allowed and no one knows they are there. There is rape, torture, beating, humiliation and humiliation, which leads to a very worrying conclusion. <br /> <br /> The TV version was (for now) bleak. No nudity and beating were quite tame, but the general sense of disgust bore one. The unrated version is even worse - there is abundance of nudity, violence is extreme and in one particularly disgusting sequence we see a crying prisoner forced to undress, while a lesbian guard "uses" her. YUCK! There is nothing wrong with operating movies, but this one just crosses the border. You get the impression that the filmmakers like it when these poor women are tortured and humiliated - everything is pushed into your face, as if you were to enjoy it. A useless ending does not help. <br /> <br /> I give him 3, because the game is good - but it actually hinders watching the movie. A sick, dingy movie. Do not recommend.
