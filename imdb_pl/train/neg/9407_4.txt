"Houseboat Horror" is often considered the worst Australian movie ever made and is featured as a typical Slasher movie that included the promotion of "See a movie that can not win an Oscar". death by a burned maniac when they try to shoot a music video on a distant lake in the Australian province. Recently a slasher flick acted and wrote with zero tension and annoying figures. the throats are cut, and the woman is killed by the horseshoe. If you like bad movies, you can try this but you have been warned. At least it is better than the Swedish "The Bleeder". 4 out of 10.
