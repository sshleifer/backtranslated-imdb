A scandalously tacky karate / horror thriller with lots of graphically bloody violence and unreasonable nudity and a completely ridiculous and bizarre "conspiracy." This is low quality and low quality entertainment, which will appeal only to viewers with particularly perverse tastes, but it is a bit cheerful and I must admit that while watching I was not bored ...
