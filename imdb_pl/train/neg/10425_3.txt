This movie is great, remember - but only in the way it tells a very bad story. Stella is so terribly primitive and she never learns better. Her husband is incredibly snobbish and has a limited mind. None of them is learning better. Is it realistic? Somehow Stella understands that her daughter is ashamed of her gaudy manners and attire, but can not understand that she just has to calm everything down? I do not think so. Stella is a GOOD woman and VERY GOOD mother. Abandoning myself so that her daughter could be associated with a group of bigoted snobs is disgusting. <br /> <br /> Much of what we see may have been normal in those days - people drinking beer or two, enjoying the piano, dancing - but it turns out that this is a kind of moral inferiority. "I can not live our child like this!" Save me. <br /> <br /> This story tells me that an unwashed working class can never aspire to the heights of higher classes. And it's just a load of tissue paper.
