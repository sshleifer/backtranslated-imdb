Director Spike Lee is famous for making movies that point to racism. In many movies, such as "Do The Right Thing", most white people are violent racists. In this film, the subject is interracial marriage, and racism is the whole again. <br /> <br /> However, what Lee does once again demonstrates his fanaticism against Christianity. These are amazing double standards existing in the world of film. If Lee or anyone else created this kind of prejudice against another group, he would be vilified, but Christians? Hey, there's an "open season" on them. <br /> <br /> Ossie Davis, the reverend in this film, shoots his son and then puts down the smoldering pistol on his Bible. They magnify it for another close-up, in case you miss it. Hey, people, here's another Bible reader and look how he is! Lee does it in almost every movie he does. <br /> <br /> It shows the same hatred when dealing with racial relationships. Who could argue with the presentation of racism as bad? However, Lee fixes this in this movie, as in other movies. His obvious bitterness to white people does not help the situation. It only adds fuel to the fire. <br /> <br /> Hey, Spike: start "doing well" and leave your prejudices in the closet. Better yet, "give it a rest." <br /> <br /> This is too bad, because the subject could be a film provoking thinking, if it was done with objectivity and intelligence.
