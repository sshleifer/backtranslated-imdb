Is it just me or is this kid really annoying? <br /> <br /> Sister Hideos spends most of his time running around disobedient little and so. As for him, I know he is a child, but his acting skills are as wooden as a dead tree. So far, I'm only halfway and I'm fascinated by this story, but people in it have failed, I just hope that at the end it will be better, because I do not know what it's all about. Although, some supposedly mysterious messages in the scribble on the wall and notebook indicate that everything is back, i.e. Dog is God, Evil lives etc. etc. seems a bit obvious now, but no one mentions its obvious meaning ( So far) If my opinion changes at the end of the movie, I will update this post, but if you read this, it's okay ...... See the above statement.
