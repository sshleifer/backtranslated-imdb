Three Russian aristocrats absorb the decadence of Monte Carlo, despite having the last franc. To support their rich lifestyle, the three use the services of a forger and use notes in casinos, hoping to exchange the counterfeit currency for the jackpot. Andrew Hughes, an American envoy, arrives in Monaco with his wife Helena, and the three decide to make friends with the guests, hoping for financial help. One of the three Russians, Count Sergiusz Karamzin, plans to go further, with a constant move towards Helena, disappointing the servant of the count who loves Sergius. Eventually, the circumstances play against three aristocrats. It is obvious that Von Stroheim tried to convey the message (with the stupidity of American women and inappropriate behaviors of aristocrats), instead of telling a story, and the film can really bore the modern public, just like me, easily. Even acting, which is great in later Evs, such as Greed and Wedding Marches, is here. The film could use improvements at various levels. Rating, 3.
