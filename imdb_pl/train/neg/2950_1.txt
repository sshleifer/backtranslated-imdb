I watched this movie when Joe Bob Briggs hosted Monstervision on TNT. Even he could not make this movie enjoyable. The only reason I watched him to the end is that I'm teaching film production and I wanted to make sure that my students never did anything so bad ... but it took all my intestinal prowess. It's like watching your great-grandmother flirting with a 15-year-old boy ... terribly painful. <br /> <br /> If you took the right movie, dumped it in a thinner, and then watched it, it would be more entertaining. Seriously. <br /> <br /> If you see this movie in a S-Mart trash bin, move away from it as if it were a rattlesnake.
