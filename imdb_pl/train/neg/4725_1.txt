A great opportunity for director Indy to create an interesting film about rock music on the verge of fame. It could be a decent movie if he coped with the traumatic past of John Livien and tortures his psyche. Instead, it's a funny attempt to identify the life of John Livien with John Lennon. John Lennon's mother suicid was John Lennon and she wanted him to become as powerful and prolific as Lennon himself. Instead of focusing on John Lennon's musical brilliance and his great ability to reveal himself to others in order to learn something about their own lives, it turned out that Lennon's legacy is a confused drug-addicted soul who should consider himself God instead of a man. I'm a big fan of John Lennon and this movie reminded me of another "crazy" obsessive person about Lennon, Lennon's killer, Mark David Chapman. Lennon was a man who was brutally murdered by someone who had an identity crisis with Lennon. Do we have to remember this? John Lennon gave so much to the world with his music and honesty, and I rejected the view of another embarrassed person as the main character in this film possessed by Lennon, and I did not show the world his beautiful contribution. Yoko Ono graciously honored John Lennon's memory by making a monument in Central Park to give his fans a chance to pay their respects and remember John. Instead, the director of the movie decided to use this site to let the killer try to commit suicide. I found it so disturbing and disrespectful to Lennon's memory. He was a man of peace who died a brutal, senseless death, and seeing such violence near this place seemed like a re-awful morning for every fan of Lennon. It ruined the movie completely. It could have been a decent movie, but I had a bitter taste in my mouth. Let John Lennon and his family rest in peace and do not remember his brutal murder through this irresponsible movie.
