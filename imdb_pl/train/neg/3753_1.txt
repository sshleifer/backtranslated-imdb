Because of the strike, the Writers Guild of America in 1988 had to shoot this episode within three days. It is quite nonsense, consisting of repeating cuts + pasted clips from season 2 and was described by the writer Maurice Hurley as "terrible, just terrible". <br /> <br /> Why producers could not just wait to do something decent, who knows. I'm guessing that because of the strike there was not enough money to spend only an episode of retrospection, or maybe Roddenberry was too sick to veto this half-career. This episode also marks the final performance of Diana Muldaur (Dr. Katherine Pulaski) in the series.
