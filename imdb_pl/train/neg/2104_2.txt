I bought this movie in Walmart's 1-dollar basket. I think I overpayed !!! In the 1940s, Bela Lugosi made a long series of films with 3 stakes for small studios (in this case, Monogram - those who made most of the Bowry Boys films). While the misery of most of these films does not come close to the horror level that his latest films have achieved (Ed Wood's classics, such as the Monster Bride and Plan 9 from outer space), they are still weak films and should be avoided by all but the most ardent fans. <br /> <br /> I am an old movie junkie, so I tried it. In addition, a few of these smaller films were really quite good - just not this one. <br /> <br /> Lugosi is a crazy scientist who wants to keep his bizarre and brutal wife using the serum he invents from young brides. They never really explained WHY it must have been a bride or why they must be women and even what kind of illness his wife was - so you can see that the plot was never really mixed up. <br /> <br /> A really annoying reporter (Lois Lane type without Jimmy Olsen or Superman) wants to get to the bottom of all these apparent murders in which the bodies were STOLEN! He follows the directions to the Lugosi threshold. Lugosi's house is full of his crazy wife, assistant and two strange people who apparently are the sons of an assistant (an ugly hunchback devil of sex and a dwarf). Naturally, this crazy reporter faints repeatedly throughout the film - apparently narcolepsy and good investigative journalism go hand in hand! Ultimately, all maniacs die - mainly because of their own hands and everything is fine. At the end, the reporter and the doctor she just met decided to get married. And of course, the stupid reporter's cameraman faints when it happens. If you have not noticed, there is a lot of fainting in this movie. Or maybe because it was a slow and heavy movie, they just fell asleep!
