At the beginning I would like to say that I am a fan of the American Pie series. Although "bare mile" and this one is the worst, this one seems to be the downfall of the whole series. <br /> <br /> First of all, the best part of the movie was that it was an American Pie movie that is always appreciated. <br /> <br /> However, there are a lot of bad things in this movie. First of all, history has a very outdated "arched" structure. First of all, there is the introduction of heroes, and then pledging the beta home and finally the Greek Olympics. Each of them has exactly 25 minutes in length. In addition to the general plot corruption, there is no character development that is double in the bad story. <br /> <br /> Besides, I really did not like stereotypes in this film. That is, showing jockeys as extremely cool guys thinking only about sex and clearly showing the freaks as inferior. In addition, it shows females only as sexual objects, and men only want to treat women as sexual objects. <br /> <br /> Besides, acting was also weak. Perhaps with the exception of Steve Talley. <br /> <br /> So, in general, a horrible movie if seen from a critical point of view. If you look at it from the point of view of teenagers, it's probably better, but in most countries this movie is rated at 18+, so it should not be watched by minors.
