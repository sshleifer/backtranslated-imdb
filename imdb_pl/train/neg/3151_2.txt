"It must have been you" is another sign that Hollywood is running out of ideas. This picture concerns Charlie Hudson, a former policeman who became the author. When Charlie's fiance leaves the city, he got stuck with the whole wedding plan. He spends a week in an elegant hotel and meets Anna Penn, a teacher who is just getting married. They both quickly become friends and plan their weddings together. That's when the story becomes boring, Charlie falls in love with Anna and must choose between safe life and Charlie. This movie breaks up all romantic comedies that have ever been made and is waiting for the end of the movie so you can do something different. Micahel Vartan and Natasha Henstridge give really average performances that make this movie even more challenging to watch.
