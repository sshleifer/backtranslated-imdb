OK and a friend rented it a few days ago because we like to follow b movies because we make them ourselves. In any case, the cover contained blood and strange-looking naked girls with fangs and other things ... and Tom Savini! There is no way that this movie will fail! Well? wrong!! It's just such a waste! There really was no story, the window was terrible (is there anyone there?), The characters were ... well, they really lacked any personality ... The effects were terrible ... and what about them long artistic shots of frightened people running around nothing not doing ... with extreme eye close ups and so on? We sat in the whole movie, waiting for something ... whatever happens ... but no ... "oh, nymphs are here! Great! Oh ... they kiss ... again ... and now violence! OK. ... nothing really happens ... again ... oh, they're running now ... and eye-close ... again ... oh, heres Tom Savini! Oh ... he's dead ... alright ... OK, maybe now something cool and even interesting will happen ... no ... oh cool! Severed head! End ... oh bullshit ... "And finally, since I am so full of myself .. I will tell you that! Give me a van, six actors, a strange-looking home, Tom Savini, a couple of naked girls with fangs and buckets of blood, and I could do the coolest movie you've ever seen ... I've made zero-budget movies in two days, which has better results, better action and better scenario than this ... what does this guy from Johannes do? Creating cool movies is easy! It could have been so great ... I'm really upset !!
