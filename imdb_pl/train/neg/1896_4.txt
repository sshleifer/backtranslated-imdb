This movie shows us nothing original. Each idea or scene (action) can be found in many previously released movies. Great Nick here is completely simple. Even Will Patton is calm, angry and good. Mr. Duvall is fine, but he has a very small part. Like Angelina, so how can we define her new fame? There are generally too many characters, so no one and nothing is particularly detailed. This makes the film easy to forget. It's a pity, do not you think?
