This film is to be held in Seattle and the surrounding area. Why is Porteau Cove Park P-R-O-V-I-N-C-I-A-L shown? Provincial parks are located in CANADA, not in the United States. The inspector uses the Palm Pilot with a stylus to "read" that someone broke into the honeymoon store computer. I did not know that this is possible using a database storage device. The woman appears in the film without any introduction and never introduces it. In the middle of the movie, we learn that this woman works in the district attorney's office. Then, in the correction center, the guard actually gives Jenks through the door and keeps his back to the perpetrator! NEVER, this would not happen in a real corrective environment. The director really came up with this - it's not happening in real life. Operation is sufficient. The plot is good. Cinematography is good. However, many errors found in continuity lead to 3 out of 10 votes.
