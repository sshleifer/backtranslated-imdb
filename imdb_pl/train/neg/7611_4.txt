First watched 28.02.2006 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Sydney Pollack): - DVD version, which I watched under the title "3 days of condor" - So the CIA drama full of relaxed performances, making the movie very loose. The story is based on approximately 7 out of 8 members of the CIA research group killed with the figure of Robert Redford, codename = Condor, which was left behind. Who killed them and why? It is Redford who tries to learn, trying not to be the eighth victim. Along the way, he engages the engaged character Faye Dunaway, initially because he needs a place to hide, and then helps him after a short time of love. This is one of a handful of innocent guys in stories, but this one does not have much tension. Flat performance does not help, and the finish does not close the offer to the public. Despite the good director at Sydney Pollack and a group of classic performers, history and performances are not what they should be, which is why film is not what it should be.
