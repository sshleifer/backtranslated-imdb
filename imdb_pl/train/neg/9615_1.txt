It seems obvious from this adaptation that he did not. He not only left the story, but also invented his own! The things he chose were so unbelievably incredible that I was happy that he decided to skip some of the most important parts of the novel. The plot was foggy, inconsistent and uncertain. I do not want to say anything bad about actors, but they can not work! Of course, Dickens is difficult, but it's pathetic! Micawber was nothing more than Kramer from the mid-nineteenth century, and the less he said about Betsy Trotwood the better! If you want to see a real Copperfield, watch a great adaptation of the 1999 BBC. As for the screenwriter, I think he read Cliff's notes!
