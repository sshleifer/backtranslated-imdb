"The Bank" (1915, Chaplin) "The Bank" was one of Essanay Charlie's 1915 films. While these groups of movies are more enjoyable than their counterparts from 1914, this movie seems a bit below average. Kneblik with a double vault with a combi lock and a difficult ending in which Charlie wakes up from sleep, in which he strokes the hair of a lead lady, only the mop head, which he used as a quasi pillow, is Chaplin's classic moments. Both are ironically the beginning and the end. The middle is filled with battles against the competing janitor and breaking the bank robbery to win the girl. The mop is probably the biggest physical prop in this movie, and Charlie uses it to get the comedy effect, whether it's the intention of his character or not. The mop seems to be Charlie's alter ego, doing things he would like to do, but he would not do it with his own hands. Interesting things, but it's better.
