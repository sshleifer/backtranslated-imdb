Instead, go to the zoo, buy some peanuts and feed them to the monkeys. Monkeys are funny. People with amnesia who do not speak much, they just sit with empty eyes, they are not that funny. <br /> <br /> Black comedy? There is no black person in it and there is not one funny thing in it. <br /> <br /> Walmart somehow buys these things and puts them in the rack for dollars. It is marked as No rating. I think they took out the topless scene. They could also take out other things, who knows? We only know that whatever they took away is gone. <br /> <br /> Acting seemed fine. There are many unfathomable things. This is supposed to be a city? This is supposed to be a big lake? If the church is so hot, people are fanning, why are all wearing coats?
