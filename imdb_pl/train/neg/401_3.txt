That's what I said every time in the incredibly inept third act of this apologizing justification for the movie. First of all, the computer effects are absolutely stunning! These computer wizards really deserve to be patted on the back. The rest of the movie, though ... <br /> <br /> None of the characters work in a realistic way, especially in the mentioned vile third act (I promise not to give it back, but trust me, it's not worth keeping a secret!). Lots of laughter in the movie comes unintentionally, for example, when they try to explain that the eyelids of an invisible man do not work. Please give viewers more recognition than this! <br /> <br /> Some sexual aspects of the film were interesting. After all, what would you do if you were invisible? Nobody will catch you! These issues were discussed more intelligently in the classic "Invisible Man from 1933". There is one scene of violence in particular, which is so ambiguous and is not mentioned even once. If more attention was paid to it, the crazy scientist Kevin Bacon could have some more sense. <br /> <br /> The film would be much more successful as a pornography, because the premise could be realized in a unique and interesting way. But this job ... go see something else. Or not and live with the consequences! <br /> <br /> 3/10
