Okay, let me break it for you ... It's terrible! <br /> <br /> If Roger Kumble did such a sophisticated work on the first cruel intentions, why did he do such a bad job. I'm sorry, but this movie is stupid, right, maybe it would improve if his show was ever released, but let's be realistic ... this movie is a crock! Many bad actions * NOTE Scene with shower * "Kissing Cousins" ?????? What is this line? "Slipers when it's wet" ?????????? Can we say DUH-M! This movie had an effort, I'll give it to you, but it was too stupid! They even tried to make it funny, giving home servants stupid accents that are actually ... NOT FUNNY! It was pathetic. Not to mention that everyone looked absolutely NIC like an original cast. It's as if they intentionally or otherwise looked different! I like to watch them when I'm really on board, which does not happen from time to time. For those of you who liked it ... Okay, what were you thinking about? Could you choose this movie over the other one who had a great acting and fantastic Sarah Michelle Gellar? The film is golden if it has Sarah Michelle Gellar, DUH! But this movie is not, without offense, Amy Adams. Oh, yes, since when does Sebastain have a heart ????? UGH!
