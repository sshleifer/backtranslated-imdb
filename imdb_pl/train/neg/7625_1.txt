This is your only warning against the spoiler. What a sad state of our cinema, when such unprofessional trash is considered "worthy of an Oscar". <br /> <br /> Divide the material into three levels. The first is a scenic theater. Here, the viewer is in stagnation, and the power rests in the actor's presentation and, most importantly, in the writer's power. A good playwright is better than a good screenwriter because he knows the ways of words better. The best playwrights know how to create images that the barren scene can not show. <br /> <br /> The second level is a movie. You can use a weaker writer in this medium, but the viewer does not sit in one place all the time. In the film context can take on the features of visual poetry and meaning in addition to strong writing. In addition, the film can manipulate elements of the day, such as sound and color, in an almost surrealistic way. <br /> <br /> The last level is literature. In this context, everything is imagined by the author, translated into paper, and then re-imagined by the reader. Much more detail can be a novel than in a movie studio. <br /> <br /> That's why adaptations can go up, but never down. The revisions are never better than the base movie (see dimes at the local book store), while the movie can not transmit the same power as the original book (Catch-22 and WP). Movies can rarely be played, and playback can always be made in movies. <br /> <br /> When it comes to "The Last Picture Show", it fails. This is a movie that should stay on stage because the director is too stupid to do something good. Characters say the same thing and behave the same way, it's pure aimlessness. Add an unpleasant soundtrack to it, and you have a movie that you can not watch. <br /> <br /> I saw this in my high school class with about 20 other would-be thespians. The instructor was amazed at how sad the movie was. The sad thing is that such stagnation is depressing when the material itself is funny. If it were in color, impotence scenes, pool parties and an old whore would be considered a great comedy. Look what Lucas did with American Graffiti a few years later. <br /> <br /> The American secondary school system must start to learn About the film, instead of trying to teach with the movie. Two visually powerful downbeat movies: Apocalypse Now and Barry Lyndon. Rely on them, not on that. This is the "Last" that I want to see. 1 out of 5.
