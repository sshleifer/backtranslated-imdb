This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! It's bad, even in television standards. The plot is diabolically flawed, and the famous names in this movie are wasted on lost, uncertain characters. I do not know how the director managed to keep this excuse of the film together - it is so bad. Billed as "Thriller's Psychological Horror," it is certainly terrifying. There is nothing exciting about it. And it can harm you psychologically! The initial opening scenes had such a promise - it would be possible to deal with whether the soul is just an aspect of the brain, but the total mess that followed the car accident is unbelievable. No matter how hard you try, do not worry about the heroes. There are so many sprinkled ideas that the film is, at best, a collage of unrelated phrases from Chinese philosophers, and in the worst case scenario the film will actually make you go to Brain Dead! <br /> <br /> I have bought over 300 movies on DVD, and this is FIRST, for which I am to recover my money. STEER CLEAR.
