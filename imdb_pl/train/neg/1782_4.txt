The charming boy and his mother move to the nowhere city, cats and death soon after them. This sums up. <br /> <br /> I admit I'm a little scared by cats after watching this movie. But in all seriousness, despite the many things that are wrong in this movie, and believe me that there are a lot of things like that, generally speaking, it is a very pleasant experience. <br /> <br /> Characters are more like caricatures here, with their basic instincts. Fear, greed, pride or anger seem to be what motivates these people. Although it can be argued that this apparent defeat actually serves to tell stories. The supernatural assumption and the fact that it is a scenario of Stephen King (not that I have something specific against Mr. King) are quite nicely supported by interesting FX works, makeup and quite appropriate music. The absolute gem of this film is undoubtedly Alice Krige, who plays Mary Brady, an unearthly mother. <br /> <br /> King manages to make a simple story of an outsider or people who are a little different (alright - and a lot in this case), trying to match and transform into a campaign over a little gem of horror, which must be in the collection of every fan of horror films.
