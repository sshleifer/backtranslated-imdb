5 minutes after this movie I was hyperventilating, shivering and seeing pain. And not in a good way. The story is about a group of idiotic children who make telephone jokes to a psychologist, which is always a good idea. It turns out that psychos do not like witty phones, because in 2 minutes they are at their door killing poor mother and dad Williams. Go back 15 years and guess what? The phone still rings to people. Yes, you would think that a horrible murder would discourage them from never doing it again, but not. So after about two hours and too many screams I realized that this movie gave me nothing but a terrible taste in my mouth and a strong desire to take my life. This piece of shit is not even worth laughing at from the trashy production, the "acting" or shrinking career of Rutger Haurs. I love bad horror movies, but this is the most unsatisfying piece I've ever seen. Just do not.
