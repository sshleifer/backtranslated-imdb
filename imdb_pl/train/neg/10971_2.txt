How Irish critics rave about this movie is beyond me. Abused by an ordinary group of Irish actors pulled on every Irish film. A horrible script, with forced character quirks (brown sauce). Romanticizing everything that is bad in Dublin. The attitude "ah, this is a dump, but it's definitely not great." Lots of interesting facts only for the American audience (the supermarket manager and his awfully forced password). And the nail in the coffin was Colme Meaney's character. A great actor forced to play the part that a five-year-old could write. Useful things. The best thing about this movie is Farrell and it's bad when you have to say it. Well, at least he did not put on a terrible American accent. We warn the international audience: stay at home and watch Snatch and Lock Stock. You will have a better time. The break is external
