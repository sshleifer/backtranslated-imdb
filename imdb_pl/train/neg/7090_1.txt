At 19:35, I fell asleep on the couch before evening, watching Larry Sanders (usually DirecTivo, but not last night). I woke up at 3 a.m. (invasive banker on the west coast) and was fascinated by seeing it on HBO2. I was shocked at how poor this "movie" was. Seriously. thrilled. So shocked that I had to write a commentary on iMDB. This is really very bad. writing is boring, but directing and editing are simply below the level of the first year at the film school. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a film made. Remember that it is recorded on VIDEO, not on DIGITAL VIDEO. It looks like a soap opera. Clips from skateboard movies have a more "film" character for them than the horror movie. <br /> <br /> I wanted to describe poor directing, but honestly I can not remember. Arrows and blocking are stupid. yes, I chose the word "stupid". not unconventional, not bold, not bold, not boring, just stupid. I know that people reviewing this review will say, 'give me an example'. I can not. It was 3am. but believe me, I know you will look at it anyway, you will be attracted by terrible reviews. <br /> <br />
