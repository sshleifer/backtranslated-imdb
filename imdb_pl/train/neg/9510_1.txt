Sugar & Spice is one of the worst films of 2001. The film tries to cross Heathers and bring it to fruition. When I saw in January last year, I was so disgusted with the movie that I went and talked on a mobile phone with my girlfriend for the last half hour of the movie. I heard that the DVD has a director's cutout, maybe I'll check it, but this PG-13 junk movie is s *** and the worst kind of ***. Maybe if the movie had any T & A that would make everything ok. But the gags are lame, and the acting is terrible. Worse than Troma's film.
