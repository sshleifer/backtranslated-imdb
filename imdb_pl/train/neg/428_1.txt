Wow, a NYC politics film apparently written by someone who has never set foot in New York. You know that there is a problem when at some point you expect the credits to shed, and the movie will continue for another half hour. The characters are boring, the accent of John Cusack is funny, and the thread behaves between boring and funny. Scary Movie.
