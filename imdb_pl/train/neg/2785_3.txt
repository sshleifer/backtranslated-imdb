I know that some films (I mean European films) that are very bad films are considered by some critics as great cinema, just because they are non-American. I saw the result of 8.1 IMDB for this film and I noticed that it was chosen for some big festivals. Do not be fooled! Unless you're one of those people who like such disgusting movies, and then call it great art, skip it! The film contains one funny scene after the other (a similar Italian movie fell into my mind, a terrible PREFERISCO IL RUMORE DEL MARE (I prefer the sounds of the sea)). The problem with these movies is that they are not only boring, just like other weirdly praised movies, but they almost act like a camp. I mean, let's face it, acting is awful (I mean the level of a soap opera), history does not have one surprise (it has been done an infinite number of times, combining several threads: SHORT CUTTING, MAGNOLY, GAME IN THE HEART, only much better), not one realistic character (some real freakiness along the way, notice a funny daughter like a zombie) and so on, etc. <br /> <br /> If that was not enough, the movie is 135 min. (count it!) for a long time, and finally the director opens his can of sentimentalism. After the film with such a comically evil dialogue and scenes that showed the audience in the preview preview, they laugh at such a great incompetence ... Well ... It's an insult to the cinema and gets only high marks, because it happens to be in a different language, in this case, Spanish. Strange world in which we live ... 3/10
