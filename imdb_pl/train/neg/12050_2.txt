I have read some positive reviews of this movie and I was really surprised how terrible it was. This film, placed as a crossroads of AIDS related stories and some kind of "Duch" / "Blithe Spirit" stories, may not always make it what it wants to be. <br /> <br /> Simon and Mark are a couple of homosexuals who have an "open" relationship - Simon can have anonymous (though safe) sex on his side when he wants to. Mark is HIV + and he and Simon no longer seem to have sex life. When Mark dies, Simon - who used to shut his emotions after his father rejected him many years ago - tries to erase his memory and simply become a bachelor. Not that his behavior before Mark's death was completely different. But Mark returns in a ghostly form and frustrates his various trystings, while forcing Simon to open himself up and admit his true feelings. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Simon is such a selfish SOB, it is impossible to feel any empathy for him most of the movie. When it is supposed to be more pleasant, it is too late to look after it. Mark, in turn, follows in the footsteps of Demi Moore from "Ghost", crying abundantly throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> After Mark's return, a strange tone appears. Suddenly, we get a lame attempt at humor, and the la TV show "The Witch". But it does not last long. When Simona's emotional health is at stake, the whole thing becomes more and more distasteful, with amateur attempts to tug at heart jerks. The finale, with a gilded angel-boy, leading tearful Mark to heaven, while the scolded Simon, farewell to the waves, is simply stunning, mainly because he is not deliberately amusing.
