What a weekend. Two days ago, I watched the first half of "War Games 2: Dead Code", now "While she was outside." I am trying to decide which one is worse in terms of pain in my mind while watching. I think "While she was out" was worse. <br /> <br /> This has all been said earlier in other comments: Unrealistic, illogical, etc. - the only thing I really have to add is that at some point I started to feel more like bad guys than for women because I would recommend her Darwin prize if she really died (I just watched the first half, so I do not know). I soon had two Darwin prizes (if it was possible) for her immense stupidity. <br /> <br /> And, hey: Produced by Kim Basinger? So not only did she know the script, but she was also responsible for bringing this waste of money to us, people? I think people who waste a lot of money to be bad because money could be used to feed and clothe several people, instead of hurting 80 percent of those who saw it in the cinema and giving 20 percent, which is idiots, a good opportunity to show them how much they are idiots.
