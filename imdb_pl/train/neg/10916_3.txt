For the audience, I see how to applaud this film. For outsiders, without their own interests, it did not make much sense. The Germans were depicted as incompetent and the Russians as heroes. Apparently the romantic angle was superfluous and distracting. How a young woman could "love" a lieutenant, just looking at him was nonsense. How could she, as mentioned at the end of the movie, never get married only because of this infatuation, she was beyond me. I mentioned that the Germans were portrayed as idiots, an example of which was chase in the swamp. Several hundred German soldiers were moving forward, pushing the Russians into the swamp. So the Russians hid, and the Germans stopped at the edge of the swamp and simply stood there listening. I suppose they did not want to wet their shoes, but I'm sure the officer would order 20 or 30 men in the water to search the swamp. But that would end. The Germans also entered the barn, where the Russians hid in the attic and did not bother to shoot the roof. In the worst case, a soldier would throw a grenade into the attic and not climb the ladder to look inside. <br /> <br /> I saw reviewers who said they were crying at the end. I wonder why? You knew that this small group would die, and they would not tug at it.
