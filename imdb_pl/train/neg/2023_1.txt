As summarized, you've just done the most unaware comment I've ever heard on RPG. Did you really think they were gay? Are you handicapped? If you went to save your best friend and someone decided on the goodness of his heart to help you, you are seriously indebted to this man. Lavitz was a good man, and each time they helped each other, they came together as friends. They were not gay lovers, like your slut. To inform you about it, the game takes place in the medieval period. In those days, women were just preparing meals while men fought. Do you even know your story? Do you know how long it took for women to be in the army today? This game contains a lot of realism, even if too damn slow to catch it, and you really need to spit some solid evidence instead of ignorance assumptions based on a mistaken action to interpret the story.
