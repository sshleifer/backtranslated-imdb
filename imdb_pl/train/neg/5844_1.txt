This movie is one of the worst I've ever seen. And I do not mean it in a good way. We wanted to see a bad horror / thriller, so we chose the one that seemed the worst in the store. For the first time the movie was everything we expected. And more! (should I say less?) <br /> <br /> The actors look as if they were reading their lines from posters behind the camera. Special effects are created by placing a red transparent plastic in front of the camera to give the impression that we see through the eyes of deadly rats. And the script? Do not even start with the script ... And when you thought it could not be worse, it turns out that the first part of the film was an Oscar material compared to the end. <br /> br /> Take it from me, this movie is funny if you like ugly horror movies, but if you want a GOOD movie, keep looking. This is not for you.
