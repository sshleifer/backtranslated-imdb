"Fallen" belong to the category of waste of life (WOL). I am sad that I am now two hours older was not fun. Other members of my family also watched the movie and cast demeaning comments on the screen and took root in the mummy. I feel sorry for the actors (Wagner). I have read other negative reviews and can not add anything else to this movie except that it can be reduced to 25 minutes so that it can take a 30-minute slot on the TV without losing the story. It reminds me of a dish that has some good ingredients, but when it is served it is bland, tasteless. In my humble opinion, a 42-foot mummy should be 8-10 feet and improve the plot, removing the mystic and replacing it with several people who want to get rid of facts and want DNA samples for bad reasons. The heroes are discredited and thrown at the ear by their colleges. Later everything was spoiled by bad people. The heroes will save the day and prove that everyone is wrong.
