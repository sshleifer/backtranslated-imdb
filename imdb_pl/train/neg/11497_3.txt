This warning against anti-Semitism is well thought out and could have had its purpose at the time, but it was created without any idea how to make a film. The director has no idea about the mise-en-scene; the cast changes from bad to even worse. <br /> <br /> The great Austrian comic Hans Moser is wasted. In its part, an asylum for the madman ends, which was designed as a set with Das Kabinett des Dr. Caligari; one wonders if the creators had all their mental abilities. <br /> <br /> The restored copy that I saw (Dutch Filmmuseum) gives the impression that some of the scenes have not been put in the right place, but it could be a bad edition too.
