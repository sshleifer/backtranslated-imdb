The film seems chaotic and general, badly written. The script moves as if it were written by 10 different people and none of them communicated with each other. Apparently they wanted to take the page from the movie Miracle on 34th Street (original), but it happens so badly that the movie is falling apart. This movie is intended only for very young people, and will even see that whoever wrote it knows little about baseball. Such as: <br /> <br /> ?? When the Angels are in a dead place, the owner does not worry about it, nor does he worry about the fact that his manager just struggled with his pitcher? AT THE BEGINNING? or that the announcer of the band playing live TV started. However, when the team is one game of winning in a division, it becomes inept due to the story (coming from the 6-year-old) that the manager receives help from a child who claims to see real angels. What sounds worse? Losing a violent manager who lost 15 points in a row? Or a victorious coach on the edge of the playoffs, who behaves a bit eccentric and helps foster children? The owner's response does not make sense. And he changed his mind in Maggie and the speech "straight from the film" during a press conference. <br /> <br /> ?? Angels should play in the Division in the last weekend against White Sox, but at the end of the game, the announcer still repeats that the Angels "won the pennant" and the pennant is not resolved until someone wins the LEAGUE championship, not the regular season title . <br /> <br /> ?? Whitt Bass, a pitcher of goofball is a starting pitcher and wins a game that interrupts the defeat of the Angels? DAY. <br /> <br /> Mel Clark (Tony Danza) says in the ninth round that he threw 156 pitches in a low scoring match. it's usually around 80-90 pitches. <br /> <br /> ?? "AL" an angel says at the end "The championship must be won on their own" despite the fact that he and his angels manipulated and repaired the games throughout the second half of the season. <br /> <br /> I could continue and continue because there are many other examples where the story is badly written. <br /> <br /> For younger children (under 10 years) this movie can be fun. Shame ?? done well it could be classic. It's done so badly and it's an unforgettable mess that will live forever like UHF / cable Saturday morning.
