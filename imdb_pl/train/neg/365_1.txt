Bad plot, bad dialogue, bad acting, idiotic directing, an annoying soundtrack with a porn groove that continues over an uninterrupted script, and a bad copy of VHS can not be used by alcohol consumption. Trust me, because I threw this turkey to the end. It was so pitifully bad that I had to assume that Hitler was the fourth trick of Springtime. <br /> <br /> The girl who played Janis Joplin was the only weak spark of interest and it was only because she could sing better than the original. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch something similar, but a thousand times better, watch Beyond The Valley of The Dolls.
