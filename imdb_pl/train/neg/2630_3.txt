SPOILER ALARM! ! ! Personally, I do not understand why Pete did not help save Williams' life, I mean, it would be great to know why William was motivated or forced. I think Secret Service members are people every day and there is a rumor that the writer was a member of the Secret Service, now his motivations are clear, well known. But as a rental, this movie will not satisfy you, because old, but used twists, average acting - these are just the things in this movie, just wait for you. Clark Johnson as a SWAT director did a much better job than this and I still wonder how producers (for example, Michael Douglas) left this film to theaters.
