This science fiction adventure is not the best and it is not the worst. I agree with the statement that bad sci-fi is comical. Bizarre pink coloring and unusual special effects make it a favorite for late, late, late viewers. Space explorers on the planet Mars are fighting strange giant monsters similar to amoeba and other strange creatures. It's nice. <br /> <br /> The cast includes Les Tremayne, Naura Hayden, Gerald Mohr and Jack Kruschen. Give yourself pleasure and joy. Do not feel bad if you nod your head for a moment. I agree to add this to the list of iconic classics, not to miss.
