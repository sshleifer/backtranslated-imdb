OK, my girlfriend and I rented a DVD and about 30 minutes of film, we exchanged a lot of "ehhh, what is this movie about, and more importantly, if I care about finding out what ends" and decided whether we needed drugs, to make us interested in the "plot", or just ended up in pain, then we watched something else. We decided on the latter one. <br /> <br /> I really liked "I'm a cheerleader," but Mango Kiss is too stupid and surreal for my taste, I'm sorry! I definitely prefer "D.E.B.S", "Better Than Chocolate", "Fucking Åmål", "Goldfish Memory" and "Fire". <br /> <br /> -Sorcia
