Not that I'm really surprised .... movies are never as good as the books they come from. I could not wait to see this movie because it's one of my favorite books, although I knew it probably would suck. I was hoping to be pleasantly surprised. However, they moved away too much from the story of the book, and the film version did not convey how terrible this house was. The ending was different too. Lara Flynn Boyle looked awful because of the really bad plastic surgery. Acting was uninteresting at best. Perhaps if the cinema version was created so that they do not have to stay in the "Made for TV" Lifetime box for so long, it would be better. If you saw this movie, I encourage you to track down the book and read it. I doubt you will be disappointed and you hope that you will like it as much as I do whenever I read it.
