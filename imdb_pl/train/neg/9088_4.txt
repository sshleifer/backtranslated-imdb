It is said several times - not just because of me - that watching Eric Rohmer's film is like watching dry paint; it looks like Monsieur Rohmer does not feel like it (he does not deny it, but in that case, how could he, he just does not like it) so much that his new movie, which may also be his last, Inch Allah , it is so far back that it is like watching woad dry. These wonderful people who gave you Nouvelle Vague, Cahiers du Cinema, have already named it one of the best films of 2007, so he should give you an idea. Reality is not high on Rohmer's plans, so in the 5th century in France, we have a castle in one corner that would not be out of place in the Loire valley, while the only other apartment we see is a naughty wooden hut. The story concerns nimf and shepherds, and because Rohmer often throws her into unknown people who happen to be passing by accidentally, so that the overall effect is that the annual class game at the school for students with special needs has been accidentally captured on the film. One can be tempted to say, "Godard back, everything is forgiven," but even this pathetic production can not force me to say those words.
