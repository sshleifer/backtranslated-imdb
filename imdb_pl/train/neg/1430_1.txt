Looking through the channels on a Saturday night, my friends and I stumbled across this movie. Above all Irish actor Pierce Brosnan as an indigenous American? Seriously?! His accent stuck so much, though his character was obviously Scottish. Then I was stunned by the statement that this movie was made after he had at least twice played James Bond / Agent 007. This film presents stereotypes with an inspirational figure of a professor. The girl who played Pony should receive payment so as not to close her mouth. And this movie won the prize? I can not believe it. Brosnan is an attractive man, but we seriously wanted to assess our eyes after seeing it for 10 seconds. We changed the "Kicking and Screaming" for this and we wanted to come back. During the night, we watched the children's classics in 1995, The Indian in the Cupboard, in which the Iroquois were also discussed. The following poem presents our desire to escape: "Take me outside, earth catcher". From "Gray Owl": "If you do not like it, you do not have to watch."
