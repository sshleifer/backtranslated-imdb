Being the great western of James Arness, this movie has become the worst Alamo movie ever made. The tale was terrible, all the time inaccuracy and just false lies! Continuity has been cast on four winds. Can someone catch a sequence of cannons? The Mexicans were stupid enough to launch cannons that apparently had sticking mud and staffs. Come on! Then there's Brian Keith's funny hat! The customer must be away or something. Or simply from their mind!
