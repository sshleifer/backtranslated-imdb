Despite many styles, flashing and brilliance, this French musical does not speak. The melodies are repetitive, predictable and tedious. History is uninteresting, as are many characters. <br /> <br /> People break into the song and dance without motivation or reason. Most casts look like fake wigs and hairpieces, and the sets look hopelessly related to the studio. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this movie with the restored version was stopped before the end, which had a negative impact on me. Certainly a shame that such a multi-talented endeavor in such a light manner. <br /> <br /> The point is that, I think, there are often further observations (in this case, a wonderful classic "Umbrellas"). Can not be recovered, just reconstructed.
