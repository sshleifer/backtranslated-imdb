Certainly not terrible, but definitely not good. <br /> <br /> Cry, The Beloved Country (1995) was directed by Darrell Roodt and screened by Ronald Harwood (Adaptation from the novel by Alan Paton in 1946). There are James Earl Jones and Richard Harris. <br /> <br /> The film is about Apartheid in South Africa and about the stories of a black man and a white man. The pious but na√Øve preacher Stephen Kumalo (James Earl Jones) receives a letter from Johannesburg, saying that he must arrive immediately; later he discovers that his son killed a man. Rich farmer / landowner James Jarvis (Richard Harris) discovers that his son, a blacklisted warrior, was killed by son Kumalo. In this they connect. <br /> <br /> I can not compare it to the 1951 movie of the same title, because I did not see it. Or a musical from 1974 entitled "Lost in the Stars" because I did not see it; both look better than this one. But Cry Freedom, on the other hand, I saw; it has a much more urgent air, as if it was actually trying to say something where Cry's movie, The Beloved Country, seems to have no idea where it's going. Very "uncomfortable". I refuse to compare the film to the novel (except that I liked the novel more than the movie), because novels and films are two very different media and it makes no sense to try to transfer them directly to each other or compare them with the same means. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this movie exploded. Well, I think it was not that bad - Five-to-ten, but it was not that good either. Both leaders, both very talented actors, perform some of the most wooden performances I have seen with some of the most awkward dialogues in film history (but you can blame the writer, Ronald Harwood, who is also strange that he is playing with the movie that he also wrote the lofty The Pianist and Being Juliet). Among other things, the point and themes of the novel are almost completely lost in the transition to the film for the third time; there is little, if any, tension at any point in the movie, racially or suspensively. Music does not help. Painfully lost and boring pastoral orchestral works really help in this dulling of the film. One of the advantages is cinematography, with many rather good or great photos, but unfortunately, it does not help the film too much. <br /> <br /> The last, striking words of Alan Paton's novels are shown in the last moments of cinematography. It is a pity that they seem to be so disconnected from the film shown. I do not know what Nelson Mandela could see in this movie. <br /> <br /> Thank you for your time.
