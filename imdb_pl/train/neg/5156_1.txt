"Laughter is a state of mind," says the tag, and I hesitate to comment on Barry Levinson. What could he think about creating "toys"? When he watched the rushes, did he see a successful, funny fantasy? If so, it works on a different plane than I. It's a distorting picture in which the production project accounts for 90% of things (and even cartoon colors are a disappointment). Robin Williams and (especially) Joan Cusack are humiliated as brother and sister of a toy mogul who are overlooked as heirs to the factory when their father dies. There is nothing funny (satirical or slapstick) on the display. It is evenly draggy, ugly and is one of the worst "big" movies ever made. NO STARS WITH ****
