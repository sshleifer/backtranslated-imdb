PLAN B has the appearance of a quickly created, unedited, sloppy script for a movie whose purpose is to go out for the actors involved - a trip that should be removed from the beginning. This is another mafia "comedy" that has nothing new and lowers the standard for those who take part in it. <br /> <br /> Joe Maloni (Paul Sorvino) is the head of the crime more concerned about clothing and appearance than his business control. His personal assistant Mario (Anthony DeSando) is stupider than dirt, and his ignorance is supposed to be fun. Maloni attacked one of his debtors (who happened to be married to Frank - Diane Keaton), and Maloni takes Frana as his assistant to cut off the debt of her deceased husband by being a "struck man" by Maloni. Fran is afraid of his own shadow and is unable to perform Maloni's tasks, instead he decides to move his "whackee" to Florida to hide in her brother James's home until he learns what to do next. This alternative to killing three candidates is called Plan B, the plan is to kill them! The ending is completely predictable, as is each line assigned to the characters in the scenario. <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton has made a lot of great films and is one of our most talented actresses and comedians, but here she screams and rages and breaks through a funny part that quickly becomes annoying to watch. Paul Sorvino is, well, Paul Sorvino cast from other gangster movies. The auxiliary staff can also play on the balcony in the widest way imaginable. What is to be a comedy ends simply stupidly and exaggerated. Director Greg Yaitanes must return to television comedy series: if this poor story was compressed in a half-hour concert, she would have a chance. Grady Harp
