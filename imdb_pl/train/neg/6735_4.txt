The best thing I can say about this movie is that it is at a good pace. He did not fall flat. The next best thing is the performances of a supporting actor playing young Mr. Edward, always a wonderful Holland Taylor and actor playing husband Taylor. An actor helping to criticize Messing's potential costumes on the early stage brings enchanting absurd and at the same time winning quality to the proceedings. Okay, it's a positive thing. <br /> <br /> Dermot Mulroney, whom I adore, is much more credible, expressing contempt for Messing than in any scene in which he tries to be matter-of-fact or supportive. As others have pointed out, there seems to be no emotional investment in this venture except to pack it as soon as possible. Messing, however, sincerely tries to bring the film and create the illusion of chemistry with Mulroney. She does it appropriately, but she's just not strong enough for the actress to release it without help. Give her "E" for her effort and "C +" for achievement. Considering Mulroney's indifference, the only thing that could help Messing would be the great bachelor performance of Irons-esquire from the actor playing her former fianc√©, Jeffrey. Instead, his performance is poorly bent, mewed and insolent. <br /> <br /> If I tried to analyze it even more, of course I would pay more attention than most people involved. It's harmless enough to kill time if you have nothing else to do, and less unpleasant (and less creative) than The Wedding Singer, but you're much more likely to see "My Best Friend's Wedding" again.
