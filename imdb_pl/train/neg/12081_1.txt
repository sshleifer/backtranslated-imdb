Note for George Litman and others: the riff of Mystery Science Theater 3000 is "I do not think * breeder *". <br /> <br /> My favorite riff is "Why did you look at his" how? ", Simply for total absurdity. That and "Well done!" above all, I would say that we have to thank the MST3K crew for trying to ridicule this TV movie. you really can not have fun with the dialog box; Bill S was a good playwright. on the other hand, this production is so bad that even he will renounce it. The drama club of the gymnasium could have done better. <br /> <br /> I recommend that you buy a book and read "Hamlet".
