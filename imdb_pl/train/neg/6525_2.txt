I gave this film 2 and although I consider myself a sci-fi fan, I find this film very difficult to take seriously. It was AMC late at night and I'm glad I saw it for free. This movie is probably good for a few laughs, but not much more. <br /> <br /> The special effects are more or less average during this period - not terrible, but not great. Of course, we now know more about Mars than then, but we can not really oppose this film. The main reason why I did not like this movie is its history. <br /> <br /> There were several parts of the movie that I would like to be explored in a little more detail - the astronaut's / town's state of Mars, the creation in the lake, etc. In general, the movie is similar to the long episode of The Outer Limits from the 1960s - ended with a cheap ending.
