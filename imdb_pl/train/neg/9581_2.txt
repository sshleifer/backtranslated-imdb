This is the only thing I can say positively about this film. Cleveland is a star, I've been there and I have never seen this city so good. A beautiful river and urban landscapes. <br /> <br /> This movie is moving forward at such a pace that it hopes you will not notice the lack of real meaning in the world. People run and shoot with weapons without any consequences. For example, at Rob Lowe's home there is a shootout - two cars have been stolen, but the cops do not show up much later. The murder for rent has never seemed so unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Whoever wrote this movie should be at the end of one of the films - countless stray bullets. Many of the actors in this film are much better. I check the date of the film just to make sure it was not written during the writers' strike, but unfortunately it was not. This video is currently in the rotation phase of the Universal Universal channel - unless you want to drool over Lowe there is no reason to watch it.
