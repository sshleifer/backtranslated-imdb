The definition of the abomination defined by Webster's Dictioara is "the cause of disgust or disgust". If anyone can come up with a more appropriate word or definition than the one for Alone in the Dark, let me know because it's the best I can come up with. However, I do not feel that this word describes how really this movie is really awful. <br /> <br /> I went to see this movie with my two roommates. One has very similar taste for me, the other is a guru of action / adventure. The latter guy usually does not care about the size of the holes in the story, if the film contains a lot of explosions, and he will go away happy. <br /> <br /> Speaking this, we went to the theater for Friday's Alone in the Dark. To my surprise, we were the only people in the theater. When it started, I knew why immediately. <br /> <br /> It starts with the worst scene opening every movie and unfortunately I have to admit that it is worse from there. The opening scene is a 5-minute scrolling text that is told. I understand, however, why it was told. The director had to understand that only illiterate people would even say that PAYMENT will watch this film. However, this first scene is not only the longest scrolling text in cinema history, but also does not make sense. It seems that in the same order we hear about the complete separation of films. One concerns an ancient civilization and its manipulation of the portal, the other concerns a mad scientist and his orphans experiments. If you are reading this and are confused, you are not alone. <br /> <br /> Then begins a terrible plot, acting, effects and working with the camera. Tara Reid is terrifying as an actress. He does nothing to think for a second that he is a museum curator. Slater is just bad, unconvincing and there is no chemistry with Reid. <br /> <br /> The plot is probably the worst thing created by man. All the time me and a roommate with similar preferences are asking questions like: What is this? What's going on In addition to these scuffed debris, we have several narrated sequences of Slater himself. Are they good? NO. Do they explain anything? NO. At any moment, as an audience, do we have the slightest idea why we should care what will happen? Once again, NO. <br /> <br /> Then we have a random sex scene. We were told that Slater and Reid are together, but they never behave as if they were caring for others. But then BAM ... sex scene. I do not know again. <br /> <br /> Good, oh, I do not know, 30 seconds after the end of this pathetic scene, we have a shootout with 20 or more troops and a similar number of aliens. It is a piece of heavy metal and causes more cerebral haemorrhage than ever before. <br /> <br /> And if that's not enough ... <br /> <br /> There is no main villain. He is a scientist and they are "foreign" things. At some point, the scientist controls foreign things and stands on the hill, ordering them to attack a military facility. Why? How did he become the supreme commander of these things? Why are they listening to him? Once again, I have no idea. <br /> <br /> The movie ends when Slater and Reid are in the evacuated city. Why was the city evacuated? Did foreign things break? Did the army tell them that? Who knows ... and up to this point, who cares? I did not do it and you did not. <br /> <br /> But in addition Slater and Reid are attacked by a foreign thing. Although it was found that foreign things would be killed by exposure to sunlight. And that's right, you guessed it's the middle of the day * and% $ and it's as bright as you can. Maybe the alien has bought a pair of sunglasses, I do not know and I do not care. <br /> <br /> Now after the movie ended, I ran to the theater, 6 feet 6 inches from me, waving my arms and shaking my afro, telling everyone not to watch this movie. Even my roommate of action / adventure with gung-ho (who would consider a movie that just cut and pasted 2 hours of explosion into one movie to be the best thing ever created) admitted that the holes in the story were very visible in this movie . <br /> <br /> Summing up this CRAP-FEST, I give him 0.0 / 10 and I would give him less if I could. <br /> <br /> Unambiguously, the worst movie ever made. I would not want this movie on my worst enemy.
