I was completely strengthened to see this movie. I waited a year to clean it here in New Zealand. I should not have built so much because it was so disappointing and it is undoubtedly Clark's worst movie. There is so much wrong with this movie. First of all, some of the acting is great, especially Nick Stahl as "The Bully" and the girl with curly brown hair (I do not remember her name), but most of them were so detached and incredibly incredible, especially Leo Fitzpatrick. He is a veteran of Clark's films and he was so brilliant in "Kids", but in "Bully" he invests his lines in such a ceremony to turn his scenes into a virtual parody. The script seemed to be written by a student of the first year of the film. No, I'm sorry, high school student ... one who has never seen a movie before. And I could not understand Clark's intentions. Have you tried to point out the existence of these children without meaning? It certainly did not prevent him from getting a damn good pervert. I'm not prudish, but I did not have to see my teenage breasts and buttocks every 5 minutes. I still maintain that Clark's best film is "Another day in paradise". It's fantastic and I do not think he ever got it.
