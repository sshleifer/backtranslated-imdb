I watched Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings version when I was half-reading the Two Towers and thought it was absolutely brilliant. <br /> <br /> An animated version of The Lord of the Rings on DvD was released, but I told myself that I would finish reading Two Towers and Return of Kings before watching it (because I thought it would show the whole trilogy). <br /> <br /> So when I finished the trilogy I went and brought DvD, which was a stupid idea, because it was absolutely nonsense. <br /> <br /> I was bored with 20 minutes, which was really weird because I love the book and I'm shocked that the producer of this movie could even think about fitting at least 1 and a half books to a 2-hour 8-minute movie. <br /> <br /> None of the characters had any emotions when they talked and it seemed that reading the page, even my favorite character, which is Gandalf, did not seem interesting at all. <br /> <br /> The animation was only fine in parts of the movie, except for the orcs (they looked terrible) and Aragorn and Sam. <br /> <br /> I do not know how the movie was released because there was not even the right ending, but maybe it's good that the producer ran out of money because the movie could not be better. <br /> <br /> I just hope that no one will judge the books according to this film. <br /> <br /> 3/10
