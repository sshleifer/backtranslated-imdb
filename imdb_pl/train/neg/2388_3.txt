No one should ever try to adapt Tom Robbins' book to the screen. While the movie is fine and the performances are good, a dialogue that works well is nonsense when you talk. Or, in other words, no one would suggest that hearing the name of someone else was like watching him in radium on pearl. <br /> <br /> Generally, the movie looks like a poorly adapted Cliffs Notes to the book - most parts have been hacked to one-fifth of their size in the book, in terms of history and current history, and the ending is crazy (and unpleasantly) different from that in book. Most of the stories from the book get lost, including the one that makes everything make sense at the end, and the book has more than one reference that makes the viewer say "Huh?" Unfortunately, this is not worth the effort - the script should be read in comparison with the book, burnt, and all actors sent to do something much better. I admire Gus Van Sant very much, but even someone from his caliber could not make a decent movie of such a complex book without doing a miniseries.
