Josh Hartnett's dead eyes, thick writing of this and Harrison Ford in the comedy of a friend! Here are 3 reasons to hate, avoid and use 116 minutes of your life better. <br /> <br /> The videos of friends are fun. However, their true golden age returned in the 1980s and 1990s. Making someone who tries to combine action and comedy by the Hollywood police is certainly a good idea, but the final result turned out to be not just a parody of the subspecies, but a reason to ask God to have mercy on all of the old films of the same kind, while the worst of them was much bigger than (Hollywood homicide). <br /> <br /> What really happened with this fun formula ?! Things have not been the same for the entire decade. You would have a stubborn flop on the other. I will be delighted with some titles, which you will understand well during the catastrophe: (I Spy - 2002), (National Security - 2003), (Taxi - 2004), (Starsky and Hutch - 2004), and the worst of them all else (Miami Vice - 2006 )! <br /> <br /> I think that one of the reasons is the natural case of saturation after many similar movie films and TV shows in just two decades. Add to this, especially here, neglect and boring humor. Actually, this case is completely unbearable. Yes, we have the characters of 2 loyal cops who have a second job and the background of a sinful city, but what else was new ?! It's not a cliché; it is about a few renewals mixed up with clichés in which both were badly made. <br /> <br /> Acting, especially on the part of (Hartnett), is terrible. This guy is not just a comedian (or actor!). So his character wanted revenge for his father's death! Take revenge on a man, he probably died because of watching your acting !! Even small roles have people who have nothing to do with comedy (or so they thought!). <br /> <br /> The director does not present something so comical or so harsh, some parts can be very boring (arrest a black guy by lack of ??); it's rare to get bored in action / comedy! They did not use Hollywood as an ironic place in which an ugly face hides behind a superficial charm, and even as a place full of shiny or fallen stars (scenes that could give him some interesting moments). > <br /> This is a very easy movie that can be viewed only thanks to the charm of the stars and the film with the clay of Buddha, which ends up as one of the worst cases of 2 stars with chemistry on the screen (one of them has no chemistry with the screen itself!) Guess who ?!), and the Buddy-Cop destroyer more than a movie! God, do not make me or my children live to be a witness (Hollywood Homicide ?? Part 2)! In the end, look at the performance of Harrison Ford, he wanted to have fun, but at least we did not.
