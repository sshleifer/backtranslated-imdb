"Plants are the most devious and cruel of all life forms," ​​says one careless victim in "The Seedpeople," a silly, flaccid remake of "Invasion of the Bodysnatchers," "Day of the Triffids," and a thousand moovas. And why seeds are more dangerous than plants? Because according to the same word, "seeds can chase us." Yes, I remember one terrifying incident when MooCow was just a calf, chased all the way home from school by the hungry seed of a dandylion ... Yes, that's right. Unfortunately, the "monsters" in this dingy little turkey look like shaggy little muppets, some of them roll like ominous whirlpools, and others swim on strings. There is not even the slightest terror or tension. For unexplained reasons, seed monsters are knocked out by 50 volt ultraviolet light, even if they can walk in daylight that has about 1,000,000,000,000 more uv energy. As you can see, there was not much thinking about this flop of cows. MooCow says go the weeds, instead of wasting photosynthesis here. : = 8P
