SAPS AT SEA <br /> <br /> Picture format: 1.37: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound format: Mono <br /> <br /> (black and white) <br /> <br /> Suffering from "hornophobia", Ollie embarks on a "calm" journey by ship, but he and Stan are mixed up with the escaping convict (Rychard Cramer). Chaos appears. <br /> <br /> This feature-length comedy - OK, which nevertheless does not resemble the usual imitations of the best works of Laurel and Hardy - marked the final collaboration between L & H and producer Hal Roach. The episodic structure of the film culminates in an unforgettable oceanic journey after The Boys are taken hostage by the wicked Cramer (who shoots the gulls to prove how hard it is!). Gags are okay, but there is no inspiration, perhaps because of the recruitment of actor-director Gordon Douglas, previously responsible for the first solo effort Ollie in the era of sound (ZENOBIA, produced in 1939), But whose work here is lacking. Pzazz. Fair, but nothing special. Charlie Hall and James Finlayson, L & H patrons, have guest appearances.
