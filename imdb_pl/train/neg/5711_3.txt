The national treasure is just as overstated and exaggerated as it appears. Nicholas Cage is in no way a credible hero of the action, and this movie is not "Indiana Jones." People who compared this film to the classic Indian Jones trilogy seriously fell out of their rocker. <br /> <br /> I really can not guess for which target group did this movie. Maybe the pre-school audience will like it, but I found it totally absurd. I can not imagine adults and young adults who think that it is a great movie. Simply put: at best it's fine. <br /> <br /> The national treasure is unimaginable and inspired, borrowing what it has from the "Da Vinci Code". I recommend you wait for the release of this movie in 2006 and pass this nonsense. <br /> <br /> The whole idea to steal the Declaration of Independence so easily and run around Washington and Philadelphia with it (though never destroying it once), while fighting against the "bad" and experiencing what is supposed to be " non-stop action "is absurd. I particularly liked the scene with the Declaration made in a tube lying in the middle of a busy road, while the cars whizzed past it without destroying it. Oh brother! <br /> <br /> He reminded me of this episode of "Brady Bunch", where they go to the amusement park, and Mr. Brady loses architectural plans. Only that this episode of Brady Bunch was much better than the whole movie! <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​such a huge treasure, which nobody believes that he was buried in the mysterious ruin of the USA, is bizarre. Literally in this treasury there are thousands of undiscovered "priceless" items. Yes, sure!! Funny!! <br /> <br /> What's worse, the speed and accuracy with which Cage finds and calculates what should be "difficult" tips on these ancient riddles, is pre-poster !!! Oh, humanity! <br /> <br /> The performances of Cage, Voight and other actors in "National Treasure" are as stiff, wooden and flat as they appear. However, when you work with such a bad dialogue, it's hard to accuse an actor of 100% for it. <br /> <br /> The national treasure is a good movie that can be seen once. I can not recommend it anyway, and I certainly would NOT buy it on top, a bizarre hunt for mess. <br /> <br /> Rent it if you must see it first .......
