I just rented this movie to see Dolph Lundgren, whom I have not seen in any movie since Rocky IV. Unfortunately, this movie was a huge disappointment. The operation of all parties was bad, except for Mr Lundgren, who was okay. Kata Dob√≥ was a nice look despite her funny outfit and make-up. <br /> <br /> The story is not smart at all, it's something that has been repeated a million times in different movies. The scammers were completely stereotypical, and Lundgren's form had no depth in it. I did not expect a film masterpiece, but unfortunately it is not even a decent action. Every rotation of the story is extremely predictable, and the incredible amount of exaggerated unrealism and comic characters has made me very annoyed. <br /> <br /> I recommend this comic book for young children, but only if nothing else is available. <br /> <br /> 1/10. (I think the current average vote of 7.0 with 6 voices must have been influenced by someone involved in making this movie)
