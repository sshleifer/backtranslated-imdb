I am a huge huge fan of John Cusack, Samuel L. Jackson and Tony Shalhoub. I'm a little less liked by Stephen King, but I like his work. <br /> <br /> That being said, I should have LOVED 1408. <br /> <br /> *** POSSIBLE SPOILERS AFTER THIS PUNKT **** <br /> <br /> I walked willingly. I left disappointed. <br /> <br /> It's not the fault of the actors. Shalhoub and Jackson have very small roles, because Cusack puts the film in the "guy in a locked room" script. <br /> <br /> It was not a BAD movie, but I can not call it good either. It was a muddy mess that had the moment "ouch, it's just WRONG", combined with moments "ouch, it's just painful" and sometimes "oh, now THIS is just unfortunate" with a very small continuity of connection between them. Eislin's father appears once and has nothing to do with the rest of Mike's personal life that we see when she tries to survive peace. <br /> <br /> The previous commentator described the Olin / Enslin argument as worth seeing and I agree with it very much. But apart from clever music tips (the room almost jokingly tormented Enslin, and gives him one chance to get out before raising the ante ... at this point he gives him an hour clock counting down and the title line from Carpenters "We've Only Just Begun . ") It's mainly" things pop on you when you least expect it! "Type in a horror movie that was cool when I was fourteen, and surrounded by friends of my age, squeezing in the summer while Jason sneaked into the Camp Crystal Lake. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie was: its most painful experiences "mindgaming, with" animate images in a scary way "cliché cheesiness. <br /> <br /> ****** END SPOILERS ***** <br /> <br /> I expected better after this movie with attached name of Stephen King, and also the actors I mentioned higher. <br /> <br /> We never know where the evil comes from. We will never see the defeated evil, although we may suppose that it has been defeated. <br /> <br /> And the ending was just a shocking "What ?!" moment. <br /> <br /> Wait until the cable arrives. I would not mind paying for it as a matinée, but I feel a bit embarrassed that I paid the opening price for it.
