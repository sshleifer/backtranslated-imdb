I had to see it because it looked like a terrible premise - prisoners who found a magic book, oh, err! it comes to claustrophobic terror, etc. <br /> <br />, but there has not been a story that would fit this great idea. instead of a bloodcurdling physiological horror, it relied on the effects of open fire and OTT horrors that did not scare you if you were more than 12 years old. , with characters killed for nothing but counting. wasting good characters - which was the best thing in this movie. <br /> <br /> obviously low budget, which does not spoil him, the movie really does not go anywhere, and I believe I will say it - it needs a remake of Hollywood. you simply lose interest in this version. definitely not in the same league as other French films appearing in the last few years, such as crimson rivers that were at least watchful / entertaining, malefique is not entirely honest. and I bet you can guess the ending before watching the movie. really very disappointing - impossible to recommend.
