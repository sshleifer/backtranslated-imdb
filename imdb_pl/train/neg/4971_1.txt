I work in the Blockbuster store and every week we have films that contain only a few copies, these are films that show the Sci-Fi channel. That kind of movie that no one ever wants, and only that the idiots rent when they bring it back, I ask them, "was that good?" They say "no, we turned it off after 15 minutes!" Movies with monsters generated by computer, super-imposed monsters and such, very unattractive. <br /> <br /> This is the same kind of film as Grendel and an absolute waste of time if you want a sensible (and only reasonable) good movie based on Beowulf, and then try Beowulf & Grendel, with Gerard Butler, who will also play in the eagerly awaited 300, as King Leonidas of Sparta. <br /> <br /> Plus, this year we have another Beowulf movie starring, from Anthony Hopkins and Brendan Gleeson, to Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich. <br /> <br /> But do not let your hopes come true, like everyone with Eragon, or we are all for another big disappointment. <br /> <br /> And when it comes to renting, here's my rule: if there's only one or two copies, do not borrow it because it's a lot of nonsense (it's true 99.9% of the time, it's usually not true if the title is foreign or documentary.)
