I bought Unhinged because I was pulled in by a bloody photo on the cover. If you want to see all the good parts of the movie, just look at the back of the box. All murders are shown and I can honestly say that they look much better in the frame than in the film. <br /> <br /> Having said that, let's look at the story. A group of friends going to a rock concert (through deep, dark forests in one of the longest driving sequences captured on celluloid) slides off the road. The car has no visible damage, but apparently enough one of the signs in a coma until the end of the movie (or maybe she read the script and was already in a coma before the start of the shooting). > <br /> The other two girls are waking up in a large, secluded house. By the way, the house is fantastic and is more dramatic due to its presence than any of the actors in the film. However, for some reason this house has no roads. The only way to get to the main road is to walk five miles through the forest. The girls spend the rest of Unhinged listening to strange conversations between an old rich bitch (who looks like George Washington's tramp) and her equally cozy, sexually suppressed daughter. The girls apparently did not rush back from the concert, because they packed more clothes than the cast of Gilligan's on this three-hour tour. <br /> <br /> Until we, viewers, reach the killing scene, we do not care. We want someone to kill us only to end our suffering. Unhinged eventually ends with a rather shocking ending, which deserves to be in a much better movie. It's almost as if the end, the only good idea in the film, was written first, and then the writers tried to make a movie for it. <br /> <br /> Unhinged is ultimately a boring movie with bad acting, an inept director and a conspiracy with more holes than a leper in a porn movie (I'm sorry, I'm not sure where it came from). You will find out how bad the movie is during the opening credits, when for some reason, which has never been explained, the screen turns black for about two minutes while the characters talk about nothing to keep in mind. Do not waste time. You will simply feel unhinged and want to regain your time and money.
