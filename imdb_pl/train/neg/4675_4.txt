"Washington Square" is a flat, worn adaptation of the short novel by Henry James. Indeed, the novel is very good, but far from the level of James' masterpieces. What's more, his simple, event-free story seems inappropriate to make a film from it (although William Wyler, with his "heiress", in 1949 gave a beautiful version of the novel). <br /> <br /> In any case, the movie completely betrays the spirit of this great American writer's work. In the novel, the heroine Catherine is shy, not very attractive and a bit clumsy, but she is still a healthy, intelligent young woman and is not as naive as it might seem. Her attachment to her father is dignified and respectful, with no morbidities. After three-quarters of the movie, Catherine (Jennifer Jason Leigh) seems to be mentally retarded. In the last quarter she suddenly (and unbelievably) becomes intelligent, aware of her dignity, and that's all. <br /> <br /> The director Agnieszka Holland added two vulgar scenes to the story. First, when Catherine's nervous child is in trouble with his bladder. The second scene, when we see in the background a kind of brothel in the open air, where prostitutes take their clients for tents and so on. Nothing can be more contrary to the spirit and artistic ideals of Henry James. It is known that the writer was unusually decent and humble even with reference to the standards of the Victorian era. I am opposed to anyone who finds any thickness on thousands of pages of James's huge literary production. These two scenes really annoyed me. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know that the director needs a reasonable freedom in adaptation of the novel on the screen. But if the director completely ignores or misinterprets the art of the author (here Henry James), I do not see the point of using his work to create a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Acting is appropriate for the film: poor and flat, despite the talent of Albert Finney and Maggie Smith. "Washington Square" is definitely a movie not recommended.
