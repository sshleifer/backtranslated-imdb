Effort on the side (this is not a review of good intentions, it is about the end product), this film is poorly written, misused and poorly targeted. Of course, the story had potential, but this story is nowhere in the movie. <br /> <br /> Clara Barton was a man. She had passions, desires, love, pain, embarrassment, weakness and doubt, just like the rest of us. You would never find out from the movie about the role of the main actress. In fact, it applies to every character in the film, but in the case of Barton: Every sentence is speech. An epic on the upper speech, like an inhuman robot. In fact, this is the only scene that plays well in one of the board meetings and I realized it because she is giving a speech! Every idea he has is unbelievable in his context and he comes up with ideas that sound like they've lasted a lifetime looking for a soul in place. For example, when he sees an injured man, he will begin to think about the needs of the battlefield and protect soldiers, put up white flags, etc. As in the film, there is NO thing that could come up with such a detailed thought out idea in a few seconds. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this movie robs Clara Barton of her struggles. He robs her of humanity and, by nature, cheaper everything she has done, because the script is written in clich√©s. The writer does not know Clara Barton and seems to have based his script on an article from the Britannica encyclopedia. (yeah, they had them then) But hey, nice Technicolor! (who cares)
