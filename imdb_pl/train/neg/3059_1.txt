Okay. Recently, I got the chance to borrow and watch Santa Claus picking up martains. Although the children were much more sadistic in SCCTM, I would have to say that Santa Claus was a much worse film. As a Spanish worker in Spanish 5 we had to watch it. I'll tell you, usually when we watch a movie, we all talk and eat, but not for this movie. Everyone just kept their jaws and wondered what Mr. Pitch was going to do. Will Merlin help Santa!? Will the robot reindeer come and save the day? I suggest you rent, because it's the biggest piece of junk I've ever seen and I love it for that. :RE
