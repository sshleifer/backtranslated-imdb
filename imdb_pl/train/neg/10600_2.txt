I will be honest. The only reason I watched this movie on TV is that it's at the bottom 100 IMDb. And now I wonder if the hour and a half of my life really was worth the next "check" on the same list. > <br /> Van Damme is Luc Deveraux, who fights with Universal Soldiers after the main computer pulled "HAL" to defend himself. And yes, after all mandatory explosions, penalties and chases is the last one that stands. In combination with a terrible action and a bit of boring setting, it makes it a place on the infamous list. <br /> <br /> Only for idiots like me who want to watch this full list. 2/10.
