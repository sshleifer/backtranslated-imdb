As said before, visual effects are stunning. They are breathtaking. Personally, I use Blender and such graphics are not easy at all. But that's all this movie. Not only the plot is misleading, but the overall conflict is not clear. For example, in the first scene, Proog and Emo try to escape from who knows what. Conflict seems to be here between man and nature. Later, when they enter the pit of a bottomless well, Proog explains that "one step away from the place and (you are dead)". Here is a more precise conflict between the careless man and nature. As the film progresses, it is clear that there is a conflict between man and nature. But suddenly there is a conflict between a man and a man when Proog, out of nowhere, murders Emo. Proog immediately changes from a protective guardian caring for a lost child to a "sick man". He betrays us. Not only is it depressing, but we do not care, because the conflict between the thoughts and actions of the characters is not developed. This is not a story about someone, through a fight that becomes stronger. It's depressing and does not make sense, because there is not much truth about the human soul or about a world that reveals itself as a great drama. In my opinion, the film is very poorly developed in every respect. However, the graphics are stunning, but the movie is more than mere sweets. There is no truth, no fight and no surprise. To sum up, the underdeveloped movie without a point. ... but the graphics are good.
