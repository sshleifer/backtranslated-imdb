It is a film that embodies the fear of the D & D of the 80s (and even today). They are afraid that people who play D & D (or any other role-playing game) will be "drawn in" and lose their ability to distinguish reality from fantasy (and they will kill madness, children's victims, suicides, etc.). A great movie for anyone who likes to blame society's problems with inanimate objects, but anyone who played RPG, a video game or even played a game would find it an insult to their intelligence. What Wargames had on computers belongs to D & D. Plus as a movie it just sucks.
