You can deal with historical inaccuracies, but this movie was simply too big. Virtually nothing was even close to the truth, and even in the age it was seen as stupid. <br /> <br /> In the defense of the Ford, it was revealed in the old talk show that he acted on this story as he told him the real Wyatt Earp, who was of course old, old and recreated the scene in his own way. Earp told the director about the stagecoach and how it was going to happen during the arrival of the stagecoach, so despite what other historians claim, Wyat himself assures that it was deliberately premeditated. <br /> <br /> This movie presents Earp as an honest man, as well as his brothers. History does not say exactly that they were or were not. Most people like to add a bit of deception and lawlessness to their characters, but it's nothing new. The truth is probably closer to them that they are law-abiding laws GUNFIGHT AT THE OK CORRAL. Men who saw it as a career and trust me in the old West, you did not have time to think about something else. <br /> <br /> Characters that do not exist, characters depicting death in a corral that did not really do, all this makes the movie weaker. This is further weakened by Mature, who really did not convince Doc. It may be the worst choice in history for Docu, but at the same time we must remember that older films were closer to the age and closer to the truth. In the end, Ford got information from Wyatt Earp firsthand. <br /> <br /> It is also weakened by all such predictable events with the participation of a Mexican girl. In those days, Hollywood was very Nazi and ready to kill brunettes in a very predictable way to show their patronage of Hitler's idealism. This is the case in most films up to the eighties. It is not an excuse, but it is dancing art. <br /> <br /> The actors who play Earps are doing well, and Brennan is always excited. In fact, Elder may be the only fault working in this movement. Nevertheless, this is the weakest of the old OK Corral movies.
