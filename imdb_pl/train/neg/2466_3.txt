For the last few years there has been fashion for the often ironic movies associated with zombies, as well as other incarnations of the media from the body - eating the resurrected dead. "Fido" is a movie that is either an attempt to make money on it, just its manifestation, or both - and it falls into the category of ironic zombies. The joke is that we see walking deceased in the contrasting context of a broadly stereotypical, high-speed alternative history (we are following a great zombie war, and creatures are now called as slaves) version of a suburb from the 1950s. <br /> <br /> It's a rather funny concept in itself, and perhaps enough for a five-minute comedy sketch, but it can not stop a feature film by itself. The joke that the rotting corpse for the service is inconsistent with this idealized version of a small town, repeats itself over and over and loses all effectiveness. The soundtrack constantly plays sunny melodies while zombies can cannibalize viewers. The word "zombie" is constantly inserted into a line known in a different way to try to laugh. <br /> <br /> The mere width and artificiality of the '50s' representation here can not irritate me. It is so stylized, evidently inspired by "Pleasantville", that it is more visible in waving markers from the 1950s than in reality reminiscent of anything that could happen between 1950 and 1959. about it, as if the movie boasted emptiness and thoughtlessly about how more open, mundane and better are the 2000s. <br /> <br /> Because characters are such broad representations of the "types" of pop culture of the 1950s, it is difficult to develop many emotional investments in them. Each of them has several features of characters cast on him - Helen is obsessed with appearances, and Bill loves golf and his haunted by the fact that he had to kill his father - but they remain quite two-dimensional. The performances within this bad letter are fine. The best of them is Billy Connolly as Fido zombie, who according to the tradition of Boris Karloff in "Frankenstein" actually gives character and compassion to a green monster who can not speak. <br /> <br /> There are small pieces of not very subtle allegory cast - for fetishism, racism, classicism, war paranoia, et cetera, but none of them really work at the comprehensive level, and filmmakers do not; really stick to anything. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie does not really miss the joke "Look! Zombies in 'Leave it to Beaver!' For a good hour and a half.
