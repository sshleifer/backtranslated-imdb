The inspiration was the premise of Afro-American woman Scrooge in a modern, fighting with the city, but there is nothing else in this film. Here, Mrs. Scrooge is a skimpy banker who uses employees and clients in a largely poor and black neighborhood. There is no doubt about the good intentions of the people involved. Part of the problem is that the plot roots do not translate well to the urban scene of the movie, and the script does not work properly. Moreover, the constant message of sharing and giving is repeated so endlessly, the audience will get tired of it before the film reaches its known end. It's a movie with a message that does not know when to end. In the title role, the talented Cicely Tyson gives a too uptight performance, and sometimes the lines are difficult to understand. Charles Dickens' novel has been adapted so many times that its adaptation in a way that makes it fresh and accurate, despite a very important message.
