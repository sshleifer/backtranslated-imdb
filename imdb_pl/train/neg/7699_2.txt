I was expecting a comedy like "Big Mama." Instead, the movie was a bizarre mix of comedy, drama and love story. <br /> <br /> This film has three threads: The first includes Madea and her foster child. The second concerns a woman engaged to a rich man who uses her. The third concerns the relationship between a single mother with two children and a single father. <br /> <br /> There are very few comedies in the film. There are also some very twisted messages in the film. For example, Madea beats the replacement child with a belt (in a comedy fashion) to convince the child to straighten out. The child actually turns around. Apparently, it pays to beat children. <br /> <br /> There are plots dealing with the rape of children (with the consent of the mother). There are scenes with old men who watch young girls who are related to them. (Ogling takes place during the family reunion). The movie jumps from the plot to the story so that you are always in balance. Is it a comedy, a love story or a drama? In fact, it's nothing ... except for the loss of time and money.
