The problem with the book "Memoirs of a Geisha" is that it had Japanese surfaces, but under the surface it was the way of thinking of an American man. Reading a book is like watching a great ballet with great music, sets and costumes, but performed by animals in the yard dressed in these costumes - characters were so far away from Japanese ways of thinking. <br /> <br /> The movie is not about Japan or a real geisha. This is a story of a few mistaken views of Americans about Japan and geishas filtered through their own ignorance and misperceptions. So what is this movie if it's not about Japan or geisha? Is it a pure fantasy, how many people have said? Yes, but why do you do it in American fantasy? <br /> <br /> There were so many missed opportunities. Imagine a culture in which there is no puritanical separation, no connotations of sin about sex. Sex is natural and normal. How is sex treated in this film? Well. As if it was dirty. The closest scene of sex in the movie is Sayuri's wrinkling nose and grimacing with distaste for five seconds, as if a man trying to put it down has dropped a handful of cockroaches on her crotch. <br /> <br /> Does anyone really like sex in this movie? No. It is said that one character is dissolute, but we only see that he pushes a lover, because it looks like he does not want to be caught doing something dirty. Such typical American puritanism does not happen in the film about the Japanese geisha. <br /> <br /> Did Sayuri, for the first time, admire an old coder after her cherry was sold at the auction? No. It lies there like a cold piece of meat on a piece of cutting. Of course, she should not enjoy it. And that's what I mean in this movie. Why could not they give her something to please? Why does all sex have to be sinful and bad? <br /> <br /> Behind Mameh, the chairman was the secret patron of Sayuri and as such he was for the auction of her virginity. He could have faked the auction and won it himself. Nobu did not even bid. Why, then, did the chairman let the old kodesh win and the stinking stench of an old man, touch his naked body with his fingers? Will any woman really forgive this man? <br /> <br /> Let's try to understand it. Following Mameha, the chairman took a debt to train the geisha Sayuri. To regain his debts, the president ordered Sayuri to sell to Dr. Crab. Through Mameha, the chairman sold sexual favors to Sayuri to the old man so that the chairman could make some money on her. The chairman was not her patron. He was her pimp! A romantic love story. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is great, but it resembles the beauty of a very attractive, appealing transvestite, whose voice, appearance and every touch are exciting. But under this very feminine surface is an ominous secret. Under the improperly appearing Japanese surface of the film lurks an ominous secret that the heart, soul, spirit and core of this film are completely American and male. It is not the best thing if you try to be different than lying, distortion and terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> Some contrasts between Japan and MOAG: <br /> <br /> Japanese style ?? Sophisticated, elegant simplicity. Style MOAG ?? Beijing Opera. <br /> <br /> Japanese geisha ?? Hair swept away. MOAG geisha ?? Loose hair that must have broken in a thick paste of white make-up. <br /> <br /> Japanese shaved ice - Japanese people are rather strict towards seasonal ceremonies. Shaved ice is only a summer feast. MOAG shaved ice - Chairman is buying Chiyo, young Sayuri played wonderful Suzuka Ohgo, this feast during the cherry blossoming season. This thought made my whole body tremble with cold. <br /> <br /> Japanese geisha ?? Trained and qualified artists. MOAG geisha - whores. <br /> <br /> Japanese wind treatment - used in summer, because hearing a sound that makes the Japanese feel a bit cooler thanks to the wind. MOAG wind chime - door bell! If someone stood in front of someone else's home and made sounds with wind gong, he would be considered a madman, not as an entrance. <br /> <br /> Japan? Focus on interpersonal relations, group-oriented. MOAG ?? "I want life that is mine" American individualism. <br /> <br /> Japanese traditional dance? Sophisticated elegance. Almost geometric and mechanical precision. MOAG dance ?? Martha Graham is going crazy on LSD, dressed in a not-too-good white Japanese funeral shroud. Performed by a geisha on a ramp in a place that looks like a strip club? Hahaha! Did the strip club conduct most of their research about the geisha? <br /> <br /> Fire in a Japanese home? Setting or even lighting a fire is worse than murder because it creates such a serious threat to the community. Fires can break through these wooden villages, cities and cities by destroying hundreds or thousands of homes and killing as many people as possible. Fire MOAG house - Perfect complement to the battle scene, but has no consequences, and because it is no longer needed, fire out of control miraculously escapes. Technically, the film ended here because Sayuri would have been ostracized and joined her sister among those who had never been heard. At this point, Arthur Golden and Rob Marshall should be banished. <br /> <br /> Enough. The film stinks.
