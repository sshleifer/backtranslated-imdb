The King Maker is a film about a series of real (needed quotes) events that took place during the Portuguese occupation in Indochina. <br /> <br /> Although the costumes and the direction of art are commendable, the film still does not impress the viewer. In particular, the acting was very poor. Some actors try to stop tears, and the accents, both true and false, are extremely annoying. The plot was too stupid and too stupid to be true and seemed more like a history lesson. The film could not even capture this kind of royal and century-old air and looked rather like an unsuccessful attempt to create an Asian version of Elizabeth. <br /> <br /> Say last? The costumes and the artistic direction give the film a breath of freshness, but the execution was very poor, and the actors could not even give natural emotions. In short, the movie sounded more like a hullabaloo than a script.
