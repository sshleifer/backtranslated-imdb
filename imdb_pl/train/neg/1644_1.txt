The worst movie I've ever seen. I thought nothing would ever dethrone the hero of the last action, but it's easy. The film consists of about 3 individual guys who meet on Sunday to discuss their sexual escapades from the weekend. The fourth guy - who is married and - who once was part of a group, appears and talks about what he and his wife are doing. Nothing works in this movie. Jokes are not funny, but they are repeated throughout the movie. The big kicker at the end of the movie is funny. Avoid at all costs.
