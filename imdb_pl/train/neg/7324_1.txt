Being a graduate of film studies, I would like to think that I have seen a variety of films, some good and bad, but I must say that the "summer rain" is definitely a worse movie I have ever seen! I chose this movie in the hope that it would be a great British classic, such as "Secrets and Lies" or "Lockstock", but oh no, it was so bad that my flat friends and I ended up laughing and curling up with this funny acting and a tacky script (reminded me of the bad school production of "theater in education"). The main heroes Michelle and Gary began to annoy us from the very beginning. "Michelle", the main character who lives with two friends, has a face type that you will never get bored with, and Gary was so wet (tearing up every 5 minutes with tears) that at the end of the movie I really did not care about any of them. All I could think of was "I paid 3 pounds for this pile." I never wrote a review before, but after watching this movie, it encouraged me to warn people about this catastrophic production. So please avoid at all costs. Thank you for reading.
