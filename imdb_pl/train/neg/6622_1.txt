I, like many other Bachchana fans, are looking forward to Sholay's remake. This movie was not that. Thank God they would not let them use the name "Sholay" in the title of the movie. Ram Gopala's remake is not worth the title. Working with cameras, locations, costumes, dancing completely out of the scene, dialogue all combined to create the worst movie I've ever seen. You wonder if the cast of the actors agreed to make this movie because they needed money, and Ram Gopal paid a lot of money for the cast. The only unpaid actor, an ant, was the only resemblance to the first movie. Abishek's role was completely absurd, did he need money to pay for the wedding with Ash? Save your money, your mind and your time, do not worry about this movie or DVD when it comes out.
