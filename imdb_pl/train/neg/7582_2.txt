High heels are tricks. They can lift women (or dress up men) at newly discovered heights, introduce a sharp style and bring a touch of gentle elegance. Alternatively, they can be a dangerous foot pain that will inevitably lead to travel, falls and ultimate tragedy. Tacones lejanos is a more disappointing journey than the stylish high riser. <br /> <br /> The drama of Almodóvar's mother and daughter is certainly stylish, but when it comes to the story, it's a language-related and boring thing full of confusing, complex characters that never fully engage or make sense. A few moments of comedy aside, Tacones lejanos is simply not interesting. The best piece comes first in a wonderfully macabre case of murder arranged by a child. From this amazing piece of black comedy, we look up, but then the movie comes to life. <br /> <br /> There are enough solid performances and there is some stylish artistic direction you can expect from Almodóvar, but otherwise Tacones lejanos is not an impressive piece of Spanish cinema. With a story about murder, show business, femininity, a broken mother-daughter relationship and a character who is alternately a judge, a transvestite and a police informer, it could have been a melodramatic power. Instead, he is poor. High Heels stumble for sure.
