I grew up in Baptist and I know the story that this movie tries to tell, although I do not believe in this story anymore. I will give kudos a movie for being as good as the average movie of the week. Slightly interesting, mediocre acting, a bit slow, the script is predictable, the music is juicy and is somewhat melodramatic. And all the people who remain must be the purest non-Christians. Not one word of curse from any of them. But I laughed loudly when an actor playing a man who runs the UN proclaimed "nuclear" as "nu-cuerier," just like Bush. Is there any Christian code of honor that requires that if Bush claims that he is also called by God, then all Christians must hide their ignorance by mistakenly pronouncing the word in the same way in which they act? LOL! After all, I really could not take the film seriously. After the "nu-cu-ler" incident, the film began to seem to be packed, manipulative propaganda. I was looking for something brave. I was actually looking for something that would make me think, but I did not find it here. If you're looking for mindless entertainment, stop here - it's good to kill a rainy afternoon. But if you are looking for intelligence, look elsewhere.
