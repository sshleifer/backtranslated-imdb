I had high hopes related to this film. I thought the premise is interesting. I went through it even though I found acting, with the exception of Helena Bonham Carter, nothing extraordinary. All the time I was hoping that my time would pay off, but in the end I wondered why they even took the trouble. Maybe in the version of George Orwell it is worth passing the message. If this movie did anything, it inspired me to read Orwell's classics. It's hard for me to believe that his story may be as disappointing as this adaptation. If the filmmaker's message is: "mundane life is worth living," well, they did. I recommend this movie to anyone; 101 minutes of my life were wasted.
