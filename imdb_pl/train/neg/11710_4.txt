There's only one reason to watch this movie if you're not associated with one of the stars or the producer: actress Nichole Hiltz. It is a show in this slow and wildly unbelievable story of revenge. The film, directed by Simon Gornick, plays Joyce Hyser as a betrayed wife who decides to take revenge on her married spouse. Oh, but not conventional means. He plans a total guerrilla war and recruits the evil girl Nichole Hiltz as his chosen weapon. He wants Nichole (as Tuesday) to get closer to his former (handsome but boring Stephan Jenkins, who should stick to the music) to embarrass him and ruin his life. David DeLuise is good in a few short moments, and the old star of Crime Story, Anthony Dennison, has almost nothing to do, but he complains. On the other hand, Hiltz appears at different times as sexy and funny, and then angry and devious. It also cope well with sensitivity and "maybe a bit psychotic". It's also quite hot (though it does not show any naughty pieces), so you can understand how it could reach every guy to whom it is directed. But in this movie performance is a bit wasted, which is not sharp enough and interesting to recommend.
