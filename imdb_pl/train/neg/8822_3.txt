Depending on your own state of mind while watching this, "Christmas Evil" can turn out to be an ambitious and innovative psychological thriller OR one of the most pathetic and annoying lame Christmas slavers. Personally, I am tempted to choose the last one because I did not bother with any research and simply expected a cheesy and undemanding 80's slasher with nutcase in a Santa Clause costume. Wrong! The film actually deals with a guy named Harry Stadling; who is obsessed with Christmas, works in a rubbish factory and thinks that it is his duty to establish on Christmas Eve who deserves gifts and who deserves to be punished. Harry's problems began when he was a witness to Nicholas? his dad, of course, in a costume ?? caress his mother's naked legs in a tender young age. Then he grew up on social outcast, to the annoyance of his younger brother, who must do one day (holi). I fully understand why some fans appreciate this somewhat eccentric horror, but does it really have to be so boring? There are several long and seemingly endless parts of the film in which nothing happens. I can forgive modesty and scandalous bloodshed, but this film does not even benefit from the disturbing atmosphere or the unexpectedly mad twists (with the exception of the final, I must admit). In addition, I would take this concept more seriously if a mad hero focused on lethal punishment of naughty children! It does not kill or kill badly behaving adults. How should you seriously approach the controversial and original Christmas thriller when Santa Claus does not even commit one unhappy murder? That would make Christmas Evil a classic, while now it's just a forgotten and pathetic bit of rubbish.
