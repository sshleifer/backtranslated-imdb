The bad news is still terrible. I gave him 2, because sometimes some of this lousy slapstick parody seems to be fun. <br /> <br /> It should be better than "Mulva, Zombie Ass Kicker", and progress should be rewarded. Or maybe I drank heavily when I watched him and felt generous. Regardless, "2" is. <br /> <br /> Maybe the best thing about this movie is that it's pretty fast. It gets elements from most of the key Kill Bill I and II themes and fights scenes, hacks them, stupid down, blots the dialog box, and turns the whole mess into about an hour of really horrible amateur video. <br /> <br /> It's best to burn a lot of power if you want to enjoy it. And move this DVD back to the video store on time! You really hate yourself if you have to pay a late fee.
