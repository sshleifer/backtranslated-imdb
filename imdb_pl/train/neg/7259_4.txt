This is definitely one of the most exciting films from the 1970s and the most noteworthy is the start of the Bigfoot hysterical decade. Also noteworthy are the small elements of madness throughout the film, especially when the dark, moody first half is replaced with MUSIC INTERLUDE of all things (as another user noticed, one of the songs is dedicated to the character, Travis Crabtree, who kicks for a while, then ... comes out, never seen again). Although it is painfully dated, I am still a funny frightening movie that I can show to children, and anyone who likes either Bigfoot Lore or Hillbilly Culture from the '70s will certainly do it. My favorite part: the guy is so afraid that he jumps his head through the door (!?), And the narrator explains that he lost consciousness because of the "shock". I'd say breaking the door with your head is more likely why you lost consciousness, but whatever. <br /> <br /> 4/10 stars, or 7/10, if you like bad Americany.
