I really can not believe I spent $ 5 on this movie. I'm a big zombie fanatic and I thought the movie could not be so bad. Did he have zombies in him? Was I wrong! Honestly, the movie had its moments ... I thought it was cool when the guy tore his head off, but that's all. In general, I think it would be nicer to slide the razor blade off my naked nut into a vat of vinegar, then watch the movie again. The movie could be better if we could see some boob, but I had to watch trailers of other films made by this company to see it. Buyers be careful ... unless you're in masochism.
