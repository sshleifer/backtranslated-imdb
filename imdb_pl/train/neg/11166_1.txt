I am sure that the character of Nacho Libre is absolutely funny in the nooks of Jacek Blacks, but it is not. You can tell ol Jacks that he has a whale of time when he plays a smarmistic, slimy Mexican brother with dreams of becoming a wrestler, but this movie is a total failure in almost every department. I just sat there for most of the movie thinking "Is this supposed to be fun" and "Is this guy from Tenacious D right?" The truth is that this movie has nothing to offer. AT ALL! It's a bad script with shitty characters and really inept action and direction. You will watch the endless moments in which you think something funny will happen, but it simply is not. I was bored stupid about 10 minutes, but I'm sure he would get up. No. 90 minutes later I barely managed to stop the aneurysm, it was so painful. <br /> <br /> Let's remind ourselves years ago, when you saw something with your favorite actor in it, even some of them really early in the days when they were famous, and you would be really embarrassed that this actor was so heavy . This is. <br /> <br /> I liked some of Jack Black's earlier movies, such as Shallow Hall, and I really can not wait to see Pick of Destiny, but come. If you do this to us again, Jack. I need to go out there and stick your knee or something. At least seriously talk to. <br /> <br /> I know it's a clich√©, but this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and for many reasons ....
