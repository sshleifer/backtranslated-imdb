Not as bad as you've heard. There are some fun parts, and Affleck and Applegate have quite a good chemistry. In particular, Applegate is attractive and sympathetic to Affleck's love interest. James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara are consummate professionals. They're pretty good at everything. Ultimately, "Survival" is not the worst holiday movie you'll ever see. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's out of focus and most of the comedy is forced. Attempts at dark humor give way to nonsense. Affleck strives hard to be charmingly spastic and overly enthusiastic, but she is anxious. The nature of his character's caricature brings relief when he is seen next to Gandolfini's and O'Hara's more subdued, credible performances. Even thanks to the relaxed standards of holiday movies, you never fully buy Affleck by "renting" this family to the X-mas. <br /> <br /> There are also scenes that border on surreal strangeness. The Christmas Eve scene is full of incestuous humor (a son was discovered looking at the naked, provocative pictures of the mother), which is not only funny or credible but disturbing. <br /> <br /> What's worse, the colors in this movie are muddy, almost colorless. The set, on which the majority of the film takes place, looks stage and cheap. <br /> <br /> "Survive" is mainly interesting as the fourth in a row of misfires (Paycheck, Gigli, Jersey Girl and this) for Affleck. It will turn out how permanent the damage will be.
