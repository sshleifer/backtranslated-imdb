Even Steve Martin and Dan Aykroyd could not save this movie before submitting an emu egg. Based on the classic Phil Silvers series, he bombed because: A) It was updated to the 90s, and B) The simple premise of the TV series turned into a confusing, weak and stupid scenario. > The original television series used a small cast of talented actors to present nice characters playing simple but hilarious pranks. Extending this assumption to a film from the 90s required trouble and it shows. Nobody would be able to pay me enough to sit for the second time in this smelly one.
