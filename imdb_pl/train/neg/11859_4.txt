Well, it would be better if you planned to sit in this amateur, faint and twisted novel about a widowed middle-aged mother who has some more in common with her young adult or older teenage daughter than she would like. The mother set in Tunis turns around the apartment, gets disgusting and decides, though reluctantly (he just can not resist), put on a costume and dance in a local cabaret. Meanwhile, her daughter takes dance lessons. The common denominator is the band's drummer from Tunisia. This movie is filled with fill so much that I watched DVDs in x2 and read the subtitles, quickly scrolled through most of the usual dance and long shots of walking (go everywhere) and more walking and just sleeping on x4 just for this boring, uninhibited, low budget movie in which some people have quite good criticisms. Conjecture. (DOWN-)
