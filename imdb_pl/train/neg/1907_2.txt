This terribly bad piece of rubbish is racist, sexist and homophobic at once, while pretending to be extremely chic and sophisticated. Cruel performances, a trashy scenario and boring direction make this film bypass. The two scenes were particularly offensive - the one in which Schaech scrubs his tongue after kissing another man (could it really be so disgusting), and the scene where Eastwood is kissed by Schaech's best friend who pretends to be a Russian. After leaving the room, he calls "F ** King Aliens"! It's just that she is a cultural artist who dreams of living in Paris!?! <br /> <br /> Jonathon Schaech can be a nice actor on the screen and he is amazingly handsome. It is a pity that he did not learn more from working with the latest gay director Greggi Araki on an earlier film and tries to save this film from falling into a series of gay stereotypes and mud of homophobia.
