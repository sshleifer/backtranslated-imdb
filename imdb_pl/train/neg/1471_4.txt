This kind of movie has already become an old hat, right? The whole point is that the nostalgia for the syrup appeared in some feedback loop. <br /> <br /> It certainly sounds like a good idea: a great band, good gags and a human drama about what could / could have been. Unfortunately, there is no central event that links them together, as it was in "The Big Chill," one of those groundbreaking films that have produced movies that imitate such as this one. In the end, you want to see more than one or two specific people instead of making short shots of everyone. The surface it creates is not just annoying but annoying. The script below the average does not help.
