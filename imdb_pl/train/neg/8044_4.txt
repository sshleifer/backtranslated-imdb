Okay, I watched the movie a little over 2 years ago, and now I pulled it out of the dusty shelf to watch it again and I have to say that I really think this movie is good. This movie caused a storm because the bootleg I Know What You Did Last Summer 3, like Final Stab, was aimed at Scream 4, and this movie is not so bad. I mean, he had flaws and of course it would be ridiculous to release it in cinemas, but still the midnight popcorn is not half bad. He has a bit of fear, and some really hot women can add. Besides, he presents Joey Lawrence's new, powerful look, though of course he did not even bring him any big Hollywood roles ...... I feel bad about this man, he had such a career at the beginning and in the mid-90s with a flower , some Disney movies and eternal performances by the Lawrence brothers ... Joey Lawrence played a little in the sitcom scene, but then, as in a 360-degree turn, his career went south, making only low-budget movies like this one. <br /> <br /> In the film you are also striking, makes you think between the crew, there really is a secret that someone knows to finally disappoint to discover the secret. It also throws you out of the killer, I came up with the idea, but I still do not think that the killer was who he was, but his motives combined with the mystery were a great disappointment. Was there any secret that was released? This movie could be one of the better rated movies. But I'm also a nerd on college topics, and in college I spent a spring break in a house on the beach with the size of a residence similar to that here, so I just felt the sentiment for this movie. <br /> <br /> And so slasher flick. Good for the movie at midnight.
