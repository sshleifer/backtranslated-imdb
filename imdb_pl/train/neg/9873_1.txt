I watched it with my mother and we were like ... <br /> <br /> What the hell? We do not understand it at all. I may have it wrong, but the chair had something to do with the death of that woman's father. This movie was horrible! This is not a movie for those who like a good movie of the suspense. Bad transition movie! * shakes a cane in the movie * I never see her again. And I'm also a big fan of life movies! They must stop trying to make movies from books. It drives me crazy! <br /> <br /> And Whit was ugly, and yet he loves him more than Hugh, who was a bit nicer looking. : 1/10
