Nacho Vigalondo is very famous in Spain. It's kind of a bad showman who can make you feel sick ... Very embarrassing. Nacho recorded a few commercials on TV, I remember the ones in which Nacho was looking for Paul Mc Carney in Madrid (the advertisement concerned the collection of Mc Carney's discs). <br /> <br /> This little movie is like the Nacho commercial: bad plot, bad direction and horrible performances. I can not believe that such a disgusting movie was at The Kodak Theater. Biedny Oscar ... <br /> <br /> Nacho could have made this film because of his wife, producer 7:35, a woman very well connected with the businessmen of Spanish television.
