This movie is a disgusting scenario of bad acting and bad scenography, as well as cheesy lines and a lame story. But watching is so much fun. Everything is fun. The basic intrigue is a group of future scientists who go back in time to catch an evil collaborator who intends to destroy them all. They will catch up with him in 1146. The "futuristic" scientists lab of 2033 is a 1980s style room with lots of "futuristic" flashing buttons and a time capsule that looks like a lawn shed. Actors pass their lines without enthusiasm, which is not difficult to understand, given that lines are usually shakers, such as "I checked everything twice!" Double checked twice? He checked it four times? Not only this, but in the first five minutes they give you the whole premise of the film and continue the rapid pace of fire until they hit the medieval part. When Roger Corman ran out of money. And he had to stop traveling in time and consequently different sets. The medieval set is a comic mishmash from the end of the tenth century to the sixteenth century. Every costume they could find used. I am guessing that the mail was not in the budget, because everyone is wearing sequined shirts dressed as armor. Combat scenes are funny, and men reluctantly throw themselves on cardboard swords with abandon and die in mortal throws with fry. It sounds really horrible, but I like it every time I watch it. Same lines are enough for you to fit, and everything else connects, creating a fantastic movie B, which, if you're a connoisseur of kitsch movies, I would suggest that you see it. And when you do, read the Unknown Movies review. I love to listen, as all the funny, really horrible parts of the movie point to.
