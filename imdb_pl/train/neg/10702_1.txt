Dialogue: stilted, clichd; Acting: hammy, clich√©d; Story: predictable, stereotypical. <br /> <br /> What do Christopher Plummer Nastassia Kinski do in the "B" garbage? Plummer was well-established decades before this movie was made, Kinski had behind him masterpieces such as "Tess" and "Cat People" ... They had to be desperate. <br /> <br /> All the bad guys have accents of the bad guy - * bad * accents of the evil guy! (Especially Plummer! Where * did * he learned to do "German"?), And most of them also have taunting bad guys. Innocent viewers exaggerate with panic enough to make you laugh. A good guy experiences, among others: * a throwing knife 5 'buried deep in his arm - he just pulls it out, and seconds later he uses his arm without any difficulty; * fire marines machine guns (I think someone referred to .50) in the leg, which he solves, tying a bandage around the trouser leg, and then barely has a limp grip; * a few fist fights, in which he keeps many blows in the face, as well as running in the skull - first to the door frame, * fall backwards, from what looks like the third floor, to the pavement, without the slightest trace of a sprained ankle or any other minor inconvenience . The script has exactly three clever lines, the rest of the time is so boring and boring. <br /> <br /> OK, not everything is so bad, Plummer introduces a certain class to his role and is undoubtedly the best actor in this film. a lot, but he can do a soulless villain without resorting to the ham techniques that most villains use to draw their Ve haff vays and meance lines with some danger, but you are always aware that you are watching Christopher Plummer playing the villain. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a terrible waste of time. Acting, as it is, is a kind of films from the 1970s, in which wooden deliveries meet with very fake scenes of Bruce Lee's fight, but it is not even as good as Roger Moore's movie 007 or Bruce ' Lee. Do not worry.
