Wow, the most horrible thing about this episode was the price of houses from 40 years ago. I will tell you that I am not a fan of episodes told. If history / actors / etc are worth their salt, they should be able to convey most of the narrative without having to read it, they reminded me of personalities who can not come up with a cuff, but rely on teleprompters. Psychobabble was boring and boring, but some like it, it's not my tea with a cup. They could keep the narrative, but at least make it more credible and interesting if it came from a psychiatrist or perhaps a journalist or something. Small things like Peugeot at home, which has a single semi-circle driveway, but it seems that he parked his car on the tree under which he stood, because nowhere he can be seen on the road or on the property. Sloppy edition, when you enter the driveway (which seems to be the 100th time) exactly who are these two guys you see on the 24th of March 30 towards the car, when he drives into the driveway of an abandoned house? The dolly approaches were also exaggerated, as some students of Jr. High Drama, who for the first time discovered the zoom function in their camera. I could split up, but it can become almost boring, like this episode. It kept going, and the real purpose seemed to be the use of absolutely all the footage that Elaine had done with the leading Newport cabriolet. I fully expected that I would see the Chrysler logo and a nice jingle game, while the voice spoke to us about the 8-track player, the automatic top, etc. The only good thing I have to say about it is that it ends abruptly. No loose ends are bound, nothing is explained or finished. Few people will notice, I suspect most have already changed the channel or dozed to the end.
