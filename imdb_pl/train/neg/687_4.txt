I'm a big fan of Fred MacMurray and Carole Lombard. And besides, Charles Butterworth (a very pleasant supporting actor) was in this movie, so why did not I like it especially ?! Well, despite the good cast, this is one of the poorest written and most banal "A pictures" I've ever seen. Given the talent and money spent on making this film, it is shocking how much writing was written. I knew that the movie would be boring, when each time at the beginning of the movie I realized that exactly what would happen next - and I was always right! And not because I am a "film scholar", but because there was almost no imagination or effort in it. In fact, it seemed that the movie was just a long string of stereotypes that were combined! Besides, it irritated me a bit that Fred treated Carole badly throughout the movie, and yet, according to the convention, she ran to him in the end. Uggh! There is more uncertainty in Lassie's film ("will he bring people to save Timmy or the rope they hang from a break?"). <br /> <br /> In spite of the very, very tired and stereotypical scenario, there were a few positives about the film. It was nice to see Fred looking like a broken one at the end of the movie - it was pretty reliable and he looked like he had not eaten, shaved or slept for several days. In addition, Charles Butterworth's "prattle" provided several gentle moments. But all this was not enough to make this movie look different than "movie B". It is a pity that it could have been much better.
