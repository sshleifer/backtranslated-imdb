This low-budget story of Horror B comes with all the amenities - crazy scientist with helper, malicious corporate greed of the pharmaceutical industry, eccentric and extreme genetic engineering and information technology .... can not abandon it. <br /> <br /> Start with a strange sequence of feverish-looking nameless sailors who stupidly decide to swim in the waters near an unknown island and end up with buddies rife with shark hammers ..... <br /> <br / > Cut into a weak history from the past suggesting a fall in the stocks of a generic pharmaceutical corporation that motivates its shaky man, quoting the general manager who is about to offer an unpaid offer from a former employee / researcher who has been dismissed as a research manager and who turns out to be nut ... of course (Herbert West's total bathtub). He offers a new stem cell technology that could produce tons of cash ... or it seems ... It attracts several employees to his island Moreau-ish (it had to be an impressive exit package when he was allowed to afford the island) to confirm your scientific discoveries, including the president and, incidentally, were the fianc√©e son of a mad scientist now changed the shark (how convenient) .... <br /> <br /> Plan in a sense aims to light the lost love between old marriages, and at the same time get revenge on former colleagues for its ending. (Sheez, how can this guy be bitter? He has his own "island with friggen ...". <br /> <br /> Soon, they all run away (from the endless stock of bodyguards with heavy weapons, from mutant plants - can it exist an unexplored island without plants that eat a man ?, from the appetite of a shark son to a slaughter, from daddy's breeding plans and from the lack of a cell phone signal) ... and everyone must learn to work together get off the island alive! <br /> <br /> Will anyone run away? Will there be a new genre? Watch it and find out. <br /> <br /> There is some entertainment value in this video, but do not expect too much ... for a real Combs fan you can not miss it. /> <br /> Do not say I did not warn you.
