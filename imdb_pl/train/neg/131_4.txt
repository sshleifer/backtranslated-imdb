So where are the cannibals? Intrigued by the title and appeal of the "real cannibal" of this film, they will be disappointed. Instead, we were shown a strange man and his second visit to the village of Papua New Guinea full of natives, one of whom was his lover several decades earlier. Man, Tobias Schneebaum, is a New York Jew, and somehow, it is related to a document that appears in his yamice in several scenes. <br /> <br /> There are no real cannibals here: only stories given to some natives and Tobias himself. Not all together a bad movie. Very interesting and great photos. Schneebaum remains very nice and gives us a fascinating look at life that is as far from Western civilization as you can get. <br /> <br /> This is not what he claims to be on the cover and a plot summary. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 children.
