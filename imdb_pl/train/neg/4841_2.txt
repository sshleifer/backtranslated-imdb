REALLY??? <br /> <br /> I am really amazed to see great reviews here! <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's one big pathetic, grainy, clich√©. I would laugh a lot and laugh, but I was on a date with a former military guy. I could not hide my other answer, BOREDOM. Yes, I think I liked my date, "good old boy". This is not a compliment. I know that the actor wants to work ... Good for others. But Ralph, come on. <br /> <br /> It was a painful irritation from Ralph. I only vote for 2, because Ralph looked so SAVING. But I have to beg, Ralph, how could you? And why?? <br /> <br /> I'm going to watch The End of The Affair to heal and recover ...
