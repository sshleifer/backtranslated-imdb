The scientist (unfortunately, John Carradine) learns how to bring the dead back to life. However, they return with marble faces. Ultimately, all this leads to a catastrophe. <br /> <br /> A boring, completely predictable exit from the 1940s. It was stupid when I was a child, but now I'm bored. I had to fight to not fall asleep! With one exception, acting is terrible. Such hopeless boring actors! Hopeless. <br /> <br /> There are some good things about it: Carradine, despite the script, in fact gives very good results. And there are several gentle moments in which the spirit walks on the walls. There is also one of the worst knockouts in the history of cinema. Still, none of this is fun enough to get through this. Avoid.
