Poor Paul Mercurio. After landing as Scott Hastings in the Strictly Ballroom, the best film ever, he managed to make a lot of trash. None of the characters in this movie is unlikely or even hateful, but running Mercurio is the kind of person you prefer to ignore - totally unbearable and carries the OVERCOATS. A big mistake in costume design.
