European Vacation (aka National Lampoon's European Vacation) is the weakest holiday film (the first and third best film). While Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo return as Clark and Ellen Griswold (with new actors in the roles of Russ and Audrey Griswold), this time they receive a weaker scenario with very bad dialogue. It causes suffering of stimulation, and jokes are not funny at all. More specifically, what really causes this movie to suffer is the fact that "jokes" as they are are simply pasted together in a cobblestone script, instead of a central story like the other 3 holiday movies. Well, they can not win all of them. 4 out of 10.
