Let me start by saying that I saw this movie as part of the occasion. I really got bored with one good day in 1997, so I went cycling to a movie rental company. I asked the official what was the worst film he had in stock. Without hesitation, he took me to the Lucky Stiff. He told me he would give up the loan for $ 1 (he said it would be wrong to charge extra) if I promised to watch the whole movie. So watch it, for free ... <br /> <br /> This movie is awful. Even a terrible God. I do not have to go into the details of the plot, read other reviews. Jokes do not make sense. Acting was terrible. I know it was supposed to be a comedy, but the main character's stupidity was exhausting. You can try to watch it as something you can laugh at, but it's so bad that it's not even funny. Avoid!
