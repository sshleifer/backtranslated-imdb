A friend asked me to read his script, which was chosen by the film studio. To say that one of the most inept and bland scripts I've ever read would be a bold understatement. However, I never told him that. Why? Because in a world where films like "While it was out" can be lit in green and attract an Oscar-winning star like Kim Basinger, a scenario without character, content and common sense does not guarantee that it will not be sold. br /> <br /> As noted by many other reviewers, "While She Was Out" is a terribly insufficiently written movie Woman-in-Peril, who abused Basinger, a housewife chased by four unlikely hoods on Christmas Eve. Every reason is justified, from poor dialogue and bad acting to staggering logical errors, but Basinger is such an interesting actress, and the premise is not without promise. Here are some things that struck me: <br /> <br /> 1) I do not care how much we should think that her husband is a jerk, the house is a mess with toys. Since when has the children been used to let the children rise after each other? <br /> <br /> 2) Racially diverse gangs are rare everywhere except Hollywood, where they are usually the only racially balanced groups on the screen. <br /> <br /> 3) Sure, the movie is stupid. But just as the innumerable "thrillers" in which I sat when women are portrayed as failing, helpless victims of male sadism. Stupid or not, I found it refreshing when I see a woman who draws from her best perpetrators. <br /> <br /> 4) I LOVED the ending! <br /> <br /> 5) Although the previous reviewer came up with this sentence, I really think that this movie should be repeated "The Red Toolbox of Doom".
