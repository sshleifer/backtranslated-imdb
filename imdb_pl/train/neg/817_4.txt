"You will not shoot these little creatures. First of all, they did not hurt you. Second, they can be radioactive. " Ah, joys of sci-fi 50s without a budget? Despite the strange jewel, Superman and Mole-Men are quite uninspiring, even with a 58-minute modest run. Is it outside the cheap cost (one shot of Superman flying is an incredibly inept frame of several animations) and quite boring, although it has a surprisingly altruistic message? silent Mole-Men, small actors with enlarged skulls and furs, who look more like Mr Mxyzptlk without a hat than underground creatures, freed from their underground world by oil wells are not malicious, but misunderstood, and George Reeves' Man of Steel tries to prevent the local small-town mob led by Jeff Corey from killing them. Perhaps an interesting counterpoint to the paranoid day, but with little more than good intentions to recommend it.
