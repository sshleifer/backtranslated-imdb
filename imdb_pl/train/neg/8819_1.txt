this is undoubtedly the worst most idiotic horrible piece I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> in this movie is a conspiracy that some guy goes crazy and dresses like Santa Claus and kills people BECAUSE he saw his mother give her father oral sex when he was dressed like Santa Claus. WHY IS WHY VENTILATED? Is it just me, is this the worst reason why somebody went crazy like EVER? and that's not the only thing. I am serious when I say that nothing is happening in this film. Nothing passed until about 1 hour and 15 minutes elapsed. <br /> <br /> there is a whole icy scene in which he sticks his black beard. THIS IS A LENGTH OF FRIGGIN MINUTE. WHO HELL WANT TO SEE THIS? However, I must say that the ending of this movie forced me to laugh. so if you see this movie on TV or get back in an hour and 20 minutes, just watch the worst end of the story. and I'm seriously thinking about it. <br /> <br /> it's not even that good, it's bad, it's boring, it's stupid, it made me want to break vcr. it just is not worth your time, I'm sure every other review mentioned it, but the actress who played her mother on Home Improvement was in this movie for a fraction of a second. WANT TO KNOW HOW IT IS BAD THIS FILM? RATHER WATCH HOME IMPROVEMENT FOR THE SECOND SIXTH HOURS, EVEN YET LOOK LIKE THIS FILM COVER.
