Not to be confused with Lewis Teague's "Alligator" (1980), which is actually a great movie, "Il Fiume Del Grande Caimano" laboriously ends the exotic trilogy that Sergio Martino made in the late 1970s (including the "L" Isola degli uomini pesce "and not so good" La Montagna del dio cannibale "). Following the scandalous plot of "SzczÄ™k", the script does not create tension that ever. Creation is ridiculous, and its victims are simply wicked. The poor melody of Stelvio Cipriani poorly illustrates the adventures of these stupid tourists from the very beginning as obvious elements of the reptile's meal. No emotions, actually no laughs! And we can find this pathetic movie quite funny if the natives' dialogues and appearance were not so clearly inspired by pure racism. Very soon the chuckle ends with a sour feeling that indicates such a condescending attitude. We could justify poorly made films and weak effects, but not such a mentality. Never!
