Recently, I managed to catch up with Marilyn Miller movies because they are not shown on TCM in the UK. I was intrigued for years because it was one of the 20's superstars. Some of the stars of this era, such as Jolson, are still shining, but not for Miller. this movie, as an audience, got tired of music, virtually all music numbers were removed. So we were left with a comedy from this period with a small real appeal. She received $ 500,000 for it, so I have only two applications. Either it was poorly served by the cinema or she had no talent. I think the truth is closer to the later one than the first one.
