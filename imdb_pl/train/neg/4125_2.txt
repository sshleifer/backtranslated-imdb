Damn it! What a terrible, terrible Spanish thriller! I've had it for about four years and finally started it that night. I watched an hour before bedtime. The whole thing intrigued me. I finished it last night and could not believe where I stopped it last night. I literally stopped it a second before the movie broke down completely. <br /> <br /> As I said, I was very puzzled and curious where this secret goes, but I stopped her when Simon received the package of the bar. I picked up when he opened the package to reveal a laser gun and then played a "dangerous" laser game. Whew! The big discovery is that the whole game is a terrorist plot, based on playing the role of suckers. Whew! It can be said that the Spanish industry was definitely behind the director Mateo Gil (co-author of two previous big hits of Amenabar). There is an excellent result and great photography. But this scenario reeks of stupidity. It's outside of me that someone has been sitting with a straight face for the past 40 minutes.
