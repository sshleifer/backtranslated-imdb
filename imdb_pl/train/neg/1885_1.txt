If you're looking for a movie that shows a senseless and boring middle class life entangled in a network of non-communication and false ideals, this is a movie for you. If also what the video engages and interests you, you should probably look elsewhere. There are many movies that do it much better. For example, try some darker Bergman movies. The director felt that to show the spiritual poverty of the middle class, he should subject the viewer to another tiring and boring incident after another, until the film reaches its winding and pathetic end. If you value your time, there are much better ways to spend two hours, such as Cleaning the house.
