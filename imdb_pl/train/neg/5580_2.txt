I like many actors / actresses involved in this project, so insulting by the movie was even worse than if they used the unknown. The main problem was this film, which was clearly a concept created for the baby boomer. 30 years NBC will probably make a movie like in the early 90's. I see now that a black family in which children are involved in la riot's and a white family, kids rebel and listen to grunge rock music. The soundtrack will contain bands like Nirvana, NWA, Public Enemy, Soundgarden, etc. as it will be just as bad as the 1960s and I guarantee that NBC will do it. See the biggest problem with pieces from the era, when you do buy chains, that when you live in a certain period of time, you do not think that I live in the 1960s or any other decade is fashionable in this retro style at the time. The next time someone does something like that, they should pay more attention to this project
