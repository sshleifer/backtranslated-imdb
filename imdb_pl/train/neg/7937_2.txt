After 30 seconds you realize that there is no real budget for this cheap knock-off. The story comes from great films such as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Hills have eyes. I like these movies, even if they are well copied (Wrong Turn, Timber Falls, Carver). <br /> <br /> But "Side Sho" is difficult to watch: the actors are really bad, the dialogue is bad, and the music is stupid and completely out of place. You do not care what happens to the heroes. The so-called bad guys are not at all interesting and rather stereotypical. And what about blood and blood? Well, there are some of them, although it is rather cheap and the action is very poor. 2 points, only for blood and blood, but I understand that it is not worth watching, even for dogs-gore.
