I chose this movie to replace the grim selection of daily television and go with my desire for femme fatales. Well, in the previous case it's better than television during the day .... although I'm not sure how much. <br /> <br /> It has its own points, but after about the first 20-30 minutes, good points diverge and one comes to the conclusion that they are watching a TV movie that has been made with little time to do something that will to stick together. In short, the scary Sci Fi channel type. <br /> <br /> He has his points like the future is dirty, as "Blade Runner" showed ..... of course, this is not "Blade Runner" "The captain looks like he feels like actor Robert Forster, the type of person you may want to be around. <br /> <br /> But unfortunately it ends up feeling like a bad "Andromeda", where the crew's muscles consist of weak copies of intelligent alien shooters, the mystic is the vampire Willow sexually intensified, and the new Captain as well it could well be like Jan-Michael Vincent running on "Dangerous Island" in "Banana Divisions"; he only put on a uniform with epaulets; he has very little right to it. Everyone runs with their version of power lances inside the ship, which looks very much like "Eureka Maru" because they are fighting against the class of "people" who occupy the universe and are divided into several different tribes or sects of different evolutionary features ....... like Nietzcheans in Andromeda. <br /> <br /> It may have the function of Michael Ironside's redemption, but after a while there is the feeling that he took part as a hoot! He probably had a good time, but it does not help the movie. <br /> <br /> It's ..... "OK." It's good that you can watch the DVD once without turning it off; if they watch it with ads, they will probably change the channel. You can watch it once .......... but a few hours later I wonder what made them watch it all. <br /> <br /> For me it was femme fatale. ............ when she fought.
