This is not only my contemplated verdict about this film, but also most of what was written about it. Now do not get me wrong either, I'm not a total philistine, I did not hate the movie, because it was not enough, like "police academy 9" or anything else, I'm happy about my high forehead or artistic stuff, I swear. <br /> <br /> "Magnolia" is weak and I am honestly surprised why it seems so. Long, lengthy, indulgent, nonsense nonsense from the beginning to the end, there is so little that you can credibly believe in the movie. There are enough high-class actors, and none of them achieves average or worse performance. What's more, my wife (admirer Tom Cruise) tells me that this is his best career. But the plot is so completely uninteresting, it revolves between the stories of several loosely connected characters at such a snail's pace that even when significant life-changing events are presented, they seem so pointless and uninteresting that you are calling for someone to blow themselves up or something. <br /> <br /> It does not help that none of the characters is easy to identify or empathize with (well, I did not think, but I do not like most people). They all play their not-so-large stories on a large scale, demonstrating their character flaws and emotions in more and more complex details and playing their deep and meaningful relationship to the nth degree with many wafer monologues on the way. Yadda yadda yadda. The soundtrack is also tragic, with the annoyingly annoying quality that I had so far considered exceptional in Alanis Morisette's music. <br /> <br /> In total, it was as nice three hours as forcing to repeatedly view the episode of "Friends", while the unhappy goat nanny intermittently intervenes in the ribs. A piece with frogs, however, is good.
