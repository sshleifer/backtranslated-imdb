As a youth pastor, I have heard good things about this film. Then I looked at him. Acting was not the best. This is excusable. This is a message that does not sound like giving Jesus your life and everything will change - you can do better, catch some amazing moments, stop burying, start making touchdowns and even play in the playoffs. All because Jesus magically transforms terrible, undersized weaknesses in American athletes. I laughed loudly when the trainer quoted excerpts from the scriptures to explain to the digger why he missed goals. But wait, that's not all. You will receive a completely new truck, a raise of 6000 USD, and you and your wife with infertility will suddenly end up pregnant - twice. Then you will win the state championship, because God helps the weak to dig the winning goal 12 meters farther than ever before - and to the wind, no less - all because "God wanted him to do it". The next year you will win the state championship again. None of these good things would happen if the band did not decide to follow Jesus, their whole heart. <br /> <br /> Here's what I took from the movie: God can do whatever he wants, whenever he wants to do it - and the point is to make our lives better, easier and more enjoyable. He chooses his favorite team and helps them win matches. On which Bible is this story based? I bet Saint Stephen wished he knew the keys to such a safe life before he was stoned. Someone should have done this film before 10 out of 11 apostles were killed for following Jesus. It would save them a lot of trouble.
