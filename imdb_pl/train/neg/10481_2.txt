The film is poorly manned, with the exception of some of the famous old Hollywood names. Other performances by unknown names (ie Jennifer Gabrielle) are not very inspiring. I have seen other films of this director, unfortunately this is one of his worst. Perhaps this is a reflection of the scenario? <br /> <br /> In a positive tone the performance of Kim Bassinger and Pata Morita saved the film from oblivion. However, I liked Pat more in the Karate Kid. There are many good films to see, in short, this one is not one of them. Save money and celluloid. <br /> <br /> Jason Vanness
