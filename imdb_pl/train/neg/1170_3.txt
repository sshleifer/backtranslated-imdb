As a fan of Eric Rohmer's research on the contemporary war between the sexes, I really wanted to see "The Lady and The Duke (L'Anglaise et le duc)", how he treated men and women in a real war, the French Revolution. <br /> <br /> The film looks beautiful, with each stage designed as a period painting, like a living picture. I expected many conversations, just like the Rohmer style. But maybe Rohmer was restrained, basing the script on the true woman's writings, which was why it was mainly the docudram version of "Scarlet Pimpernel." <br /> <br /> As awful as the excesses of Robespierre and others, some recognition that the French aristocrats were spoiled brats? I murmured to myself: "Marat, we are poor and the poor remain poor"; you could also choose a melody from "Les Miz". <br /> <br /> I was not as sympathetic as the central figure has to go back and forth between his house in the city and the country house to stay ahead of the revolution. At some point, her maid claims that the pantry is naked, but she certainly manages to make a decent meal. I just did not understand her, an English sympathizer who alternately rejects and defends his former lover and patron as he and the Revolution change their political direction; I think I should sympathize with its consequence more than with their political machinations, like the character from "The Scarlet Pimpernel". Hey, the only reason she did not come home was her disgrace after romance and the child with the Prince of Wales or someone else. <br /> <br /> Usually in the revolutionary period there are some changes in relations between men and women, but I have not seen it here. Once I went to Herbert Marcuse's lecture, which ended with a long question and question; the last question from an audience member much older than the rest of us, acolytes, damn it, had gray hair, "Why are the revolutionaries so bleak?" She was sung, and Marcuse did not deign to answer seriously - but that's the only thing I remember from the whole evening. Rohmer shows that counter-revolutionaries are also bleak and didactic. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 8/11/2002)
