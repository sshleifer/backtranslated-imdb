I think this movie was going to be shocking. But the only way it's really shocking is how shocking it is that it has been done ... and it just is. It's one and a half hours of torment. Even more for the viewer than for the film's heroes (five girls). <br /> <br /> Of course, the main characters get their damn piece in a bad way, which is basically okay, because it's a horror movie. And I (usually) like horror movies. I have no problem with violence in this type of films per se. However, all the violence in this film is endless. This is not a show except that it is simply grotesque. It's so bad that it even gets boring and very fast. <br /> <br /> The worst thing (if the above was not bad enough for you) about this movie is that they tried to copy the Blair Whitch Project, by filming with cheap handheld cameras. But (again the same) is endless. In "Blair Which", there is certainly an explanation, namely that they are with a camera looking for a Blair witch. There's no other explanation in this movie than: "Hey, yeah, we wanted it to LOOK LIKE, like Blair Whitch !!" Sound in the movie is also something that can be depressed. The girls are screaming so hysterically that you can not understand what they say many times. No effort has been made to make anything better, more sound or otherwise wise. <br /> <br /> There is finally a soundtrack, which is just as bad as the rest and different from a cheap euro house to the worst grungy hard-rock ... <br /> <br /> My advice: do not watch in ANY circumstances.
