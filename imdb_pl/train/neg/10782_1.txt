the only scenes that made me laugh, when the ones with Christopher Walken (the crazy film director) the rest of the movie was just boring. The first hour or something really is not happening. jones douglas is really hyperactive. what would happen to the main characters. If he really fell off the building in a suicide attempt, the movie could be more interesting to watch.
