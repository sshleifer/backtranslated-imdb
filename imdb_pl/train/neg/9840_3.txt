Bizarre, independent, theatrical, Christian Slater - these are all the trailers that made me wait for the hour to "discover" the jewel of the film. Boy, I was disappointed. Julian Po never worries. The film is relentlessly self-aware. I could not even suspend disbelief for a moment. Exaggerated, of course, theatrical sets, exaggerated, of course, theatrical acting, exaggerated, of course theatrical directing - well, you have an idea. <br /> <br /> Allegory do not have to be delivered in the style of a blacksmith's hammer. And it's hard to feel much for Julian Po because we never know much about him. Funny girl, annoying urban population, idiotic clergyman, ugly kids - why anybody, especially someone who has ambitions for life to get to the sea (Slater's character), decided to stay in such a gloomy place?
