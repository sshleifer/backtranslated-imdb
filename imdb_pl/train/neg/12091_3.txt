Well, artyfartyrati from Cannes could like this movie, but I'm not afraid. If you like the type of video where photos last for so long that you are wondering if the actor has fallen asleep or the cameraman has gone for lunch, this may be for you. A large part of this is so with short stays in the sphere of unpleasantness. I did not think it shocking or disturbing, like some other reviewers - it was just a bit tasteless and pointless. The only reason I did not give this one star is that acting is commendable and the movie is pretty well filmed. However, the plot has little to say. A large part of the film simply shows a grumpy woman who teaches or listens to the piano, which may appeal to some people. But do not think it's harmless enough, be prepared to kidnap pornography and sexual violence to wake you up with bad taste in your mouth. Do not recommend.
