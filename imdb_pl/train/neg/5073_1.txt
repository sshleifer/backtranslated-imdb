Tree of Palme teasers try to convey this as a kind of fairy tale allegory with real meaning, and then immediately start to admire the animation. I should have known what it meant. <br /> <br /> The main character, Palme, is a good example of a problem with the whole movie. In an instant, Palme is a humble hero in the search for himself, another violent psycho with an unhealthy fixation on the girl he once occupied. <br /> <br /> Like all characters in the movie, Palme is poorly defined. You do not connect with characters at all, although Shatta has bought a few fan-girls. It seems that the writer was more concerned about pissing off the whole drama and complexity he could put into this film than on examining the motivations and personalities of his characters. <br /> <br /> New, useless threads have been introduced in the last fifteen minutes of the movie. The writer seriously needed to improve his story. Perhaps he tried to be epic, but it was just too much information for a two-hour movie. However, I can not resist thinking about whether the plot with so many dimensions and characters would better suit a television series or a graphic novel. <br /> <br /> In the last five minutes of the movie, I just could not stand the pure lack of quality anymore and we started laughing at how characters, relationships and the story were made up. I touched my companion and he started to slam, just like the young man behind us. We tried to control ourselves so much, but we simply could not take the terrible quality of the film. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the animation is amazing, and viewers will admire the lush backgrounds and charming designs. Animation almost guides you; when you do not care about characters, it tells you how to feel.
