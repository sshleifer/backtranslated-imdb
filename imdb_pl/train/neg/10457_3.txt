What can I say? I am a mysterious fan of films "above the top" of action and horror movies. Especially when it comes to a lot of humor and insinuation, but I'm not a fan of Snake on a Plane. <br /> <br /> There are three potential features of this movie: ?? Comedy situation; ?? horror; and ?? New to hundreds of snakes from the plane. <br /> <br /> First of all, this movie is not written as a cursed horror or comedy, and the movie contains only 1 or 2 points in which you smile at yourself. If you want to know a movie, the trailer actually represents a movie, a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Secondly, if you expect a full action movie and shakes, you will not be disappointed. It does not stand out from other films, but it always focuses. <br /> <br /> Third, although the novelty of Snakes of a Plane does not disappear, but you will leave thinking about the cinema "what was going on? ". <br /> <br /> I know that this movie has a high rating, but it does not sum up. A) Many reviews written before the release of the film and B) The division of user ratings has a much smaller variation than the normal 77% of people rating 10/10, with only 7% of people reporting it 9/10 - Why such a huge gap?
