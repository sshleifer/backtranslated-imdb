Has anyone read the script. This must be the worst script and director of the whole year. Three great actors, Paul Giamatti, Rachel Weisz and Miranda Richardson, could not get it out. About two-thirds it looked like Giamatti's eyes say, I can not believe I signed the contract. This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's really a bad list of Christmas movies. Not enough lines, but what else can you say? Okay, the movie just does not move with Vaughn's dialogue, his character is just a frightening guy you just can not miss. It was just a vague walk through which no one could get.
