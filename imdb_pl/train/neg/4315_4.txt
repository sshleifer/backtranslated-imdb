Seriously, the only good thing in this year's ceremony were the winners. <br /> <br /> Although the ceremony itself was quite short, it was still a bit boring. I think the time has come to look for a new director and producers for the show who can come up with something really new. It is quite obvious that this year they tried to make the show more "fashionable" and attractive to the younger audience, allowing Beyonce to perform and let P. Diddy and Prince present the category. Allowing Chris Rock to be a presenter was an attempt to re-introduce the ceremony and make it more attractive. Nothing really worked. <br /> <br /> Sure, Chris Rock is a funny guy, but he was not really a good presenter. I really saw him only as a guy who talked from time to time between different categories. His presence was not as "big" as for example Billy Crystal's. <br /> <br /> Also, the distribution of prizes was sometimes quite stupid. Not allowing everyone to enter the stage, but also giving the prizes in the middle of the theater was strange. <br /> <br /> Despite this, I do not remember that I would be more pleased with the prize winners. None of the films really took away the prizes, because the last few years have always taken place. Does this mean that it was a good year for films with lots of competing participants? I do not think so. I think most movies will be largely forgotten in 20 years, except perhaps the "Million Dollar Baby" and "The Passion of the Christ". Of course, I do not agree with every prize that was handed out this year, for example, Caleb Deschanel should have won for the best shots, not that I do not like Robert Richardson's job, he really did an amazing job for most Oliver Stone I work, but really I feel that Deschanel deserved more prizes. I would also like Jim Miller and Paul Rubell to win for the best editing, and John Debney for the best music. Well, there is no way that Oscars can satisfy everyone, of course I understand it. There will always be people who complain about the winners. <br /> <br /> It was also funny that most of the prize presenters were more upset than the nominees and winners. Did Prince say one of the names nominated immediately? And was Sean Penn's sense of humor? Al Pacino and Jeremy "I hope they missed you." Irons were the best presenters of the night. <br /> <br /> In general, a very unforgettable show, but with nice winners. <br /> <br /> 4/10
