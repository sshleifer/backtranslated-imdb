LIFE SMALL, LOVE SMALL is one of the strangest movies of Elvis. The slapstick part, partly fluff, partly surreal and partly strange. Elvis meets a very strayed girl with an annoying voice. It looks like Jennifer Aniston. History does not make much sense, as with most of Elvis Presley's films, and there are a lot of weird characters. Not much music in it, but what I liked, although none is unforgettable. Strange continuity. Elvis and Michelle Carey are going to her home on the beach at night, but a few minutes later a delivery boy comes in and that's bright daylight !! What?? It's about the essence of the movie. What?? Oh, two good things about the movie: A) Elvis looks great and B) the dog steals the show.
