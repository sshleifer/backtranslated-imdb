RATING STARS: ***** Works **** Just miss the brand *** It's a bit between ** Delays * Hollows <br /> <br /> In this debut for Nick Park's beloved man and dog, they are forced to fly to the moon, when the good old Wallace is done with cheese. <br /> <br /> In addition to being the shortest function in just 22 minutes, this W / G adventure is the earliest and it shows a bit. The plasticine animation here is a bit creaky and funny, reminiscent of the Mork animation about a little man in a box. <br /> <br /> Let's admire that art is behind it, I've never really been involved in Wallace & Gromit (maybe a bit too clean and traditional for someone from my generation.) The only thing I really liked was The Wrong Trousers (and this was more from a time when I was younger and less aware, say, delightful pleasures of life.) I was forced to actively seek this early effort due to the revival of popularity as a result of an extremely successful recent film adaptation. <br /> <br /> From the technical point of view, impressive like the first two (all things considered!), there is no emotional angle that the successors would have. Having said that, it is quite fun, as the first attempt and certainly sets standards for future things. Two stars, but two good stars. **
