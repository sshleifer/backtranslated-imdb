Do you like beautiful girls? Yes me too. What can you say wrong about beautiful girls / women? Nothing, so why should I give this film only 2 stars out of 5, although he won the "talents" of Chiaki Kuriyama and Aya Ueto? <br /> <br /> If I really wanted to watch beautiful people, I would watch MTV or something like that. However, this is a movie, the so-called action movie. So, by definition, it does not even need a story? I do not agree 100%, but let's say yes. So what do I need? 20 minute material from the first part (maybe a little exaggerating, but it seemed to me that it was over 20 minutes ...)?! That would be "No". But again, you never know, people who watched the part, would not know what they ate for breakfast this morning, so hey, let's remind them ... hey, maybe even remind them twice? To make sure that they will not forget ... at least until credits begin to be handed out !!!! <br /> <br /> So forget about history, about character development, about real emotions, about "acting" (and no, I do not think that women in skirts and / or fighters are responsible for acting!) ... What does it come out? Yes, action scenes. The action scenes are not bad and that's why I gave the film 2 stars instead of 1! I gave the film a chance, but it was a waste of time ... You have better things to do / look, believe me ...
