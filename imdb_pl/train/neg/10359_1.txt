The series of books "Wrinkle in Time" is my favorite series from my childhood. I have read and read them more than I can count in the last 35+ years. The heroes, with all their virtues and vices, are close to my heart. This adaptation contained little of the magnificent, magical, spiritual story that I love so much. To say that I was disappointed with this film would be a great understatement. <br /> <br /> If you've never read a book, I imagine you'll enjoy the movie. Acting is passable, special effects are well done for a television film, and history is interesting. However, if you love books, avoid this movie at all costs. <br /> <br /> I found this statement on Wikipedia's page: "In an interview for Newsweek, L'Engle said about the movie," I was expecting it to be bad, and it is. "" <br /> <br /> I, like another reviewer, feel the need to re-read the book to dispel this movie from my mind.
