Regardless of the rating given to BOOM, it is only thanks to the excellent location of Sardinia and Rome. Otherwise it is only for addicts from Hardcore ELIZABETH TAYLOR (its phase down) and RICHARD BURTON (its deceptive phase). Tennessee Williams wrote: "The milk train does not stop here anymore" and apparently he likes the adaptation of his art - but apparently he was the only one. Taylor supposedly hated it, and Burton needed money. <br /> <br /> Regardless, this is a hill with beans in which Taylor poses and fits in her penetrating way, exploding in the servants and exchanging bad conversations with children than NOEL COWARD who seems to be a guest from another when it finally appears. <br /> <br /> It's so sharp that it's probably something to see among Taylor's fans. But if you can sit through this without a drink in your hand, you are in front of me. Unfortunately, this is a movie that marked the end of Taylor taken seriously as a film actress, even after winning two Oscars. For Burton it was equally catastrophic, and the critics called him BOMB. Judge for yourself if you dare.
