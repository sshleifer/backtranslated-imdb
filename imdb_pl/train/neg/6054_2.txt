I'm not sure Carpenter is trying to ask questions about abortion, and make it really hard and obvious that a woman should be allowed to take an abortion if Satan is a father, but he goes on. Ron Perlman is funny. The child is really stupid looking, basically a crab with a child's head mounted on it. You can see the material about Satan. What a mess. This episode has about five minutes of history and 55 minutes of boredom. Very very bad. And the ending is just ridiculous. After he learned that his child was dead, did the devil destroy the abortion clinic and kill everyone in a huge, bloody, bloody scream? NO! He lowers his head and is sulking from the room. Horrible.
