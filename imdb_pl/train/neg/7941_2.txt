When the 2000s were over, the adopted daughter of King Kong went ahead and announced the announcement that her performance was coming to an end. <br /> <br /> When Miss Winfrey broke up, I laughed and screamed like a wild Indian from the old west. <br /> <br /> So what does Oprah do? he takes famous people and places them in his program. what kind of famous people? people who suffered (like her, except for those who lost more than their virginity) suffered melted faces (true story), missing limbs (real story, see the end of the paragraph) and marital insults (too much to count on). and somehow they come to the concert and tell their story as if we did not hear it before tones and tons of times (Bethany Hamilton, I heard your story of losing a shark arm from the first day that was October 31, 2003. Do not tell me you do not have any hard feelings.) But the biggest event in Oprah was the Michael Jackson interview in 1993, after accusing him of molesting children. Unfortunately, Mr. Jackson has died since then. but this one particular show was about Michael's personal life, which few people knew at the time. <br /> <br /> Oprah's Real has an impact on middle-aged women and football mums. They seem to think that sometimes he is like a personal Jesus. but all I see in Oprah is a great lady from the ghetto who made it big, and she just shows how rich she is. <br /> <br /> I'm happy that her concerts will be over soon. we need better TV programs.
