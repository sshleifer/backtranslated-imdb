Carrie Fisher has repeatedly stressed that she made this film during her life when she had a severe problem with cocaine, and she remembers little of it. That would explain why she did the movie, but it does not explain why someone else did it in the cast or crew; I can not believe that EVERYONE had a problem with the coke. It must be one of the worst films ever, and that says something. The blame can not be put at the feet of the "director" Tim Kincaid nor the "writer" Buddy Giovinazzo, because it is obvious that this picture was not written or directed by anyone. Apparently it just spontaneously happened because there is little evidence of consistency, consistency, design, storyline, meaning, intelligence or anything else. It is amazing that some professionals have participated in this hatch. The co-star Robert Joy did a good job in other films, and composer Jimmie Haskell and operator Arthur Marks are industry veterans, Marx is also a director and is not bad. Why are they involved in this steaming heap of offals, they are incomprehensible. Tim Kincaid, the alleged "director," created some low-budget sci-fi movies and horror movies, and seeing most of them, I can tell you that none of them is good. This, however, is by far the worst thing he has ever done, and this is his great achievement. Everything, absolutely EVERYTHING, about this film is the 12th rate - at best. Pictures are horrible, funny acting, "special effects" make "Plan 9 from space" look like "Spider-Man", the story is banal, derivative and stupid. Do not waste your time even by looking at the lid of the video box, let alone borrowing it. A complete, complete, annoying, total misfire.
