First of all, I will not tell you why I borrowed this movie because I'm still confused ... <br /> <br /> The air raid is similar to every movie I saw when the plane was kidnapped. Of course there is one important person on the plane, and the hijacker seeks revenge. The sad thing is that some methods to stop the hijackers have already been used in other movies. Do we become so unoriginal so quickly? <br /> <br /> Although this is Ice-T (which for some unintelligible reason makes painful attempts to ACT, when it is not busy putting "c" back before rap), which is a movie glorified on the cover, in fact, plays less than the amazing Kim Oja as a stewardess who is "surprisingly" flipped by five kidnappers who naturally come back to persecute them. As for the rest of the cast, the only person I could recognize was Steve Hytner, better known as Kenny Bania from "Seinfeld". <br /> <br /> I can not forget to skip my favorite part of the movie when the abductor used the PLASTIQUE FUND to blow the castle ... BRILLIANT. <br /> <br /> The plot was unnaturally predictable. <br /> <br /> Scenario - terrible. It reached the point where I could say something, which seemed to me a stupid commentary, and that would be another line in the film. <br /> <br /> When it comes to special effects ... the only thing unique about this movie is that I've wasted the cost of electricity to run my TV and VCR for 100 minutes. <br /> <br /> And the title - the DID movie takes place in the air. But because of less than star performances, the only rage in the film was the viewer's rage. <br /> <br /> So if you're in the mood to even pick a movie, just because it's bad. SAVE YOU, do not choose it.
