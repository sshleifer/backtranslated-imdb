I have been using IMDb for years and have never wanted to get involved in film commentary? This document has so many problems that I hardly know what to say. I am not a Muslim or an expert in Islamic studies, but I know enough to shed some light on the obvious one-sided point of view that this document is telling. <br /> <br /> Problems with this movie start with the fact that it is a document. Most of the documentary films I have seen anchor around several important points, and then surround these points with controversial interpretation and disinformation. That is certainly the case with Islam: what the West needs to know. Yes, there are fundamentalists around the world, and some of them are Muslims, but building a documentary about all Islam around a small percentage of radicalized people is incredibly misleading. This is really a document about the fundamentalist aspects of Islam and nothing more. <br /> <br /> For those who would like to study more objectively some of the issues raised in this video, here are some points that can help. <br /> <br /> There was nothing positive about the Islam presented in the document. <br /> <br /> The document focuses on the Middle East, but more Muslims live outside this region. More Muslims live in China, believe it or not, than in Saudi Arabia. About 40% of all Muslims live in Pakistan, Bangladesh, India and Indonesia. <br /> <br /> The translation of the Koran used in the document is questionable. I watched the document while watching another translation, and the differences were striking. I was warned about the translation that was used in the document, and now I know why. Surrah 98: 6 is a good example. The document suggests that Surrah says that non-believers will go to hell. But the translation I read reads: "Those who reject the Truth among the people of the Book and among the polytheists will be in the heat of hell." The difference is that those who reject the Truth are people who know about God and God's Truth and decide to reject it. <br /> <br /> The film mentioned that there is no morality in Islam, but it is not true. Although it is true that many come from the Koran and Hadith, Islam also recognizes the concept called "Urf" or "normative behavior". Of course, what is normative can be interpreted in many ways, but "Urf is to be" good "behavior, which the average person would consider good or bad. <br /> <br /> The document presents Shar'ia (Islamic law) as one unified collection of knowledge followed by all Muslims. It's just not true. There are many Islamic law schools that differ from progressive and modernist to fundamentalist in the way the law is interpreted. <br /> <br /> The tradition of hadith is similar. There are thousands of Hadiths, and every law school accepts some and rejects others. Using Hadiths without serious research, to determine which ones are accurate, true and appropriate, you select and select quotes from history that match what you want to say? what the document did. <br /> <br /> I hope people will realize that fundamentalism is a problem, not Islam or any other religion. Christianity has fundamentalists who shoot doctors in the abortion clinic and so on. I know it's not the same as a suicide attempt, just understand that the justice of fundamentalism is probably a problem. If you think you have an answer, everyone must be wrong. But if you think you have an answer, you can work with the views of other people about politics, religion, God or anything.
