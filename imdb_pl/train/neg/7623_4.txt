This little program is of course some stupid little prequel / spin-off from the original series. <br /> <br /> Compared to the series of live events, this series is a complete shit. The live show had smart jokes and a storyline. While the animated series is basically a subdued bittersweet version for younger viewers to digest, but I think maybe children do not like this shit. <br /> <br /> The plot in each episode is simply Sabrina has some stupid and senseless dilemma and uses magic to fix it. This is the basic idea of ​​each episode. The strangest episode was when Sabrina uses magic to become a Jewel and Jewel to become a Sabrina. Thus Gem becomes a witch and hypnotizes Harvery to become her slave. This leads to a bizarre but quite interesting scene in which Gem says that "I just love me for now," and Harvey lays on his knees and starts kissing her feet as she is a god. (which is quite right, because she is her slave to mind control). But this stupid spin-off is not worth the time or effort.
