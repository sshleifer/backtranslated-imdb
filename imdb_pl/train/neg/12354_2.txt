Of course, I did not watch "GI Jane" by choice. I was more or less forced to watch this movie around my ex-girlfriends' home. <br /> <br /> GI Jane immediately loses credibility, trying to convince the viewer that this is a potentially real scenario, which of course it is not. The result is that history automatically becomes bounded by restrictions, limiting the amount of humor (which is not there) or funny action scenes, and soon becomes too serious. The film becomes extremely boring and predictable. <br /> <br /> "GI Jane" fails where other action movies are successful, mainly because films such as James Bond, Dirty Harry and others are bigger than life, but they never say otherwise. They are escapism, and therefore fun. "GI Jane" tries to be real and fails. <br /> <br /> This is a very disappointing movie from Ridley Scott, with a very incredible story, extraordinary acting and the only reason I do 2/10 instead of 1/10 is for some technical work.
