This is a typical production of Steele's novel, in which two people who have undergone a tragedy, managed to meet despite the chances. I would not call it a spoiler, because anyone who read Steele's novel knows how the EVERY end ends. If you do not want to know a lot about the story, do not read on. <br /> <br /> The character of Gilbert, Ophelia, is a French woman who has lost her husband and son in an accident. Gilbert has to stop making films in which he must have an accent, because otherwise a good actress can not realistically distract any accent. Brad Johnson, also an excellent actor, is Matt, who gets better after a nasty divorce. He is gentle, convincing and convincing in this role. <br /> <br /> They both meet on the beach through their daughter, Pip, and initially Ophelia accuses Matt of molesting children only because he talked to the child about art. Everyone becomes friends after this episode, and then the couple falls in love with each other. <br /> <br /> Chemistry between the two tracks is not great, although the talent of these two people is not, in my opinion, a question. They did everything in their power, with a predictable plot and scenario bordering the stereotype. Two people meet, a tragedy, a greater tragedy, a mystery appears, another tragedy, and then they meet. I would like there to be more to it, but it is brief. <br /> <br /> I wanted mindless entertainment and I got it. When it comes to the genre of romantic films, this film is not memorable. "A Secret Affair" with Janine Turner is much better (this is not Steele's book), as did some of Steele's earlier books re-made into a film.
