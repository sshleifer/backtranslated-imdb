Let me admit. I found this movie and bought it because Guttenberg looked so sexy in his underwear on his jacket. But there was another story inside. Apart from the fact that the film was basically a parody of the special effects of the genre of the "invisible man" (very visible strings and other such accessories), the script did not waste any chance - in fact it left the road - offending all - WASP races and real homosexuals or imagination. Any insult against a person in the scenario was either homophobic or racist or both. It starts to ache on your nerves, along with a trembling sound, honest camera photography and a melodramatic story. The end, however, is a surprise. But before you get there, you do not care. It is a pity that it could have been a pretty good movie.
