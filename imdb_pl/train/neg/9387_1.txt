I saw this movie when it was released for the first time. The memory of how bad it was was almost forty years old. I did not want to trust my sentiments about the film when I saw him, so I consulted the review of the film published in one of the main metropolitan newspapers, when the sentiment was confirmed the next day. . A little research reveals that the producer was the husband of the star Leslie Caron, so a breath of nepotism suggests the beginning of this horrible movie. The list of many talented actors - Caron, Warren Oates, Scatman Crothers, Gloria Grahame and James Sikking among others - suggests that he has a promise in himself. But the death of this movie stems from its horrible scenario. "Mystery" is so mysterious and so little revealed in the whole film that the viewer is embarrassed from the stage to the stage. The film seems to be torn between the detective mystery and the spy thriller, but never settles on one or the other. No voltage is completely absent. The main characters play on dry, emotionless types in a way that does not arouse any empathy. Pictures are for pedestrians. As a result, the unfortunate viewer loses interest in characters, storylines, and finally the movie itself. I'm not surprised that there is no version of this pathetic movie to buy. I hope that if TCM finds a print of this film and you feel compelled to emit it, it will be safely moved to 4:00.
