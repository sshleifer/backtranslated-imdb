I thought that these films were disappointed, I expected that it would be much better than it was. I am glad that I did not pay for watching this movie and that I did not sit in the cinema for this movie. Where to start this movie? Acting in this film was average, humor was terrible, and the overall plot of the film was not exceptional. I thought this movie was supposed to be great, but it was no more than a cheap shred of time. I think that the acting in this movie was terrible, that none of the actors in this movie had chemistry, it just was not there. I think if we had a different actor playing Kirk than Jay Baruchela, it could be better, but all the time watching this movie looked high and I did not have the impression that he was not playing in this film. Now Alice Eve did a great job as an actress, but there was no chemistry between her and Jay. All the actors in this movie had no names and had very little influence on this film. The humor in this movie was not funny at all, there were a few liners in the film that were fine, but nothing worth telling to friends they would understand. I think Jim Field Smith had problems because he could not decide if he wanted affairs or comedies. I really think that he must stick to Burger King ads. I think that this movie could be better if the writers went to another director. The story of this movie is like every hot girl, just a guy, a love story? Honestly, I would not recommend anyone to see this movie. I think you would have more dental entertainment than in this movie. So save yourself agony and just do not look.
