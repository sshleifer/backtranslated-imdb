It follows the same path as most of the follow-up. The first one was great. The second was mediocre, and the one full of evil acting and stupid dialogue, as well as many suspensions of disbelief, this film was weak. <br /> <br /> Too predictable and I just could not stand that Henry Wrinkler - like a boss with that stupid eye, they could do a lot more with it. I liked the first one very much. I'd like them to go deeper than what they did here. <br /> <br /> There were too many unexplained things to explain, at what time it was and why is there an old phone in this room? <br /> <br /> I understand that there is one more in the works. <br /> <br /> Bla!
