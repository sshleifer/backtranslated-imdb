Where to start. This movie began as something that looked like a "Darkness Falls". An old, disfigured woman living in the forest, giving children gifts on teeth. Sounds familiar? Then it changes. In "The Falls of Darkness" the fairy only killed you when you saw her. The fairy in this movie killed you no matter what. Why did they need a rocker, his hippie girlfriend, or Bubbas and their sister? I think that without them the film would be fine. It seems that the producers have sat down and decided that they have to put additional people in the film so that the fortune-teller would kill people. Although it is nice to see a pretty blonde who is not presented as a bubble on her head to change. Good for rent, but I would not suggest buying it.
