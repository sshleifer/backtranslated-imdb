This is a Japanese movie, but here is also a lot of English. This is a nice movie with nice visual effects, showing the picturesque beauty of Hawaii. <br /> <br /> However, this was the only saving trait for me. The story was generally boring. Who wants to watch a young woman sulk for 90 percent of the movie, because her "pictorial" husband is much older than it was advertised? It's true that it can be a bummer ...... but give it a rest! <br /> <br /> Only in the last 10 minutes he makes a face of himself and likes it. By then, most viewers were too late. Until then, we fell asleep.
