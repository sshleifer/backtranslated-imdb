My sincere advice to everyone: do not watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Do not even approach the theater where the movie is played !! even his look is harmful to health. serious. no jokes. it's 3.30 in the morning. and I came back from this worst movie about this universe. FOUR HOURS CHANGE !!! I am proud that I survived after all this! If it's called survival. <br /> <br /> I am very frustrated. annoyed. disappointed. it was a waste of time! the money went down the drain! no plot. I hope that I will wake up tomorrow healthy and without memories of that night !! RUBBISH MOVIE. <br /> <br /> Happy Republic Day to one and all :)
