I like movies with morally corrupted characters, but it was too much. Acting was not great, but it was not a real problem. The problem was that it was about 20 minutes in the stomach in my stomach. These figures were empty. They had almost no depth, and what they did not do was sacrificed to the cruelty they displayed to each other in the guise of friendship. Exploring the darker sides of the character set can be fascinating, but you have to give these characters real personality, or they are just cardboard cutouts. These figures were cardboard, and the picture they gave was simply ugly.
