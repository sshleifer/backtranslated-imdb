I bought it on DVD for my brother who is a big fan of Michelle Pfeiffer. I decided to watch it myself earlier this week. <br /> <br /> It is quite a funny piece containing two completely separate fictional lines. The section with Michelle Pfeiffer was definitely more interesting. A rising Hollywood actress who had many short, unfulfilled relationships. He literally runs into Brian Kerwin (an ordinary married visitor with children) after she drove her car backwards. After initially being hostile to himself, he proposes to take her home because he no longer feels comfortable. The romance develops eventually leading to a tragedy when his wife finds out. What's happening at the end, which I was not prepared for, but the slow pace and routine TV direction take away all the dramas from the storyline. <br /> <br /> The second part is about the old Studio boss played by Darren McGavin. This section really has a better cast with Kenneth McMillan, Lois Chiles, Steven Bauer and Stella Stevens. Everyone wants something from the head of the studio, but in the end, when he is asked to resign, everyone realizes that their careers will now be out of the blue. <br /> <br /> It's going to be a long time, but it's not that interesting and I'm glad I was not bought it. I'm not a fan of Michelle Pffeifer, but she was the only actress worth watching in this film, and even in 1983 she was a decent actress. In general, unless you're a fan of her, avoid this because it is very routine.
