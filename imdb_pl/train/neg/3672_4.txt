I watched the whole movie starring William Hurt, Natascha McElhone and Desiree Nosbusch. I am glad that I had no idea about Peter Weller's presence. At the end of the movie, I said, "THAT was Peter Weller?" Appreciation for Mr. Weller for outstanding achievements. Weller played the main character, and his performance was such that I did not even recognize him. <br /> <br /> In general, the plot was wrong, the writing was bad, and the performances outside of Nosbusch and Weller, were below the norm Scenery and surroundings were interesting, and Weller was amazing. <br /> <br /> 4 stars, possibly 10.
