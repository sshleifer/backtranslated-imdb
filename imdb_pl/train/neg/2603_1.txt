I was interested in this subject and only the dance fans Drew Barrymore on David Letterman's desk will find something interesting in it. OK, it shows some breasts (or maybe the body has two). The plot is cut into pieces, and acting is terrible. No lead has any material to work because the direction of the film does not lead anywhere. Do not waste time. See Donnie Darko, if you want the horrifying movie Drew Barrymore, and if you want to see another, skip it and see again Darko. <br /> <br /> The treatment of the Doppelganger legend is absolutely criminal. Refer to Charles Williams's novel "Descent Into Hell" to find something worth considering. It's just an excuse to make a B movie to go directly to the video and suck some life out of people in Blockbuster. <br /> <br /> What makes one of these people think that acting was commendable? Give me a break.
