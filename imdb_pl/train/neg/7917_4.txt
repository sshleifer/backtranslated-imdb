"Cement" is a bad movie about bad cop (Penn) with a bad attitude and bad temper that has a bad guy in bad condition to his cajons in fast-drying concrete. While we are waiting for the cement and film to dry, in order to find out what is going on, we are periodically torn apart in a time without a rhyme and a reason that we can watch the events leading to the cement thing. The general boring flutter, "Cement" suffers from a lack of history, a clumsy execution and the most ubiquitous errors of filmdom; there is no reason to care. A time killer for the best-needing couch potatoes. (D +)
