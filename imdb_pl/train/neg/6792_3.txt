Here's a movie with a good cast and a nice location, but it just does not exist. Director Richard Brooks had to be a bit tired at this stage of the game; How much better were his PROFESSIONALS! Horses and the rest of the action seemed to be in slow motion, even during motionless scenes. This movie had to be accelerated, if at all. This horse-shaped lather looked horribly offensive to me, and the traces of tires in those moments of desert tracks - just lazy. Careless job. Detriment. The actors were doing well, but I certainly saw that all of them work better. Ben Johnson is always a joy. I saw this movement for the first time almost 30 years ago; he was disappointed then and remained after his second visit 30 years later.
