The Lady in Cement is a real course on social anthropology in the late 1960s. Writing, not acting, is the center of attention. Did I say - clean camp! Prepare for insult if you're a woman or gay. Wide and dame are standard terms, and gay baits and pounding are represented for what they were during the day (camp). Most lines are rejected, although there are great performances by very few outstanding actors. Action scenes are mundane, but it's great to see Dan Blocker playing a tough guy who likes to bash in hard conditions. And Lanie Kazan and Racquel Welsh are at the top of their careers. It's amazing that they were 28 years old and Mr Sinatra was 53 years old. . . Was the result? Well, you understand. Watch it with friends who want to laugh. it is full of them.
