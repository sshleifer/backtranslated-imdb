This movie sold for one dollar in Wal-Mart on DVD, so I do not feel that I lost something to watch this movie, except for my TIME. He enjoyed the acting of Tom Hanks (Robbie Wheeling), who was very young and gave excellent results, considering that it was a terrible scenario. The story tells about students who decided to play the game Mazes & Monsters, only in a very realistic environment. Robbie Wheeling had problems with playing in other schools in the past and advised parents to leave the game alone and get good grades. Robbie meets a very nice girl and has a romantic romance with her, and when she begins to play, she stops to love her and acts like a monk. The film has several scenes that are filmed around the former World Trade Center, as well as on the observation floor and on the roof. It's quite sad watching this part of the movie in which so many people died because of evil in the world. This is not a very good movie, with the exception of Tom Hanks, who tries to keep the movie above the level of entertainment.
