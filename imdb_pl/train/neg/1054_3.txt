Family drama in the countryside - perhaps a nod towards "Ordinary people" - refers to a young boy who retreats to himself after a fatal injury to his older brother during an unfortunate accident. Despite the swollen subject (considering the merciless treatment of director Christopher Kain), there is a certain dynamism in this sad story that is worth exploring. Unfortunately, the isolated agricultural atmosphere and the reluctance of adults to take control of the situation make the film a difficult experience. What about Robert Duvall, Glenn Close and Wilford Brimley in the cast, the movie is almost a small convention of "The Natural." It is a pity that this project did not get the necessary talent behind the camera to really get a thrilling, unforgettable picture. * 1/2 of ****
