Wow, how bad it can be. It was really bad. Not in terms of gore - which was mainly laughter worth CGI - but in acting, atmosphere and direction. <br /> <br /> The story was terrible - the arc of the main character's advantage was a complete joke. Within a few nights of persecuting Vinnie Jones, he begins to be "haunted" to the point that he is crying while photographing his girlfriend. Um ... are all New York photographers so childish, suggestive and weak? His character development had absolutely no justification or point - and until the very end you will laugh loudly at the absolutely predictable and completely absurd twist that his character takes. <br /> <br /> Moments were clearly weak, low-valued effort to jump on a modern mountain wagon in the style of MTV - all cgi, blood, but without real emotions. These parts were involuntarily funny - and they distracted their self-consciousness - crazy camera angles, etc. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie requires another idea. What could have an atmosphere (as long as the stupid monsters at the end) will not be ruined in favor of the self-aware drive in the "look at me" style. This film was not created for the public - it was created for CV - a deeply selfish motif.
