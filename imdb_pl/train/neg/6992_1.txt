The plot tells the story of a female nurse named Anna, who is caught in the midst of global chaos, when the zombie meat eating begins to rise and take over the world and attack the living. He escapes to the streets and is saved by a black policeman. So far, good! I usually like horror movies, but this movie does not deserve to be called a horror movie. It's not even exciting, it's just funny. Even "Flintstones" or "Kukla, Fran and Ollie" will give you more excitement. It's like watching a group of thirsty blood drinkers who can not get into the mall for more alcohol. The heroes who locked themselves in the mall to avoid being eaten by bandits outside are also not better. Although they do not seem to be drunk, they seem mentally disabled. Save money instead of spending it on it!
