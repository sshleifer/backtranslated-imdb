I'm starting to see the pattern in the movies I give 1 to. It's almost all the movies that my wife told me to watch. Maybe I should stop believing in her taste in movies. Either way, this is a typical nonsense for older girls, but made even less than usual. Once again, the writer has broken the main rule of every film. He / she made the main character unacceptable. He starts with a complete b to his friend at the beginning, and then he learns when he is 30 that he is basically a sh * tty (having an affair, etc.). Why F would we feel for this person? OK, let's say we can get around this. Jennifer Garner is so far away from the attractiveness that can be obtained without any deformation. I do not know if it's her fault or writer's fault, but her character goes far beyond my irritation limits. Here's a tip for future filmmakers: 13-year-olds are NOT funny, they are annoying. The far and the most embarrassing moment in the film came when they danced to "Thriller". Holy nonsense that was painful. He showed her how to practice this dance at the beginning. That explains why she knows, but the whole club full of people?!? Argh !!! Macarena would be more credible! Suddenly she is completely incompetent and has no idea how to do her job and no one notices? At least the character of Tom Hanks in "Big" had a job that made sense to the child. Those movies that change the body / become adults at night, really get out of control, and this is definitely the worst.
