There is no ingenious record here because it does not deserve one. Not an artistic film. Even one of those "hidden" gems. You know, like the films you hear about through a friend who has seen this amazing film in the city center, where they show all good independent and artistic films. <br /> <br /> Just pack them into holiday boxes and quickly get rid of them.
