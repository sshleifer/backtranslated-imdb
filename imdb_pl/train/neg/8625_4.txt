In the unlikely event that some novice directors read these comments, I would like to offer some advice (free!) From the perspective of the viewer. If you want to do a serious exotic adventure movie, do it. If you want to make a parody of exotic adventure movies, go ahead. DO NOT try to create both at the same time, it does not work. For example, killing and beheading a foolish "comic relief" and following it with a monkey shaking a tree and dropping a coconut on a cannibal head makes you look like you DO NOT HAVE AN IDEA, what kind of movie you wanted to do. This one is boring, meandering, cheap, racist .... you have a photo. A few clever moments and a few flashes of nudity from Kathy Shower (too prisey here) are not worth your trouble. There is a reason why everyone forgot about the existence of this movie. (* 1/2)
