This is a typical "ideal crime" thriller. There is a perfect crime, and the police investigator, ignoring all the clues, immediately knows who is guilty. The audience has to wait for the whole movie to get caught guilty. The result is like any episode of "Columbo" or "the murder she wrote." The director himself refers to the history of the hackney, showing the policeman watching the episode of Matlock! This story barely fills 90 minutes, but the director insists on using all 120 minutes of filling every cliche in the book. Skip this, you do not miss anything.
