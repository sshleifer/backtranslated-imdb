Everything in this movie is pork laundry. Pathetic acting, terrible dialogue, ugly native girls. this film is falling into oblivion !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The director had to be a weekend bender. Robert C. is completely lost and has no idea what is going on. College kids are the worst. No acting talent, very stupid reasoning and just a dumbbell. Special effects are for birds. The so-called security forces around this park belong to the land of toys: with stupid-looking pistols, useless walkie-talkie; and a computer system with a roll of toilet paper. if the park is under construction and nothing works; why invite potential customers until everything is over. writers should be the first victims of the mess together with the producers and crew. The entire movie belongs to a septic tank launched on a different planet for viewing. What a jewel. Convicts should observe this so that they can commit suicide.
