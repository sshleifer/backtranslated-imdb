It's a movie that makes you say two things ... 1) I can do a lot better (playing, writing and directing) 2) It's so bad that I have to leave the review and warn others ... <br /> It looks like it was filmed with my flip movie. I also believe that my friend, who told me to watch it, takes revenge against me. I noticed that there are some positive posts for this home video; There must have been crew members or people who had something to do with this movie. One of the worst 3 movies I've ever seen. Let's hope the screenwriters and director leave the company. even talented enough to do advertising !!!!!
