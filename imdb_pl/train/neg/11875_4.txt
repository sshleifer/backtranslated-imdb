Mmm, is not a big stack of pancakes good? Maple syrup and fruit preserves on top. Make a bite. Mmmmmmm. Take another bite. Other. Other. EAT. EAT, IT'S !!! Continue brushing him to the throat until the face turns green with nausea. You've just experienced Ally McBeal. <br /> <br /> I came across this concert in the winter of 1998 and I fell in love immediately. Like this stack of pancakes, I ate it. However, the joy is soon over, because the character Ally McBeal (which we consider charming and charming at first glance) soon becomes the most annoying, uncertain, grumbling grumbler you have ever met. (Call me a feminist, but I prefer my bitch to have a backbone.) Gags and tricks from the show become hackneyed, the music of Vonda Shepherd (which is really stuck in your face) becomes snappy, and the constant figure of change and make-up make the show he's a goddamn soap opera. <br /> <br /> My advice for you is to take this show in small doses and give it up once it gets embarrassing (and it will happen). I managed to survive 2.5 of the season before my pleasure worsened. It was good when it lasted, but like a crazy, neurotic girl, she just became ugly after she exceeded her greeting. <br /> <br /> And the next time you go to IHOP, skip the pancakes. Order something healthy, like a cup of fruit. It will be better to sit with you.
