I just want to explain one thing - I love Michael Vartan! But this movie really disappoints him. His acting is still great, he's still charming as always, and he still looks great. But the movie itself is a lot of garbage! Natasha Henstridge, I'm sorry I say this, he's a bit masculine ... you're still waiting for him to run away with his best friend who has his own strange story. Me and my family (who sat down and watched the movie with me) also discouraged the soundtrack to the film; sometimes the music just did not match what was happening in the scenes. However, even this was not the worst aspect of what I thought was a very disappointing movie. I could forgive the butch of the leading lady, I could forgive the bizarre characters that were thrown into the mix, and I could forgive a poor selection of musical accompaniment, but whose choice was to cut out the middle part of the movie and go straight to the end? The ending was of course planned from the very beginning, but the way it gets there is unknown. If you're a fan of Michael Vartan, skip this movie: buy yourself a poster.
