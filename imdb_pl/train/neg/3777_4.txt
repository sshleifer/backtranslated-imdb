Flat, soulless computer images on unusual images animate the horribly predictable story in this film. Absolutely nothing will surprise you, you can even say when the vocals of Bryan Adams will come, which is always at the wrong time. <br /> <br /> The main character, Spirit the horse, gets an annoying voice when he talks about what's going on. Narration is not necessary, however, because everything that happens is really obvious. You can even say what the horses say, although everything they do is neigh. Which would be good, but all horses seem to have exactly the same sounds - one for warning, one for sadness, one for laughing, etc. There is no difference between the voices of horses. <br /> <br /> Young children can like this movie. It's quite bland so that the family can sit down and watch, and there is little danger that someone will be scared. If you have nothing else to do and want to watch a movie with your children, this is not a bad choice. <br /> <br /> But otherwise it is not recommended.
