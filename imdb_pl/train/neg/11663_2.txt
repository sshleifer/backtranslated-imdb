WHITE CHICKS Wait, why would not they get dressed up for Black Chicks, oh yeah, they would not look different. Can anyone give me one Wayans movie in which he did not dress up as a lady? Do not Be A Menace does not count, Jack White and Michael Costanza wrote this (other members of the Norton Trio acted as directors). <br /> <br /> In White Chicks, there are never any jokes. It's just Wayans behaving like girls for 2 hours. There are no settings, no punchlines and no laughter. There are many "I think I will play in Time Crisis 3." At least for me it was (5 times accurate). <br /> <br /> Someone has to tell Kenan Ivory, Damon, Marlon, Shawn, Damien (the only gifted), Kim, Rakeesh, George W., and Osama Bin Wayans stops making movies. It just hurts the O-Zone layer. <br /> <br /> VERSION 1/2 * with ****
