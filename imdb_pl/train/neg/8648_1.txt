Well, basically the movie is blowing! It is Blair Witch who meets Sean Penn's ill-conceived fantasy of going to Iraq to show the world what the "War on Terror" really is about. The script sounds as if it was written by an eighth grader (no offense for eighth graders); the two main actors take over the whole film; they used the wrong type of camera and the wrong type of film (not that I knew anything about these things - but it just did not look like the real documentaries I watched), and Christian Johnson was the worst of all and made him suck. It reminded me of the time when I tried to draw a picture of my dog ​​and ended up with a really bad thing that looked like a stick that looked more like a gigantic turd. I'd rather watch Blair Witch VIII than sit any further.
