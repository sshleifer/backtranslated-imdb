Worest's film from Open water. Do not be surprised if you completely miss this movie after the release date, because I'm sure the cash register will not be all right. This movie had a lot of Potential, but it was not too short. Not enough character development, awkward actors, and the advantage of this movie was nudity. Boobs. Amazing. If I had to see this movie again, I would go to POSTAl. <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< <<<< << <<<<<<<
