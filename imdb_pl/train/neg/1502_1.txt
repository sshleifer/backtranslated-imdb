Django's ballad is a messy movie mess! This spaghetti western is simply a collection of scenes from other (and much better!) Films allegedly related to each other by "Django", talking about how he brought different outlaws. Hunt Powers (John Cameron) brings nothing to the role of Django. Skip this one, unless you MUST have any Django movie, and even THIS might not be enough excuse to see this movie !!
