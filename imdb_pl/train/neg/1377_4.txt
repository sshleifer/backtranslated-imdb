The species of volleyball is strangely overlooked by most screenwriters. Fortunately, the highly-rated director Nelson McCormick brought us the second best volleyball of all time (rated lower than Side Out and higher than, well, umm). However, do not let the cover of this movie catch you. Kill Shot stars up and up Koji star as modern Sherlock Holmes. Using such technologically advanced gadgets as a computer that is less efficient than my Gameboy, Koji is able to help FBI agents to follow a man who has not committed any obvious crime. While there are other actors in the movie, including short episodes of Denise Richards, a gay Black man, and an absurdly ugly and annoying girl, Koji wears this movie alone. Any fan of movies like The Matrix or Hackers will certainly love Kill Shot.
