I usually talk a bit about the story in the first part of my review, but in this movie there is nothing to talk about. You just mishmish other better epics of the sword and sorcery. Lack of cohesion causes madness, like banality. Even the chief peasant woman refusing to wear clothes other than a loincloth is quite boring because she has a young boy's chest. Gently funny in its ineptitude at best and seriously delayed in the worst. Lucio Fulci scrapped the bottom of the barrel here and it shows. <br /> <br /> My class: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Posters and photos of the gallery; Lucio Fulci Bio; and American and international theater trailers <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Sabrina Siani is topless (some may find it attractive, I do not); various additions are also topless
