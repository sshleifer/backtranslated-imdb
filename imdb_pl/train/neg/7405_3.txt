I think they really let them go away from the quality of DVD production. I rented this DVD from 2 movie stores and for the second time I was able to play it on the third DVD player I tried. <br /> <br /> Does anyone else have this problem? It is really hard to give the film a non-objective review after going through such troubles to play it. First of all, I have never seen a Finnish horror before, so I was a little dazed that the film was made in English. Because it was never clear what's wrong with Sara, she just came out late and that's why I really hoped that someone would shoot her in the face and make all the terrifying events go away.
