The first one was different and entertaining. This attempt should never leave the studio. This movie does not make you laugh. This is a poor attempt at blatant humor. The movie chooses current and old movies to break. This time, the jokes seem to be used and exaggerated. The audience I saw with her only changed Hannibal's dinner scene and slept differently.
