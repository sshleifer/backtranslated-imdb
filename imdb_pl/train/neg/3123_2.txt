Felt mine was while watching this ... but it seems that this is the reason for the madness running in the family in this movie. Anyway, it does not make much sense, as others have mentioned, it was one of Karloff's last films and only his presence on screen gives him all credibility. It is sad that all the great legends of horrors in the era of sounds have been ultimately reduced to a role in such garbage. Marginal Boris got out a bit better than poor old Bela Lugosi, but not much. <br /> <br /> Boris does everything in his power, and gives him appreciation for trying to keep this mess together. Sharp background music does not help and distracts you from the bright moment. Apart from Boris, the rest of the Mexican cast is called a strange, clipped, English monotony reminiscent of the type used in porn movies from the late seventies. <br /> <br /> I suspect that this is Edgar Allen Poe's "House of Usher" from which it comes, but it would be difficult to find a lot of Poe in the finished article. <br /> <br /> Still, there are much better films with Boris Karloff at its best, look for them and give it all, unless you want the curse of a "shrinking brain"!
