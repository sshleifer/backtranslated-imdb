I was not impressed with this movie. Originally it was named Sin Eater and it should have remained the same, taking into account what was said in the last half of the movie. I'm not even sure what the first 20 minutes of the movie had to do with the rest of the movie. It was very slow, and hence, the election of Robocop (Peter Weller) as one of the main actors. It was a sad point. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I would say to check if you are dealing with Catholic religion, but do not expect an exorcist or stigmata from this film. After a few days, it will definitely disappear.
