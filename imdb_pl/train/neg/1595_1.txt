The film seemed to appeal to me because of the new Pokemon Celebi type. But the plot was of course not as interesting as other films. It was a waste of money and time. The same greedy humor and kitsch bad guys. The film was useless if you wanted to praise Pokemon. The film should not be better associated with animes such as Dragonballz, Digimon or Yu-Gi-Oh. Drawing and settings are not at a level that matches the standards of the original anime. It's a pity to even talk about this movie. I bet that fans of Pokemon will be disappointed with the result of the film and give up Pokemon. Digimon is more anime and does not come close to the pokemon.
