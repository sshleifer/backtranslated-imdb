This is without a doubt one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This makes your movie from the mill look like Reservoir Dogs. Based on the book of the one and only Britney Spears and her mother, it is a nightmare with nothing but the sensible performance of Virginia Madsen (I hope you've done well) to save her. The story of a red gill village that wins a scholarship at a prestigious music school is just a vehicle for pedaling the music of Miss Spears's pants for the consumer and generally agrees that the low forehead must be the way. There is nothing good here, because all bits are as predictable as day after night. Never again.
