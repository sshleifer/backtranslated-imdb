A tense comedy reminiscent of a sketch revue that was originally a vehicle for the presentation of Jack Perl's one-time radio star, but is now best remembered as an American introduction to The Three Stooges. In fact, Larry, Curly and Moe are announced next to Ted Healy's comic as Ted Healy and his Three Stooges. Although the cast includes Jimmy Durante (who is completely wasted on the weak material) and ZaSu Pitts, the only audience these days are Stooges-addicts, and even they will not find much applause here. Incredibly loud and overbearing, it shows how far Hollywood had to go to achieve a certain level of advancement in the slapstick. * 1/2 of ****
