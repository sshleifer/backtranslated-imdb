Although I consider myself a fan of the Babylon 5 television series, the original film that introduced the series was a poor start. Although many elements that later mature and become more attractive in the series, the Gathering pace is slow, the makeup is somewhat unsuitable and the story is misleading. What is worse, the characteristics of the premiere episode are weak. Although the ranking chart shows that many fans are willing to overlook these problems, I remember that The Gathering almost threw me out of what soon turned into a spectacular series.
