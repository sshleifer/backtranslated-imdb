There will be a time when children will grow up without seeing the only kiss of Bugs (technically) of another man on the lips. There will be a time when there will be no Duck or Rabbit season. There will be a time when Tazmanian Devil will be called politically incorrect. <br /> <br /> But now help me, this is not the time. <br /> <br /> No one really wants the "EXTREME" version of our beloved Loony characters. Whoever it is in marketing who thinks of "Corn Nuts: Corn gone wrong" and "Extreme Doritos" and evidently this ruining turd should know that just because they have a degree in business or advertising or does not mean that they know about Jack children. <br /> <br /> I think they hurt children, depriving them of one of the greatest and most iconic shows of all time. This show disgusts me, and it's not just outdated graphics or terrible dialogue. They abuse good voice talent like Phil Lamarr, Michael Clarke Duncan, Candi Milo and many others. He lacks style, humor, character development and, most importantly, his heart. <br /> <br /> The show, just like the repackaged characters (Slam Tasmanian, Rev Runner, Ace Bunny), is just a shadow of his former, timeless and beautiful self.
