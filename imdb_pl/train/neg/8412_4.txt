I saw DreamGirls yesterday and I was REALLY impressed. Despite all the noise of Oscar, it's nothing special. Anyone who was really impressed with this movie never took the trouble to see the true musical classics of the film. In addition to great music and dramatic performances by Eddie Murphy, Dreamgirls is simply a glorified TV movie with no style and style. Only a handful of amateurs singing to each other! <br /> <br /> Now the first half hour was good, but I was irritated at how the great performances of Eddie Murphy were shortened and interrupted by editing. These were the best songs and the best performances in the film. And part of the movie "rise to the top" was the only part of the movie that had a coherent point of view or any tempo. The remaining hour and 45 minutes is a shapeless mess that was neither realistic nor fantastic to be interesting. It was also boring visually and contained too many sound melodies. <br /> <br /> Condon did not try to turn any of the melodies into large pieces, as I expected. Each number in the second half was just one close-up to the other people "singing" on each other. And the way they shot a large number of "love me" Hudson was criminal! Condon just shot her on stage - no drama! God has sucked it! <br /> <br /> AND pay attention to everyone involved - this "talking dialog" can work on the stage, but it DOES NOT WORK IN VIDEOS (see embarrassing defeats by Evita and Phantom). All this "I will be accompanied by something Efff-ieeee!" Shit should be left on the editor's floor. These are not "songs." <br /> <br /> Again, the movie - except the amazing performance of Eddie Murphy - was nothing but a beloved television movie. There must have been megabucks for PR work on this movie! I wonder how much money was spent to spend this "before the battle" Oscar? All in all, this movie was, NEVER save Eddie, NEVER in the movie about the caliber of Oscar! (except for Eddie) I would play him there with Grease 2. BIG disappointment, especially after all (very expense $ $) hype!
