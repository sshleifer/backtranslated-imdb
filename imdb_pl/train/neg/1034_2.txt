After the success of Scooby-Doo, Where are you, they decided to give Scooby and Shaggy their own program. Unfortunately, they added a new character that forever damaged Scooby-Doo's success. They came up with a new program with a new title, Scooby and Scrappy-Doo. This Scrappy-Doo made her show a complete failure, probably for both adults and children. Scrappy was a stupid brave puppy who always looked ready to beat someone. Scooby and Shaggy were scared of the villain and tried to stop him. Scooby-Doo does not need small annoying bastards. If they wanted Scooby-Doo to be more successful, they should either kill or never think of Scrappy. It was just poor, maybe your children prefer it!
