I saw this film as a child when it was released in the theater and it was so bad that it became a deposit of a family joke. If the ranking was zero, this movie would get it. The dinosaurs were terrible. The story was ridiculous. Acting really is not eligible for action. The only reason I remember even the name of the movie so well is that my family is still talking about how bad it really was.
