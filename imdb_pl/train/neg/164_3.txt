I'm not a big fan of Star Trek, but I could not wait. I was intrigued by the descriptions of the Enterprise, its tight, underwater stylistics and raw technology compared to the Treks we are used to. <br /> <br /> I have not seen anything so interesting in this pilot. I think that the story is complicated and confusing. <br /> <br /> I admit that I liked the development of the character a little - presenting people as a "growing up" species, ready to grow out of their chaise-longings, they were fun. <br /> <br /> And that Vulcan babe had an amazing, awesome shelf. <br /> <br /> But I do not think I'm getting involved in this series. <br /> <br /> 3/10
