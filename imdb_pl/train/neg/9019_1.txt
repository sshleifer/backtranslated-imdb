Why would he do this to me? <br /> <br /> Not that I expected Dean Cain to make hits. Or even decent movies. I saw Lois and Clark, I'm aware of how ... "good" is Dean Cain. <br /> <br /> Of course it will be a cheese flutter, and each cheese flutter has its own special way to make a scratch on the head. I will not call these spoilers, because you can not really spoil the movie as it is. <br /> <br /> To start with ... why is this a fake helicopter? I mean ... why? <br /> <br /> How is it possible that one scientist comes from Chicago and this other scientist comes from LA and none of them can be more Eastern European if he tries? How hard would it be to get an American actor or just change the bad state sheet that the movie provides us to say that these people are not American? <br /> <br /> Why are there twice when the movie gives us a slug line? We get a helicopter landing pad, and then a mess later in the day. And that's all who care about the timeline. Honestly, who cares about it, even when they mentioned it, but I think it does not make sense. <br /> <br /> Does the movie really improve if it can be watched on many split screens? The answer is no. <br /> <br /> This dragon can definitely get out of this corridor ... beyond ... and over ... and over ... and over ... <br /> <br /> Who on land was responsible for one of the worst endings in film history? It was straight from the scooby doo. Oh, the dragon is dead now ... tell me, do you want to get dinner? Sure, but not in any Chinese place .... with a dragon in the name !! AH HA HA HA !! HAHAHA!! HAHAHA! I used to be Superman! HA HA AHA! HA HA! <br /> <br /> zanikajÄ… do czarnego <br /> <br /> my God, it made me collapse, it was so stupid. <br /> <br /> But never be afraid ... even though the entire building exploded ... and no one remained alive ... for some reason there is a second untouched, unmanned laboratory that has survived quite well, so they can to make a sequel. Hurray for all of us. <br /> <br />
