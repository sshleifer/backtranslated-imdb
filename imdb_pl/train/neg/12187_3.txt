De Niro Scorsese's worst cooperation in this terrible, painful, brutal, long mess. Scorsese is completely devoid of his element in this film, with horror announced suddenly by a loud phone ring and slamming doors that seem funny and embarrassing from such a master. The cast is completely wasted, and the southern accents are very annoying and forced. Nick Noltie plays the greatest lawyer in history who will ever believe he can defend anyone! Psychotic Bowden De Niro is nothing more than a typical psycho assassin of the 90s. The stage with De Niro and Lewis at the beginning is very awkward, and the culmination continues uninterrupted and we should all be more than tired of a psychological persecutor who never dies. One of my scariest movie experiences. Renting the original is 100 times better. <br /> <br />
