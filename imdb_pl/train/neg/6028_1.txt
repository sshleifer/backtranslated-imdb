I am a Christian ... and I feel that this movie is terrible. <br /> <br /> No one but the hard, biblical Christians will like this movie. The message is simply too difficult. If you want to touch a wider audience, you have to be more subtle. You can not force your father to swing the Bible and carry it with him in EVERY scenario. FUNNY! <br /> <br /> Poor direction. Unveiling missing people should be frightening, but it was ridiculous. They leave their clothes on the ground? It reminded me of Ed Wood's old films: "Oh my God! People are missing! "This scene on the plane is simply stupid. Think about it: if you found a relative's clothes, you would not only shout "Oh my God. Gone! and start crying and yelling. First you deny ... you just would not have come to that conclusion. Watch Jodie Foster in FLIGHTPLAN. My favorite shot is a dog sitting on the lawn with a pile of clothes and shoes sitting next to him. I fell off the couch. So I was laughing. <br /> <br /> The music was so bad and distracting. It was as if the composer was in his own world, shooting his own films. "Here is my chance to make a thriller", "this is my chance to act!" STOP ME, HOW TO FEEL JAMES COVELL! A good result supports what is happening on the screen ... this movie required more than the UNDER score, but instead it was just like a message in your face. <br /> <br /> Writing was bland. Like Captain Christian Kirk Cameron. Chelsea was worse: "you do not understand! People are missing! " Brad Johnson was funny. Two outstanding performances came from Antichrist and an older guy (sorry, I do not remember their names) While watching "creation" (to answer my question "what do they think ???"), producers and filmmakers and actors just delude ... saying that "we will reach a wide audience" and "brad Johnson is amazing" and "this is like a Hollywood movie". I came to the conclusion that they simply do not know what they are doing. <br /> <br /> I praise the effort. Providing a message to a wide audience is a fantastic idea. Film is the best medium possible for this. Look at films like WIDE AWAKE, SIGNS, CONTACT, PASSION OF CHRIST, even O'BROTHER, WHERE DO YOU ART? The bottom line is that the movie had to be created by people who have talent and vision. Unfortunately, it was not.
