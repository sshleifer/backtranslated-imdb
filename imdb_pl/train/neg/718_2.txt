The main reason why people still care about "Carlton-Browne Of The F.O". the point is that Peter Sellers plays a second role. But watching this movie to see Peter Sellers is a mistake. <br /> <br /> The sellers are playing Amphibulos, the vague reptile of the Prime Minister of the poor island nation of Gaillardia, formerly British colony, in which many Russian diggers now live during the Cold War summit. Amphibulos wants to play both in the interests of the US and the Soviet Union against each other because of the easy profit, "all very friendly and all our cards under the table." Terry-Thomas is the title character, a lazy British diplomat who wants to show Gaillardia that Great Britain has not forgotten them, all the opposite performances. <br /> <br /> A positive review says: "The reason why this movie is considered average is because the comedy is understated. "I think the reason why" Carlton-Browne "is considered below average is that comedy does not exist. <br /> <br /> After a decent opening, which confirms only two strengths of the film, the nice doltish Terry-Thomas and the vigorous result of John Addison quickly slows down a series of slow burns and jokes with poor communication. The low opinion of Carlton-Browne by his boss and the unclearness of Gaardardia (which no one can find on the map) is crushed to death. Before we reach the island (after a hard series of airsick jokes), expectations are quite low. <br /> <br /> However, they are still too high. The island itself, which seems to exist both in Latin America and in the Mediterranean, is so pathetic that it faints the honor guard at the airport, and the review station breaks down during the parade. The army apparently is still a drawn horse, allowing another bad gag by a thickly accented announcer: "In the war, the army uses many horses." <br /> <br /> Sellers never occupy a central position, even when once again on the island of their character. The action is taken over by Ian Bannen as King of Loris, who inherits the throne of Gaardardy after the murder of his father. Bannen is boring and plays his role as simply as it is written. Usually, it would be the likely goal of salesmen stealing scenes, but trapped behind a thick accent and a fat mustache, the seller is only a threat to those of us who remember him much happier in two other movies from the same year "Mouse that roared" I all right, Jack. "<br /> <br /> It's strange that this movie, like" Jack ", was a production of Boulting Brothers, and Roy Boulting was co-director alongside Jeffrey Dell. Usually, Boulting's films combine wicked social satire with the comedy "everything is going", but here are only bizarre stabs in both directions. Amphibulos works on his distorted English for all its value ("This man is like you are a bull in a Chinese ship"), while Carlton-Browne is ragged by his superior, far more than he deserves. <br /> <br /> The weakest and longest element of the movie is the romance of young Loris with Illyena. Get one point for playing through the captivating Luciana Paluzzi, make sure that cousins ​​are apparently never addressed. <br /> <br /> The film ends with a staged revolution whose unexpected resolution will not surprise anyone and the last action of Carlton-Browne, who seems to literally tap into his coffin. Apparently he lives to see another day, but the movie with the same name is strictly DOA.
